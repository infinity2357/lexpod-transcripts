as an experimental physicist what do you

26
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
as an experimental physicist what do you
 

27
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,310
as an experimental physicist what do you
think is the most amazing or maybe the

28
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
think is the most amazing or maybe the
 

29
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,630
think is the most amazing or maybe the
coolest measurement device

30
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
coolest measurement device
 

31
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,950
coolest measurement device
you've ever worked with or humans have

32
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
you've ever worked with or humans have
 

33
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,430
you've ever worked with or humans have
ever built maybe for now let's

34
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
ever built maybe for now let's
 

35
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,110
ever built maybe for now let's
exclude the background imaging of cosmic

36
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
exclude the background imaging of cosmic
 

37
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,350

galactic polarization instruments yeah

38
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
galactic polarization instruments yeah
 

39
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,709
galactic polarization instruments yeah
i'm slightly biased towards that

40
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
i'm slightly biased towards that
 

41
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,310
i'm slightly biased towards that
particular instrument but talk about

42
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
particular instrument but talk about
 

43
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,150
particular instrument but talk about
that in a little bit yeah but certainly

44
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
that in a little bit yeah but certainly
 

45
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,430
that in a little bit yeah but certainly
the telescope to me is is a lever that

46
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
the telescope to me is is a lever that
 

47
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,670
the telescope to me is is a lever that
has literally moved the earth uh

48
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
has literally moved the earth uh
 

49
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,910
has literally moved the earth uh
throughout history so the og telescope

50
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
throughout history so the og telescope
 

51
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,910
throughout history so the og telescope
og telescope yeah the one invented not

52
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
og telescope yeah the one invented not
 

53
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,310
og telescope yeah the one invented not
by galileo as most people think but by

54
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
by galileo as most people think but by
 

55
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,630
by galileo as most people think but by
this guy hans lipperche in uh in the

56
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
this guy hans lipperche in uh in the
 

57
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,830
this guy hans lipperche in uh in the
netherlands

58
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
netherlands
 

59
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,670
netherlands
and you know it was kind of interesting

60
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
and you know it was kind of interesting
 

61
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,710
and you know it was kind of interesting
because

62
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
because
 

63
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,630
because
in the 1600s 14 1500 1600s it was the

64
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
in the 1600s 14 1500 1600s it was the
 

65
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,350
in the 1600s 14 1500 1600s it was the
beginning of movable type and so people

66
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
beginning of movable type and so people
 

67
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,350
beginning of movable type and so people
for the first time in history

68
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
for the first time in history
 

69
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,350
for the first time in history
had a standard by which they could

70
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
had a standard by which they could
 

71
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,670
had a standard by which they could
appraise their eyesight so looking at a

72
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
appraise their eyesight so looking at a
 

73
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,950
appraise their eyesight so looking at a
printed word now we just take it for

74
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
printed word now we just take it for
 

75
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,950
printed word now we just take it for
granted 12 point font whatever and

76
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
granted 12 point font whatever and
 

77
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,310
granted 12 point font whatever and
that's what the eye charts are based on

78
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
that's what the eye charts are based on
 

79
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,749
that's what the eye charts are based on
they're just fixed height but back then

80
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
they're just fixed height but back then
 

81
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,350
they're just fixed height but back then
there were no there's no way to adjust

82
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
there were no there's no way to adjust
 

83
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,830
there were no there's no way to adjust
your eyesight if you didn't have uh you

84
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
your eyesight if you didn't have uh you
 

85
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,749
your eyesight if you didn't have uh you
know perfect vision and there was no way

86
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
know perfect vision and there was no way
 

87
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,950
know perfect vision and there was no way
to even tell if you had perfect vision

88
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
to even tell if you had perfect vision
 

89
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,510
to even tell if you had perfect vision
or not until the gutenberg bible and

90
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
or not until the gutenberg bible and
 

91
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,789
or not until the gutenberg bible and
movable type

92
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
movable type
 

93
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,310
movable type
and at that time people realized hey

94
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
and at that time people realized hey
 

95
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,749
and at that time people realized hey
wait i can't read this you know my

96
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
wait i can't read this you know my
 

97
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,350
wait i can't read this you know my
priest or my my friend over here he can

98
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
priest or my my friend over here he can
 

99
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,270
priest or my my friend over here he can
read it she can read it i can't read it

100
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
read it she can read it i can't read it
 

101
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,270
read it she can read it i can't read it
what's going on and that's when you know

102
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
what's going on and that's when you know
 

103
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,590
what's going on and that's when you know
these people in in venice and in the

104
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
these people in in venice and in the
 

105
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,350
these people in in venice and in the
netherlands saw that they could take

106
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
netherlands saw that they could take
 

107
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,350
netherlands saw that they could take
this kind of you know glass material and

108
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
this kind of you know glass material and
 

109
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,030
this kind of you know glass material and
hold it up and maybe put another piece

110
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
hold it up and maybe put another piece
 

111
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,310
hold it up and maybe put another piece
of glass material and it would make it

112
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
of glass material and it would make it
 

113
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,350
of glass material and it would make it
clearer

114
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
clearer
 

115
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,630
clearer
and what was so interesting is that

116
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
and what was so interesting is that
 

117
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,550
and what was so interesting is that
nobody thought to take that exact same

118
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
nobody thought to take that exact same
 

119
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,510
nobody thought to take that exact same
device you know two lenses and go like

120
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
device you know two lenses and go like
 

121
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,950
device you know two lenses and go like
let me go like this and look at that

122
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
let me go like this and look at that
 

123
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,030
let me go like this and look at that
bright thing in the sky over there uh

124
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
bright thing in the sky over there uh
 

125
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,430
bright thing in the sky over there uh
until galileo so galileo didn't invent

126
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
until galileo so galileo didn't invent
 

127
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,110
until galileo so galileo didn't invent
it but he

128
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
it but he
 

129
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,630
it but he
did something kind of amazing he

130
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
did something kind of amazing he
 

131
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,869
did something kind of amazing he
improved on it by a factor of 10. so he

132
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
improved on it by a factor of 10. so he
 

133
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,949
improved on it by a factor of 10. so he
10xed it which is almost as good as

134
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
10xed it which is almost as good as
 

135
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,790
10xed it which is almost as good as
going from zero to one is going from you

136
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
going from zero to one is going from you
 

137
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,150
going from zero to one is going from you
know one to ten

138
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
know one to ten
 

139
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,030
know one to ten
and

140
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
and
 

141
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,990
and
when he did that he really

142
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
when he did that he really
 

143
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,150
when he did that he really
transformed both how we

144
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
transformed both how we
 

145
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,309
transformed both how we
look at the universe and think about it

146
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
look at the universe and think about it
 

147
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,470
look at the universe and think about it
but also who we are as a as a species

148
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
but also who we are as a as a species
 

149
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,869
but also who we are as a as a species
because we're using tools not to get

00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
because we're using tools not to get

somebody mentioned this idea that uh

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
somebody mentioned this idea that uh
 

163
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,589
somebody mentioned this idea that uh
if humans weren't able to see the stars

164
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
if humans weren't able to see the stars
 

165
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,710
if humans weren't able to see the stars
maybe there was some some kind of

166
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
maybe there was some some kind of
 

167
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,790
maybe there was some some kind of
makeup of the atmosphere which

168
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
makeup of the atmosphere which
 

169
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,470
makeup of the atmosphere which
for the early humans made it impossible

170
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
for the early humans made it impossible
 

171
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,390
for the early humans made it impossible
to see the stars that we would never

172
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
to see the stars that we would never
 

173
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,070
to see the stars that we would never
develop human civilization or at least

174
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
develop human civilization or at least
 

175
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,149
develop human civilization or at least
raising the question of how important is

176
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
raising the question of how important is
 

177
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,470
raising the question of how important is
it to look up to the sky and wonder

178
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
it to look up to the sky and wonder
 

179
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,949
it to look up to the sky and wonder
what's out there as opposed to

180
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
what's out there as opposed to
 

181
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,430
what's out there as opposed to
um maybe this is an over romanticized

182
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
um maybe this is an over romanticized
 

183
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,670
um maybe this is an over romanticized
notion but like looking at the ground it

184
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
notion but like looking at the ground it
 

185
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,509
notion but like looking at the ground it
feels like a little bit too much focused

186
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
feels like a little bit too much focused
 

187
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,910
feels like a little bit too much focused
on survival not being eaten by a bear

188
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
on survival not being eaten by a bear

if you look up to the stars you start to

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
if you look up to the stars you start to
 

193
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,869
if you look up to the stars you start to
wonder what is my place in the universe

00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
wonder what is my place in the universe

um because they also took the tribe

200
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
um because they also took the tribe
 

201
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,030
um because they also took the tribe
they took the same two lenses and they

202
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
they took the same two lenses and they
 

203
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,309
they took the same two lenses and they
looked inward right they looked at

204
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
looked inward right they looked at
 

205
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,070
looked inward right they looked at
bacteria they looked at you know hairs

206
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
bacteria they looked at you know hairs
 

207
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,030
bacteria they looked at you know hairs
and in other words they made the

208
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
and in other words they made the
 

209
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,509
and in other words they made the
microscope and we're still doing that

210
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
microscope and we're still doing that
 

211
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,990
microscope and we're still doing that
and so you know to have a telescope is

212
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
and so you know to have a telescope is
 

213
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,229
and so you know to have a telescope is
it serves a dual purpose it's it's not

214
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
it serves a dual purpose it's it's not
 

215
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,110
it serves a dual purpose it's it's not
only

216
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
only

a way of looking out it's looking in but

218
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
a way of looking out it's looking in but
 

219
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,509
a way of looking out it's looking in but
it's also looking back in time in other

220
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
it's also looking back in time in other
 

221
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,710
it's also looking back in time in other
words you can see a microscope you don't

222
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
words you can see a microscope you don't
 

223
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,309
words you can see a microscope you don't
say oh i'm seeing this thing as it was

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
seeing it no you don't think about it
 

231
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,470
seeing it no you don't think about it
like that but when you see something

232
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
like that but when you see something
 

233
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,309
like that but when you see something
that's happening you know on jupiter the

234
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
that's happening you know on jupiter the
 

235
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,149
that's happening you know on jupiter the
moon andromeda galaxy you're seeing

236
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159

things you know back when lucy was

238
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
things you know back when lucy was
 

239
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,149
things you know back when lucy was
walking around the serengeti plains and

240
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
walking around the serengeti plains and
 

241
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,789
walking around the serengeti plains and
for that i think that took then the

242
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
for that i think that took then the
 

243
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,710
for that i think that took then the
knowledge of you know relativity and

244
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
knowledge of you know relativity and
 

245
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,190
knowledge of you know relativity and
time travel and and so forth they took

246
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
time travel and and so forth they took
 

247
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,429
time travel and and so forth they took
that before we could really say oh we we

248
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
that before we could really say oh we we
 

249
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,429
that before we could really say oh we we
really unlocked some cheat codes in the

250
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
really unlocked some cheat codes in the
 

251
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,270
really unlocked some cheat codes in the
human brain so i think that might be a

252
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
human brain so i think that might be a
 

253
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,270
human brain so i think that might be a
little too much but but nevertheless i

254
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
little too much but but nevertheless i
 

255
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,870
little too much but but nevertheless i
mean what's better than having a time

256
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
mean what's better than having a time
 

257
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,550
mean what's better than having a time
machine you know it's like we can look

258
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
machine you know it's like we can look
 

259
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,229
machine you know it's like we can look
back in time we see things as they were

260
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
back in time we see things as they were
 

261
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,550
back in time we see things as they were
not as they are and that allows us to do

262
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
not as they are and that allows us to do
 

263
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,310
not as they are and that allows us to do
many things including speculate about

264
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
many things including speculate about
 

265
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,670
many things including speculate about
that but one of the coolest things i

266
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
that but one of the coolest things i
 

267
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,469
that but one of the coolest things i
don't know if you're familiar with

268
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
don't know if you're familiar with
 

269
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,150
don't know if you're familiar with
someone i'm a radio astronomer i don't

271
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,590
someone i'm a radio astronomer i don't
actually look through telescopes very

272
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
actually look through telescopes very
 

273
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,830
actually look through telescopes very
often except uh you know on rare

274
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
often except uh you know on rare
 

275
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,830
often except uh you know on rare
occasions when i when i take one out uh

276
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
occasions when i when i take one out uh
 

277
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,670
occasions when i when i take one out uh
to show the kids but

278
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
to show the kids but
 

279
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,950
to show the kids but
um but a radio telescope is even more

280
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
um but a radio telescope is even more
 

281
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,310
um but a radio telescope is even more
sort of visceral i mean it's much less

282
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
sort of visceral i mean it's much less
 

283
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,350
sort of visceral i mean it's much less
cool because you look at it you're like

284
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
cool because you look at it you're like
 

285
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,790
cool because you look at it you're like
all right looks cool it's kind of weird

286
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
all right looks cool it's kind of weird
 

287
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,469
all right looks cool it's kind of weird
shape thing looks like it belongs in

291
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,110
sci-fi it's going to blast you know
the death star or whatever but when you

292
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
the death star or whatever but when you
 

293
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,629
the death star or whatever but when you
when you realize that when you point a

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,590
when you realize that when you point a
radio telescope at a distant object if

296
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
radio telescope at a distant object if
 

297
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,430
radio telescope at a distant object if
that object fills up what's called the

that object fills up what's called the
 

299
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,430
that object fills up what's called the
beam which is basically the

beam which is basically the
 

301
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,430
beam which is basically the
field of view of a radio telescope is

field of view of a radio telescope is
 

303
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,230
field of view of a radio telescope is
called this beam if you fill up the beam

called this beam if you fill up the beam
and you put a resistor just a simple

306
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
and you put a resistor just a simple
 

307
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,230
and you put a resistor just a simple
absorbing piece of material at the focus

308
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
absorbing piece of material at the focus
 

309
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,950
absorbing piece of material at the focus
of the radio telescope that resistor

310
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
of the radio telescope that resistor
 

311
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,029
of the radio telescope that resistor
will come to the exact same temperature

312
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
will come to the exact same temperature
 

313
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,870
will come to the exact same temperature
as the object that's looking at

as the object that's looking at
 

315
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,390
as the object that's looking at
which is pretty amazing it means you're

316
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
which is pretty amazing it means you're
 

317
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,150
which is pretty amazing it means you're
actually remotely measuring you're

318
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
actually remotely measuring you're
 

319
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,070
actually remotely measuring you're
taking the temperature of jupiter or

320
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
taking the temperature of jupiter or
 

321
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,029
taking the temperature of jupiter or
whatever in in effect and so it's it's

322
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
whatever in in effect and so it's it's
 

323
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,510
whatever in in effect and so it's it's
it's allowing you to basically teleport

324
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
it's allowing you to basically teleport
 

325
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,029
it's allowing you to basically teleport
and there's no other science that you

326
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
and there's no other science that you
 

327
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,230
and there's no other science that you
can really do that right if you're an

328
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
can really do that right if you're an
 

329
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,990
can really do that right if you're an
archaeologist you can let me get into my

330
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
archaeologist you can let me get into my
 

331
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,390
archaeologist you can let me get into my
you know my time machine and go back and

332
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
you know my time machine and go back and
 

333
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,150
you know my time machine and go back and
see what was lucy really like you know

334
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
see what was lucy really like you know
 

335
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,990
see what was lucy really like you know
it's not possible so this the same thing

336
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
it's not possible so this the same thing
 

337
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,909
it's not possible so this the same thing
happens this is where i learned about

338
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
happens this is where i learned about
 

339
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,430
happens this is where i learned about
this from march of the penguins when the

340
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
this from march of the penguins when the
 

341
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,350
this from march of the penguins when the
penguins huddle together

342
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
penguins huddle together
 

343
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,029
penguins huddle together
they uh you know the the body

344
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
they uh you know the the body
 

345
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,150
they uh you know the the body
temperature

346
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160

347
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,590
temperature
arrives to the same place so you're

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
arrives to the same place so you're
 

349
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,189

you're doing this remotely that's like

350
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
you're doing this remotely that's like
 

351
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,950
you're doing this remotely that's like
the march of the penguins but remote we

352
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
the march of the penguins but remote we
 

353
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,390
the march of the penguins but remote we
do it from antarctica too so there are

354
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
do it from antarctica too so there are
 

355
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,390
do it from antarctica too so there are
some penguins around when we do it

356
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
some penguins around when we do it
 

357
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,790
some penguins around when we do it
okay excellent you uh mentioned time

00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
you talk about
 

365
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,309
you talk about
time machines so let me ask you the

366
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
time machines so let me ask you the
 

367
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,070
time machines so let me ask you the
question of uh

368
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
question of uh
 

369
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,950

uh
 

371
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,110
uh
take us back in time what happened at

372
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
take us back in time what happened at
 

373
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,550
take us back in time what happened at
the beginning of our universe ah okay

374
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
the beginning of our universe ah okay
 

375
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,070
the beginning of our universe ah okay
usually people preface this by saying i

376
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
usually people preface this by saying i
 

377
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,309
usually people preface this by saying i
have a simple question so uh you know is

378
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
have a simple question so uh you know is
 

379
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,510
have a simple question so uh you know is
this so you know what happened before

380
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
this so you know what happened before
 

381
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,830
this so you know what happened before
the universe began what happened

382
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
the universe began what happened

take two i have a simple question what
happened at the beginning of our

390
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
happened at the beginning of our
 

391
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,590
happened at the beginning of our
universe there you go all right good so

392
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
universe there you go all right good so
 

393
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,070
universe there you go all right good so
when we think about what what happened

394
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
when we think about what what happened
 

395
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,629
when we think about what what happened
it's more correct it's more logical it's

396
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
it's more correct it's more logical it's
 

397
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,350
it's more correct it's more logical it's
more uh practical to go back in time

398
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
more uh practical to go back in time
 

399
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,150
more uh practical to go back in time
starting from today so if you go back

400
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
starting from today so if you go back
 

401
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,710
starting from today so if you go back
uh

402
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:37,720
uh
 

403
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,550
uh
13.874 billion years from today that's

404
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
13.874 billion years from today that's
 

405
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,830
13.874 billion years from today that's
some day right i mean you could

406
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
some day right i mean you could
 

407
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,670
some day right i mean you could
translate into some day right so on that

408
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
translate into some day right so on that
 

409
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,309
translate into some day right so on that
day something happened uh earlier than

410
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
day something happened uh earlier than
 

411
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,309
day something happened uh earlier than
than you know than the the moment

412
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
than you know than the the moment
 

413
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,749
than you know than the the moment
exactly now let's say we're talking

414
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
exactly now let's say we're talking
 

415
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,710
exactly now let's say we're talking
around

416
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
around
 

417
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,990
around
one o'clock

418
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
one o'clock
 

419
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,550
one o'clock
so at some point during that day uh the

420
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
so at some point during that day uh the
 

421
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,390
so at some point during that day uh the
universe started to become a fusion

422
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
universe started to become a fusion
 

423
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,710
universe started to become a fusion
reactor it started to fuse light

424
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
reactor it started to fuse light
 

425
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,550
reactor it started to fuse light
elements and isotopes into heavier

426
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
elements and isotopes into heavier
 

427
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,070
elements and isotopes into heavier
elements and isotopes of those heavier

428
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080

elements
 

431
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,950
elements
um after that period of time you know

432
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
um after that period of time you know
 

433
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,710
um after that period of time you know
going forward back closer to today less

434
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
going forward back closer to today less
 

435
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,550
going forward back closer to today less
you know 10 minutes earlier 10 minutes

436
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
you know 10 minutes earlier 10 minutes
 

437
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,990
you know 10 minutes earlier 10 minutes
earlier

438
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
earlier
 

439
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,990
earlier
later rather coming towards us today we

440
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
later rather coming towards us today we
 

441
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,110
later rather coming towards us today we
know more and more about what the

442
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
know more and more about what the
 

443
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,029
know more and more about what the
universe was like and in fact all the

444
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
universe was like and in fact all the
 

445
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,950
universe was like and in fact all the
hydrogen you know it's a very good

446
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
hydrogen you know it's a very good
 

447
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,110
hydrogen you know it's a very good
approximation in the water molecules in

448
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
approximation in the water molecules in
 

449
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,710
approximation in the water molecules in
this bottle almost all of them were

450
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
this bottle almost all of them were
 

451
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,629
this bottle almost all of them were
produced during that first 20 minute

452
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
produced during that first 20 minute
 

453
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,510
produced during that first 20 minute
period

454
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
period
 

455
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,670
period
so i would say you know the actual

456
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
so i would say you know the actual
 

457
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,629
so i would say you know the actual
fusion

458
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
fusion
 

459
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,110

468
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
done sir
 

469
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,150
done sir
you know most of those light elements

470
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
you know most of those light elements
 

471
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,070
you know most of those light elements
besides hydrogen aren't really used in

472
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
besides hydrogen aren't really used in
 

473
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,670
besides hydrogen aren't really used in
your you know in your encounter right we

474
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
your you know in your encounter right we
 

475
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,670
your you know in your encounter right we
don't encounter helium that often unless

476
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
don't encounter helium that often unless
 

477
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,510
don't encounter helium that often unless
you go to a lot of birthday parties or

478
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
you go to a lot of birthday parties or
 

479
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,990
you go to a lot of birthday parties or
pilot a blimp um you don't need lithium

480
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
pilot a blimp um you don't need lithium
 

481
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,830
pilot a blimp um you don't need lithium
hopefully uh you know but but other than

482
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840

so if you look at it right now but if i

718
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
so if you look at it right now but if i
 

719

so if you look at it right now but if i
said well when will it stop oscillating

so that depends on how much energy it

722

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
evolved after inflation took place and
 

775
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,629
evolved after inflation took place and
ended but it says nothing about how it

776
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
ended but it says nothing about how it
 

777
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,949
ended but it says nothing about how it
itself took place and that's really what

778
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
itself took place and that's really what
 

779
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,110
itself took place and that's really what
you're asking me i mean you don't real

780
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
you're asking me i mean you don't real

nucleosynthesis and the elements got
made and these fusion reactors and and

786
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
made and these fusion reactors and and
 

787
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,310
made and these fusion reactors and and
the whole universe was a fusion reaction

788

the whole universe was a fusion reaction
 

789
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,069
the whole universe was a fusion reaction
but like don't you really care about

790
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
but like don't you really care about
 

791
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,710
but like don't you really care about
what happened at the beginning of time

792
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
what happened at the beginning of time
 

793
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,110
what happened at the beginning of time
at the first moment of time and the

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
at the first moment of time and the
 

795
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,430
at the first moment of time and the
problem is we can't really answer that

796
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
problem is we can't really answer that
 

797
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,670
problem is we can't really answer that
in the context of the big bang we can't

answer that in the context of these
 

801
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,629
answer that in the context of these
alternatives so you asked me about some

802
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
alternatives so you asked me about some
 

803
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,069
alternatives so you asked me about some
of the alternatives so one is aeon

804
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079

on this point is that those consequences
 

1079
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,750
on this point is that those consequences
are dangerous because they lead to

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,470
works really hard with him
but nevertheless this has certain

1122
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
but nevertheless this has certain
 

1123
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,590
but nevertheless this has certain
attractions to it and what um what it

1124
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
attractions to it and what um what it
 

1125
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,070
attractions to it and what um what it
does most foremost is that it removes

1126
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
does most foremost is that it removes
 

1127
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,150
does most foremost is that it removes
the quantum gravity aspect from

1128
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
the quantum gravity aspect from
 

1129
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,590
the quantum gravity aspect from
cosmology

1130
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
cosmology
 

1131
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,190
cosmology
so it takes away

1132
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
so it takes away
 

1133
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,870
so it takes away
50 percent of the motivation for a

theory of quantum gravity
 

1137
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,990

you've talked a lot about quantum

1138
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
you've talked a lot about quantum
 

1139
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,150
you've talked a lot about quantum
gravity uh you talk people eminent

1140
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
gravity uh you talk people eminent
 

1141
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,310
gravity uh you talk people eminent
people on the show always latent in

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
people on the show always latent in
 

1143
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,549
people on the show always latent in
those conversations is sort of the

1144
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
those conversations is sort of the
 

1145
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,190
those conversations is sort of the
teleological expectation that there is a

teleological expectation that there is a
 

1147

theory of everything there is a theory
 

1149
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,510
theory of everything there is a theory
of quantum gravity but there's there's

1150
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
of quantum gravity but there's there's
 

1151
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,110
of quantum gravity but there's there's
no law that says we have to have a

1152
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
no law that says we have to have a
 

1153
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,510
no law that says we have to have a
theory of quantum gravity so that that

1154
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
theory of quantum gravity so that that
 

1155
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,470
theory of quantum gravity so that that
kind of uh implicit expectation has to

1156
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
kind of uh implicit expectation has to
 

1157
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,029
kind of uh implicit expectation has to
do ultimately with the inflationary

do ultimately with the inflationary
 

1159
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,230
do ultimately with the inflationary
theory so in cosmic inflation so is that

1160
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
theory so in cosmic inflation so is that
 

1161
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,870
theory so in cosmic inflation so is that
at the core so okay uh maybe you can

1162
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
at the core so okay uh maybe you can
 

1163
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,909
at the core so okay uh maybe you can
speak to what is uh the negative impacts

1164
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
speak to what is uh the negative impacts
 

1165
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,590
speak to what is uh the negative impacts
on society

1267
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,350

reaching that far well no i think those

1268
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
reaching that far well no i think those
 

1269
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,669

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,510
the answer is a little both because in

right but that's horribly imprecise so

00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
so me telling you that tells you nothing
 

1321
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,070
so me telling you that tells you nothing
in this case it's basically saying that

1322
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,080
in this case it's basically saying that
 

1323
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,830
in this case it's basically saying that
we're living in a universe because the

1324
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
we're living in a universe because the
 

1325
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,470
we're living in a universe because the
overwhelming odds of our existence

overwhelming odds of our existence
 

1327
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,190
overwhelming odds of our existence
um dictate that we would exist there has

1328
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
um dictate that we would exist there has
 

1329
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,549
um dictate that we would exist there has
to be at least one place that we exist

1330
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
to be at least one place that we exist
 

1331
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,549
to be at least one place that we exist
but the problem is um it's a

1332
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
but the problem is um it's a
 

1333
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,270
but the problem is um it's a
manifestation of infinity so humans

1334
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
manifestation of infinity so humans
 

1335
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,190
manifestation of infinity so humans
and and i'm sure you know this from your

1336
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
and and i'm sure you know this from your
 

1337
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,430
and and i'm sure you know this from your
work with with ai and ml and everything

1338
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,440
work with with ai and ml and everything
 

1339
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,390
work with with ai and ml and everything
else um that humans

1340
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
else um that humans
 

1341
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,789
else um that humans
as far as we know really are the only

1342
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
as far as we know really are the only
 

1343
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,270
as far as we know really are the only
entities capable of contemplating

1344
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
entities capable of contemplating
 

1345
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,909
entities capable of contemplating
infinity but we do so very imperfectly

1346
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
infinity but we do so very imperfectly
 

1347
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,830
infinity but we do so very imperfectly
right so if i say to you like what's

1348
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
right so if i say to you like what's
 

1349
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,590
right so if i say to you like what's
bigger the number of you know water

1350
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
bigger the number of you know water
 

1351
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,270
bigger the number of you know water
molecules and and this thing or the

1352
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
molecules and and this thing or the
 

1353
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,950
molecules and and this thing or the
number of real numbers or if i say

1354
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
number of real numbers or if i say
 

1355
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,070
number of real numbers or if i say
what's bigger the number of real numbers

1356
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
what's bigger the number of real numbers
 

1357
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,510
what's bigger the number of real numbers
are rational numbers they're all

1358
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
are rational numbers they're all
 

1359
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,029
are rational numbers they're all
different classifications of the amount

1360
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
different classifications of the amount
 

1361
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,029
different classifications of the amount
of infinities that there could be

1362
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
of infinities that there could be
 

1363
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,549
of infinities that there could be
infinity to the infinity power you know

1364

infinity to the infinity power you know
when you have kids someday they'll tell

1366
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
when you have kids someday they'll tell
 

1367
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,190
when you have kids someday they'll tell
you i love you infinity you have to come

1368
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
you i love you infinity you have to come
 

1369
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,270
you i love you infinity you have to come
back i love you infinity plus one right

1370
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280
back i love you infinity plus one right
 

1371
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,669
back i love you infinity plus one right
so uh but the human brain can't really

1372
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
so uh but the human brain can't really
 

1373
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,070
so uh but the human brain can't really
contemplate infinity let me illustrate

1374
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
contemplate infinity let me illustrate
 

1375
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,029
contemplate infinity let me illustrate
that

1376
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039
that
 

1377
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,669
that
they say in the singularity the universe

1378
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
they say in the singularity the universe
 

1379
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,070
they say in the singularity the universe
it had an infinite temperature

1380
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
it had an infinite temperature
 

1381
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,510
it had an infinite temperature
right so

1382
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
right so
 

1383
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,710
right so
let me ask you a question is there

1384
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
let me ask you a question is there
 

1385
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,710
let me ask you a question is there
anything that you can contemplate in the

and if you can think of such thing i'd

1396
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
and if you can think of such thing i'd
 

1397
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,789
and if you can think of such thing i'd
like to know it but if you can

1398
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
like to know it but if you can
 

1399
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,470
like to know it but if you can
how does it go to infinity minus one you

1400
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
how does it go to infinity minus one you
 

1401
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,830
how does it go to infinity minus one you
know the opposite direction i go with my

1402
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
know the opposite direction i go with my
 

1403
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,710
know the opposite direction i go with my
kids

how does it go from like the half of

1406
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
how does it go from like the half of
 

1407
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,510
how does it go from like the half of
infinity because that's still infinity

1408
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
infinity because that's still infinity
 

1409
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,750

how did it cool down how did it get more

1410
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
how did it cool down how did it get more
 

1411
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,590
how did it cool down how did it get more
and more tenuous and rarefied so now

1412
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
and more tenuous and rarefied so now
 

1413
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,909
and more tenuous and rarefied so now
it's only infinity over two in terms of

it's only infinity over two in terms of
 

1415
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,390
it's only infinity over two in terms of
past less infinite more infinite

1416
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
past less infinite more infinite
 

1417
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,950
past less infinite more infinite
yeah i mean it's uh that's one of the

1418
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
yeah i mean it's uh that's one of the
 

1419
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,909
yeah i mean it's uh that's one of the
biggest

1420
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
biggest
 

1421
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,190
biggest
troubling things to me about infinity is

1422
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
troubling things to me about infinity is
 

1423
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,190
troubling things to me about infinity is
uh you can't truly hold it inside our

1424
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
uh you can't truly hold it inside our
 

1425
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,110
uh you can't truly hold it inside our
minds it's a mathematical construct that

doesn't it feels like intuition fails

1428
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,440
doesn't it feels like intuition fails
 

1429
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,029
doesn't it feels like intuition fails
and but nevertheless we use it

1430
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
and but nevertheless we use it
 

1431
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,950
and but nevertheless we use it
nonchalantly and then

1432
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
nonchalantly and then
 

1433
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,909
nonchalantly and then
use like physicists they're incredible

1434
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:03,919
use like physicists they're incredible
 

1435
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,990
use like physicists they're incredible
intuition machines and then they'll play

1436
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
intuition machines and then they'll play
 

1437
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,909
intuition machines and then they'll play
with this infinity as if

1438
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
with this infinity as if
 

1439
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,669
with this infinity as if
they can play with it and the level of

1440
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:09,679
they can play with it and the level of
 

1441
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,190
they can play with it and the level of
intuition as opposed to the level of

1442
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
intuition as opposed to the level of
 

1443
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,230
intuition as opposed to the level of
math

1444
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
math
 

1445
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,990
math
you know yeah maybe something cyclical

1446
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
you know yeah maybe something cyclical
 

1447
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,669
you know yeah maybe something cyclical
you can imagine infinity just going

1448
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:15,679
you can imagine infinity just going
 

1449
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,350
you can imagine infinity just going
around the same um kind of like a mobius

1450
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
around the same um kind of like a mobius
 

1451
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,510
around the same um kind of like a mobius
strip situation

1452
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
strip situation
 

1453
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,909
strip situation
but then the question then arises how do

1454
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
but then the question then arises how do
 

1455
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,310
but then the question then arises how do
you make it more or less infinite uh

1456
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
you make it more or less infinite uh
 

1457
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,830
you make it more or less infinite uh
yeah all of that intuition fails

1458
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
yeah all of that intuition fails
 

1459
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,590
yeah all of that intuition fails
completely and i mean how do you

1460
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
completely and i mean how do you
 

1461
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,350
completely and i mean how do you
represent it in a computer right it's

1462
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
represent it in a computer right it's
 

1463
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,430
represent it in a computer right it's
either some placeholder for infinity or

1464
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
either some placeholder for infinity or
 

1465
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,269
either some placeholder for infinity or
it's one divided by a very the smallest

1466
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
it's one divided by a very the smallest
 

1467
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,630
it's one divided by a very the smallest
you know possible

1468
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
you know possible
 

1469
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,470
you know possible
um you know real number that you can

1470
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
um you know real number that you can
 

1471
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,909
um you know real number that you can
represent in the memory well that's

1472

and they just learned this thing through
 

1649
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,430
and they just learned this thing through
smuggled in you know it's it's a work of

1650
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,440
smuggled in you know it's it's a work of
 

1651
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,430
smuggled in you know it's it's a work of
heroism especially in cosmology there's

1652
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,440
heroism especially in cosmology there's
 

1653
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,029
heroism especially in cosmology there's
so many cosmologists that worked

1654

so many cosmologists that worked
 

1655
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,310
so many cosmologists that worked
incredibly hard probably because they

interesting uh incentives in the soviet
 

1667
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,789
interesting uh incentives in the soviet
system that maybe you can take this

1668
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:54,799
system that maybe you can take this
 

1669
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,750
system that maybe you can take this
tangent uh for a brief moment

1670
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
tangent uh for a brief moment
 

1671
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,789
tangent uh for a brief moment
that

1672
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
that
 

1673
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,549
that
because there's a dictatorship

1674
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:00,559
because there's a dictatorship
 

1675
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,470
because there's a dictatorship
authoritarian regime throughout the the

1676

science was prioritized
 

1683
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,630
science was prioritized
and because the state prioritized it

1684
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640

it's interesting to think of a world
 

1749
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,470
it's interesting to think of a world
where science was highly prized but they

1750
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
where science was highly prized but they
 

1751
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,710
where science was highly prized but they
had to do that science

1752
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
had to do that science
 

1753
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,029
had to do that science

through is that a hedgehog that says

2218
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:10,320
through is that a hedgehog that says
 

2219
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,030
through is that a hedgehog that says
it's a hedgehog hedgehog and the fog

2220
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,040
it's a hedgehog hedgehog and the fog
 

2221
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,829
it's a hedgehog hedgehog and the fog
i should mention and we'll go one by one

2222
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
i should mention and we'll go one by one
 

2223
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,030
i should mention and we'll go one by one
these things you've given me some

2224
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,040
these things you've given me some
 

2225
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,790
these things you've given me some
incredible gifts maybe this is a good

2226
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
incredible gifts maybe this is a good
 

2227
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,790
incredible gifts maybe this is a good
place to ask about

2228
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800
place to ask about
 

2229
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,710
place to ask about
the telescope that put some clamps on

2230
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
the telescope that put some clamps on
 

2231
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,550
the telescope that put some clamps on
and let the hedgehogs look

2232
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560
and let the hedgehogs look
 

2233
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,230
and let the hedgehogs look
and uh using now you're officially an

2234
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,240
and uh using now you're officially an
 

2235
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,829
and uh using now you're officially an
experimental astrophysicist by the way

2236
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:27,839
experimental astrophysicist by the way
 

2237
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,910
experimental astrophysicist by the way
why experimentalist versus an engineer

2238
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:29,920
why experimentalist versus an engineer
 

2239
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,670
why experimentalist versus an engineer
because you assembled this telescope you

2240
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
because you assembled this telescope you
 

2241
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,030
because you assembled this telescope you
gave it a mount

2242
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,040
gave it a mount
 

2243
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,950
gave it a mount
and you connected it to uh to a very

2244
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:34,960
and you connected it to uh to a very
 

2245
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,390
and you connected it to uh to a very
yeah but there's no experiment going on

2246
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
yeah but there's no experiment going on
 

2247
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,390
yeah but there's no experiment going on
it's just engineering for show okay it's

2248
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:38,400
it's just engineering for show okay it's
 

2249
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,390
it's just engineering for show okay it's
very shallow so experimenters taking it

2250
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,400
very shallow so experimenters taking it
 

2251
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,470
very shallow so experimenters taking it
to the next level and actually achieving

2252
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,480
to the next level and actually achieving
 

2253
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,550
to the next level and actually achieving
something here i just built a thing for

2254
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
something here i just built a thing for
 

2255
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,589
something here i just built a thing for
show well that's always a joke people

2256
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:45,599
show well that's always a joke people
 

2257
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,710
show well that's always a joke people
say oh you're an experimental

2258
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:46,720
say oh you're an experimental
 

2259
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,390
say oh you're an experimental
cosmologist i'm like yeah i build a lot

2260
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,400
cosmologist i'm like yeah i build a lot
 

2261
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,470
cosmologist i'm like yeah i build a lot
of universes oh we actually most of my

2262
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
of universes oh we actually most of my
 

2263
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,990
of universes oh we actually most of my
time is putting clamps on things

2264
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,000
time is putting clamps on things
 

2265
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,430
time is putting clamps on things
soldering things you know it's not

2266
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
soldering things you know it's not
 

2267
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,510
soldering things you know it's not
actually doing the stroking of my

2268
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
actually doing the stroking of my
 

2269
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,430
actually doing the stroking of my
non-existent beard contemplating the

model yeah and just like uh most of

2274
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:01,520
model yeah and just like uh most of
 

2275
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,990
model yeah and just like uh most of
robotics is just using velcro for things

2276
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,000
robotics is just using velcro for things
 

2277
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,829
robotics is just using velcro for things
right yeah it's not like having dancing

2278
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:05,839
right yeah it's not like having dancing
 

2279
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,550
right yeah it's not like having dancing
dogs and whatever right so telescope yes

blessings i have my life came from a
 

2293
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,870
blessings i have my life came from a
telescope and i always advise parents or

where i was growing up as a 12 year old

2302
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:31,599
where i was growing up as a 12 year old
 

2303
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,190
where i was growing up as a 12 year old
outside of manhattan

2304
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,200
outside of manhattan
 

2305
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,950
outside of manhattan
you can see the exact same craters on

2306
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:34,960
you can see the exact same craters on
 

2307
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,109
you can see the exact same craters on
the moon the same rings of saturn the

2308
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
the moon the same rings of saturn the
 

2309
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,910
the moon the same rings of saturn the
same moons of jupiter the same phases of

same moons of jupiter the same phases of
 

2311
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,710
same moons of jupiter the same phases of
v you can see the andromeda galaxy lacks

00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,720
v you can see the andromeda galaxy lacks
 

2313
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,710
v you can see the andromeda galaxy lacks
two and a half million light years away

2314
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:44,720
two and a half million light years away
 

2315
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,470
two and a half million light years away
from earth you can do that with that

2316
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:46,480
from earth you can do that with that
 

2317
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,910
from earth you can do that with that
little thing over there one that's a

2318
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:47,920
little thing over there one that's a
 

2319
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,190
little thing over there one that's a
little more expensive get one that has a

2320
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,200
little more expensive get one that has a
 

2321
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,430
little more expensive get one that has a
mount and and you can attach now your

2322
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
mount and and you can attach now your
 

2323
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,870
mount and and you can attach now your
smartphone what the hell is that i

2324
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:52,880
smartphone what the hell is that i
 

2325
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,829
smartphone what the hell is that i
wouldn't have known what that was in

2326
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
wouldn't have known what that was in
 

2327
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,349
wouldn't have known what that was in
1984.

2328
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:55,359
1984.
 

2329
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,270
1984.
and with that you can do something that

2330
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,280
and with that you can do something that
 

2331
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,589
and with that you can do something that
no other science to my knowledge can

2332
00:38:59,589 --> 00:38:59,599
no other science to my knowledge can
 

2333
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,990
no other science to my knowledge can
really replicate maybe biology in some

2334
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,000
really replicate maybe biology in some
 

2335
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,550
really replicate maybe biology in some
sense but you can experience

2336
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:04,560
sense but you can experience
 

2337
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,550
sense but you can experience
the physical sensation

2338
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:06,560
the physical sensation
 

2339
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,349
the physical sensation
that galileo experienced when he turned

2340
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
that galileo experienced when he turned
 

2341
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,270
that galileo experienced when he turned
a telescope like that to jupiter and saw

2342
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,280
a telescope like that to jupiter and saw
 

2343
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,910
a telescope like that to jupiter and saw
these four dots around it or that saturn

2344
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:13,920
these four dots around it or that saturn
 

2345
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,829
these four dots around it or that saturn
had ears as he called it or that the

2346
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:15,839
had ears as he called it or that the
 

2347
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,990
had ears as he called it or that the
moon was not crystalline polished smooth

2348
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,000
moon was not crystalline polished smooth
 

2349
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,390
moon was not crystalline polished smooth
and and made of this heavenly substance

2350
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:20,400
and and made of this heavenly substance
 

2351
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,550
and and made of this heavenly substance
the quintessent substance right

2352
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,560
the quintessent substance right
 

2353
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,390
the quintessent substance right
so where else can you be

2354
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,400
so where else can you be
 

2355
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,390
so where else can you be
viscerally connected with the first

2356
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
viscerally connected with the first
 

2357
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,829
viscerally connected with the first
person ever make that discovery try

2358
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
person ever make that discovery try
 

2359
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,430
person ever make that discovery try
doing that with the higgs boson you know

2360
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,440
doing that with the higgs boson you know
 

2361
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,109
doing that with the higgs boson you know
get yourself an lhc

2362
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
get yourself an lhc
 

2363
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,550
get yourself an lhc
and smash together you know high

2364
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:32,560
and smash together you know high

2555
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,109
westchester county new york yeah got it
so okay so but then that's where the

00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:45,119
so okay so but then that's where the
 

2557

but
 

2561
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,550
but
then there is the pragmatic journey of a

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,670
and i was you know thinking uh maybe
i'll be condensed matter physicist or

i'll be condensed matter physicist or

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,510
like signal is primary like the the
thing you measure

2842
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:21,520
thing you measure
 

2843
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,710
thing you measure
is primary and theory is just

2844
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:24,720
is primary and theory is just
 

2845
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,230
is primary and theory is just
the search of explaining um

2846
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
the search of explaining um
 

2847
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,790
the search of explaining um
how that signal originated but it's all

2848
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:30,800
how that signal originated but it's all
 

2849
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,950
how that signal originated but it's all
about the signal i mean i i see the same

2850
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:32,960
about the signal i mean i i see the same
 

2851
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,190
about the signal i mean i i see the same
search for the human mind and like

2852
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
search for the human mind and like
 

2853
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,589
search for the human mind and like
neuroscience in that same kind of way

2854
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:37,599
neuroscience in that same kind of way
 

2855
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,990
neuroscience in that same kind of way
is it's ultimately about the signal but

2856
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:40,000
is it's ultimately about the signal but
 

2857
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,470
is it's ultimately about the signal but
you kind of hope to understand

2858
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,480
you kind of hope to understand
 

2859
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,990
you kind of hope to understand
how that signal originated that's

2860
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,000
how that signal originated that's
 

2861
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,470
how that signal originated that's
fascinating that's uh that's such a

2862
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:46,480
fascinating that's uh that's such a
 

2863
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,030
fascinating that's uh that's such a
beautiful way to

2864
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,040
beautiful way to
 

2865
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,790
beautiful way to
to explain experimental physics

2866
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:52,800
to explain experimental physics
 

2867
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,390
to explain experimental physics
because it it ultimately at the end of

2868
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:54,400
because it it ultimately at the end of
 

2869
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,910
because it it ultimately at the end of
the day is

2870
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:55,920
the day is
 

2871
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,390
the day is
all about the signal yeah

2872
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
all about the signal yeah
 

2873
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,230
all about the signal yeah
yeah and maybe those two things the the

2874
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,240
yeah and maybe those two things the the
 

2875
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,630
yeah and maybe those two things the the
neuroscience and like cosmos uh not

2876
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
neuroscience and like cosmos uh not
 

2877
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,710
neuroscience and like cosmos uh not
getting too romantic but yeah maybe

2878
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:04,720
getting too romantic but yeah maybe
 

2879
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,190
getting too romantic but yeah maybe
they're linked in some fundamental way

2880
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:07,200
they're linked in some fundamental way
 

2881
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,950
they're linked in some fundamental way
some fundamental conscious cosmic

2882
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:08,960
some fundamental conscious cosmic
 

2883
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,190
some fundamental conscious cosmic
consciousness but um we're gonna get to

2884
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,200
consciousness but um we're gonna get to
 

2885
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,630
consciousness but um we're gonna get to
that yeah yeah no we definitely have to

2886
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:12,640
that yeah yeah no we definitely have to
 

2887
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,309
that yeah yeah no we definitely have to
do that

2888
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:14,319
do that
 

2889
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,990
do that
but getting back to yet so it's so my

2890
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,000
but getting back to yet so it's so my
 

2891
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,430
but getting back to yet so it's so my
origins so i always say like and i want

2892
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:17,440
origins so i always say like and i want
 

2893
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,190
origins so i always say like and i want
to try this on you you said you wouldn't

2894
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,200
to try this on you you said you wouldn't
 

2895
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,309
to try this on you you said you wouldn't
answer any of my questions but i'm going

2896
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
answer any of my questions but i'm going
 

2897
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,430
answer any of my questions but i'm going
to ask you some questions what's the

2898
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:21,440
to ask you some questions what's the
 

2899
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,030
to ask you some questions what's the
most important day on the calendar don't

2900
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,040
most important day on the calendar don't
 

2901
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,710
most important day on the calendar don't
tell me the date but what to you what is

2902
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:24,720
tell me the date but what to you what is
 

2903
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,230
tell me the date but what to you what is
your mo what's the most important day to

2904
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
your mo what's the most important day to
 

2905
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,030
your mo what's the most important day to
you

2906
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
you
 

2907
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,790
you
every year do i have to answer or do i

2908
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
every year do i have to answer or do i
 

2909
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,630
every year do i have to answer or do i
have to think about it no no answer like

2910
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:30,640
have to think about it no no answer like
 

2911
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,910
have to think about it no no answer like
you don't tell me the exact date of the

2912
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:31,920
you don't tell me the exact date of the
 

2913
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,670
you don't tell me the exact date of the
count it could be like your mistresses

2914
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:33,680
count it could be like your mistresses
 

2915
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,349
count it could be like your mistresses
you know a birthday or whatever but i

2916
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
you know a birthday or whatever but i
 

2917
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,069
you know a birthday or whatever but i
have so many i lose track

2918
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:38,079
have so many i lose track
 

2919
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,349
have so many i lose track
even though i'm single how does that

2920
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:39,359
even though i'm single how does that
 

2921
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,069
even though i'm single how does that
even make sense i know okay i'm sorry uh

2922
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
even make sense i know okay i'm sorry uh
 

2923
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,910
even make sense i know okay i'm sorry uh
so i uh a day

2924
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:43,920
so i uh a day
 

2925
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,069
so i uh a day
like like uh like a month and a day yeah

2926
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
like like uh like a month and a day yeah
 

2927
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,430
like like uh like a month and a day yeah
i mean for me it would be december 31st

2928
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
i mean for me it would be december 31st
 

2929
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,790
i mean for me it would be december 31st
yeah so i was going to say new year's

2930
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:50,800
yeah so i was going to say new year's
 

2931
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,870
yeah so i was going to say new year's
eve new year's day uh some people say

2932
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:52,880
eve new year's day uh some people say
 

2933
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,950
eve new year's day uh some people say
birthday anniversary kids birth they're

2934
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960
birthday anniversary kids birth they're
 

2935
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,430
birthday anniversary kids birth they're
usually signif signifying beginnings and

2936
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:57,440
usually signif signifying beginnings and
 

2937
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,670
usually signif signifying beginnings and
ends right january means the portal

2938
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,680
ends right january means the portal
 

2939
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,430
ends right january means the portal
between the god was the portal between

2940
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:01,440
between the god was the portal between
 

2941
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,190
between the god was the portal between
the beginning and the end so you're

2942
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:03,200
the beginning and the end so you're
 

2943
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,230
the beginning and the end so you're
looking back maybe because you're

2944
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,240
looking back maybe because you're
 

2945
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,549
looking back maybe because you're
russian like the death side the light

2946
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:06,559
russian like the death side the light
 

2947
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,910
russian like the death side the light
side looking forward to january the

2948
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:07,920
side looking forward to january the
 

2949
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,150
side looking forward to january the
beginning right

2950
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
beginning right
 

2951
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,670
beginning right
so um

2952
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:11,680
so um
 

2953
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,910
so um
everybody's most important day

2954
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:13,920
everybody's most important day
 

2955
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,230
everybody's most important day
is usually some beginning or something

2956
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:16,240
is usually some beginning or something
 

2957
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,069
is usually some beginning or something
significant for me it was studying the

2958
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:18,079
significant for me it was studying the
 

2959
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,349
significant for me it was studying the
most significant thing of all it's like

2960
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:19,359
most significant thing of all it's like
 

2961
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,950
most significant thing of all it's like
when did the universe get born as i said

2962
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:20,960
when did the universe get born as i said
 

2963
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,470
when did the universe get born as i said
before and i didn't think there again i

2964
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:24,480
before and i didn't think there again i
 

2965
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,230
before and i didn't think there again i
didn't i just there was some mental

2966
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:26,240
didn't i just there was some mental
 

2967
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,630
didn't i just there was some mental
obstruction that i didn't realize

2968
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
obstruction that i didn't realize
 

2969
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,950
obstruction that i didn't realize
that i could get past because i didn't

2970
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
that i could get past because i didn't
 

2971
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,190
that i could get past because i didn't
think like anybody does it like i knew

2972
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,200
think like anybody does it like i knew
 

2973
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,870
think like anybody does it like i knew
astronomers knew these answers like the

2974
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:34,880
astronomers knew these answers like the
 

2975
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,950
astronomers knew these answers like the
universe at that time between 10 and 20

2976
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
universe at that time between 10 and 20
 

2977
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,309
universe at that time between 10 and 20
billion years old now we know it's

2978
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:39,319
billion years old now we know it's
 

2979
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:42,230
billion years old now we know it's
13.872 billion years old it's incredible

2980
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
13.872 billion years old it's incredible
 

2981
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,230
13.872 billion years old it's incredible
the five digits you know for significant

2982
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,240
the five digits you know for significant
 

2983
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,190
the five digits you know for significant
five what is it again 13.

2984
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:46,200
five what is it again 13.
 

2985
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,910
five what is it again 13.
13.872 billion years

2986
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:48,920
13.872 billion years
 

2987
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,069
13.872 billion years
872 million so is there a lot of plus or

2988
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:52,079
872 million so is there a lot of plus or
 

2989
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,510
872 million so is there a lot of plus or
minus on that is that what are the

2990
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:53,520
minus on that is that what are the
 

2991
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,910
minus on that is that what are the
errors for me i'm 50. so it would be the

2992
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:55,920
errors for me i'm 50. so it would be the
 

2993
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,270
errors for me i'm 50. so it would be the
equivalent of you looking at me and

2994
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
equivalent of you looking at me and
 

2995
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,349
equivalent of you looking at me and
telling me within 12 hours how old i am

2996
00:49:59,349 --> 00:49:59,359
telling me within 12 hours how old i am
 

2997
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,670
telling me within 12 hours how old i am
yeah it's a half a percent percent level

2998
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:01,680
yeah it's a half a percent percent level
 

2999
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,430
yeah it's a half a percent percent level
accuracy there's the confidence behind

3000
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,440
accuracy there's the confidence behind
 

3001
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,630
accuracy there's the confidence behind
that oh yeah i mean there's the

3002
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
that oh yeah i mean there's the
 

3003
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,549
that oh yeah i mean there's the
significance yeah no it's extremely well

3004
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:06,559
significance yeah no it's extremely well
 

3005
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,589
significance yeah no it's extremely well
measured i mean it's one of the most

3006
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:07,599
measured i mean it's one of the most
 

3007
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,910
measured i mean it's one of the most
precise things that we have in contrast

3008
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:09,920
precise things that we have in contrast
 

3009
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,950
precise things that we have in contrast
to again 25 years ago we didn't know if

3010
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
to again 25 years ago we didn't know if
 

3011
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,790
to again 25 years ago we didn't know if
the universe was 10 billion or 20

3012
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:14,800
the universe was 10 billion or 20
 

3013
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,790
the universe was 10 billion or 20
billion years old but there were stars

3014
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800
billion years old but there were stars
 

3015
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,710
billion years old but there were stars
in our galaxy that were believed to be

3016
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:18,720
in our galaxy that were believed to be
 

3017
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,950
in our galaxy that were believed to be
as they are about 12 billion years old

3018
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:20,960
as they are about 12 billion years old
 

3019
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,549
as they are about 12 billion years old
or in the universe that were 12 billion

3020
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:22,559
or in the universe that were 12 billion
 

3021
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,950
or in the universe that were 12 billion
so that would be like you being um older

3022
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
so that would be like you being um older
 

3023
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,549
so that would be like you being um older
than your father

3024
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:26,559
than your father
 

3025
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,069
than your father
it was embarrassing can we can we

3026
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:28,079
it was embarrassing can we can we
 

3027
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,230
it was embarrassing can we can we
actually take a tangent on the tangent

3028
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:30,240
actually take a tangent on the tangent
 

3029
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,750
actually take a tangent on the tangent
tension out of tangent

3030
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
tension out of tangent
 

3031
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,069
tension out of tangent
how old is the universe can you can you

3032
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:34,079
how old is the universe can you can you
 

3033
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,349
how old is the universe can you can you
dig in onto this number how do we know

3034
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:37,359
dig in onto this number how do we know
 

3035
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,270
dig in onto this number how do we know
currently with those i guess you said

3036
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,280
currently with those i guess you said
 

3037
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,349
currently with those i guess you said
five four or five uh

3038
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:41,359
five four or five uh
 

3039
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,510
five four or five uh
significant uh digits so we can come

3040
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:43,520
significant uh digits so we can come
 

3041
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,589
significant uh digits so we can come
about it from two different ways one uh

3042
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:45,599
about it from two different ways one uh
 

3043
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,190
about it from two different ways one uh
basically they rely on the most

3044
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:47,200
basically they rely on the most
 

3045
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,710
basically they rely on the most
important number in cosmology which is

3046
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:48,720
important number in cosmology which is
 

3047
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,470
important number in cosmology which is
called the hubble constant the hubble

3048
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:50,480
called the hubble constant the hubble
 

3049
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,109
called the hubble constant the hubble
constant is this weird number that has

3050
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:53,119
constant is this weird number that has
 

3051
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,030
constant is this weird number that has
the following units it has the units of

3052
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:55,040
the following units it has the units of
 

3053
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,309
the following units it has the units of
kilometers per second per megaparsec so

3054
00:50:58,309 --> 00:50:58,319
kilometers per second per megaparsec so
 

3055
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,549
kilometers per second per megaparsec so
it's a speed per distance which means

3056
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
it's a speed per distance which means
 

3057
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,910
it's a speed per distance which means
you multiply it by distance and you get

3058
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:01,920
you multiply it by distance and you get
 

3059
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,430
you multiply it by distance and you get
a speed and what is the speed you're

3060
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:03,440
a speed and what is the speed you're
 

3061
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,790
a speed and what is the speed you're
measuring well you're measuring the

3062
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:04,800
measuring well you're measuring the
 

3063
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,470
measuring well you're measuring the
speed of a distant galaxy at many

3064
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,480
speed of a distant galaxy at many
 

3065
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,710
speed of a distant galaxy at many
megaparsecs away so a galaxy at one

3066
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:08,720
megaparsecs away so a galaxy at one
 

3067
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,150
megaparsecs away so a galaxy at one
megaparsec away this isn't actually

3068
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:10,160
megaparsec away this isn't actually
 

3069
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,349
megaparsec away this isn't actually
strictly true because of local

3070
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
strictly true because of local
 

3071
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,430
strictly true because of local
gravitational effects uh but if you go

3072
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:13,440
gravitational effects uh but if you go
 

3073
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,589
gravitational effects uh but if you go
out say one uh megaparsico i would say

3074
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
out say one uh megaparsico i would say
 

3075
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,670
out say one uh megaparsico i would say
that that galaxy is moving 72 kilometers

3076
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:17,680
that that galaxy is moving 72 kilometers
 

3077
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,670
that that galaxy is moving 72 kilometers
per second away from you and every

3078
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:19,680
per second away from you and every
 

3079
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,069
per second away from you and every
galaxy except for the local very most

3080
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
galaxy except for the local very most
 

3081
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,829
galaxy except for the local very most
local group surrounding us maybe a half

3082
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:23,839
local group surrounding us maybe a half
 

3083
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,190
local group surrounding us maybe a half
a dozen galaxies out of 50 to sorry

3084
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
a dozen galaxies out of 50 to sorry
 

3085
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,870
a dozen galaxies out of 50 to sorry
sorry out of uh

3086
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880
sorry out of uh
 

3087
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,190
sorry out of uh
500 billion galaxies to perhaps a

3088
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,200
500 billion galaxies to perhaps a
 

3089
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,910
500 billion galaxies to perhaps a
trillion galaxies so 12 out of that

3090
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:33,920
trillion galaxies so 12 out of that
 

3091
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,790
trillion galaxies so 12 out of that
number

3092
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:34,800
number
 

3093
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,069
number
are moving towards us the rest are

3094
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,079
are moving towards us the rest are
 

3095
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,510
are moving towards us the rest are
moving away from us

3096
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:37,520
moving away from us
 

3097
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,230
moving away from us
so

3098
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:38,240
so
 

3099
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,470
so
that number if you invert it

3100
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:40,480
that number if you invert it
 

3101
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,230
that number if you invert it
if you say well when did those things

3102
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:42,240
if you say well when did those things
 

3103
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,150
if you say well when did those things
last touch each other all those galaxies

3104
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:44,160
last touch each other all those galaxies
 

3105
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,069
last touch each other all those galaxies
now they're really far apart we know how

3106
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:46,079
now they're really far apart we know how
 

3107
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,349
now they're really far apart we know how
fast they're moving away it's a very

3108
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:47,359
fast they're moving away it's a very
 

3109
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,030
fast they're moving away it's a very
simple algebra problem to solve when

3110
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:49,040
simple algebra problem to solve when
 

3111
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,710
simple algebra problem to solve when
were they touching that's where you get

3112
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:50,720
were they touching that's where you get
 

3113
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,190
were they touching that's where you get
that number from so there's the local 12

3114
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:53,200
that number from so there's the local 12
 

3115
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,270
that number from so there's the local 12
and then the rest ignore the 12 yeah and

3116
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,280
and then the rest ignore the 12 yeah and
 

3117
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,790
and then the rest ignore the 12 yeah and
then ignore the 12 and then look at the

3118
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:56,800
then ignore the 12 and then look at the
 

3119
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,470
then ignore the 12 and then look at the
others and yeah the then solve the

3120
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
others and yeah the then solve the
 

3121
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,630
others and yeah the then solve the
algebra problem

3122
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:00,640
algebra problem
 

3123
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,390
algebra problem
uh how does the

00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,400
uh how does the

00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:05,920
mystery of that beginning epic changed
 

3129
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,470

this calculation of very little because

3130
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:08,480
this calculation of very little because
 

3131
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,270
this calculation of very little because
actually we understand um how there's

3132
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
actually we understand um how there's
 

3133
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,710
actually we understand um how there's
some other ingredients that go into it

00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
some other ingredients that go into it
 

3135
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,309
some other ingredients that go into it
namely how much dark energy there is in

3136
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:14,319
namely how much dark energy there is in
 

3137
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,670
namely how much dark energy there is in
the universe how much dark matter there

3138
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:15,680
the universe how much dark matter there
 

3139
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,589
the universe how much dark matter there
is in the universe how much radiation

3140
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:17,599
is in the universe how much radiation
 

3141
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,150
is in the universe how much radiation
light neutrinos etcetera are and how

00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,160
light neutrinos etcetera are and how
 

3143
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,829
light neutrinos etcetera are and how
much ordinary matter like we're made up

3144
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:21,839
much ordinary matter like we're made up

of neutrons protons croutons
 

3147
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,069
of neutrons protons croutons
okay so

3148
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079

 

3149
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,190

3151
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,910

it appears that the universe

00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:33,920
it appears that the universe
 

3153
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,270
it appears that the universe
is bigger than it is older

3154
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,280
is bigger than it is older
 

3155
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,510
is bigger than it is older
how does that make sense oh oh yeah so

3156
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:39,520
how does that make sense oh oh yeah so
 

3157
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,549
how does that make sense oh oh yeah so
you're talking about the fact that we

3158
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559
you're talking about the fact that we
 

3159
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,870
you're talking about the fact that we
can actually see stuff in our observable

3160
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:42,880
can actually see stuff in our observable
 

3161
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,589
can actually see stuff in our observable
universe that's located at a distance

3162
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:45,599
universe that's located at a distance
 

3163
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,230
universe that's located at a distance
that is farther than the speed of light

3164
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:48,240
that is farther than the speed of light
 

3165
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,069
that is farther than the speed of light
times the age of the universe naively

3166
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:50,079
times the age of the universe naively
 

3167
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,829
times the age of the universe naively
you would say that the the yeah so

3168
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
you would say that the the yeah so
 

3169
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,150
you would say that the the yeah so
you're right if the universe were static

3170
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,160
you're right if the universe were static
 

3171
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,069
you're right if the universe were static
um if the universe came into existence

3172
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
um if the universe came into existence
 

3173
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,349
um if the universe came into existence
and you can conceive of this the

3174
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:57,359
and you can conceive of this the
 

3175
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,829
and you can conceive of this the
universe came into a big bang in a fixed

3176
00:52:59,829 --> 00:52:59,839
universe came into a big bang in a fixed
 

3177
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,510
universe came into a big bang in a fixed
universe so the universe just

3178
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:01,520
universe so the universe just
 

3179
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,230
universe so the universe just
started off those galaxies were you know

3180
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:04,240
started off those galaxies were you know
 

3181
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,910
started off those galaxies were you know
they could be moving towards us away

3182
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:05,920
they could be moving towards us away
 

3183
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,710
they could be moving towards us away
from us who knows um that you could say

3184
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,720
from us who knows um that you could say
 

3185
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,790
from us who knows um that you could say
i can see a galaxy that's at a distance

3186
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:10,800
i can see a galaxy that's at a distance
 

3187
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,870
i can see a galaxy that's at a distance
of only

3188
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:11,880
of only
 

3189
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,230
of only
13.8 billion years times the speed of

3190
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,240
13.8 billion years times the speed of
 

3191
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,230
13.8 billion years times the speed of
light that would be true but the fact

3192
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:16,240
light that would be true but the fact
 

3193
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,630
light that would be true but the fact
that the light is expanding along with

3194
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:18,640
that the light is expanding along with
 

3195
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,790
that the light is expanding along with
the expansion of the universe so imagine

3196
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:20,800
the expansion of the universe so imagine
 

3197
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,190
the expansion of the universe so imagine
there was some very distant past but we

3198
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
there was some very distant past but we
 

3199
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,030
there was some very distant past but we
were near a galaxy it's going to produce

3200
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:25,040
were near a galaxy it's going to produce
 

3201
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,030
were near a galaxy it's going to produce
some light and that galaxy is going to

3202
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,040
some light and that galaxy is going to
 

3203
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,549
some light and that galaxy is going to
be moving away from us the light's going

3204
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:28,559
be moving away from us the light's going
 

3205
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,230
be moving away from us the light's going
to be getting more and more red shifted

3206
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:30,240
to be getting more and more red shifted
 

3207
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,829
to be getting more and more red shifted
as it's called it's going to be moving

as it's called it's going to be moving
 

3209
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,829
as it's called it's going to be moving
farther and farther away from us

3210
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:33,839
farther and farther away from us
 

3211
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,030
farther and farther away from us
as time goes on there'll be some

00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
as time goes on there'll be some
 

3213
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,710
as time goes on there'll be some
acceleration as we get into the era of

that we can see things approximately

3258
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:19,599
that we can see things approximately
 

3259
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,270

three times the age of the universe away
 

3261
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,950
three times the age of the universe away
from us so we can see if it's called the

from us so we can see if it's called the
 

3263
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,790
from us so we can see if it's called the
age of the universe 15 billion years

3264
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:24,800
age of the universe 15 billion years
 

3265
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,390
age of the universe 15 billion years
just to make the math simple we see

3266
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:26,400
just to make the math simple we see
 

3267
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,549
just to make the math simple we see
things at 45 billion light years

things at 45 billion light years
 

3269
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,270
things at 45 billion light years
distance in that direction and we see

direction just turning our telescopes
 

3275
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,750
direction just turning our telescopes
180 degrees away so that means we see

3276
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:37,760
180 degrees away so that means we see
 

3277
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,390
180 degrees away so that means we see
things that themselves are are 90

00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:51,760
an infinite number of them how are you
 

3291
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,549
an infinite number of them how are you
emotionally okay with the fact that our

3292
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
emotionally okay with the fact that our
 

3293
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,789
emotionally okay with the fact that our
universe is expanding so like it's gonna

3294
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:56,799
universe is expanding so like it's gonna
 

3295
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,030
universe is expanding so like it's gonna
be like annie hall like with alvi uh

we watched propaganda i realized that

3302
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
we watched propaganda i realized that
 

3303
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,309
we watched propaganda i realized that
you did yes uh so there's a family paul

3304
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:06,319
you did yes uh so there's a family paul
 

3305
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:11,270
you did yes uh so there's a family paul
is that some kind of what is this

3306
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280

 

3307
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,190

420 that's uh i've heard of that number

3420
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,400
420 that's uh i've heard of that number
 

3421
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,630
420 that's uh i've heard of that number
before all right let's it used to be 69

3422
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:04,640
before all right let's it used to be 69
 

3423
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,630
before all right let's it used to be 69
but then they changed

3424
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:06,640
but then they changed
 

3425
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,190
but then they changed
wow physics works in mysterious ways and

3426
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:09,200
wow physics works in mysterious ways and
 

3427
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,670

the millimeter box is 69. what what are

3428
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:11,680
the millimeter box is 69. what what are
 

3429
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,069
the millimeter box is 69. what what are
we talking about here what uh what's

3430
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079
we talking about here what uh what's
 

3431
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,390
we talking about here what uh what's
inside what's what's in the box i'm

3432
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:16,400
inside what's what's in the box i'm
 

3433
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,230
inside what's what's in the box i'm
gonna get it that's right let's think

3434
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:18,240
gonna get it that's right let's think
 

3435
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,670
gonna get it that's right let's think
outside the box no we're thinking inside

3436
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
outside the box no we're thinking inside
 

3437
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,750
outside the box no we're thinking inside
the way so if you have every cubic

3438
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:21,760
the way so if you have every cubic
 

3439
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,990
the way so if you have every cubic

ordinary matter in the universe
 

3449
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,190
ordinary matter in the universe
and every cubic centimeter there's some

3450
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:33,200
and every cubic centimeter there's some
 

3451
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,030
and every cubic centimeter there's some

00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:44,720
universe it's enormous that's why
 

3463
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,630
universe it's enormous that's why
there's enormous numbers of particles in

3464
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:46,640
there's enormous numbers of particles in
 

3465
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,789
there's enormous numbers of particles in
our universe it's a very rich universe

3466
00:57:48,789 --> 00:57:48,799
our universe it's a very rich universe
 

3467
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,510
our universe it's a very rich universe
but now let's zoom in on that box so now

3468
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:51,520
but now let's zoom in on that box so now
 

3469
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,270
but now let's zoom in on that box so now
inside that box there might be you know

3470
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,280
inside that box there might be you know
 

3471
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,430
inside that box there might be you know
one let's let's say there might be one

3472
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
one let's let's say there might be one
 

3473
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,030
one let's let's say there might be one
ordinary matter like a proton or an

3474
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
ordinary matter like a proton or an
 

3475
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,950
ordinary matter like a proton or an
electron a baryon

3476
00:57:58,950 --> 00:57:58,960
electron a baryon
 

3477
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,750
electron a baryon
a lepton there might be a couple some a

3478
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:01,760
a lepton there might be a couple some a
 

3479
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,349
a lepton there might be a couple some a
couple hundred neutrinos and there'll be

3480
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:03,359
couple hundred neutrinos and there'll be
 

3481
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,270
couple hundred neutrinos and there'll be
a couple hundred photons as i said four

3482
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,280
a couple hundred photons as i said four
 

3483
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,870
a couple hundred photons as i said four
hundred and twenty

3484
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:06,880
hundred and twenty
 

3485
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,589
hundred and twenty
what's between those guys

3486
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:09,599
what's between those guys
 

3487
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,829
what's between those guys
what's between the protons and the

3488
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:11,839
what's between the protons and the
 

3489
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,549
what's between the protons and the
neutrinos and the photons like just zoom

3490
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,559
neutrinos and the photons like just zoom
 

3491
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,910
neutrinos and the photons like just zoom
into a cubic micron now like imagine 420

3492
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:17,920
into a cubic micron now like imagine 420
 

3493
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,430
into a cubic micron now like imagine 420
things inside a box this big it's

3494
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:19,440
things inside a box this big it's
 

3495
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,030
things inside a box this big it's
actually pretty empty like they're

3496
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:21,040
actually pretty empty like they're
 

3497
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,789
actually pretty empty like they're
zipping around in there right so between

3498
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:22,799
zipping around in there right so between
 

3499
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,390
zipping around in there right so between
them there's a lot of empty space and

3500
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
them there's a lot of empty space and
 

3501
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,549
them there's a lot of empty space and
this is outside the kind of

3502
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:26,559
this is outside the kind of
 

3503
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,630
this is outside the kind of
physics-based models of fields and all

3504
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:28,640
physics-based models of fields and all
 

3505
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,230
physics-based models of fields and all
those kinds of things just like just

3506
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,240
those kinds of things just like just
 

3507
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,549
those kinds of things just like just
actually asking the question of like

3508
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:32,559
actually asking the question of like
 

3509
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:33,829
actually asking the question of like
what is this

3510
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:33,839
what is this
 

3511
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,069
what is this
particle content in the universe in

3512
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:36,079
particle content in the universe in
 

3513
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,390
particle content in the universe in
every cubic centimeter of the universe

3514
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:38,400
every cubic centimeter of the universe
 

3515
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,789
every cubic centimeter of the universe
outside of the 420 so you have the 420

3516
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
outside of the 420 so you have the 420
 

3517
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,870
outside of the 420 so you have the 420
420 they have they have some you know

3518
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:42,880
420 they have they have some you know
 

3519
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,710
420 they have they have some you know
they have some mass well they have

3520
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
they have some mass well they have
 

3521
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,870
they have some mass well they have
energy they don't matter photons

3522
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:46,880
energy they don't matter photons
 

3523
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,910
energy they don't matter photons
energy that's why they don't bring

3524
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:47,920
energy that's why they don't bring
 

3525
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,910
energy that's why they don't bring
suitcases you know that's true right

3526
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:49,920
suitcases you know that's true right
 

3527
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,910
suitcases you know that's true right
photons never bring suitcases with you

3528
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:51,920
photons never bring suitcases with you
 

3529
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,870
photons never bring suitcases with you
with them

3530
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
with them
 

3531
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,030
with them
because they're traveling light

3532
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,040
because they're traveling light
 

3533
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,870
because they're traveling light
see i don't even get a lesson

3534
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:56,880
see i don't even get a lesson
 

3535
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,789
see i don't even get a lesson
that's corny dad jokes okay you'll

3536
00:58:58,789 --> 00:58:58,799
that's corny dad jokes okay you'll
 

3537
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,069
that's corny dad jokes okay you'll
appreciate something

3538
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:00,079
appreciate something
 

3539
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,990
appreciate something
pretty good it's just i'm laughing on

3540
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:02,000
pretty good it's just i'm laughing on
 

3541
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,150
pretty good it's just i'm laughing on
the inside what's in the box what's the

3542
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:04,160
the inside what's in the box what's the
 

3543
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,390
the inside what's in the box what's the
420 what's between

3544
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:06,400
420 what's between
 

3545
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,470
420 what's between
the photons that's what space is that's

3546
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:08,480
the photons that's what space is that's
 

3547
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,549
the photons that's what space is that's
what the universe is expanding into okay

3548
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:10,559
what the universe is expanding into okay
 

3549
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,069
what the universe is expanding into okay
that's not so that's

3550
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:12,079
that's not so that's
 

3551
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,470
that's not so that's
that's the notebook yeah on which the

3552
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:14,480
that's the notebook yeah on which the
 

3553
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,069
that's the notebook yeah on which the
photons are written

3554
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:16,079
photons are written
 

3555
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,510
photons are written
that's beautiful but still thank you uh

3556
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:19,520
that's beautiful but still thank you uh
 

3557
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,270
that's beautiful but still thank you uh
still

3558
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
still
 

3559
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,510
still
i i i understand this but it's still

3560
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,520
i i i understand this but it's still
 

3561
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,069
i i i understand this but it's still
uncomfortable that that if the uh the

3562
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:26,079
uncomfortable that that if the uh the
 

3563
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,630
uncomfortable that that if the uh the
universe is expanding that this thing is

3564
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:28,640
universe is expanding that this thing is
 

3565
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,349
universe is expanding that this thing is
expanding the the canvas is expanding

3566
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:31,359
expanding the the canvas is expanding
 

3567
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,030
expanding the the canvas is expanding
it's very strange

3568
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040
it's very strange
 

3569
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,470
it's very strange
because like if we're just sitting there

3570
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:34,480
because like if we're just sitting there
 

3571
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,309
because like if we're just sitting there
still i guess if we're in brooklyn

3572
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:36,319
still i guess if we're in brooklyn
 

3573
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,030
still i guess if we're in brooklyn
nothing's expanding so our

3574
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
nothing's expanding so our
 

3575
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,630
nothing's expanding so our
cognition our

3576
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:40,640
cognition our
 

3577
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,230
cognition our
intuition about the world is based on

3578
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,240
intuition about the world is based on
 

3579
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,510
intuition about the world is based on
this local

3580
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,520
this local
 

3581
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,630
this local
fact that

3582
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:44,640
fact that
 

3583
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,670
fact that
we don't get to experience um

3584
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:47,680
we don't get to experience um
 

3585
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,510
we don't get to experience um
this kind of expansion

3586
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:49,520
this kind of expansion
 

3587
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,230
this kind of expansion
yeah and that intuition leads us astray

3588
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:52,240
yeah and that intuition leads us astray
 

3589
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,230
yeah and that intuition leads us astray
but you know that gravity is the weakest

3590
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:54,240
but you know that gravity is the weakest
 

3591
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,710
but you know that gravity is the weakest
of the so-called four fundamental forces

3592
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:56,720
of the so-called four fundamental forces
 

3593
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,030
of the so-called four fundamental forces
um and yet it has the longest range

3594
00:59:59,030 --> 00:59:59,040
um and yet it has the longest range
 

3595
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,109
um and yet it has the longest range
pervasiveness gravity is you know we're

3596
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:01,119
pervasiveness gravity is you know we're
 

3597
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,390
pervasiveness gravity is you know we're
being pulled towards the andromeda

3598
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,400
being pulled towards the andromeda
 

3599
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,190
being pulled towards the andromeda
galaxy at some enormous rate of speed

3600
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:05,200
galaxy at some enormous rate of speed
 

3601
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,789
galaxy at some enormous rate of speed
because of its massive counter

3602
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:06,799
because of its massive counter
 

3603
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,150
because of its massive counter
gravitational force to the force we

3604
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:08,160
gravitational force to the force we
 

3605
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,270
gravitational force to the force we
exert on it uh so gravity is enormously

3606
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:11,280
exert on it uh so gravity is enormously
 

3607
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,589
exert on it uh so gravity is enormously
long range but incredibly weak

3608
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:13,599
long range but incredibly weak
 

3609
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,630
long range but incredibly weak
and because of that uh we can think

3610
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
and because of that uh we can think
 

3611
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,190
and because of that uh we can think
about these effects of expansion as the

3612
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
about these effects of expansion as the
 

3613
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,750
about these effects of expansion as the
relationship between the

3614
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
relationship between the
 

3615
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,990
relationship between the
as you said the no the grid lines on the

3616
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:24,000
as you said the no the grid lines on the
 

3617
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,430
as you said the no the grid lines on the
notebook right

3618
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
notebook right
 

3619
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,630
notebook right
gravity is a manifestation of the

3620
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:28,640
gravity is a manifestation of the
 

3621
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,109
gravity is a manifestation of the
interrelationship between those points

3622
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:31,119
interrelationship between those points
 

3623
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,109
interrelationship between those points
how far they are from each other and

3624
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:33,119
how far they are from each other and
 

3625
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,270
how far they are from each other and
those can change those point distances

3626
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
those can change those point distances
 

3627
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,750
those can change those point distances
can change over time because of the

3628
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:37,760
can change over time because of the
 

3629
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,630
can change over time because of the
force of gravity so it's weak and

3630
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
force of gravity so it's weak and
 

3631
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,950
force of gravity so it's weak and
what we experience is gravity

3632
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:42,960
what we experience is gravity
 

3633
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,150
what we experience is gravity
is the

3634
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:44,160
is the
 

3635
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,549
is the
um changing of those trajectories from

3636
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:46,559
um changing of those trajectories from
 

3637
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,870
um changing of those trajectories from
being rectilinear to curvilinear that's

3638
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:48,880
being rectilinear to curvilinear that's
 

3639
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,190
being rectilinear to curvilinear that's
what we experience is gravity well you

3640
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:51,200
what we experience is gravity well you
 

3641
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,630
what we experience is gravity well you
have this analogy when you talk to barry

3642
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:52,640
have this analogy when you talk to barry
 

3643
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,309
have this analogy when you talk to barry
barish about bowling ball and a

3644
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:54,319
barish about bowling ball and a
 

3645
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,950
barish about bowling ball and a
trampoline and uh that's almost right uh

3646
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:56,960
trampoline and uh that's almost right uh
 

3647
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,990
trampoline and uh that's almost right uh
because it's actually you have to

3648
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:58,000
because it's actually you have to
 

3649
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,990
because it's actually you have to
visualize that now in four dimensions

3650
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
visualize that now in four dimensions
 

3651
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,670
visualize that now in four dimensions
like wrapping a trampoline at every

3652
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
like wrapping a trampoline at every
 

3653
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,910
like wrapping a trampoline at every
point around the object including on the

3654
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:03,920
point around the object including on the
 

3655
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,589
point around the object including on the
sides and it becomes very hard to

3656
01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:05,599
sides and it becomes very hard to
 

3657
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:07,910
sides and it becomes very hard to
visualize so a lot of people use that um

3658
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
visualize so a lot of people use that um
 

3659
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,750
visualize so a lot of people use that um
it's also fraught analogy because you're

3660
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:09,760
it's also fraught analogy because you're
 

3661
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,230
it's also fraught analogy because you're
using gravity like the notion of gravity

3662
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
using gravity like the notion of gravity
 

3663
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,150
using gravity like the notion of gravity
pulling something down to explain the

3664
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
pulling something down to explain the
 

3665
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,910
pulling something down to explain the
notion of gravity so it's a little

3666
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:15,920
notion of gravity so it's a little
 

3667
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,150
notion of gravity so it's a little
overburdening the analogy

3668
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:18,160
overburdening the analogy
 

3669
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,910
overburdening the analogy
but okay so you mentioned barry bearish

3670
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:19,920
but okay so you mentioned barry bearish
 

3671
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,470
but okay so you mentioned barry bearish
wrote the forward to your book yeah

3672
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:22,480
wrote the forward to your book yeah
 

3673
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,230
wrote the forward to your book yeah
how do gravitational waves fit into all

3674
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:24,240
how do gravitational waves fit into all
 

3675
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,309
how do gravitational waves fit into all
this how how do they on the emotional

3676
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:26,319
this how how do they on the emotional
 

3677
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,670
this how how do they on the emotional
level how do they make you feel that

3678
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,680
level how do they make you feel that
 

3679
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,870
level how do they make you feel that
they're just uh moving space time

3680
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:30,880
they're just uh moving space time
 

3681
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,109
they're just uh moving space time
yeah so gravitational waves were the

3682
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:33,119
yeah so gravitational waves were the
 

3683
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,950
yeah so gravitational waves were the
nobel prize for gravitational waves

3684
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
nobel prize for gravitational waves
 

3685
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,630
nobel prize for gravitational waves
discovery the first time you know it's

3686
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:36,640
discovery the first time you know it's
 

3687
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,030
discovery the first time you know it's
this this was discovered twice

3688
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:39,040
this this was discovered twice
 

3689
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,549
this this was discovered twice
indirectly by two uh men uh uh named

3690

3693
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,549
halsen taylor and that was given my
first year of graduate school the ia i

3694
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:46,559
first year of graduate school the ia i
 

3695
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,230
first year of graduate school the ia i
entered graduate school almost they they

3696
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
entered graduate school almost they they
 

3697
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,990
entered graduate school almost they they
announced these two guys one and the guy

3698
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,000
announced these two guys one and the guy
 

3699
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,510
announced these two guys one and the guy
who won it did the work that would later

who won it did the work that would later
 

3701

win him the nobel prize when he was my

3702
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:53,119
win him the nobel prize when he was my
 

3703

01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,870
i got it i got it you know to a
cosmologist age it means nothing um and

firecracker let's say there's a
firecracker and you want to see if it

3778
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:14,640
firecracker and you want to see if it
 

3779
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,150
firecracker and you want to see if it
went off in the building next door to

3780
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:16,160
went off in the building next door to
 

3781
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,549
went off in the building next door to
you you can't see it so you can't see

3782
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:18,559
you you can't see it so you can't see
 

3783
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,950
you you can't see it so you can't see
the imprint of it but you can hear it

3784
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:20,960
the imprint of it but you can hear it
 

3785
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,950
the imprint of it but you can hear it
and what we're trying to do is hear the

3786
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
and what we're trying to do is hear the
 

3787
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,710
and what we're trying to do is hear the
effect of gravitational waves from the

3788
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:24,720
effect of gravitational waves from the
 

3789
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,230
effect of gravitational waves from the
big bang not by using a camera or even

3790
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,240
big bang not by using a camera or even
 

3791
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,549
big bang not by using a camera or even
an interferometer like barry used and

3792
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:30,559
an interferometer like barry used and
 

3793
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,549
an interferometer like barry used and
his colleagues but instead using the cmb

3794
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:34,559
his colleagues but instead using the cmb
 

3795
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,789
his colleagues but instead using the cmb
the light the primordial ancient fossils

3796
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:36,799
the light the primordial ancient fossils
 

3797
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,630
the light the primordial ancient fossils
of the universe the oldest light in the

3798
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:38,640
of the universe the oldest light in the
 

3799
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,029
of the universe the oldest light in the
universe we're going to use that as a

01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:41,039
universe we're going to use that as a
 

3801
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,870

onto which gravitational waves get
 

3805
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,910
onto which gravitational waves get
exposed

3806
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:45,920
exposed
 

3807
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,750
exposed
and hope you can uh so what are the

3808
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:47,760
and hope you can uh so what are the
 

3809
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,589
and hope you can uh so what are the
challenges there to get enough accuracy

3810
01:03:49,589 --> 01:03:49,599
challenges there to get enough accuracy
 

3811
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,789
challenges there to get enough accuracy
to to for the exposure so the the signal

3812
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:52,799
to to for the exposure so the the signal
 

3813
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,190
to to for the exposure so the the signal
as i said it's um so there's 420 of

3814
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,200
as i said it's um so there's 420 of
 

3815
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,789
as i said it's um so there's 420 of
these photons per cubic centimeter and

3816
01:03:56,789 --> 01:03:56,799
these photons per cubic centimeter and
 

3817
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,309
these photons per cubic centimeter and
there's a lot of cubic centimeters in

3818
01:03:58,309 --> 01:03:58,319
there's a lot of cubic centimeters in
 

3819
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,390
there's a lot of cubic centimeters in
the universe however what we're looking

3820
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400
the universe however what we're looking
 

3821
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,349
the universe however what we're looking
for is not the brightness of the photon

3822
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:03,359
for is not the brightness of the photon
 

3823
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,510
for is not the brightness of the photon
how intense it is we're not looking for

3824
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
how intense it is we're not looking for
 

3825
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,510
how intense it is we're not looking for
its color what wavelength it is we're

3826
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:07,520
its color what wavelength it is we're
 

3827
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,069
its color what wavelength it is we're
looking for what its polarization is

3828
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:10,079
looking for what its polarization is
 

3829
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,910
looking for what its polarization is
and we'll go let me just ask are you

3830
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:11,920
and we'll go let me just ask are you
 

3831
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,750
and we'll go let me just ask are you
serious about the per cubic millimeter

3832
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:13,760
serious about the per cubic millimeter
 

3833
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,990
serious about the per cubic millimeter
of 420 is the number centimeter

3834
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,000
of 420 is the number centimeter
 

3835
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,270
of 420 is the number centimeter
but uh uh cubic centimeter 420 is the

3836
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:19,280
but uh uh cubic centimeter 420 is the
 

3837
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,069
but uh uh cubic centimeter 420 is the
number

3838
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:20,079
number
 

3839
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,990
number
uh i wonder if elon knows this and if he

3840
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,000
uh i wonder if elon knows this and if he
 

3841
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,430
uh i wonder if elon knows this and if he
doesn't he will truly enjoy this

3842
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440

 

3843
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,150

yeah that's true oh okay funding

3844
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:28,160
yeah that's true oh okay funding
 

3845
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,510
yeah that's true oh okay funding
security excellent

3846
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
security excellent
 

3847
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,109
security excellent
um so i mean this takes us to this story

3848
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:33,119
um so i mean this takes us to this story
 

3849
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,670
um so i mean this takes us to this story
of heartbreak of triumph

3850
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:35,680
of heartbreak of triumph
 

3851
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,510
of heartbreak of triumph
of uh that you described and losing the

3852
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
of uh that you described and losing the
 

3853
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,230
of uh that you described and losing the
nobel prize so describe what uh

3854
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:40,240
nobel prize so describe what uh
 

3855
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,150
nobel prize so describe what uh
polarization is that you mentioned yeah

3856
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,160
polarization is that you mentioned yeah
 

3857
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,309
polarization is that you mentioned yeah
you can describe what bicep one and

3858
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:44,319
you can describe what bicep one and
 

3859
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,910
you can describe what bicep one and
bicep two are

3860
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:45,920
bicep two are
 

3861
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,430
bicep two are
bicep three

3862
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,440
bicep three
 

3863
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,510
bicep three
perhaps the instruments that uh can

3864
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:49,520
perhaps the instruments that uh can
 

3865
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,430
perhaps the instruments that uh can
detect this kind of polarization what

3866
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
detect this kind of polarization what
 

3867
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,029
detect this kind of polarization what
are the challenges

3868
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:53,039
are the challenges
 

3869
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,870
are the challenges
the the origin story the whole thing

3870
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
the the origin story the whole thing
 

3871
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,190
the the origin story the whole thing
yeah so well the origin story goes back

3872
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,200
yeah so well the origin story goes back
 

3873
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,349
yeah so well the origin story goes back
again to like a father-son rivalry it

3874
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,359
again to like a father-son rivalry it
 

3875
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,190
again to like a father-son rivalry it
really does my father won all these

3876
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:01,200
really does my father won all these
 

3877
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,870
really does my father won all these
prizes awards etc but he never won a

3878
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:02,880
prizes awards etc but he never won a
 

3879
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,270
prizes awards etc but he never won a
nobel prize and you know some parents in

3880
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:05,280
nobel prize and you know some parents in
 

3881
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,510
nobel prize and you know some parents in
america they compete with their kids you

3882
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:07,520
america they compete with their kids you
 

3883
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,190
america they compete with their kids you
know oh i was a football player in high

3884
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:09,200
know oh i was a football player in high
 

3885
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,630
know oh i was a football player in high
school i'll show you and whatever

3886
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:10,640
school i'll show you and whatever
 

3887
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,150
school i'll show you and whatever
wrestling whatever and some of us could

3888
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
wrestling whatever and some of us could
 

3889
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,549
wrestling whatever and some of us could
be healthy too um but

3890
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:14,559
be healthy too um but
 

3891
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,630
be healthy too um but
um with me and my dad it wasn't super

3892
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:16,640
um with me and my dad it wasn't super
 

3893
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,349
um with me and my dad it wasn't super
healthy like we would compete and and

3894
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:19,359
healthy like we would compete and and
 

3895
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,710
healthy like we would compete and and
you know he was much more of a pure

3896
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:20,720
you know he was much more of a pure
 

3897
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,470
you know he was much more of a pure
mathematician and i was an experimental

3898
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:22,480
mathematician and i was an experimental
 

3899
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,950
mathematician and i was an experimental
physicist so we had both different ideas

3900
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
physicist so we had both different ideas
 

3901
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,670
physicist so we had both different ideas
and what was worth prioritizing our time

3902
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:27,680
and what was worth prioritizing our time
 

3903
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,789
and what was worth prioritizing our time
but i knew for sure he didn't win the

3904
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
but i knew for sure he didn't win the
 

3905
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,109
but i knew for sure he didn't win the
nobel prize and i knew i could kind of

3906
01:05:31,109 --> 01:05:31,119
nobel prize and i knew i could kind of
 

3907
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,829
nobel prize and i knew i could kind of
out do him so i feel pretty venal and

3908
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:33,839
out do him so i feel pretty venal and
 

3909
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,910
out do him so i feel pretty venal and
kind of you know minuscule kind of

3910
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:35,920
kind of you know minuscule kind of
 

3911
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,190
kind of you know minuscule kind of
character wise

3912
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,200
character wise
 

3913
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,789
character wise
the only reason you could outdo him is

3914
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:38,799
the only reason you could outdo him is
 

3915
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,549
the only reason you could outdo him is
because the fields medal is given every

3916
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:40,559
because the fields medal is given every
 

3917
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,789
because the fields medal is given every
four years and only if you're under 40

3918
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:42,799
four years and only if you're under 40
 

3919
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,789
four years and only if you're under 40
which he wasn't so he's working under

3920
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:44,799
which he wasn't so he's working under
 

3921
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,430
which he wasn't so he's working under
much more limited conditions

3922
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:47,440
much more limited conditions
 

3923
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,670
much more limited conditions
that's right so even if i had which you

3924
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:49,680
that's right so even if i had which you
 

3925
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,109
that's right so even if i had which you
know spoiler alert the book's called

3926
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:51,119
know spoiler alert the book's called
 

3927
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,029
know spoiler alert the book's called
losing the nobel prize so i didn't do it

3928
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:53,039
losing the nobel prize so i didn't do it
 

3929
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,029
losing the nobel prize so i didn't do it
um but i wanted to do something big and

3930
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:55,039
um but i wanted to do something big and
 

3931
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,589
um but i wanted to do something big and
i wanted to do something uh that would

01:05:57,589 --> 01:05:57,599
i wanted to do something uh that would

01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:03,680
it was when we made the premature
 

3939
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,670
it was when we made the premature
announcement that we had been successful

3940
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:05,680
announcement that we had been successful
 

3941
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,829

so you were from the beginning

3942
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:07,839
so you were from the beginning
 

3943
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,470
so you were from the beginning
reaching for the big questions that's

3944
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:10,480
reaching for the big questions that's
 

3945
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,470
reaching for the big questions that's
all i can so as an experimenter you were

3946
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:12,480
all i can so as an experimenter you were
 

3947
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,150
all i can so as an experimenter you were

that's all i wanted to do i felt like uh

3950
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:17,200
that's all i wanted to do i felt like uh
 

3951
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,430
that's all i wanted to do i felt like uh
if it's not you know if it's if it's

01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:19,440
if it's not you know if it's if it's
 

3953
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,589
if it's not you know if it's if it's
worth spending you know perhaps the rest

3954
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:21,599
worth spending you know perhaps the rest
 

3955
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,150

of my life on as assigned as a scientist

3956
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,160
of my life on as assigned as a scientist
 

3957
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,589
of my life on as assigned as a scientist
it better be damn well better be

3958
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:25,599
it better be damn well better be
 

3959
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,510
it better be damn well better be
interesting to me to carry me through to

always say passion is great when people

3964
01:06:31,109 --> 01:06:31,119
always say passion is great when people
 

3965
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,190
always say passion is great when people
say oh follow your passion but it's not

3966
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:33,200
say oh follow your passion but it's not
 

3967
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,870
say oh follow your passion but it's not
enough passion is like the spark that

3968
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:34,880
enough passion is like the spark that
 

3969
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,549
enough passion is like the spark that
ignites the rocket but that's not enough

3970
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:36,559
ignites the rocket but that's not enough
 

3971
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,589
ignites the rocket but that's not enough
to get the rocket into space so then

3972
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
to get the rocket into space so then
 

3973
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,670
to get the rocket into space so then
you swung for the fences with bicep one

3974
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:41,680
you swung for the fences with bicep one
 

3975
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,150
you swung for the fences with bicep one
what is this so bicep one was born out

3976
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:44,160
what is this so bicep one was born out
 

3977
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,390
what is this so bicep one was born out
of um kind of interesting circumstances

3978
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:46,400
of um kind of interesting circumstances
 

3979
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,029
of um kind of interesting circumstances
so i had gone to a stanford university

3980
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:49,039
so i had gone to a stanford university
 

3981
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,029
so i had gone to a stanford university
for a postdoc so an academic hunger

3982
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:51,039
for a postdoc so an academic hunger
 

3983
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:54,470

it's this uh small little school it's

3986

it's this uh small little school it's
 

3987
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,390
it's this uh small little school it's
it's not like that technical college in

experiments and that was uh difficult to
 

4119
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,390
experiments and that was uh difficult to
work with on a small scale for like a

now and he had been involved in

4204
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:34,719
now and he had been involved in

experiment that actually measured the

4206
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,080
experiment that actually measured the
 

4207
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,750
experiment that actually measured the
universe was flat

4208
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:37,760
universe was flat
 

4209
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,990
universe was flat
very close to flat um along with a

4210
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:40,000
very close to flat um along with a
 

4211
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,590
very close to flat um along with a
preceding experiment done at princeton

4212
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:41,600
preceding experiment done at princeton
 

4213
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,430
preceding experiment done at princeton
by lyman page and other collaborators so

4214
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,440
by lyman page and other collaborators so
 

4215
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,270
by lyman page and other collaborators so
the shape of the universe is flat the

4216
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:45,280
the shape of the universe is flat the
 

4217
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,669
the shape of the universe is flat the
geometry of the universe is flat

4218
01:10:47,669 --> 01:10:47,679
geometry of the universe is flat
 

4219
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,910

how did he do that experiment so he used

4220
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:49,920
how did he do that experiment so he used
 

4221
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,550
how did he do that experiment so he used
the cosmic microwave background and so

4222
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
the cosmic microwave background and so
 

4223
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,910
the cosmic microwave background and so
what i said is you have to look for

4224
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:53,920
what i said is you have to look for
 

4225
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,590
what i said is you have to look for
triangles in the universe so you can

4226
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:55,600
triangles in the universe so you can
 

4227
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,430
triangles in the universe so you can
measure triangles on earth you can

4228
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:57,440
measure triangles on earth you can
 

4229
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,189
measure triangles on earth you can
actually it's hard to show that the

4230
01:10:59,189 --> 01:10:59,199
actually it's hard to show that the
 

4231
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,310
actually it's hard to show that the
earth is curved but you can show the

4232
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,320
earth is curved but you can show the
 

4233
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,910
earth is curved but you can show the
earth is curved using triangles

4234
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:01,920
earth is curved using triangles
 

4235
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,510
earth is curved using triangles
mountaintops etc if you have an accurate

4236
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:03,520
mountaintops etc if you have an accurate
 

4237
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,430
mountaintops etc if you have an accurate
enough protractor allegedly yeah yeah

4238
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
enough protractor allegedly yeah yeah
 

4239
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,750
enough protractor allegedly yeah yeah
god you you're like auto cancelling this

01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,510
of the the one over the square root of
the number of measurements but the

the number of measurements but the
 

4405
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,590
the number of measurements but the
square root of 44 000 is pretty big so

4406
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:55,600
square root of 44 000 is pretty big so
 

4407
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,030
square root of 44 000 is pretty big so
they were able to get a very accurate

they did it they also have to do a
 

4413
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,669
they did it they also have to do a

us a check and said get started on this

4488
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
us a check and said get started on this
 

4489
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,470
us a check and said get started on this
idea and so we started coming with the

4490
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:16,480
idea and so we started coming with the
 

4491
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,189
idea and so we started coming with the
idea for what i later named bicep by

polarization which is kind of ironic
 

4497
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,430
polarization which is kind of ironic
because we ended up measuring galactic

4498
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:25,440
because we ended up measuring galactic
 

4499
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,630
because we ended up measuring galactic
polarization we'll get to that in a

4500
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:26,640
polarization we'll get to that in a
 

4501
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,590
polarization we'll get to that in a
minute um but along the way the idea was

4502
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:29,600
minute um but along the way the idea was
 

4503
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,790
minute um but along the way the idea was
very simple we're going to make the

4504
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:30,800
very simple we're going to make the
 

4505
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,870
very simple we're going to make the
simplest telescope you can possibly make

which is a refracting telescope your
 

4509
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,030
which is a refracting telescope your
eyes you have two refracting telescopes

is making things more complex right and

4514
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:41,679
is making things more complex right and
 

4515
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,110
is making things more complex right and
when you make things complex in science

4516
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,120
when you make things complex in science
 

4517
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,030
when you make things complex in science
you introduce the possibility for

4518
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
you introduce the possibility for
 

4519
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,030
you introduce the possibility for
systematic errors and so we want to

4520
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:47,040
systematic errors and so we want to
 

4521
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,550
systematic errors and so we want to
build the cleanest instrument turns out

itself which is the coolest temperature
 

4539
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,510
itself which is the coolest temperature
in the whole universe so we had to cool

4540
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:07,520
in the whole universe so we had to cool
 

4541
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,070
in the whole universe so we had to cool
these down to about 0.1 or 0.2 degrees

to do that we need to put it inside of a
 

4547
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,590
to do that we need to put it inside of a
huge vacuum chamber and suck out all the

premier places on earth of course you'd

4638
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:46,800

like to go into space there's no water

4640
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,080
like to go into space there's no water
 

4641
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,750
like to go into space there's no water
in space so it's not about

4642
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:49,760
in space so it's not about
 

4643
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,910
in space so it's not about
um it's not about cold it's about dry

4644
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:51,920
um it's not about cold it's about dry
 

4645
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,030
um it's not about cold it's about dry
exactly so that's why for example you

4646
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:55,040
exactly so that's why for example you
 

4647
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,070
exactly so that's why for example you
can take this uh vodka and you could put

4648
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:58,080
can take this uh vodka and you could put
 

4649
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,669
can take this uh vodka and you could put
it in this cup right and we could take

4650
01:17:59,669 --> 01:17:59,679
it in this cup right and we could take
 

4651
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,350
it in this cup right and we could take
it over to a microwave somewhere and

4652
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:01,360
it over to a microwave somewhere and
 

4653
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,870
it over to a microwave somewhere and
heat it up

4654
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:02,880
heat it up
 

4655
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,550
heat it up
after two minutes the water's three

4656
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
after two minutes the water's three
 

4657
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,070
after two minutes the water's three
minutes the water's boiling you can't

4658
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:06,080
minutes the water's boiling you can't
 

4659
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,750
minutes the water's boiling you can't
touch it take it from me don't touch it

4660
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
touch it take it from me don't touch it
 

4661
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,030
touch it take it from me don't touch it
but you can touch the mug and take it

4662
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:09,040
but you can touch the mug and take it
 

4663
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,950
but you can touch the mug and take it
out if you want to right why because the

4664
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:10,960
out if you want to right why because the
 

4665
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,189
out if you want to right why because the
mug is totally bone dry but the

4666
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
mug is totally bone dry but the
 

4667
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,630
mug is totally bone dry but the
microwaves get absorbed by the water

4668
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:14,640
microwaves get absorbed by the water
 

4669
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,310
microwaves get absorbed by the water
molecules because water molecules

4670
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:16,320
molecules because water molecules
 

4671
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,070
molecules because water molecules
resonate exactly at these microwave

4672
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:18,080
resonate exactly at these microwave
 

4673
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,830
resonate exactly at these microwave
frequencies so we don't want these

4674
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:19,840
frequencies so we don't want these
 

4675
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,510
frequencies so we don't want these

01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,510
get absorbed in some water molecule in
the earth's atmosphere so you take it to

01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:29,520
the earth's atmosphere so you take it to
 

4685
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,790
the earth's atmosphere so you take it to

01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:09,600
your wisdom teeth they yank them before
 

4723
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,189
your wisdom teeth they yank them before
you go down there

4724
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
you go down there
 

4725
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,310
you go down there

if you have any issues with your
appendix they'll cut it out of you

4728
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:13,600
appendix they'll cut it out of you
 

4729
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,430
appendix they'll cut it out of you
before you go down there the russians at

01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:15,440
before you go down there the russians at
 

4731
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,910

01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:20,000
miles away the doctors there there's a
 

4735
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,430
miles away the doctors there there's a
famous picture of one of them operating

01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:21,440
famous picture of one of them operating
 

4737
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,870
famous picture of one of them operating

and we go to those great lengths because

4748
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:32,800
and we go to those great lengths because
 

4749
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,630

it's a pristine environment to observe
 

4751
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,430
it's a pristine environment to observe
these precious photons and we built this

4752
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:37,440
these precious photons and we built this
 

4753
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,270
these precious photons and we built this
telescope and it weighs you know tens of

4754
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:39,280
telescope and it weighs you know tens of
 

4755
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,310
telescope and it weighs you know tens of
thousands of pounds and it had to scan

4756
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,320
thousands of pounds and it had to scan
 

4757
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,709
thousands of pounds and it had to scan
the sky almost like it's a robot i mean

4758
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
the sky almost like it's a robot i mean
 

4759
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,030
the sky almost like it's a robot i mean
it's scanning the sky almost unattended

4760
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:47,040
it's scanning the sky almost unattended
 

4761
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,350
it's scanning the sky almost unattended
it needed uh that we have a guy who

4762
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:49,360
it needed uh that we have a guy who
 

4763
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,870
it needed uh that we have a guy who
spends a year of his life down there a

4764
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:50,880
spends a year of his life down there a
 

4765
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,149
spends a year of his life down there a
girl who spends a year of their life

4766
01:19:52,149 --> 01:19:52,159
girl who spends a year of their life
 

4767
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,149
girl who spends a year of their life
down there they're called winter overs

4768
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:54,159
down there they're called winter overs
 

4769
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,229
down there they're called winter overs
they arrive in sometimes as early as

4770
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
they arrive in sometimes as early as
 

4771
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:57,669
they arrive in sometimes as early as
november and they don't leave until the

4772
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:57,679
november and they don't leave until the
 

4773
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,630
november and they don't leave until the
following december and we always joke

4774
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:00,640
following december and we always joke
 

4775
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,110
following december and we always joke
we'll pay you 75 000 you just have to

4776
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:03,120
we'll pay you 75 000 you just have to
 

4777
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,550
we'll pay you 75 000 you just have to
work for one night of your life that's

4778
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:04,560
work for one night of your life that's
 

4779
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,070
work for one night of your life that's
that's all but

4780
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,080
that's all but
 

4781
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,750
that's all but
it's a long night

4782
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:07,760
it's a long night
 

4783
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,550
it's a long night
and what bicep is and uh i couldn't

4784
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
and what bicep is and uh i couldn't
 

4785
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,550
and what bicep is and uh i couldn't
bring my my polarized sunglasses here so

4786
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:12,560
bring my my polarized sunglasses here so
 

4787
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,390
bring my my polarized sunglasses here so
i brought these actual polarizers here

4788
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:14,400
i brought these actual polarizers here
 

4789
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,390
i brought these actual polarizers here
so if you take this and put in front of

4790
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:16,400
so if you take this and put in front of
 

4791
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,030
so if you take this and put in front of
your telescope there

4792
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:19,040
your telescope there
 

4793
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,270
your telescope there
you have now made a polarimeter you've

4794
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:21,280
you have now made a polarimeter you've
 

4795
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,910
you have now made a polarimeter you've
made a polarization sensitive telescope

4796
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:23,920
made a polarization sensitive telescope
 

4797
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,910
made a polarization sensitive telescope
now you may not be able to immediately

4798
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:25,920
now you may not be able to immediately
 

4799
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,070
now you may not be able to immediately
know how you would use such a thing but

4800
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,080
know how you would use such a thing but
 

4801
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,310
know how you would use such a thing but
one way to think about now take this guy

4802
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320
one way to think about now take this guy
 

4803
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,870
one way to think about now take this guy
and look at a light look at a light

4804
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:32,880
and look at a light look at a light
 

4805
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,950
and look at a light look at a light
source put one up to your eye and now

4806
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:34,960
source put one up to your eye and now
 

4807
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,270
source put one up to your eye and now
put the other one in front of it

4808
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:37,280
put the other one in front of it
 

4809
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,750
put the other one in front of it
anywhere and now rotate them

4810
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:39,760
anywhere and now rotate them
 

4811
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,229
anywhere and now rotate them
what happens to the light source

4812
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:42,239
what happens to the light source
 

4813
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,390
what happens to the light source
it becomes brighter and dimmer and

4814
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:44,400
it becomes brighter and dimmer and
 

4815
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,229
it becomes brighter and dimmer and
brighter and dimmer yeah so it's called

4816
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:46,239
brighter and dimmer yeah so it's called
 

4817
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,390
brighter and dimmer yeah so it's called
a quadrupolar pattern right so it's

4818
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,400
a quadrupolar pattern right so it's
 

4819
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,790
a quadrupolar pattern right so it's
repeating it goes bright dim bright dim

4820
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:50,800
repeating it goes bright dim bright dim
 

4821
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:51,590
repeating it goes bright dim bright dim
uh

4822
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:51,600
uh
 

4823
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,310
uh
it double rotates twice in intensity for

4824
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:54,320
it double rotates twice in intensity for
 

4825
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,950
it double rotates twice in intensity for
every single physical rotation

4826
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:56,960
every single physical rotation
 

4827
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:57,990
every single physical rotation
and that's because of the property of

4828
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
and that's because of the property of
 

4829
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,070
and that's because of the property of
the photon the photon is a spin one

4830
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:00,080
the photon the photon is a spin one
 

4831
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,510
the photon the photon is a spin one
field but the polarization of light

4832
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:03,520
field but the polarization of light
 

4833
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,590
field but the polarization of light
is it's the axis at which its electric

4834
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600
is it's the axis at which its electric
 

4835
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,070
is it's the axis at which its electric
field is oscillating its electric field

4836
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
field is oscillating its electric field
 

4837
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,590
field is oscillating its electric field
is marching straight up and straight

4838
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:09,600
is marching straight up and straight
 

4839
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,350
is marching straight up and straight
down and so therefore vertical

4840
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:11,360
down and so therefore vertical
 

4841
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,189
down and so therefore vertical
polarization is the same as

4842
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
polarization is the same as
 

4843
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,189
polarization is the same as
negative vertical polarization and so

4844
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
negative vertical polarization and so
 

4845
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,950
negative vertical polarization and so
you get the same pattern as you rotate

4846
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:16,960
you get the same pattern as you rotate
 

4847
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,470
you get the same pattern as you rotate
two times for every one physical

4848
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:18,480
two times for every one physical
 

4849
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,910
two times for every one physical
rotation so it's like a spin a spin two

4850
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:21,920
rotation so it's like a spin a spin two
 

4851
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,830
rotation so it's like a spin a spin two
object so now if you put that in front

4852
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,840
object so now if you put that in front
 

4853
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,070
object so now if you put that in front
of the telescope

4854
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
of the telescope
 

4855
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,750
of the telescope
you can do one of two things now you're

4856
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:27,760
you can do one of two things now you're
 

4857
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,750
you can do one of two things now you're
polarizing all the light that's going in

4858
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:29,760
polarizing all the light that's going in
 

4859
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,430
polarizing all the light that's going in
because you have one of the polarizers

4860
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:31,440
because you have one of the polarizers
 

4861
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,870
because you have one of the polarizers
and then you can analyze it as you

4862
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:32,880
and then you can analyze it as you
 

4863
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,709
and then you can analyze it as you
rotate the other one you can analyze it

4864
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:34,719
rotate the other one you can analyze it
 

4865
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,870
rotate the other one you can analyze it
and change the amount of polarization

4866
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:36,880
and change the amount of polarization
 

4867
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,790
and change the amount of polarization
or you can put this kind of very special

4868
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
or you can put this kind of very special
 

4869
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,790
or you can put this kind of very special
crystal in here there's a crystal it's

4870
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:40,800
crystal in here there's a crystal it's
 

4871
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,270
crystal in here there's a crystal it's
called calcite this is from lex luthor

4872
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:43,280
called calcite this is from lex luthor
 

4873
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,790
called calcite this is from lex luthor
not lex friedman

4874
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:44,800
not lex friedman
 

4875
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,790
not lex friedman
this crystal put it on top of your

4876
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:46,800
this crystal put it on top of your
 

4877
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,790
this crystal put it on top of your
printed notes there and tell me what

4878
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:48,800
printed notes there and tell me what
 

4879
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,709
printed notes there and tell me what
does it look like

4880
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:50,719
does it look like
 

4881
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,629
does it look like
there's uh

4882
01:21:54,629 --> 01:21:54,639

 

4883
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,470

like i could see everything twice it's a

4884
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:56,480
like i could see everything twice it's a
 

4885
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,629
like i could see everything twice it's a
double image it's a double image that is

4886
01:21:58,629 --> 01:21:58,639
double image it's a double image that is
 

4887
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,390
double image it's a double image that is
a special crystal that has two different

4888
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400
a special crystal that has two different
 

4889
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,470
a special crystal that has two different
indices of refraction

4890
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:02,480
indices of refraction
 

4891
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,790
indices of refraction
so light emerging which is unpolarized

4892
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:04,800
so light emerging which is unpolarized
 

4893
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,110
so light emerging which is unpolarized
from the black ink comes out

4894
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:07,120
from the black ink comes out
 

4895
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,709
from the black ink comes out
and it splits into two different

4896
01:22:08,709 --> 01:22:08,719
and it splits into two different
 

4897
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,030
and it splits into two different
directions and it could split even more

4898
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:11,040
directions and it could split even more
 

4899
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,870
directions and it could split even more
if i made the crystal give you my more

4900
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:12,880
if i made the crystal give you my more
 

4901
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,229
if i made the crystal give you my more
expensive crystal but that's all i have

4902
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:14,239
expensive crystal but that's all i have
 

4903
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,350
expensive crystal but that's all i have
what is the crystal with this kind of

4904
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,360
what is the crystal with this kind of
 

4905
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,430
what is the crystal with this kind of
property called it's called calcite this

4906
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:17,440
property called it's called calcite this
 

4907
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,350
property called it's called calcite this
is crystal it's called birefringent

4908
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,360
is crystal it's called birefringent
 

4909
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,070
is crystal it's called birefringent
crystal bi means two refrigerant means

4910
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:22,080
crystal bi means two refrigerant means
 

4911
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,470
crystal bi means two refrigerant means
refracting so this is a special type of

4912
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,480
refracting so this is a special type of
 

4913
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,149
refracting so this is a special type of
material that

4914
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:26,159
material that
 

4915
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,430
material that
separates light based on its

4916
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:27,440
separates light based on its
 

4917
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,229
separates light based on its
polarization pretty clean

4918
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:30,239
polarization pretty clean
 

4919
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,430
polarization pretty clean
by signal yeah it's it's cleanly

4920
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:33,440
by signal yeah it's it's cleanly
 

4921
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,390
by signal yeah it's it's cleanly
too

4922
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:34,400
too
 

4923
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,629
too
yeah see i'm seeing two very cleanly

4924
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:36,639
yeah see i'm seeing two very cleanly
 

4925
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:37,990
yeah see i'm seeing two very cleanly
it's very crisp right so that's that's

4926
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:38,000
it's very crisp right so that's that's
 

4927
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,430
it's very crisp right so that's that's
yours to keep with every time you host

4928
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:39,440
yours to keep with every time you host
 

4929
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,910
yours to keep with every time you host
me now take the polarizer underneath

4930
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:41,920
me now take the polarizer underneath
 

4931
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,709
me now take the polarizer underneath
your left hand uh yep put it on top of

4932
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
your left hand uh yep put it on top of
 

4933
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,390
your left hand uh yep put it on top of
the crystal

4934
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:46,400
the crystal
 

4935
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,189
the crystal
and kind of move it back and forth wow

4936
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:49,199
and kind of move it back and forth wow
 

4937
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,669
and kind of move it back and forth wow
this is incredible you can switch as you

4938
01:22:51,669 --> 01:22:51,679
this is incredible you can switch as you
 

4939
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,310
this is incredible you can switch as you
rotate you switch from one

4940
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:54,320
rotate you switch from one
 

4941
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,310
rotate you switch from one
uh signal to the other so it's one of

4942
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:56,320
uh signal to the other so it's one of
 

4943
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,629
uh signal to the other so it's one of
the refractions to the other

4944
01:22:58,629 --> 01:22:58,639
the refractions to the other
 

4945
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,350
the refractions to the other
whoa so that is now you are analyzing

4946
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:01,360
whoa so that is now you are analyzing
 

4947
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,669
whoa so that is now you are analyzing
the polarization you are confirming the

4948
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:03,679
the polarization you are confirming the
 

4949
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,189
the polarization you are confirming the
light comes out of the crystal two

4950
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:05,199
light comes out of the crystal two
 

4951
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,030
light comes out of the crystal two
different types of polarization

4952
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:07,040
different types of polarization
 

4953
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,070
different types of polarization
and effectively what we do is we have

4954
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
and effectively what we do is we have
 

4955
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,629
and effectively what we do is we have
those two things if you like but working

4956
01:23:12,629 --> 01:23:12,639
those two things if you like but working
 

4957
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,629
those two things if you like but working
in the microwave so our detect that's

4958
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:14,639
in the microwave so our detect that's
 

4959
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,070
in the microwave so our detect that's
where this the cosmic photons are

4960
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:16,080
where this the cosmic photons are
 

4961
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,070
where this the cosmic photons are
brightest in the microwave regime in the

4962
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,080
brightest in the microwave regime in the
 

4963
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,070
brightest in the microwave regime in the
electromagnetic spectrum and we're

4964
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:20,080
electromagnetic spectrum and we're
 

4965
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,750
electromagnetic spectrum and we're
coupling that to a refracting telescope

4966
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:21,760
coupling that to a refracting telescope
 

4967
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,270
coupling that to a refracting telescope
but your eyes are refracting telescopes

4968
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:23,280
but your eyes are refracting telescopes
 

4969
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,350
but your eyes are refracting telescopes
so you are a polarimeter right now

4970
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:25,360
so you are a polarimeter right now
 

4971
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,950
so you are a polarimeter right now
the human eye can actually slightly

4972
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:26,960
the human eye can actually slightly
 

4973
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,830
the human eye can actually slightly
detect polarization um but otherwise it

4974
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:29,840
detect polarization um but otherwise it
 

4975
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,669
detect polarization um but otherwise it
mainly detects its intensity of light

4976
01:23:31,669 --> 01:23:31,679
mainly detects its intensity of light
 

4977
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,270
mainly detects its intensity of light
and the color that's what we call color

4978
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:33,280
and the color that's what we call color
 

4979
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,189
and the color that's what we call color
and intensity brightness so you're

4980
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:35,199
and intensity brightness so you're
 

4981
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,390
and intensity brightness so you're
devising a

4982
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:36,400
devising a
 

4983
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,990
devising a
instrument that's very precisely

4984
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:38,000
instrument that's very precisely
 

4985
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,629
instrument that's very precisely
measuring that exactly and doing so in

4986
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:40,639
measuring that exactly and doing so in
 

4987
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,790
measuring that exactly and doing so in
the microwave region with detectors not

4988
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:42,800
the microwave region with detectors not
 

4989
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,189
the microwave region with detectors not
made of biological human eyes retina

4990
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:45,199
made of biological human eyes retina
 

4991
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:48,550
made of biological human eyes retina
cells but of superconductors and uh

4992
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:48,560
cells but of superconductors and uh
 

4993
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,390
cells but of superconductors and uh
things called balometers and and this

4994
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:50,400
things called balometers and and this
 

4995
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,550
things called balometers and and this
has to be done at temperatures close to

4996
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:52,560
has to be done at temperatures close to
 

4997
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,950
has to be done at temperatures close to
absolute zero under vacuum conditions

4998
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:54,960
absolute zero under vacuum conditions
 

4999
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,870
absolute zero under vacuum conditions
one billionth of the pressure we feel

5000
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:56,880
one billionth of the pressure we feel
 

5001
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,470
one billionth of the pressure we feel
here at sea level

5002
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
here at sea level
 

5003
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,709
here at sea level
so why is it that this the kind of

5004
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:00,719
so why is it that this the kind of
 

5005
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,030
so why is it that this the kind of
device could win a nobel prize

5006
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,040
device could win a nobel prize
 

5007
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:03,910
device could win a nobel prize
so

5008
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:03,920
so
 

5009
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,830
so
when the cmb was discovered it was

5010
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:05,840
when the cmb was discovered it was
 

5011
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,430
when the cmb was discovered it was
discovered serendipitously there were

5012
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:07,440
discovered serendipitously there were
 

5013
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,910
discovered serendipitously there were
two uh radio astronomers

5014
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:09,920
two uh radio astronomers
 

5015
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,790
two uh radio astronomers
working at the time at bell laboratories

5016
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:12,800
working at the time at bell laboratories
 

5017
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,470
working at the time at bell laboratories
now why would bell laboratories be

5018
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
now why would bell laboratories be
 

5019
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,070
now why would bell laboratories be
employing radio astronomers bell

5020
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
employing radio astronomers bell
 

5021
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,229
employing radio astronomers bell
laboratories is kind of like um

5022
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:18,239
laboratories is kind of like um
 

5023
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,390
laboratories is kind of like um
like apple or you know is it like a

5024
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:20,400
like apple or you know is it like a
 

5025
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,229
like apple or you know is it like a
think tank or you know it's google let's

5026
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:22,239
think tank or you know it's google let's
 

5027
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,510
think tank or you know it's google let's
say it was like google google has like

5028
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:23,520
say it was like google google has like
 

5029
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,950
say it was like google google has like
google x it has this thing on that thing

5030
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:24,960
google x it has this thing on that thing
 

5031
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,629
google x it has this thing on that thing
right um

5032
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:26,639
right um
 

5033
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:29,110
right um
so they were working there but imagine

5034
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,120
so they were working there but imagine
 

5035
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,550
so they were working there but imagine
if google was employing radio

5036
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:30,560
if google was employing radio
 

5037
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,149
if google was employing radio
astronomers like they were actively

5038
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:32,159
astronomers like they were actively
 

5039
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:33,990
astronomers like they were actively
recruiting why would they do that well

5040
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000
recruiting why would they do that well
 

5041
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,430
recruiting why would they do that well
it turns out that was the beginning in

5042
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:35,440
it turns out that was the beginning in
 

5043
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,149
it turns out that was the beginning in
the 1960s was the first commercial

5044
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:38,159
the 1960s was the first commercial
 

5045
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,870
the 1960s was the first commercial
satellite launch for communication

5046
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:40,880
satellite launch for communication
 

5047
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:41,830
satellite launch for communication
and so

5048
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:41,840
and so
 

5049
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,510
and so
so bell labs which would later become

5050
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:43,520
so bell labs which would later become
 

5051
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,350
so bell labs which would later become
the telephone you know part of a t and

was born um and they would take that uh

5058
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
was born um and they would take that uh
 

5059
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,470
was born um and they would take that uh
1946 and they would take that uh

5060
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
1946 and they would take that uh
 

5061
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,310
1946 and they would take that uh
telescope technology that radio

5062
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:56,320
telescope technology that radio
 

5063

astronomers had developed and they would

5064
01:24:58,870 --> 01:24:58,880
astronomers had developed and they would
 

5065
01:24:58,880 --> 01:24:59,990
astronomers had developed and they would
use that

5066
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:00,000
use that
 

5067
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,510
use that
to see if they could improve the signal

5068
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:01,520
to see if they could improve the signal
 

5069
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,709
to see if they could improve the signal
to noise of the satellites that they

5070
01:25:02,709 --> 01:25:02,719
to noise of the satellites that they
 

5071
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,870
to noise of the satellites that they
were seeing and they found they couldn't

5072
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:04,880
were seeing and they found they couldn't
 

5073
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,550
were seeing and they found they couldn't
they found that they could not improve

01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:06,560
they found that they could not improve
 

5075
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,550
they found that they could not improve
the signal noise ratio of the first

and these radio stars couldn't get rid

5094
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:26,719
and these radio stars couldn't get rid
 

5095
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:27,830
and these radio stars couldn't get rid
of the signal so they said well new

5096
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:27,840
of the signal so they said well new
 

5097
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,910
of the signal so they said well new
jersey's not far from new york

5098
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:29,920
jersey's not far from new york
 

5099
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,030
jersey's not far from new york
let's see if the signal is coming from

5100
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,040
let's see if the signal is coming from
 

5101
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,790
let's see if the signal is coming from
new york nope not coming from new york

5102
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:32,800
new york nope not coming from new york
 

5103
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,070
new york nope not coming from new york
let's see if it changes with the year

5104
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,080
let's see if it changes with the year
 

5105
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,350
let's see if it changes with the year
maybe it's coming from the galaxy which

5106
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:35,360
maybe it's coming from the galaxy which
 

5107
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,590
maybe it's coming from the galaxy which
was also discovered there by janski in

5108
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600
was also discovered there by janski in
 

5109
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,149
was also discovered there by janski in
1930 something so in the the not being

5110
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:40,159
1930 something so in the the not being
 

5111
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,910
1930 something so in the the not being
able to reduce the signal or increase

5112
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:41,920
able to reduce the signal or increase
 

5113
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,310
able to reduce the signal or increase
the signal to noise ratio the noise it

5114
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:44,320
the signal to noise ratio the noise it
 

5115
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,030
the signal to noise ratio the noise it
was

5116
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,040
was
 

5117
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,629
was
they knew the signal was right they

5118
01:25:46,629 --> 01:25:46,639
they knew the signal was right they
 

5119
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,149
they knew the signal was right they
couldn't get rid of the noise and there

5120
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:48,159
couldn't get rid of the noise and there
 

5121
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:50,070
couldn't get rid of the noise and there
was excess noise over the model that had

5122
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:50,080
was excess noise over the model that had
 

5123
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,229
was excess noise over the model that had
not only been predicted by them but had

5124
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:52,239
not only been predicted by them but had
 

5125
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,070
not only been predicted by them but had
been measured by a previous guy a guy by

5126
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,080
been measured by a previous guy a guy by
 

5127
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,310
been measured by a previous guy a guy by
the name of edward ohm he measured the

5128
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:56,320
the name of edward ohm he measured the
 

5129
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,149
the name of edward ohm he measured the
same signal found that there was this

5130
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
same signal found that there was this
 

5131
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,390
same signal found that there was this
hiss of static of radio static that he

5132
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:00,400
hiss of static of radio static that he
 

5133
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,390
hiss of static of radio static that he
could not get rid of that had a value of

5134
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:02,400
could not get rid of that had a value of
 

5135
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,629
could not get rid of that had a value of
about three kelvin so you can translate

5136
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:04,639
about three kelvin so you can translate
 

5137
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,550
about three kelvin so you can translate
remember i said uh if you take a radio

5138
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:06,560
remember i said uh if you take a radio
 

5139
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,950
remember i said uh if you take a radio
telescope and you have pointed at an

5140
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:08,960
telescope and you have pointed at an
 

5141
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,350
telescope and you have pointed at an
object that's hot the radio telescope's

5142
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:11,360
object that's hot the radio telescope's
 

5143
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,390
object that's hot the radio telescope's
detector will get to the same

5144
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:12,400
detector will get to the same
 

5145
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,149
detector will get to the same
temperature as the object it's a

5146
01:26:14,149 --> 01:26:14,159
temperature as the object it's a
 

5147
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:16,390
temperature as the object it's a
principle of radio thermodynamics so

5148
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,400
principle of radio thermodynamics so
 

5149
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,669
principle of radio thermodynamics so
it's a really interesting thing it's a

5150
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:17,679
it's a really interesting thing it's a
 

5151
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:18,870
it's a really interesting thing it's a
thermometer you can stick it into

5152
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:18,880
thermometer you can stick it into
 

5153
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,870
thermometer you can stick it into
jupiter from here on earth it's amazing

5154
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:20,880
jupiter from here on earth it's amazing
 

5155
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,030
jupiter from here on earth it's amazing
they were and so we in radio astronomy

5156
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,040
they were and so we in radio astronomy
 

5157
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,030
they were and so we in radio astronomy
characterize our signal not by its

5158
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:25,040
characterize our signal not by its
 

5159
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,510
characterize our signal not by its
intensity but by its temperature

5160
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:27,520
intensity but by its temperature
 

5161
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,590
intensity but by its temperature
so he found this guy edward um oh

5162
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,600
so he found this guy edward um oh
 

5163
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,189
so he found this guy edward um oh
there's this three kelvin signal i can't

5164
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:31,199
there's this three kelvin signal i can't
 

5165
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,350
there's this three kelvin signal i can't
get rid of it it must be i did my era

5166
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:33,360
get rid of it it must be i did my era
 

5167
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,149
get rid of it it must be i did my era
analysis wrong and i would give him an f

5168
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:36,159
analysis wrong and i would give him an f
 

5169
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,669
analysis wrong and i would give him an f
if he was one of my you know first-year

5170
01:26:37,669 --> 01:26:37,679
if he was one of my you know first-year
 

5171
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,830
if he was one of my you know first-year
students um but he's just attributed to

5172
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:39,840
students um but he's just attributed to
 

5173
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,910
students um but he's just attributed to
lack of of understanding these other

5174
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:41,920
lack of of understanding these other
 

5175
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,229
lack of of understanding these other
guys penseus and wilson who are also

5176
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:44,239
guys penseus and wilson who are also
 

5177
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,390
guys penseus and wilson who are also
radio astronomers they said no let's

5178
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:46,400
radio astronomers they said no let's
 

5179
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,110
radio astronomers they said no let's
build another experiment put that inside

5180
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:49,120
build another experiment put that inside
 

5181
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,470
build another experiment put that inside
of our telescope

5182
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,480
of our telescope
 

5183
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,870
of our telescope

about four kelvin because the signal
 

5191
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,229
about four kelvin because the signal

that they're trying to get rid of is
 

5193
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,750
that they're trying to get rid of is
about three kelvin and you want to have

01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:01,760
about three kelvin and you want to have
 

5195
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,950

01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:21,199
you know degrees kelvin so uh how does
 

5219
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,669
you know degrees kelvin so uh how does
uh having a four kelvin

uh having a four kelvin
 

5221
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,350
uh having a four kelvin
source how does the calibration work

5222
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:25,360
source how does the calibration work
 

5223
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,030
source how does the calibration work
just that it could be it could be larger

5224
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,040
just that it could be it could be larger
 

5225
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,310
just that it could be it could be larger
imagine like you're trying to calibrate

5226
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,320
imagine like you're trying to calibrate
 

5227
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,830
imagine like you're trying to calibrate
the microphone like you could do it with

5228
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:29,840
the microphone like you could do it with
 

5229
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,990
the microphone like you could do it with
like a really loud sound but the gain

5230
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:32,000
like a really loud sound but the gain
 

5231
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,750
like a really loud sound but the gain
would start to compress so there are

5232
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:33,760
would start to compress so there are
 

5233
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,830
would start to compress so there are
amplifiers downstream from the detector

5234
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:35,840
amplifiers downstream from the detector
 

5235
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,669
amplifiers downstream from the detector
in every experiment that i've ever

5236
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:37,679
in every experiment that i've ever
 

5237
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,430
in every experiment that i've ever
worked on and they only have a linear

5238
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:39,440
worked on and they only have a linear
 

5239
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,430
worked on and they only have a linear
region over a very small region and you

5240
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
region over a very small region and you
 

5241
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,189
region over a very small region and you
want to keep it as linear as possible

5242
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199
want to keep it as linear as possible
 

5243
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:44,550
want to keep it as linear as possible
that means you want if you're trying to

5244
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:44,560
that means you want if you're trying to
 

5245
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,229
that means you want if you're trying to
get rid of you're trying to compare like

5246
01:27:46,229 --> 01:27:46,239
get rid of you're trying to compare like
 

5247
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:47,669
get rid of you're trying to compare like
a voice and you're trying to compare

5248
01:27:47,669 --> 01:27:47,679
a voice and you're trying to compare
 

5249
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,590
a voice and you're trying to compare
that to a jet engine it's not as it's

5250
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:49,600
that to a jet engine it's not as it's
 

5251
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,430
that to a jet engine it's not as it's
not going to be as as easy on the on the

5252
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:51,440
not going to be as as easy on the on the
 

5253
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,350
not going to be as as easy on the on the
amplifiers as getting you know a

5254
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:53,360
amplifiers as getting you know a
 

5255
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,830
amplifiers as getting you know a
slightly lo a gong or something you know

5256
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
slightly lo a gong or something you know
 

5257
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,910
slightly lo a gong or something you know
so the idea if the noise is present in

5258
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:57,920
so the idea if the noise is present in
 

5259
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:58,950
so the idea if the noise is present in
both

5260
01:27:58,950 --> 01:27:58,960
both
 

5261
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,470
both
there's a noise present in both and you

5262
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:00,480
there's a noise present in both and you
 

5263
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,310
there's a noise present in both and you
get you measure what they did is they

5264
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:02,320
get you measure what they did is they
 

5265
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,910
get you measure what they did is they
made a separate measurement just to the

5266
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:03,920
made a separate measurement just to the
 

5267
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,070
made a separate measurement just to the
calibration system which they measured

5268
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:06,080
calibration system which they measured
 

5269
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,750
calibration system which they measured
exactly very well four kelvin is the

5270
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:07,760
exactly very well four kelvin is the
 

5271
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,510
exactly very well four kelvin is the
temperature of liquid helium that's a

5272
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:09,520
temperature of liquid helium that's a
 

5273
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,189
temperature of liquid helium that's a
temperature that's not going to change

5274
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:11,199
temperature that's not going to change
 

5275
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:12,149
temperature that's not going to change
and it's certainly not going to change

5276
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:12,159
and it's certainly not going to change
 

5277
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,229
and it's certainly not going to change
over the time scale of one second and so

5278
01:28:14,229 --> 01:28:14,239
over the time scale of one second and so
 

5279
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,149
over the time scale of one second and so
they could compare unknown signal known

5280
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:16,159
they could compare unknown signal known
 

5281
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:17,669
they could compare unknown signal known
signal an unknown signal known signal

5282
01:28:17,669 --> 01:28:17,679
signal an unknown signal known signal
 

5283
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:19,270
signal an unknown signal known signal
like a scale like a balance so another

5284
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:19,280
like a scale like a balance so another
 

5285
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,149
like a scale like a balance so another
way to think about it is like this

5286
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:20,159
way to think about it is like this
 

5287
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:22,229
way to think about it is like this
you've seen these libra kind of balances

5288
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:22,239
you've seen these libra kind of balances
 

5289
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:24,070
you've seen these libra kind of balances
where you put two weights in a pan right

5290
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:24,080
where you put two weights in a pan right
 

5291
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,149
where you put two weights in a pan right
what happens if you put like a one ounce

5292
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:26,159
what happens if you put like a one ounce
 

5293
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:27,830
what happens if you put like a one ounce
weight on one side and a 20 kilogram

5294
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:27,840
weight on one side and a 20 kilogram
 

5295
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,350
weight on one side and a 20 kilogram
weight and you don't get any measurement

5296
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:29,360
weight and you don't get any measurement
 

5297
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,790
weight and you don't get any measurement
right but you do get kind of a

5298
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:30,800
right but you do get kind of a
 

5299
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,149
right but you do get kind of a
measurement if they're close in weight

5300
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:32,159
measurement if they're close in weight
 

5301
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,070
measurement if they're close in weight
that's why they use four kelvin got it

5302
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
that's why they use four kelvin got it
 

5303
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,390
that's why they use four kelvin got it
but just to linger on the fact that

5304
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:36,400
but just to linger on the fact that
 

5305
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,070
but just to linger on the fact that
there's a romantic element to the fact

5306
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:38,080
there's a romantic element to the fact
 

5307
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,030
there's a romantic element to the fact
that you're

5308
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:39,040
that you're
 

5309
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,110
that you're
um arriving at the same temperature

5310
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:41,120
um arriving at the same temperature
 

5311
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,149
um arriving at the same temperature
that's kind of fascinating and you're

5312
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:42,159
that's kind of fascinating and you're
 

5313
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:43,590
that's kind of fascinating and you're
measuring stuff in terms of you're

5314
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:43,600
measuring stuff in terms of you're
 

5315
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,590
measuring stuff in terms of you're
measuring signal in terms of temperature

5316
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
measuring signal in terms of temperature
 

5317
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,790
measuring signal in terms of temperature
at the source yeah so you get to i mean

5318
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:48,800
at the source yeah so you get to i mean
 

5319
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,149
at the source yeah so you get to i mean
there's something about temperature

5320
01:28:50,149 --> 01:28:50,159
there's something about temperature
 

5321
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,790
there's something about temperature
that's intimate yeah it's cool yeah

5322
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
that's intimate yeah it's cool yeah
 

5323
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,470
that's intimate yeah it's cool yeah
especially since you know

5324
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:54,480
especially since you know
 

5325
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,229
especially since you know
all life is basically you know

5326
01:28:56,229 --> 01:28:56,239
all life is basically you know
 

5327
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:57,910
all life is basically you know
conversion of energy and trying to

5328
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:57,920
conversion of energy and trying to
 

5329
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,750
conversion of energy and trying to
control entropy which is then related to

5330
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
control entropy which is then related to
 

5331
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,629
control entropy which is then related to
thermodynamics exactly in that way and

5332
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:02,639
thermodynamics exactly in that way and
 

5333
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:05,189
thermodynamics exactly in that way and
this is um a very crucial

5334
01:29:05,189 --> 01:29:05,199
this is um a very crucial
 

5335
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:07,030
this is um a very crucial
kind of thing to do in science because

5336
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:07,040
kind of thing to do in science because
 

5337
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,709
kind of thing to do in science because
they weren't looking for the signal they

5338
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:08,719
they weren't looking for the signal they
 

5339
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,470
they weren't looking for the signal they

01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,070
prize in 1983 these are like five nobel
prizes you know potentially for that

5498
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:58,080
prizes you know potentially for that
 

5499
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,950
prizes you know potentially for that
reason

5500
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:58,960
reason
 

5501
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,709
reason
it seemed as close as you could possibly

5502
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:00,719
it seemed as close as you could possibly
 

5503
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,270
it seemed as close as you could possibly
get to being a slam dunk to outdo what

5504
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:03,280
get to being a slam dunk to outdo what
 

5505
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,590
get to being a slam dunk to outdo what
my father did to do you know really this

5506
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:05,600
my father did to do you know really this
 

5507
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,510
my father did to do you know really this
impossible and at that time lex you know

5508
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:07,520
impossible and at that time lex you know
 

5509
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,270
impossible and at that time lex you know
again i'm

5510
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:09,280
again i'm
 

5511
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,110
again i'm
you know it sounds weird because people

5512
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:11,120
you know it sounds weird because people
 

5513
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,510
you know it sounds weird because people
like oh you wouldn't you know you you

5514
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:13,520
like oh you wouldn't you know you you
 

5515
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,189
like oh you wouldn't you know you you
don't really you know you still want the

5516
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:15,199
don't really you know you still want the
 

5517
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,790
don't really you know you still want the
nobel prize you're still like greedy and

5518
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:16,800
nobel prize you're still like greedy and
 

5519
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,030
nobel prize you're still like greedy and
look you wrote another book about um and

5520
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:19,040
look you wrote another book about um and
 

5521
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,229
look you wrote another book about um and
i always joke i'm like well if you want

5522
01:32:20,229 --> 01:32:20,239
i always joke i'm like well if you want
 

5523
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:21,669
i always joke i'm like well if you want
to see if i'm a hypocrite just get them

5524
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:21,679
to see if i'm a hypocrite just get them
 

5525
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,270
to see if i'm a hypocrite just get them
to give me the nobel prize in literature

5526
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:23,280
to give me the nobel prize in literature
 

5527
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,030
to give me the nobel prize in literature
yeah and if i accept it then i'm a

5528
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:25,040
yeah and if i accept it then i'm a
 

5529
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,070
yeah and if i accept it then i'm a
hypocrite but um wait well we'll get to

5530
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:28,080
hypocrite but um wait well we'll get to
 

5531
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,910
hypocrite but um wait well we'll get to
your current feelings on the nobel prize

5532
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:29,920
your current feelings on the nobel prize
 

5533
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,590
your current feelings on the nobel prize
in terms of hippocrates and so on

5534
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:31,600
in terms of hippocrates and so on
 

5535
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,870
in terms of hippocrates and so on
but

5536
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:32,880
but
 

5537
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,430
but
so there's this ambition

5538
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:35,440
so there's this ambition
 

5539
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,310
so there's this ambition
let's say this device this kind of

5540
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:38,320
let's say this device this kind of
 

5541
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,910
let's say this device this kind of
signal could unlock many of the

5542
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:39,920
signal could unlock many of the
 

5543
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,149
signal could unlock many of the
mysteries about the early universe and

5544
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:42,159
mysteries about the early universe and
 

5545
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,149
mysteries about the early universe and
so there's excitement there

5546
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:44,159
so there's excitement there
 

5547
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:47,110
so there's excitement there
so let's take it then further i mean

5548
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:47,120
so let's take it then further i mean
 

5549
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,510
so let's take it then further i mean
there's a human story here of a bit of

5550
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:49,520
there's a human story here of a bit of
 

5551
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,830
there's a human story here of a bit of
heartbreak not only

5552
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:51,840
heartbreak not only
 

5553
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,470
heartbreak not only
was this possibly worth a nobel prize

5554
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
was this possibly worth a nobel prize
 

5555
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,110
was this possibly worth a nobel prize
if the nobel prize was given

5556
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
if the nobel prize was given
 

5557
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,510
if the nobel prize was given
you were excluded from the list of three

5558
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
you were excluded from the list of three
 

5559
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,430
you were excluded from the list of three
that would get the nobel prize

5560
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:01,440
that would get the nobel prize
 

5561
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,870
that would get the nobel prize
so

5562
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:02,880
so
 

5563
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,030
so
why were you excluded maybe that's the

5564
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:05,040
why were you excluded maybe that's the
 

5565
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,669
why were you excluded maybe that's the
place to tell the story of bicep 2. yeah

5566
01:33:07,669 --> 01:33:07,679
place to tell the story of bicep 2. yeah
 

5567
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,310
place to tell the story of bicep 2. yeah
so bicep two like you know iphones or i

5568
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,320
so bicep two like you know iphones or i
 

5569
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,790
so bicep two like you know iphones or i
know you're an android fanboy but um you

5570
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:12,800
know you're an android fanboy but um you
 

5571
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,070
know you're an android fanboy but um you
know every year they get a little bit

5572
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,080
know every year they get a little bit
 

5573
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,830
know every year they get a little bit
better they get more megapixels they get

5574
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:15,840
better they get more megapixels they get
 

5575
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,550
better they get more megapixels they get
more optics triplex zoom whatever okay

5576
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:18,560
more optics triplex zoom whatever okay
 

5577
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,510
more optics triplex zoom whatever okay
right

5578
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:19,520
right
 

5579
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,430
right
we upgraded our detectors as well the

5580
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:21,440
we upgraded our detectors as well the
 

5581
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,430
we upgraded our detectors as well the
initial detectors were based on what are

5582
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:23,440
initial detectors were based on what are
 

5583
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,750
initial detectors were based on what are
called semiconductors they they have

5584
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:25,760
called semiconductors they they have
 

5585
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,110
called semiconductors they they have
certain properties that make them very

5586
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:27,120
certain properties that make them very
 

5587
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,350
certain properties that make them very
difficult to replicate at scale and we

5588
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:29,360
difficult to replicate at scale and we
 

5589
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,950
difficult to replicate at scale and we
wanted to make them into uh into

5590
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:30,960
wanted to make them into uh into
 

5591
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,430
wanted to make them into uh into
superconductors which had a virtue that

5592
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:33,440
superconductors which had a virtue that
 

5593
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,350
superconductors which had a virtue that
you could then mass produce them why

5594
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:35,360
you could then mass produce them why
 

5595
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,030
you could then mass produce them why
superconductors well again we're

5596
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:37,040
superconductors well again we're
 

5597
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,870
superconductors well again we're
measuring heat so one thing about a

5598
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:38,880
measuring heat so one thing about a
 

5599
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,350
measuring heat so one thing about a
superconductor is that it transitions

5600
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
superconductor is that it transitions
 

5601
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,070
superconductor is that it transitions
from some finite resistance to zero

5602

now there's this kind of
just one betrayal in this in a way and

i mean that's

5958

01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,590
collaborations are truly great it sounds
similar as when um

5966
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:07,600

 

5967
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,350

veterans talk about

5968
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:09,360
veterans talk about
 

5969
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,270
veterans talk about
their time serving together there's

5970
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:11,280
their time serving together there's
 

5971
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,590
their time serving together there's
there's a bond that's formed so like

5972
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:13,600
there's a bond that's formed so like
 

5973
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,430
there's a bond that's formed so like
comparing family and this kind of thing

5974
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:15,440
comparing family and this kind of thing
 

5975
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,910
comparing family and this kind of thing
is you know

5976
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:17,920
is you know
 

5977
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,629
is you know
it uh is not productive but

5978
01:40:20,629 --> 01:40:20,639
it uh is not productive but
 

5979
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,350
it uh is not productive but
the depth of the bond is is nevertheless

5980
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:23,360
the depth of the bond is is nevertheless
 

5981
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,189
the depth of the bond is is nevertheless
um

5982
01:40:25,189 --> 01:40:25,199
um
 

5983
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:28,070
um
real because you're taking on something

5984
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:28,080
real because you're taking on something
 

5985
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,629
real because you're taking on something
you're taking on the impossible

5986
01:40:30,629 --> 01:40:30,639
you're taking on the impossible
 

5987
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:31,990
you're taking on the impossible
you're you're trying to achieve

5988
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:32,000
you're you're trying to achieve
 

5989
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,270
you're you're trying to achieve
something sort of like there's this

5990
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:33,280
something sort of like there's this
 

5991
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,590
something sort of like there's this
darkness this fog of mystery that we're

5992
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:35,600
darkness this fog of mystery that we're
 

5993
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,510
darkness this fog of mystery that we're
all surrounded by

5994
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:37,520
all surrounded by
 

5995
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,950
all surrounded by
which is um

5996
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:38,960
which is um
 

5997
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,109
which is um
what the human condition is and you are

5998
01:40:41,109 --> 01:40:41,119
what the human condition is and you are
 

5999
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:43,510
what the human condition is and you are
like grasping at hope through the tools

6000
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:43,520
like grasping at hope through the tools
 

6001
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,270
like grasping at hope through the tools
of science and you're doing that

6002
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:45,280
of science and you're doing that
 

6003
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,390
of science and you're doing that
together

6004
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:46,400
together
 

6005
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,310
together
with like a confidence you probably

6006
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:48,320
with like a confidence you probably
 

6007
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,669
with like a confidence you probably
should not have

6008
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:49,679
should not have
 

6009
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:51,430
should not have
yeah but you're boldly pushing through

6010
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:51,440
yeah but you're boldly pushing through
 

6011
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,629
yeah but you're boldly pushing through
and then

6012
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:52,639
and then
 

6013
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:55,189
and then
for him to uh

6014
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:55,199
for him to uh
 

6015
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,270
for him to uh
to take his own life

6016
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:57,280
to take his own life
 

6017
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,709
to take his own life
it can ask you about this kind of moment

6018
01:41:00,709 --> 01:41:00,719
it can ask you about this kind of moment
 

6019
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:02,629
it can ask you about this kind of moment
that combined

6020
01:41:02,629 --> 01:41:02,639
that combined
 

6021
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,470
that combined
i don't want to say betrayal but perhaps

6022
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:04,480
i don't want to say betrayal but perhaps
 

6023
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:07,990
i don't want to say betrayal but perhaps
the feeling of betrayal that bicep 2

6024
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:08,000
the feeling of betrayal that bicep 2
 

6025
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,590
the feeling of betrayal that bicep 2
kind of goes on without you even though

6026
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:09,600
kind of goes on without you even though
 

6027
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,510
kind of goes on without you even though
you're part of it

6028
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:11,520
you're part of it
 

6029
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,430
you're part of it
you're not part of the leadership group

6030
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:15,440

 

6031
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:18,470

can you describe those low points did um

6032
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:18,480
can you describe those low points did um
 

6033
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,270
can you describe those low points did um
was there depression was there um

6034
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:21,280
was there depression was there um
 

6035
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,669
was there depression was there um
a crumbling of confidence yeah i mean it

6036
01:41:23,669 --> 01:41:23,679
a crumbling of confidence yeah i mean it
 

6037
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:26,149
a crumbling of confidence yeah i mean it
was it was so wrapped up

6038
01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:26,159
was it was so wrapped up
 

6039
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:29,189
was it was so wrapped up
with my identity as a person you know

6040
01:41:29,189 --> 01:41:29,199
with my identity as a person you know
 

6041
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,030
with my identity as a person you know
like there's only a few different ways

6042
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:31,040
like there's only a few different ways
 

6043
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,629
like there's only a few different ways
to have identity and you know unless

6044
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:32,639
to have identity and you know unless
 

6045
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,870
to have identity and you know unless
you're unhealthy psychologically one of

6046
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:34,880
you're unhealthy psychologically one of
 

6047
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,149
you're unhealthy psychologically one of
them for scientists is often that

6048
01:41:36,149 --> 01:41:36,159
them for scientists is often that
 

6049
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:37,669
them for scientists is often that
they're a scientist and that sometimes

6050
01:41:37,669 --> 01:41:37,679
they're a scientist and that sometimes
 

6051
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:39,510
they're a scientist and that sometimes
is their primary identity now i've got

6052
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:39,520
is their primary identity now i've got
 

6053
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,430
is their primary identity now i've got
other husband and father

6054
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:41,440
other husband and father
 

6055
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,430
other husband and father
um but but you know at that time that

6056
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:43,440
um but but you know at that time that
 

6057
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,310
um but but you know at that time that
was my identity so to have that kind of

6058
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:46,320
was my identity so to have that kind of
 

6059
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,990
was my identity so to have that kind of
taken away

6060
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:48,000
taken away
 

6061
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,149
taken away
it you know what it reminded me of being

6062
01:41:50,149 --> 01:41:50,159
it you know what it reminded me of being
 

6063
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:52,790
it you know what it reminded me of being
you know kind of adopted

6064
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:52,800
you know kind of adopted
 

6065
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,030
you know kind of adopted
in a sense like my like the one who

6066
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:55,040
in a sense like my like the one who
 

6067
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,950
in a sense like my like the one who
created me or that i had played you know

6068
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:56,960
created me or that i had played you know
 

6069
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,870
created me or that i had played you know
played a role in my life that he

6070
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:58,880
played a role in my life that he
 

6071
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,030
played a role in my life that he
abandoned me in a sense it felt like

6072
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:01,040
abandoned me in a sense it felt like
 

6073
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,629
abandoned me in a sense it felt like
these people are abandoning me and the

6074
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
these people are abandoning me and the
 

6075
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,229
these people are abandoning me and the
only thing i'd correct about the analogy

6076
01:42:04,229 --> 01:42:04,239
only thing i'd correct about the analogy
 

6077
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,870
only thing i'd correct about the analogy
that you use is like in milit in the war

6078
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:06,880
that you use is like in milit in the war
 

6079
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,310
that you use is like in milit in the war
they're all working you know for common

6080
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:08,320
they're all working you know for common
 

6081
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,149
they're all working you know for common
good it's not like i want to be get the

6082
01:42:10,149 --> 01:42:10,159
good it's not like i want to be get the
 

6083
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:11,430
good it's not like i want to be get the
most kills

6084
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:11,440
most kills
 

6085
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,510
most kills
i compare more to like a band like think

6086
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:13,520
i compare more to like a band like think
 

6087
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,350
i compare more to like a band like think
about the beatles you know and what they

6088
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:15,360
about the beatles you know and what they
 

6089
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,229
about the beatles you know and what they
did

6090
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:16,239
did
 

6091
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:18,229
did
and then they like you know they ripped

6092
01:42:18,229 --> 01:42:18,239
and then they like you know they ripped
 

6093
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,229
and then they like you know they ripped
apart because of egos credit they had

6094
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:20,239
apart because of egos credit they had
 

6095
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:22,950
apart because of egos credit they had
solo careers they had you know

6096
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:22,960
solo careers they had you know
 

6097
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,470
solo careers they had you know
relations their intimates and and so

6098
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:24,480
relations their intimates and and so
 

6099
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,870
relations their intimates and and so
forth and and there it's not only for

6100
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:26,880
forth and and there it's not only for
 

6101
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,790
forth and and there it's not only for
the common good there is more of a

6102
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:28,800
the common good there is more of a
 

6103
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,510
the common good there is more of a
zero-sum aspect like i would say science

6104
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:31,520
zero-sum aspect like i would say science
 

6105
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,910
zero-sum aspect like i would say science
is not science is an infinite game you

6106
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:33,920
is not science is an infinite game you
 

6107
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,470
is not science is an infinite game you
can't win science you never get today oh

6108
01:42:36,470 --> 01:42:36,480
can't win science you never get today oh
 

6109
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,229
can't win science you never get today oh
we won science and even the nobel prize

6110
01:42:38,229 --> 01:42:38,239
we won science and even the nobel prize
 

6111
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:39,590
we won science and even the nobel prize
they don't feel like oh we're done they

6112
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:39,600
they don't feel like oh we're done they
 

6113
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:40,629
they don't feel like oh we're done they
feel like a lot of times they're

6114
01:42:40,629 --> 01:42:40,639
feel like a lot of times they're
 

6115
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:42,790
feel like a lot of times they're
imposters even to that day

6116
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:42,800
imposters even to that day
 

6117
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,750
imposters even to that day
however science is made up of a lot of

6118
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:45,760
however science is made up of a lot of
 

6119
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,229
however science is made up of a lot of
lot a lot of finite games where there is

6120
01:42:48,229 --> 01:42:48,239
lot a lot of finite games where there is
 

6121
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,470
lot a lot of finite games where there is
only one winner for tenure there is only

6122
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:50,480
only one winner for tenure there is only
 

6123
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,149

01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:52,800
the higgs particle of great note has
 

6555
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,629
the higgs particle of great note has
come out and actually he's had a recent

come out and actually he's had a recent
 

6557
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:56,629
come out and actually he's had a recent
paper but it's been an upper limit along

experiment that i'm going to be talking

6562
01:49:59,510 --> 01:49:59,520
experiment that i'm going to be talking
 

6563
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,510
experiment that i'm going to be talking
with him about but but the bottom line

6564
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:01,520
with him about but but the bottom line
 

6565
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,790
with him about but but the bottom line
is it was really built to detect the

6566
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:02,800
is it was really built to detect the
 

6567
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:06,070
is it was really built to detect the
higgs so the ssc for twice as much money

6568
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:06,080
higgs so the ssc for twice as much money
 

6569
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,589
higgs so the ssc for twice as much money
would have sucked up barry's career and

6570
01:50:07,589 --> 01:50:07,599
would have sucked up barry's career and
 

6571
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:09,030
would have sucked up barry's career and
he would have been working on that maybe

6572
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:09,040
he would have been working on that maybe
 

6573
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,870
he would have been working on that maybe
not and then he would never have worked

6574
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:10,880
not and then he would never have worked
 

6575
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,790
not and then he would never have worked
on ligo and then he wouldn't have won

6576
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:12,800
on ligo and then he wouldn't have won
 

6577
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,229
on ligo and then he wouldn't have won
the nobel prize right so you look at

6578
01:50:14,229 --> 01:50:14,239
the nobel prize right so you look at
 

6579
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:15,750
the nobel prize right so you look at
counterfactual history that's not

6580
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:15,760
counterfactual history that's not
 

6581
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:17,669
counterfactual history that's not
actually a big stretch right if the ssc

6582
01:50:17,669 --> 01:50:17,679
actually a big stretch right if the ssc
 

6583
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:18,790
actually a big stretch right if the ssc
had still gone on he would have worked

6584
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:18,800
had still gone on he would have worked
 

6585
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,070
had still gone on he would have worked
out because he was one of the primary

6586
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:20,080
out because he was one of the primary
 

6587
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,830
out because he was one of the primary
leaders of that experiment

6588
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:21,840
leaders of that experiment
 

6589
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,030
leaders of that experiment
second thing if um imagine the following

6590
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:25,040
second thing if um imagine the following
 

6591
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,870
second thing if um imagine the following
thing had happened they won the nobel

they detected unequivocal evidence for
the in-spiral collision of two massive

6598
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:34,960
the in-spiral collision of two massive
 

6599
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,109
the in-spiral collision of two massive
black holes each about 30 times the mass

6600
01:50:37,109 --> 01:50:37,119
black holes each about 30 times the mass
 

6601

had just less than 60 solar masses
 

6605
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:45,589
had just less than 60 solar masses
behind so one solar mass worth of matter

to drive their cars and then there's

8090
02:15:07,990 --> 02:15:08,000
to drive their cars and then there's
 

8091
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,589
to drive their cars and then there's
millions of cars driving every day i

8092
02:15:09,589 --> 02:15:09,599
millions of cars driving every day i
 

8093
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:10,950
millions of cars driving every day i
could do this better maybe there's some

8094
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:10,960
could do this better maybe there's some
 

8095
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:12,629
could do this better maybe there's some
blockchain and they could like vin

8096
02:15:12,629 --> 02:15:12,639
blockchain and they could like vin
 

8097
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:14,870
blockchain and they could like vin
transfer yeah exactly yeah no that is a

8098
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:14,880
transfer yeah exactly yeah no that is a
 

8099
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,669
transfer yeah exactly yeah no that is a
good that is and then every situation i

8100
02:15:17,669 --> 02:15:17,679
good that is and then every situation i
 

8101
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:19,430
good that is and then every situation i
think if you rigorously like just

8102
02:15:19,430 --> 02:15:19,440
think if you rigorously like just
 

8103
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:21,750
think if you rigorously like just
practice that at a young age i think you

8104
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:21,760
practice that at a young age i think you
 

8105
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:24,229
practice that at a young age i think you
can learn to do that because like

8106
02:15:24,229 --> 02:15:24,239
can learn to do that because like
 

8107
02:15:24,239 --> 02:15:26,069
can learn to do that because like
sometimes people like ask me for advice

8108
02:15:26,069 --> 02:15:26,079
sometimes people like ask me for advice
 

8109
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:26,950
sometimes people like ask me for advice
and like

8110
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:26,960
and like
 

8111
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:29,750
and like
to do this thing or that thing is i

8112
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:29,760
to do this thing or that thing is i
 

8113
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:31,589
to do this thing or that thing is i
think you at the core really have to

8114
02:15:31,589 --> 02:15:31,599
think you at the core really have to
 

8115
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:33,109
think you at the core really have to
have this

8116
02:15:33,109 --> 02:15:33,119
have this
 

8117
02:15:33,119 --> 02:15:34,629
have this
muscle of

8118
02:15:34,629 --> 02:15:34,639
muscle of
 

8119
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:36,550
muscle of
finding the awesomeness and everything

8120
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:36,560
finding the awesomeness and everything
 

8121
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:37,990
finding the awesomeness and everything
because if you're able to find the

8122
02:15:37,990 --> 02:15:38,000
because if you're able to find the
 

8123
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,069
because if you're able to find the
awesomeness in everything like whatever

8124
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:40,079
awesomeness in everything like whatever
 

8125
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:43,030
awesomeness in everything like whatever
journey you take whatever whatever weird

8126
02:15:43,030 --> 02:15:43,040
journey you take whatever whatever weird
 

8127
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:45,669
journey you take whatever whatever weird
um

8128
02:15:45,669 --> 02:15:45,679

 

8129
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:47,589

that you take through life is going to

8130
02:15:47,589 --> 02:15:47,599
that you take through life is going to
 

8131
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:49,350
that you take through life is going to
be productive it's going to end up in a

8132
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:49,360
be productive it's going to end up in a
 

8133
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:51,589
be productive it's going to end up in a
in a great place so like that muscle is

8134
02:15:51,589 --> 02:15:51,599
in a great place so like that muscle is
 

8135
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:54,229
in a great place so like that muscle is
at the core of it and i guess curiosity

8136
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:54,239
at the core of it and i guess curiosity
 

8137
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:55,910
at the core of it and i guess curiosity
is uh

8138
02:15:55,910 --> 02:15:55,920
is uh
 

8139
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,229
is uh
central to that

8140
02:15:58,229 --> 02:15:58,239
central to that
 

8141
02:15:58,239 --> 02:16:00,229
central to that
but

8142
02:16:00,229 --> 02:16:00,239
but
 

8143
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:03,750
but
you didn't win the nobel prize the team

8144
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:03,760
you didn't win the nobel prize the team
 

8145
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:05,750

astonishing to think pansies and wilson
1965 measured something that's a billion

8312
02:18:56,150 --> 02:18:56,160
1965 measured something that's a billion
 

8313
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,349
1965 measured something that's a billion
times brighter and that was what uh 60

8314
02:18:59,349 --> 02:18:59,359
times brighter and that was what uh 60
 

8315
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:00,790
times brighter and that was what uh 60
years ago let's call it 60 years ago

8316
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:00,800
years ago let's call it 60 years ago
 

8317
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:02,389
years ago let's call it 60 years ago
since they discovered it

8318
02:19:02,389 --> 02:19:02,399
since they discovered it
 

8319
02:19:02,399 --> 02:19:04,389
since they discovered it
moore's law you're more experts let's

8320
02:19:04,389 --> 02:19:04,399
moore's law you're more experts let's
 

8321
02:19:04,399 --> 02:19:05,750
moore's law you're more experts let's
call it every two years

8322
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:05,760
call it every two years
 

8323
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:07,030
call it every two years
so you're talking about like 2 to the

8324
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:07,040
so you're talking about like 2 to the
 

8325
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:08,389
so you're talking about like 2 to the
30th power

8326
02:19:08,389 --> 02:19:08,399
30th power
 

8327
02:19:08,399 --> 02:19:10,389
30th power
doubling or something like that at that

8328
02:19:10,389 --> 02:19:10,399
doubling or something like that at that
 

8329
02:19:10,399 --> 02:19:11,830
doubling or something like that at that
so let's call 2 to the 20th something

8330
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:11,840
so let's call 2 to the 20th something
 

8331
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:14,150
so let's call 2 to the 20th something
like that so that's like only um uh 2 to

8332
02:19:14,150 --> 02:19:14,160
like that so that's like only um uh 2 to
 

8333
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,790
like that so that's like only um uh 2 to

02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:10,389
discovered on the sun i don't know did
you know that's why it's called helium

8446
02:21:10,389 --> 02:21:10,399
you know that's why it's called helium
 

8447

you know that's why it's called helium
yeah they went there at night and

8448
02:21:13,030 --> 02:21:13,040
yeah they went there at night and
 

8449
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,030
yeah they went there at night and
oh well done they went there at night no

8450
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:15,040
oh well done they went there at night no
 

8451

sun it was discovered in its spectrum

8454
02:21:18,309 --> 02:21:18,319
sun it was discovered in its spectrum
 

8455
02:21:18,319 --> 02:21:19,910
sun it was discovered in its spectrum
from observations of the telescope like

8456
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:19,920
from observations of the telescope like
 

8457
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:21,830
from observations of the telescope like
150 years ago it wasn't discovered like

8458
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:21,840
150 years ago it wasn't discovered like
 

8459
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:24,309
150 years ago it wasn't discovered like
when uh oxygen and you know iron was

8460
02:21:24,309 --> 02:21:24,319
when uh oxygen and you know iron was
 

8461
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:26,950
when uh oxygen and you know iron was
discovered um so it's only a relatively

8462
02:21:26,950 --> 02:21:26,960
discovered um so it's only a relatively
 

8463
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:28,389
discovered um so it's only a relatively
recent comer to the pure activity the

8464
02:21:28,389 --> 02:21:28,399
recent comer to the pure activity the
 

8465
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:31,670
recent comer to the pure activity the
helium came after oxygen oh no first

8466
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:31,680
helium came after oxygen oh no first
 

8467
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:33,750
helium came after oxygen oh no first
first hydrogen forms into helium so

8468
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:33,760
first hydrogen forms into helium so
 

8469
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:34,950
first hydrogen forms into helium so
that's the first thing that forms now in

8470
02:21:34,950 --> 02:21:34,960
that's the first thing that forms now in
 

8471
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:36,870
that's the first thing that forms now in
terms of discoveries oh yeah after

8472
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:36,880
terms of discoveries oh yeah after
 

8473
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,110
terms of discoveries oh yeah after
oxygen yeah i think priestly and

8474
02:21:39,110 --> 02:21:39,120
oxygen yeah i think priestly and
 

8475
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:41,590
oxygen yeah i think priestly and
yeah and others dalton discovered it in

8476
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:41,600
yeah and others dalton discovered it in
 

8477
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:43,830
yeah and others dalton discovered it in
the 1700s no helium was really only

8478
02:21:43,830 --> 02:21:43,840
the 1700s no helium was really only
 

8479
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,270
the 1700s no helium was really only
discovered from the spectrum of looking

8480
02:21:45,270 --> 02:21:45,280
discovered from the spectrum of looking
 

8481
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:46,870
discovered from the spectrum of looking
at the sun and seeing the weird atomic

8482
02:21:46,870 --> 02:21:46,880
at the sun and seeing the weird atomic
 

8483
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,150
at the sun and seeing the weird atomic
absorption and

8484
02:21:48,150 --> 02:21:48,160
absorption and
 

8485
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:49,990
absorption and
called fraunhofer lines in the solar

8486
02:21:49,990 --> 02:21:50,000
called fraunhofer lines in the solar
 

8487
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,270
called fraunhofer lines in the solar

so but when it tries to make iron

8490
02:21:53,670 --> 02:21:53,680
so but when it tries to make iron
 

8491
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:55,510
so but when it tries to make iron
there's no longer any leftover heat in

02:21:55,510 --> 02:21:55,520
there's no longer any leftover heat in
 

8493
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:57,270
there's no longer any leftover heat in
other words there's heat left over from

fusing as you know the son of a plasma

8496
02:21:59,190 --> 02:21:59,200
fusing as you know the son of a plasma
 

8497
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:01,429
fusing as you know the son of a plasma
physicist you fuse to

8498
02:22:01,429 --> 02:22:01,439
physicist you fuse to
 

8499
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:03,190
physicist you fuse to
hydrogen nuclei you get excess energy

8500
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:03,200
hydrogen nuclei you get excess energy
 

8501
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:05,110
hydrogen nuclei you get excess energy
plus you get helium so that's why fusion

8502
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,120
plus you get helium so that's why fusion
 

8503
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:06,950
plus you get helium so that's why fusion
energy could be the energy source of the

8504
02:22:06,950 --> 02:22:06,960
energy could be the energy source of the
 

8505
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:09,110
energy could be the energy source of the
future and it always will be no no

8506
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:09,120
future and it always will be no no
 

8507
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:10,790
future and it always will be no no
hopefully it'll come much sooner than

8508
02:22:10,790 --> 02:22:10,800
hopefully it'll come much sooner than
 

8509
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:13,030
hopefully it'll come much sooner than
that and so doing trying to make iron it

8510
02:22:13,030 --> 02:22:13,040
that and so doing trying to make iron it
 

8511
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:14,389
that and so doing trying to make iron it
takes more energy doesn't give off

8512
02:22:14,389 --> 02:22:14,399
takes more energy doesn't give off
 

8513
02:22:14,399 --> 02:22:16,469
takes more energy doesn't give off
enough energy star collapses explodes

8514

enough energy star collapses explodes
 

8515
02:22:16,479 --> 02:22:18,389
enough energy star collapses explodes
and what does it spray out into the you

8516
02:22:18,389 --> 02:22:18,399
and what does it spray out into the you
 

8517
02:22:18,399 --> 02:22:20,230
and what does it spray out into the you
know cosmic interstellar medium it

some of that coalesced and made the core
 

8525
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:27,830
some of that coalesced and made the core

8529
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,910
silica and carbon and the dirt and the
crust of the earth were formed and some

8530
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:31,920
crust of the earth were formed and some
 

8531
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:33,590
crust of the earth were formed and some
of that made its way to the crust the

02:22:33,590 --> 02:22:33,600
of that made its way to the crust the
 

8533
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:35,510
of that made its way to the crust the
iron made its way to the crust some of

02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:53,200
i've done enough dad jokes my quota's up
 

8553
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:56,070
i've done enough dad jokes my quota's up
um so i'm taking this this object uh you

8554
02:22:56,070 --> 02:22:56,080
um so i'm taking this this object uh you
 

8555
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:58,070
um so i'm taking this this object uh you
know seriously there's not all of it

8556
02:22:58,070 --> 02:22:58,080
know seriously there's not all of it
 

8557
02:22:58,080 --> 02:22:59,429
know seriously there's not all of it
gets bound up in a planet in fact

8558
02:22:59,429 --> 02:22:59,439
gets bound up in a planet in fact
 

8559
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:01,750
gets bound up in a planet in fact
forming planets is very inefficient um

8560
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:01,760
forming planets is very inefficient um
 

8561
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:03,190
forming planets is very inefficient um
and so there's a lot of schmutz left

8562
02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:03,200
and so there's a lot of schmutz left
 

8563
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:05,429
and so there's a lot of schmutz left
over some of which gets in the way

8564
02:23:05,429 --> 02:23:05,439
over some of which gets in the way
 

8565
02:23:05,439 --> 02:23:07,190
over some of which gets in the way
of our telescopes looking back to the

02:23:15,990 --> 02:23:16,000
magnetic fields in our galaxy can align
 

8575
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,670
magnetic fields in our galaxy can align
them and make the exact polarization

pattern that we're looking for
 

8579
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:21,110
pattern that we're looking for
as if the compass needles get all

02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:21,120
as if the compass needles get all
 

8581
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,030
as if the compass needles get all

and light polarized like this will go
 

8591
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:31,910

8753
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,190
reasons that the team leaders felt it
was important to do that so that we

8754
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:13,200
was important to do that so that we
 

8755
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:14,710
was important to do that so that we
don't get scooped by a referee it was

8756
02:26:14,710 --> 02:26:14,720
don't get scooped by a referee it was
 

8757
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:16,469
don't get scooped by a referee it was
unethical we thought we had done

8758
02:26:16,469 --> 02:26:16,479
unethical we thought we had done
 

8759
02:26:16,479 --> 02:26:18,150
unethical we thought we had done
everything right but that's confirmation

8760
02:26:18,150 --> 02:26:18,160
everything right but that's confirmation
 

8761
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:20,389
everything right but that's confirmation
there's like levels to this yeah there

8762
02:26:20,389 --> 02:26:20,399
there's like levels to this yeah there
 

8763
02:26:20,399 --> 02:26:21,670
there's like levels to this yeah there
were many levels

8764
02:26:21,670 --> 02:26:21,680
were many levels
 

8765
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:23,270
were many levels
and there were people you know me

8766
02:26:23,270 --> 02:26:23,280
and there were people you know me
 

8767
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:24,469
and there were people you know me
warning about you know how it would be

8768
02:26:24,469 --> 02:26:24,479
warning about you know how it would be
 

8769
02:26:24,479 --> 02:26:26,389
warning about you know how it would be
interpreted and wanting to also make

8770
02:26:26,389 --> 02:26:26,399
interpreted and wanting to also make
 

8771
02:26:26,399 --> 02:26:28,070
interpreted and wanting to also make
sure that we put all the data out

8772
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:28,080
sure that we put all the data out
 

8773
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:29,510
sure that we put all the data out
including the maps which we still

8774
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:29,520
including the maps which we still
 

8775
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:31,590
including the maps which we still
haven't released and um so there were a

8776
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:31,600
haven't released and um so there were a
 

8777
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:33,190
haven't released and um so there were a
lot of reasons to be skeptical but the

8778
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:33,200
lot of reasons to be skeptical but the
 

8779
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,469
lot of reasons to be skeptical but the
audi the

8780
02:26:34,469 --> 02:26:34,479
audi the
 

8781
02:26:34,479 --> 02:26:37,030

is the
 

8811
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,469
is the
to me in the space of science at least

8812
02:27:08,469 --> 02:27:08,479
to me in the space of science at least
 

8813
02:27:08,479 --> 02:27:10,150
to me in the space of science at least
that's as beautiful

8814
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:10,160
that's as beautiful
 

8815
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:11,990
that's as beautiful
because it reveals

because it reveals
 

8817
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:12,950
because it reveals
the

8818
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:12,960
the
 

8819
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:15,110
the
it's like it's uh it tells a great story

8820
02:27:15,110 --> 02:27:15,120
it's like it's uh it tells a great story
 

8821

there's a there's an excitement there's
 

8823
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:20,870
there's a there's an excitement there's
uh humanity there so there's a climax of

8824
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:20,880
uh humanity there so there's a climax of
 

8825
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:22,710
uh humanity there so there's a climax of
the triumph but there's also a climax to

8826
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:22,720
the triumph but there's also a climax to
 

8827
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:25,270
the triumph but there's also a climax to
the like the disappointment yeah

8828
02:27:25,270 --> 02:27:25,280
the like the disappointment yeah
 

8829
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:27,990
the like the disappointment yeah
because that also eventually leads

8830
02:27:27,990 --> 02:27:28,000
because that also eventually leads
 

8831
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,950
because that also eventually leads
to triumph again that sets up that's the

8832
02:27:30,950 --> 02:27:30,960
to triumph again that sets up that's the
 

8833
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:32,710
to triumph again that sets up that's the
drama that sets up the triumph like with

8834
02:27:32,710 --> 02:27:32,720
drama that sets up the triumph like with
 

8835
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:35,030
drama that sets up the triumph like with

galileo he was not only a phenomenal

8948
02:29:29,830 --> 02:29:29,840
galileo he was not only a phenomenal

8950
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:30,960
scientist
 

8951
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:32,230
scientist
he was

8952
02:29:32,230 --> 02:29:32,240
he was
 

8953
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:35,429
he was
an incredible artist a writer a poet a

philosopher
and back then they didn't have

8958
02:29:37,590 --> 02:29:37,600
and back then they didn't have
 

8959
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:39,270
and back then they didn't have
distinctions between you know scientists

8960
02:29:39,270 --> 02:29:39,280
distinctions between you know scientists
 

8961
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:41,110
distinctions between you know scientists
and i was like a physician was like a

8962
02:29:41,110 --> 02:29:41,120
and i was like a physician was like a
 

8963
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:42,150
and i was like a physician was like a
physicist

8964
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:42,160
physicist
 

8965
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:45,110
physicist
um and he would indulge you know kind of

8966
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:45,120
um and he would indulge you know kind of
 

8967
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:47,110
um and he would indulge you know kind of
these really intellectual flights of

8968
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:47,120
these really intellectual flights of
 

8969
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:48,150
these really intellectual flights of
fancy

8970
02:29:48,150 --> 02:29:48,160
fancy
 

8971
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:51,429
fancy
thinking about uh phenomena such as the

8972
02:29:51,429 --> 02:29:51,439
thinking about uh phenomena such as the
 

8973
02:29:51,439 --> 02:29:53,750
thinking about uh phenomena such as the
earth's tides or the or you know the

8974
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:53,760
earth's tides or the or you know the
 

8975
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:55,750
earth's tides or the or you know the
composition of the milky way and what's

8976
02:29:55,750 --> 02:29:55,760
composition of the milky way and what's
 

8977
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:58,469
composition of the milky way and what's
interesting about galileo is that he was

8978
02:29:58,469 --> 02:29:58,479
interesting about galileo is that he was
 

8979
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:00,710
interesting about galileo is that he was
almost as wrong often as he was right

8980
02:30:00,710 --> 02:30:00,720
almost as wrong often as he was right
 

8981
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:03,510
almost as wrong often as he was right
and galileo was not alone like this i

8982
02:30:03,510 --> 02:30:03,520
and galileo was not alone like this i
 

8983
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,910
and galileo was not alone like this i
always say like einstein had at least

8984
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:05,920
always say like einstein had at least
 

8985
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:07,990
always say like einstein had at least
seven nobel prizes that he could have

8986
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:08,000
seven nobel prizes that he could have
 

8987
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,910
seven nobel prizes that he could have
won for discoveries that later became

8988
02:30:09,910 --> 02:30:09,920
won for discoveries that later became
 

8989
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:11,990
won for discoveries that later became
true but he also had seven

8990
02:30:11,990 --> 02:30:12,000
true but he also had seven
 

8991
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,309
true but he also had seven
you know huge you know impossible to

8992
02:30:14,309 --> 02:30:14,319
you know huge you know impossible to
 

8993
02:30:14,319 --> 02:30:16,389
you know huge you know impossible to
believe blunders in some sense

8994
02:30:16,389 --> 02:30:16,399
believe blunders in some sense
 

8995
02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:17,670
believe blunders in some sense
um it's too bad because he could have

8996
02:30:17,670 --> 02:30:17,680
um it's too bad because he could have
 

8997
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:19,590
um it's too bad because he could have
had a good career as i would say uh and

8998
02:30:19,590 --> 02:30:19,600
had a good career as i would say uh and
 

8999
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:21,670
had a good career as i would say uh and
galileo was like that too in other words

9000
02:30:21,670 --> 02:30:21,680
galileo was like that too in other words
 

9001
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:24,870
galileo was like that too in other words
he would fall victim to i think this

9002
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:24,880
he would fall victim to i think this
 

9003
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:27,110
he would fall victim to i think this
confirmation bias that all scientists

9004
02:30:27,110 --> 02:30:27,120
confirmation bias that all scientists
 

9005
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:29,190
confirmation bias that all scientists
have to guard their lives against their

9006
02:30:29,190 --> 02:30:29,200
have to guard their lives against their
 

9007
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:31,190
have to guard their lives against their
careers their brands their reputations

9008
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:31,200
careers their brands their reputations
 

9009
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:33,590
careers their brands their reputations

confirmation bias is a hell of a drug uh
 

9027
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:52,070
confirmation bias is a hell of a drug uh
because it it really you know reinforces

because it it really you know reinforces

this notion which is partially sunk cost
 

9031
02:30:54,399 --> 02:30:56,070

you put so much time effort money

9032
02:30:56,070 --> 02:30:56,080
you put so much time effort money
 

9033

9035
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:00,469
reputation into it you don't want to be
wrong and go back on it and with galileo

9036
02:31:00,469 --> 02:31:00,479
wrong and go back on it and with galileo
 

9037
02:31:00,479 --> 02:31:02,950
wrong and go back on it and with galileo
he would uh he would be

9038

he would uh he would be
 

9039

um and he would use as evidence very

9052
02:31:17,510 --> 02:31:17,520
um and he would use as evidence very
 

9053
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:19,750
um and he would use as evidence very
very interesting ideas that all of which

9054
02:31:19,750 --> 02:31:19,760
very interesting ideas that all of which
 

9055
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:21,750
very interesting ideas that all of which
were wrong basically and in fact we

9056
02:31:21,750 --> 02:31:21,760
were wrong basically and in fact we
 

9057
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:23,830
were wrong basically and in fact we
weren't able to prove that the earth

9058
02:31:23,830 --> 02:31:23,840
weren't able to prove that the earth
 

9059
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:25,670
weren't able to prove that the earth
orbited around the sun and i ask you

9060
02:31:25,670 --> 02:31:25,680
orbited around the sun and i ask you
 

9061
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:27,830
orbited around the sun and i ask you
like can you prove the earth is is not

9062
02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:27,840
like can you prove the earth is is not
 

9063
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:29,510
like can you prove the earth is is not
flat no well you're a flat earther

not yeah and much harder is to prove
 

9085
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,590
not yeah and much harder is to prove
that the earth goes around the sun in

give them a little bit of humility
because i think to be a good scientist

9098
02:32:01,190 --> 02:32:01,200
because i think to be a good scientist
 

9099
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:02,790
because i think to be a good scientist
you need to be humble you need to have a

9100
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:02,800
you need to be humble you need to have a
 

9101
02:32:02,800 --> 02:32:04,150
you need to be humble you need to have a
little humility and you need to have

9102
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:04,160
little humility and you need to have
 

9103
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:05,910
little humility and you need to have
swagger you need to feel like a little

9104
02:32:05,910 --> 02:32:05,920
swagger you need to feel like a little
 

9105
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:07,910
swagger you need to feel like a little
cocky like i can do this i can do this

9106
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:07,920
cocky like i can do this i can do this
 

9107
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,349
cocky like i can do this i can do this
thing that einstein by definition

9108
02:32:09,349 --> 02:32:09,359
thing that einstein by definition
 

9109
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:11,270
thing that einstein by definition
couldn't do i'm going to attempt it i'm

9110
02:32:11,270 --> 02:32:11,280
couldn't do i'm going to attempt it i'm
 

9111
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:12,710
couldn't do i'm going to attempt it i'm
going to attempt to do what was

9112
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:12,720
going to attempt to do what was
 

9113
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:15,349
going to attempt to do what was
impossible just a generation ago how do

9114
02:32:15,349 --> 02:32:15,359
impossible just a generation ago how do
 

9115
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:17,830
impossible just a generation ago how do
you uh prove that the earth goes around

9116
02:32:17,830 --> 02:32:17,840
you uh prove that the earth goes around
 

9117
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:19,830
you uh prove that the earth goes around
the sun do you have to

9118
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:19,840
the sun do you have to
 

9119
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:22,309
the sun do you have to
is it by the motion of other planets so

9120
02:32:22,309 --> 02:32:22,319
is it by the motion of other planets so
 

9121
02:32:22,319 --> 02:32:23,510
is it by the motion of other planets so
there are many ways to do it i mean

9122
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:23,520
there are many ways to do it i mean
 

9123
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:24,710
there are many ways to do it i mean
obviously you could take a spaceship

9124
02:32:24,710 --> 02:32:24,720
obviously you could take a spaceship
 

9125
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:27,110
obviously you could take a spaceship
park it at the north celestial pole of

9126
02:32:27,110 --> 02:32:27,120
park it at the north celestial pole of
 

9127
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:29,030
park it at the north celestial pole of
our solar system and and just watch what

9128
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:29,040
our solar system and and just watch what
 

9129
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:31,190
our solar system and and just watch what
happens uh but obviously that wasn't how

9130
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:31,200
happens uh but obviously that wasn't how
 

9131
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:33,030
happens uh but obviously that wasn't how
was discovered in the late 1700s so it's

9132
02:32:33,030 --> 02:32:33,040
was discovered in the late 1700s so it's
 

9133
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:35,110
was discovered in the late 1700s so it's
called aberration so if you look at

9134
02:32:35,110 --> 02:32:35,120
called aberration so if you look at
 

9135
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:38,150
called aberration so if you look at
stars um uh as the earth orbits around

9136
02:32:38,150 --> 02:32:38,160
stars um uh as the earth orbits around
 

9137
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:40,309
stars um uh as the earth orbits around
the sun uh the position of the stars

9138
02:32:40,309 --> 02:32:40,319
the sun uh the position of the stars
 

9139
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:42,630
the sun uh the position of the stars
will shift slightly because of the tilt

9140
02:32:42,630 --> 02:32:42,640
will shift slightly because of the tilt
 

9141
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:44,070
will shift slightly because of the tilt
of the earth and because the earth is in

9142
02:32:44,070 --> 02:32:44,080
of the earth and because the earth is in
 

9143
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:46,070
of the earth and because the earth is in
motion around the earth and around the

9144
02:32:46,070 --> 02:32:46,080
motion around the earth and around the
 

9145
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:48,389
motion around the earth and around the
sun and because the earth has a non a

9146
02:32:48,389 --> 02:32:48,399

the stars will trace out little tiny

9154
02:32:55,110 --> 02:32:55,120
the stars will trace out little tiny
 

9155
02:32:55,120 --> 02:32:57,030
the stars will trace out little tiny
ellipses and those will correspond to

9156
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:57,040
ellipses and those will correspond to
 

9157
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:59,110
ellipses and those will correspond to
the fact that we're moving around

9158
02:32:59,110 --> 02:32:59,120
the fact that we're moving around
 

9159
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:00,790
the fact that we're moving around
if they're at infinite distance which we

9160
02:33:00,790 --> 02:33:00,800
if they're at infinite distance which we
 

9161
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:02,070
if they're at infinite distance which we
assume that they are they're not really

02:33:02,070 --> 02:33:02,080
assume that they are they're not really
 

9163
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:03,750
assume that they are they're not really

02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:09,840
and that was the first way it was
 

9173
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:11,429

that i have other proofs for it
one of which is that the earth has tides

9214
02:33:47,910 --> 02:33:47,920
one of which is that the earth has tides
 

9215
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:49,670
one of which is that the earth has tides
and the tides come in and out twice a

around the sun say this is the sun here
 

9225
02:33:57,439 --> 02:33:59,030
around the sun say this is the sun here
and it's moving around the sun but it's

9226
02:33:59,030 --> 02:33:59,040
and it's moving around the sun but it's
 

9227
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,550
and it's moving around the sun but it's
also rotating on its axis see how the

in his hand half drunk
 

9245
02:34:16,240 --> 02:34:17,990
in his hand half drunk
and we're both

and we're both
 

9247
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,870
and we're both
drunk and whatever else is possible so

9248
02:34:20,870 --> 02:34:20,880
drunk and whatever else is possible so
 

9249
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:22,630
drunk and whatever else is possible so
as it sloshed around he claimed that was

9251
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:23,830
as it sloshed around he claimed that was

02:42:24,389 --> 02:42:24,399
other planet that's actually how neptune
 

9715
02:42:24,399 --> 02:42:26,230
other planet that's actually how neptune
was discovered neptune was discovered

9716
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:26,240
was discovered neptune was discovered
 

9717
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:27,590
was discovered neptune was discovered
because of the anomalous behavior of the

9718
02:42:27,590 --> 02:42:27,600
because of the anomalous behavior of the
 

9719
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:30,150
because of the anomalous behavior of the
planet uranus so neptune was dark we

9720
02:42:30,150 --> 02:42:30,160
planet uranus so neptune was dark we
 

9721
02:42:30,160 --> 02:42:31,990
planet uranus so neptune was dark we
couldn't see it it was tugging on uranus

9722
02:42:31,990 --> 02:42:32,000
couldn't see it it was tugging on uranus
 

9723
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,870
couldn't see it it was tugging on uranus
in a certain way and that led to laverie

9724
02:42:34,870 --> 02:42:34,880
in a certain way and that led to laverie
 

9725
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:36,469
in a certain way and that led to laverie
discovering the planet predicting where

9726
02:42:36,469 --> 02:42:36,479
discovering the planet predicting where
 

9727
02:42:36,479 --> 02:42:38,070
discovering the planet predicting where
this planet should be found

9728
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:38,080
this planet should be found
 

9729
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:40,150
this planet should be found
so it had a good heritage in physics

9730
02:42:40,150 --> 02:42:40,160
so it had a good heritage in physics
 

9731
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:41,670
so it had a good heritage in physics
right to predict this planet that you

9732
02:42:41,670 --> 02:42:41,680
right to predict this planet that you
 

9733
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:43,510
right to predict this planet that you
couldn't see that worked but einstein

9734
02:42:43,510 --> 02:42:43,520
couldn't see that worked but einstein
 

9735
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:46,070
couldn't see that worked but einstein
said no um it's caused by the warping

9736
02:42:46,070 --> 02:42:46,080
said no um it's caused by the warping
 

9737
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:47,910
said no um it's caused by the warping
and bending of space-time due to the

9738
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:47,920
and bending of space-time due to the
 

9739
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:49,510
and bending of space-time due to the
presence of matter

9740
02:42:49,510 --> 02:42:49,520
presence of matter
 

9741
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:50,950
presence of matter
would later become known as the einstein

9742
02:42:50,950 --> 02:42:50,960
would later become known as the einstein
 

9743
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:53,429
would later become known as the einstein
equations so he he explained why mercury

9744
02:42:53,429 --> 02:42:53,439
equations so he he explained why mercury
 

9745
02:42:53,439 --> 02:42:54,870
equations so he he explained why mercury
did that he didn't it was known since

9746
02:42:54,870 --> 02:42:54,880
did that he didn't it was known since
 

9747
02:42:54,880 --> 02:42:56,469
did that he didn't it was known since
the time of newton that mercury was

9748
02:42:56,469 --> 02:42:56,479
the time of newton that mercury was
 

9749
02:42:56,479 --> 02:42:58,710
the time of newton that mercury was
behaving in this really freaky way so he

9750
02:42:58,710 --> 02:42:58,720
behaving in this really freaky way so he
 

9751
02:42:58,720 --> 02:43:00,469
behaving in this really freaky way so he
didn't predict it he retrodicted it

9752
02:43:00,469 --> 02:43:00,479
didn't predict it he retrodicted it
 

9753
02:43:00,479 --> 02:43:02,710
didn't predict it he retrodicted it
that's fine but at some point you should

9754
02:43:02,710 --> 02:43:02,720
that's fine but at some point you should
 

9755
02:43:02,720 --> 02:43:04,150
that's fine but at some point you should
come up with something new that's

9756
02:43:04,150 --> 02:43:04,160
come up with something new that's
 

9757
02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:06,309
come up with something new that's
uniquely predictive of your theory as i

9758
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:06,319
uniquely predictive of your theory as i
 

9759
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:08,550
uniquely predictive of your theory as i
just said the theory of dark matter in

9760
02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:08,560
just said the theory of dark matter in
 

9761
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:10,309
just said the theory of dark matter in
the context of neptune is actually a

9762
02:43:10,309 --> 02:43:10,319
the context of neptune is actually a
 

9763
02:43:10,319 --> 02:43:11,910
the context of neptune is actually a
valid theory it just happens not to make

9764
02:43:11,910 --> 02:43:11,920
valid theory it just happens not to make
 

9765
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:13,590
valid theory it just happens not to make
sense in the context of

02:43:13,590 --> 02:43:13,600
sense in the context of
 

9767
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:16,309
sense in the context of
vulcan and so um if he had kept doing

9768
02:43:16,309 --> 02:43:16,319
vulcan and so um if he had kept doing
 

9769
02:43:16,319 --> 02:43:19,110
vulcan and so um if he had kept doing
that maybe you know maybe perhaps he

9770
02:43:19,110 --> 02:43:19,120
that maybe you know maybe perhaps he
 

9771
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:20,630
that maybe you know maybe perhaps he
wouldn't have come up with these other

9772
02:43:20,630 --> 02:43:20,640
wouldn't have come up with these other
 

9773
02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:22,230
wouldn't have come up with these other
predictions that he would later reject

9774
02:43:22,230 --> 02:43:22,240
predictions that he would later reject
 

9775
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:23,830
predictions that he would later reject
like he rejected the existence of

9776
02:43:23,830 --> 02:43:23,840
like he rejected the existence of
 

9777
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:25,670
like he rejected the existence of
gravitational waves you and barry talked

9778
02:43:25,670 --> 02:43:25,680
gravitational waves you and barry talked
 

9779
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:27,429
gravitational waves you and barry talked
about that he didn't actually believe it

9780
02:43:27,429 --> 02:43:27,439
about that he didn't actually believe it
 

9781
02:43:27,439 --> 02:43:28,950
about that he didn't actually believe it
was the one peer-reviewed paper that he

9782
02:43:28,950 --> 02:43:28,960
was the one peer-reviewed paper that he
 

9783
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:30,790
was the one peer-reviewed paper that he
had you know he used to send back in

9784
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:30,800
had you know he used to send back in
 

9785
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:32,550
had you know he used to send back in
those days he sent a letter to nature

9786
02:43:32,550 --> 02:43:32,560
those days he sent a letter to nature
 

9787
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:34,790
those days he sent a letter to nature
physical review publish this you know

9788
02:43:34,790 --> 02:43:34,800
physical review publish this you know
 

9789
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:36,710
physical review publish this you know
let me know how much it cost

9790
02:43:36,710 --> 02:43:36,720
let me know how much it cost
 

9791
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:38,230
let me know how much it cost
and they got it rejected because he said

9792
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:38,240
and they got it rejected because he said
 

9793
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:40,469
and they got it rejected because he said
you can't detect gravitational waves and

9794
02:43:40,469 --> 02:43:40,479
you can't detect gravitational waves and
 

9795
02:43:40,479 --> 02:43:41,990
you can't detect gravitational waves and
actually or they're not real and the

9796
02:43:41,990 --> 02:43:42,000
actually or they're not real and the
 

9797
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,110
actually or they're not real and the
guys show that they're real because he

9798
02:43:43,110 --> 02:43:43,120
guys show that they're real because he
 

9799
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:45,510
guys show that they're real because he
can't corrected a math error in einstein

9800
02:43:45,510 --> 02:43:45,520
can't corrected a math error in einstein
 

9801
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:48,070
can't corrected a math error in einstein
and rosen's paper um so it's fascinating

9802
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:48,080
and rosen's paper um so it's fascinating
 

9803
02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:50,710
and rosen's paper um so it's fascinating
what should the assayer do he or she

9804
02:43:50,710 --> 02:43:50,720
what should the assayer do he or she
 

9805
02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:52,630
what should the assayer do he or she
should look at these theories look what

9806
02:43:52,630 --> 02:43:52,640
should look at these theories look what
 

9807
02:43:52,640 --> 02:43:54,469
should look at these theories look what
things they explain that already exist

9808
02:43:54,469 --> 02:43:54,479
things they explain that already exist
 

9809
02:43:54,479 --> 02:43:56,550
things they explain that already exist
and look at what new predictions they

9810
02:43:56,550 --> 02:43:56,560
and look at what new predictions they
 

9811
02:43:56,560 --> 02:43:57,349
and look at what new predictions they
can

9812
02:43:57,349 --> 02:43:57,359
can
 

9813
02:43:57,359 --> 02:43:59,590
can
claim to explain if we can build

9814
02:43:59,590 --> 02:43:59,600
claim to explain if we can build
 

9815
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:01,910
claim to explain if we can build
experiments to ch to test them so you

9816
02:44:01,910 --> 02:44:01,920
experiments to ch to test them so you
 

9817
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:03,190
experiments to ch to test them so you
have to kind of challenge yourself to

9818
02:44:03,190 --> 02:44:03,200
have to kind of challenge yourself to
 

9819
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:05,990
have to kind of challenge yourself to
think about what kind of predictions

9820
02:44:05,990 --> 02:44:06,000
think about what kind of predictions
 

9821
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,150
think about what kind of predictions
can they make such that we can construct

9822
02:44:08,150 --> 02:44:08,160
can they make such that we can construct
 

9823
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:10,870
can they make such that we can construct
experiments so that's like ultimately

9824
02:44:10,870 --> 02:44:10,880
experiments so that's like ultimately
 

9825
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:13,429
experiments so that's like ultimately
back going to this

9826
02:44:13,429 --> 02:44:13,439
back going to this
 

9827
02:44:13,439 --> 02:44:16,030
back going to this
to the signal to the

9828
02:44:16,030 --> 02:44:16,040
to the signal to the
 

9829
02:44:16,040 --> 02:44:18,550
to the signal to the
experimenters theorists essentially

9830
02:44:18,550 --> 02:44:18,560
experimenters theorists essentially
 

9831
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:21,190
experimenters theorists essentially
that's right so like very experiment

9832
02:44:21,190 --> 02:44:21,200
that's right so like very experiment
 

9833
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:22,870
that's right so like very experiment

galileo like einstein has patents for

9856
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:44,800
galileo like einstein has patents for
 

9857
02:44:44,800 --> 02:44:47,030
galileo like einstein has patents for
things that he invented

9858
02:44:47,030 --> 02:44:47,040
things that he invented
 

9859
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:48,389
things that he invented
and then you know some of his work led

9860
02:44:48,389 --> 02:44:48,399
and then you know some of his work led
 

9861
02:44:48,399 --> 02:44:50,710
and then you know some of his work led
to the laser and the mazer um so he had

9862
02:44:50,710 --> 02:44:50,720
to the laser and the mazer um so he had
 

9863
02:44:50,720 --> 02:44:52,550
to the laser and the mazer um so he had
practical it wasn't just pure airy fairy

9864
02:44:52,550 --> 02:44:52,560
practical it wasn't just pure airy fairy

02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:54,630
practical it wasn't just pure airy fairy
you know quantum reality and expanding

9866
02:44:54,630 --> 02:44:54,640
you know quantum reality and expanding
 

9867
02:44:54,640 --> 02:44:57,269
you know quantum reality and expanding
universe um so in this case what i want

9868
02:44:57,269 --> 02:44:57,279
universe um so in this case what i want
 

9869
02:44:57,279 --> 02:44:58,870
universe um so in this case what i want
to do is look at you know there's 10

9870
02:44:58,870 --> 02:44:58,880
to do is look at you know there's 10
 

9871
02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:00,070
to do is look at you know there's 10
different theories of everything or

9872
02:45:00,070 --> 02:45:00,080
different theories of everything or
 

9873
02:45:00,080 --> 02:45:01,750
different theories of everything or
cosmological models they make

9874
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:01,760
cosmological models they make
 

9875
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:03,190
cosmological models they make
predictions they have advantages and

9876
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:03,200
predictions they have advantages and
 

9877
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:05,190
predictions they have advantages and
disadvantages and i'm just asking the

9878
02:45:05,190 --> 02:45:05,200
disadvantages and i'm just asking the
 

9879
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:06,950
disadvantages and i'm just asking the
question why aren't we applying bayesian

9880
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:06,960
question why aren't we applying bayesian
 

9881
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:09,030
question why aren't we applying bayesian
reasoning with confidence intervals why

9882
02:45:09,030 --> 02:45:09,040
reasoning with confidence intervals why
 

9883
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:10,389
reasoning with confidence intervals why
don't we have updates every time an

9884
02:45:10,389 --> 02:45:10,399
don't we have updates every time an
 

9885
02:45:10,399 --> 02:45:11,830
don't we have updates every time an
experiment comes out

9886
02:45:11,830 --> 02:45:11,840
experiment comes out
 

9887
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:13,349
experiment comes out
we can update our credulity in that

9888
02:45:13,349 --> 02:45:13,359
we can update our credulity in that
 

9889
02:45:13,359 --> 02:45:15,429
we can update our credulity in that
experiment or that theory rather based

9890
02:45:15,429 --> 02:45:15,439
experiment or that theory rather based
 

9891
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:17,510
experiment or that theory rather based
on the results of the experiment and we

9892
02:45:17,510 --> 02:45:17,520
on the results of the experiment and we
 

9893
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:19,190
on the results of the experiment and we
shouldn't do it after the fact or as you

9894
02:45:19,190 --> 02:45:19,200
shouldn't do it after the fact or as you
 

9895

shouldn't do it after the fact or as you
know michio kaku has said

10029
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:33,750
themselves are familiar and so i'm able
to see the the real beauty there and it

10030
02:47:33,750 --> 02:47:33,760
to see the the real beauty there and it
 

10031
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:35,269
to see the the real beauty there and it
saddens me

10032

others
 

10037
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:39,910
others
in the physics community can't also see

10038
02:47:39,910 --> 02:47:39,920
in the physics community can't also see
 

10039
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:41,110
in the physics community can't also see
the beauty

10040
02:47:41,110 --> 02:47:41,120
the beauty
 

10041
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:43,510
the beauty
like give it a chance give a chance to

like give it a chance give a chance to
see the beauty and then your respect

10044
02:47:45,429 --> 02:47:45,439
see the beauty and then your respect
 

10045
02:47:45,439 --> 02:47:47,670
see the beauty and then your respect
right so there is one person who does

10046
02:47:47,670 --> 02:47:47,680
right so there is one person who does
 

10047
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:49,670
right so there is one person who does
take time and is

take time and is
 

10049
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:51,590
take time and is
what i consider to be a great scientist

10050
02:47:51,590 --> 02:47:51,600
what i consider to be a great scientist
 

10051
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:53,750
what i consider to be a great scientist
in terms of what he thinks he obviously

10052
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:53,760
in terms of what he thinks he obviously
 

10053
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:55,670
in terms of what he thinks he obviously
has invested interest in his own theory

10054
02:47:55,670 --> 02:47:55,680
has invested interest in his own theory
 

10055
02:47:55,680 --> 02:47:56,950
has invested interest in his own theory
and it's eric

10056

the history of physics and he has a
 

10063

great warmth and graciousness when it

and i've had look first of all i think
 

10071
02:48:10,720 --> 02:48:12,389
and i've had look first of all i think
debate is pointless like i don't know

like the red team approach in the
 

10091
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:30,469
like the red team approach in the

they may disagree on this on the tactics
 

10095
02:48:32,399 --> 02:48:34,389
they may disagree on this on the tactics
day-to-day but the strategy we have to

day-to-day but the strategy we have to
 

10097

i don't see that in very many of these

10102
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:39,120
i don't see that in very many of these
 

10103
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:41,269
i don't see that in very many of these
physicists from kaku i almost see it

10104
02:48:41,269 --> 02:48:41,279
physicists from kaku i almost see it
 

10105
02:48:41,279 --> 02:48:42,790
physicists from kaku i almost see it
it's embarrassing in some ways because

10106
02:48:42,790 --> 02:48:42,800
it's embarrassing in some ways because
 

10107
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:44,550
it's embarrassing in some ways because
they'll they'll almost mock with the

they'll they'll almost mock with the
 

10109
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:46,469
they'll they'll almost mock with the
exception of eric you know garrett's

10110
02:48:46,469 --> 02:48:46,479
exception of eric you know garrett's
 

10111
02:48:46,479 --> 02:48:48,150
exception of eric you know garrett's
interesting you know his theory is you

10112
02:48:48,150 --> 02:48:48,160
interesting you know his theory is you
 

10113
02:48:48,160 --> 02:48:50,309
interesting you know his theory is you
know people have a lot of issues very

10114
02:48:50,309 --> 02:48:50,319
know people have a lot of issues very
 

10115
02:48:50,319 --> 02:48:53,030
know people have a lot of issues very
technical uh but eric has taken the time

10116
02:48:53,030 --> 02:48:53,040
technical uh but eric has taken the time
 

10117
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:55,269
technical uh but eric has taken the time
to try to understand it eric has taken

10118
02:48:55,269 --> 02:48:55,279
to try to understand it eric has taken
 

10119
02:48:55,279 --> 02:48:56,710
to try to understand it eric has taken
the time to understand peter white's

10120
02:48:56,710 --> 02:48:56,720
the time to understand peter white's
 

10121
02:48:56,720 --> 02:48:59,269
the time to understand peter white's
theory and i i don't see i don't see the

10122
02:48:59,269 --> 02:48:59,279
theory and i i don't see i don't see the
 

10123
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:01,030
theory and i i don't see i don't see the
same graciousness extended from them i'm

10124
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:01,040
same graciousness extended from them i'm

hasn't extended the same for stephen
 

10133
02:49:07,439 --> 02:49:09,750
hasn't extended the same for stephen
wolfram because i think

10134
02:49:09,750 --> 02:49:09,760
wolfram because i think
 

10135
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:11,750
wolfram because i think
no he did no actually no he did i had a

10136
02:49:11,750 --> 02:49:11,760
no he did no actually no he did i had a
 

10137
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:13,590
no he did no actually no he did i had a
debate with them live on my show no i

10138
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:13,600
debate with them live on my show no i
 

10139
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:15,269
debate with them live on my show no i
did i listened to it but like i just

10140
02:49:15,269 --> 02:49:15,279
did i listened to it but like i just
 

10141
02:49:15,279 --> 02:49:17,429
did i listened to it but like i just
think it's outside of the toolkit oh

10142
02:49:17,429 --> 02:49:17,439
think it's outside of the toolkit oh
 

10143
02:49:17,439 --> 02:49:19,269
think it's outside of the toolkit oh
that eric is comfortable with so it's

10144
02:49:19,269 --> 02:49:19,279
that eric is comfortable with so it's
 

10145
02:49:19,279 --> 02:49:21,750
that eric is comfortable with so it's
not it's not that he's not but you're

10146
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:21,760
not it's not that he's not but you're
 

10147
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:24,830
not it's not that he's not but you're
the main thing that's often absent and

10148
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:24,840
the main thing that's often absent and
 

10149
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:28,309
the main thing that's often absent and
eric does have is like the willingness

10150
02:49:28,309 --> 02:49:28,319
eric does have is like the willingness
 

10151
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:30,150
eric does have is like the willingness
and like not just like dismissing or

10152
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:30,160
and like not just like dismissing or
 

10153
02:49:30,160 --> 02:49:32,230
and like not just like dismissing or
mocking the that he's he's reaching out

10154
02:49:32,230 --> 02:49:32,240
mocking the that he's he's reaching out
 

10155
02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:34,630
mocking the that he's he's reaching out
but okay i mean what if it's not

10157
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:35,910
but okay i mean what if it's not
you know i made a joke when they were on

10158
02:49:35,910 --> 02:49:35,920
you know i made a joke when they were on
 

10159
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:37,269
you know i made a joke when they were on
i was like how many theories of

10160
02:49:37,269 --> 02:49:37,279
i was like how many theories of
 

10161
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:38,469
i was like how many theories of
everything can there be you know

10162
02:49:38,469 --> 02:49:38,479
everything can there be you know
 

10163
02:49:38,479 --> 02:49:40,230
everything can there be you know
highlander you know there can be only

10164

highlander you know there can be only
 

10165
02:49:40,240 --> 02:49:42,469
highlander you know there can be only
one you know i don't know maybe but he

of course also like the other folks who
 

10169
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:47,030
of course also like the other folks who
propose a theory has um

10170
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:47,040
propose a theory has um
 

10171
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:49,750
propose a theory has um
in ego yeah

10172

so there's also the public

10404
02:53:51,990 --> 02:53:52,000
so there's also the public
 

10405

so there's also the public
uh

so there's a very narrow community

10410

so there's a very narrow community
 

10411

the exploration of ideas is perceived by
 

10417
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:08,469
the exploration of ideas is perceived by
the public and so there is a cert

and that in itself
 

10429
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:22,309
and that in itself
might become the thing that gives you

10663
02:58:21,439 --> 02:58:23,269

at least for me but
 

10665
02:58:23,279 --> 02:58:25,510
at least for me but
if you realize that you forgot to put

10749
02:59:44,479 --> 02:59:46,469
faster so there's a part of me when i'm
planning the diet and the meals and the

10750
02:59:46,469 --> 02:59:46,479
planning the diet and the meals and the
 

10751
02:59:46,479 --> 02:59:48,550
planning the diet and the meals and the
exercise that i get a little bit of that

10752
02:59:48,550 --> 02:59:48,560
exercise that i get a little bit of that
 

10753
02:59:48,560 --> 02:59:50,469
exercise that i get a little bit of that
thrill and that actually saps a little

10754
02:59:50,469 --> 02:59:50,479
thrill and that actually saps a little
 

10755
02:59:50,479 --> 02:59:51,670
thrill and that actually saps a little
bit of my willpower to actually complete

10756
02:59:51,670 --> 02:59:51,680
bit of my willpower to actually complete
 

10757
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:53,269
bit of my willpower to actually complete
the task that will take me to that goal

10758
02:59:53,269 --> 02:59:53,279
the task that will take me to that goal
 

10759
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:54,790

the experts say
there's a good rule ray dalio writes

10804
03:00:40,389 --> 03:00:40,399
there's a good rule ray dalio writes
 

10805
03:00:40,399 --> 03:00:42,150
there's a good rule ray dalio writes
about in principles he says an expert is

10806
03:00:42,150 --> 03:00:42,160
about in principles he says an expert is
 

10807
03:00:42,160 --> 03:00:43,750
about in principles he says an expert is
someone who's done something three times

10808
03:00:43,750 --> 03:00:43,760
someone who's done something three times
 

10809
03:00:43,760 --> 03:00:45,990
someone who's done something three times
successfully like you can do one

10810
03:00:45,990 --> 03:00:46,000
successfully like you can do one
 

10811
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:47,429
successfully like you can do one
something correctly once you could do

10812
03:00:47,429 --> 03:00:47,439
something correctly once you could do
 

10813
03:00:47,439 --> 03:00:48,950
something correctly once you could do
something correctly it's very hard to

10814
03:00:48,950 --> 03:00:48,960
something correctly it's very hard to
 

10815
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:51,269
something correctly it's very hard to
pull off like three projects three

10816
03:00:51,269 --> 03:00:51,279
pull off like three projects three
 

10817
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:52,469
pull off like three projects three
telescopes

10818
03:00:52,469 --> 03:00:52,479
telescopes
 

10819
03:00:52,479 --> 03:00:55,429
telescopes
three whatever right so um so look for

10820
03:00:55,429 --> 03:00:55,439
three whatever right so um so look for
 

10821
03:00:55,439 --> 03:00:57,269
three whatever right so um so look for
uh it's arbitrary could be four it could

10822
03:00:57,269 --> 03:00:57,279
uh it's arbitrary could be four it could
 

10823
03:00:57,279 --> 03:00:59,269
uh it's arbitrary could be four it could
be two right but the point is look at

10824
03:00:59,269 --> 03:00:59,279
be two right but the point is look at
 

10825
03:00:59,279 --> 03:01:00,550
be two right but the point is look at
eric so how many things has he

10826
03:01:00,550 --> 03:01:00,560
eric so how many things has he
 

10827
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:03,110
eric so how many things has he
contributed to and made you know pretty

10828
03:01:03,110 --> 03:01:03,120
contributed to and made you know pretty
 

10829
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:05,670
contributed to and made you know pretty
substantive kind of uh paradigm shifts

10830
03:01:05,670 --> 03:01:05,680
substantive kind of uh paradigm shifts
 

10831
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:07,269
substantive kind of uh paradigm shifts
for different people i would say he's

10832
03:01:07,269 --> 03:01:07,279
for different people i would say he's
 

10833
03:01:07,279 --> 03:01:09,590
for different people i would say he's
been right many times does that mean

10834
03:01:09,590 --> 03:01:09,600
been right many times does that mean
 

10835
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:11,510
been right many times does that mean
he's infallible that he's ineffable no

he's infallible that he's ineffable no
 

10837
03:01:11,520 --> 03:01:13,750
he's infallible that he's ineffable no
of course not for me so what i'm saying

10838
03:01:13,750 --> 03:01:13,760
of course not for me so what i'm saying
 

10839
03:01:13,760 --> 03:01:16,630
of course not for me so what i'm saying
is i get a little bit of the joy of kind

is i get a little bit of the joy of kind
 

10841
03:01:16,640 --> 03:01:18,950
is i get a little bit of the joy of kind
of learning something purely

of nonsense of undergraduate and go
 

10873
03:01:48,720 --> 03:01:50,309
of nonsense of undergraduate and go
straight to graduate school and i've

10874
03:01:50,309 --> 03:01:50,319
straight to graduate school and i've
 

10875
03:01:50,319 --> 03:01:52,150
straight to graduate school and i've
tried to encourage him that maybe he

10876
03:01:52,150 --> 03:01:52,160
tried to encourage him that maybe he
 

10877
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:53,670
tried to encourage him that maybe he
could do it maybe he can't but there's

10878
03:01:53,670 --> 03:01:53,680
could do it maybe he can't but there's
 

10879
03:01:53,680 --> 03:01:55,750
could do it maybe he can't but there's
no other way than to try and so we've

i've prepared a whole curriculum for zev
to basically bypass all of undergraduate

10884
03:01:59,510 --> 03:01:59,520
to basically bypass all of undergraduate
 

10885
03:01:59,520 --> 03:02:01,590
to basically bypass all of undergraduate
and to his credit he he's earns all the

10886
03:02:01,590 --> 03:02:01,600
and to his credit he he's earns all the
 

10887

matches many of my graduates okay hold

10890
03:02:05,349 --> 03:02:05,359
matches many of my graduates okay hold
 

10891
03:02:05,359 --> 03:02:07,510
matches many of my graduates okay hold
on a second i have to push back and this

10892
03:02:07,510 --> 03:02:07,520
on a second i have to push back and this
 

10893
03:02:07,520 --> 03:02:09,670
on a second i have to push back and this
is me saying it and i'll yeah i'm sure

10894
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:09,680
is me saying it and i'll yeah i'm sure
 

10895
03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:11,510
is me saying it and i'll yeah i'm sure
i'll talk to eric about this

10896
03:02:11,510 --> 03:02:11,520
i'll talk to eric about this
 

10897
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:12,870
i'll talk to eric about this
but to say

10898
03:02:12,870 --> 03:02:12,880
but to say
 

10899
03:02:12,880 --> 03:02:14,230
but to say
you said

10900
03:02:14,230 --> 03:02:14,240
you said
 

10901
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:15,590
you said
eric's done

10902
03:02:15,590 --> 03:02:15,600
eric's done
 

10903
03:02:15,600 --> 03:02:17,910
eric's done
was right on multiple

10904
03:02:17,910 --> 03:02:17,920
was right on multiple
 

10905
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:19,190
was right on multiple
things

10906
03:02:19,190 --> 03:02:19,200
things
 

10907
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:21,830
things
i think eric has a

10908
03:02:21,830 --> 03:02:21,840
i think eric has a
 

10909
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:23,750
i think eric has a
great deep

10910
03:02:23,750 --> 03:02:23,760
great deep
 

10911
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:26,389
great deep
insight about human nature and how

10912
03:02:26,389 --> 03:02:26,399
insight about human nature and how
 

10913
03:02:26,399 --> 03:02:29,110
insight about human nature and how
societies work and he says a lot of wise

10914
03:02:29,110 --> 03:02:29,120
societies work and he says a lot of wise
 

10915
03:02:29,120 --> 03:02:31,510
societies work and he says a lot of wise
words on that world

10916
03:02:31,510 --> 03:02:31,520
words on that world
 

10917
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:33,670
words on that world
but i think if we're talking about

10918
03:02:33,670 --> 03:02:33,680
but i think if we're talking about
 

10919
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:35,910
but i think if we're talking about
experts you kind of have to prove you

10920
03:02:35,910 --> 03:02:35,920
experts you kind of have to prove you
 

10921
03:02:35,920 --> 03:02:37,190
experts you kind of have to prove you
know it's like michael jordan playing

10922
03:02:37,190 --> 03:02:37,200
know it's like michael jordan playing
 

10923
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:38,469
know it's like michael jordan playing
baseball

10924
03:02:38,469 --> 03:02:38,479
baseball
 

10925
03:02:38,479 --> 03:02:40,309
baseball
like he's proved it many times that he

10926
03:02:40,309 --> 03:02:40,319
like he's proved it many times that he
 

10927
03:02:40,319 --> 03:02:41,910
like he's proved it many times that he
can play basketball

10928
03:02:41,910 --> 03:02:41,920
can play basketball
 

10929
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:43,590
can play basketball
but he's also got to prove that he can

10930
03:02:43,590 --> 03:02:43,600
but he's also got to prove that he can
 

10931
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:45,910
but he's also got to prove that he can
play baseball and i would say the whole

10932
03:02:45,910 --> 03:02:45,920
play baseball and i would say the whole
 

10933
03:02:45,920 --> 03:02:49,590
play baseball and i would say the whole
point of i mean of radical ideas

10934
03:02:49,590 --> 03:02:49,600
point of i mean of radical ideas
 

10935
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:51,269
point of i mean of radical ideas
is you're not

10936
03:02:51,269 --> 03:02:51,279
is you're not
 

10937
03:02:51,279 --> 03:02:53,910
is you're not
i mean it's very hard to be sitting on a

10938
03:02:53,910 --> 03:02:53,920
i mean it's very hard to be sitting on a
 

10939
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:55,910
i mean it's very hard to be sitting on a
track record of i mean you're when

10940
03:02:55,910 --> 03:02:55,920
track record of i mean you're when
 

10941
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:58,150
track record of i mean you're when
you're swinging for the is always you're

10942
03:02:58,150 --> 03:02:58,160
you're swinging for the is always you're
 

10943
03:02:58,160 --> 03:03:01,990
you're swinging for the is always you're
uh there's not a track record to sit on

10944
03:03:01,990 --> 03:03:02,000
uh there's not a track record to sit on
 

10945
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,150
uh there's not a track record to sit on
and uh like max tegmark is an example of

10946
03:03:04,150 --> 03:03:04,160
and uh like max tegmark is an example of
 

10947
03:03:04,160 --> 03:03:05,110
and uh like max tegmark is an example of
somebody

10948
03:03:05,110 --> 03:03:05,120
somebody
 

10949
03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:08,150
somebody
who has a huge track record of more like

10950
03:03:08,150 --> 03:03:08,160
who has a huge track record of more like
 

10951
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:10,230
who has a huge track record of more like
acceptable stuff but he also keeps

10952
03:03:10,230 --> 03:03:10,240
acceptable stuff but he also keeps
 

10953
03:03:10,240 --> 03:03:12,070
acceptable stuff but he also keeps
swinging for the fences in every other

10954
03:03:12,070 --> 03:03:12,080
swinging for the fences in every other
 

10955
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:14,710
swinging for the fences in every other

03:08:42,309 --> 03:08:42,319
you wouldn't get so passed on which
 

11265
03:08:42,319 --> 03:08:44,710
you wouldn't get so passed on which
aspect the strength yeah the m theory is

11266
03:08:44,710 --> 03:08:44,720
aspect the strength yeah the m theory is
 

11267
03:08:44,720 --> 03:08:46,150
aspect the strength yeah the m theory is
correct i mean here's let me just say

11268
03:08:46,150 --> 03:08:46,160
correct i mean here's let me just say
 

11269
03:08:46,160 --> 03:08:48,230
correct i mean here's let me just say
hawking hawking gets the ultimate pass

11270
03:08:48,230 --> 03:08:48,240
hawking hawking gets the ultimate pass
 

11271
03:08:48,240 --> 03:08:50,710
hawking hawking gets the ultimate pass
hawking would say things like m theory

11272
03:08:50,710 --> 03:08:50,720
hawking would say things like m theory
 

11273
03:08:50,720 --> 03:08:52,230
hawking would say things like m theory
there's zero evidence for it i mean

11274
03:08:52,230 --> 03:08:52,240
there's zero evidence for it i mean
 

11275
03:08:52,240 --> 03:08:53,830
there's zero evidence for it i mean
there's the famous meme that went around

11276
03:08:53,830 --> 03:08:53,840
there's the famous meme that went around
 

11277
03:08:53,840 --> 03:08:55,510
there's the famous meme that went around
this weekend like what is string theory

11278
03:08:55,510 --> 03:08:55,520
this weekend like what is string theory
 

11279
03:08:55,520 --> 03:08:56,870
this weekend like what is string theory
predicted and it's nothing and by the

11280
03:08:56,870 --> 03:08:56,880
predicted and it's nothing and by the
 

11281
03:08:56,880 --> 03:08:58,150
predicted and it's nothing and by the
way that's actually wrong i talked to

11282
03:08:58,150 --> 03:08:58,160
way that's actually wrong i talked to
 

11283
03:08:58,160 --> 03:08:59,590
way that's actually wrong i talked to
cameron i know you talked to carmen

11284
03:08:59,590 --> 03:08:59,600
cameron i know you talked to carmen
 

11285
03:08:59,600 --> 03:09:01,269
cameron i know you talked to carmen
carmen says that string theory does make

11286
03:09:01,269 --> 03:09:01,279
carmen says that string theory does make
 

11287
03:09:01,279 --> 03:09:03,030
carmen says that string theory does make
predictions it predicts the mass of the

11288
03:09:03,030 --> 03:09:03,040
predictions it predicts the mass of the
 

11289
03:09:03,040 --> 03:09:05,269
predictions it predicts the mass of the
electron lies between 10 to the minus 1

11290
03:09:05,269 --> 03:09:05,279
electron lies between 10 to the minus 1
 

11291
03:09:05,279 --> 03:09:06,790
electron lies between 10 to the minus 1
planck mass and 10 to the minus 30

11292
03:09:06,790 --> 03:09:06,800
planck mass and 10 to the minus 30
 

11293
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:09,590
planck mass and 10 to the minus 30
plagma okay whatever our electron it's a

11294
03:09:09,590 --> 03:09:09,600
plagma okay whatever our electron it's a
 

11295
03:09:09,600 --> 03:09:11,510
plagma okay whatever our electron it's a
big range it's a huge range

11296
03:09:11,510 --> 03:09:11,520
big range it's a huge range
 

11297
03:09:11,520 --> 03:09:13,510
big range it's a huge range
is that imagine qumran comes up and

11298
03:09:13,510 --> 03:09:13,520
is that imagine qumran comes up and
 

11299
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:15,830
is that imagine qumran comes up and
again he's just some nobody but he

11300
03:09:15,830 --> 03:09:15,840
again he's just some nobody but he
 

11301
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:16,710
again he's just some nobody but he
actually you know he doesn't have a

11302
03:09:16,710 --> 03:09:16,720
actually you know he doesn't have a
 

11303
03:09:16,720 --> 03:09:19,030
actually you know he doesn't have a
profile he's not harvard has zero h

11304
03:09:19,030 --> 03:09:19,040
profile he's not harvard has zero h
 

11305
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:21,110
profile he's not harvard has zero h
index or whatever eric says

11306
03:09:21,110 --> 03:09:21,120
index or whatever eric says
 

11307
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:23,030

why do we not like in other words why

11308
03:09:23,030 --> 03:09:23,040
why do we not like in other words why
 

11309
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:24,790
why do we not like in other words why
are we more harsh on people that are

11310
03:09:24,790 --> 03:09:24,800
are we more harsh on people that are
 

11311
03:09:24,800 --> 03:09:26,790
are we more harsh on people that are
that are trying you know the answer to

11312
03:09:26,790 --> 03:09:26,800
that are trying you know the answer to
 

11313
03:09:26,800 --> 03:09:29,910
that are trying you know the answer to
that so i get a million emails just like

11314
03:09:29,910 --> 03:09:29,920
that so i get a million emails just like
 

11315
03:09:29,920 --> 03:09:33,349
that so i get a million emails just like
you said you yourself where they proven

11316
03:09:33,349 --> 03:09:33,359
you said you yourself where they proven
 

11317
03:09:33,359 --> 03:09:35,269

in my world is artificial intelligence

11318
03:09:35,269 --> 03:09:35,279
in my world is artificial intelligence
 

11319
03:09:35,279 --> 03:09:35,990
in my world is artificial intelligence
the

11320
03:09:35,990 --> 03:09:36,000
the
 

11321
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:37,349
the
equivalence of that

11322
03:09:37,349 --> 03:09:37,359
equivalence of that
 

11323
03:09:37,359 --> 03:09:39,590
equivalence of that
uh is i figured out how to build

11324
03:09:39,590 --> 03:09:39,600
uh is i figured out how to build
 

11325
03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:41,670
uh is i figured out how to build
consciousness how to engineer

11326
03:09:41,670 --> 03:09:41,680
consciousness how to engineer
 

11327
03:09:41,680 --> 03:09:44,389
consciousness how to engineer
intelligence how to in and awesome you

11328
03:09:44,389 --> 03:09:44,399
intelligence how to in and awesome you
 

11329
03:09:44,399 --> 03:09:45,910
intelligence how to in and awesome you
should send your emails to me and i'll

11330
03:09:45,910 --> 03:09:45,920
should send your emails to me and i'll
 

11331
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:47,830
should send your emails to me and i'll
send my emails and we'll reply

send my emails and we'll reply
 

11333
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:49,670
send my emails and we'll reply
i mean i and i don't want to sort of

11334
03:09:49,670 --> 03:09:49,680
i mean i and i don't want to sort of
 

11335
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:51,750
i mean i and i don't want to sort of
mock this because i think it's very

11336
03:09:51,750 --> 03:09:51,760
mock this because i think it's very
 

11337
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:53,349
mock this because i think it's very
possible that there is

11338
03:09:53,349 --> 03:09:53,359
possible that there is
 

11339
03:09:53,359 --> 03:09:55,830
possible that there is
either kernels of interesting ideas or

11340
03:09:55,830 --> 03:09:55,840
either kernels of interesting ideas or
 

11341
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:58,469
either kernels of interesting ideas or
and whole like there is geniuses out

11342
03:09:58,469 --> 03:09:58,479
and whole like there is geniuses out
 

11343
03:09:58,479 --> 03:10:00,550
and whole like there is geniuses out
there that are unheard but the because

11344
03:10:00,550 --> 03:10:00,560
there that are unheard but the because
 

11345
03:10:00,560 --> 03:10:02,950
there that are unheard but the because
of so much noise

11346
03:10:02,950 --> 03:10:02,960
of so much noise
 

11347
03:10:02,960 --> 03:10:05,030
of so much noise
you do have to

11348
03:10:05,030 --> 03:10:05,040
you do have to
 

11349
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:06,150
you do have to
weigh

11350
03:10:06,150 --> 03:10:06,160
weigh
 

11351
03:10:06,160 --> 03:10:07,590
weigh
like uh

11352
03:10:07,590 --> 03:10:07,600
like uh
 

11353
03:10:07,600 --> 03:10:10,790
like uh
hire the edwins of the world when they

11354
03:10:10,790 --> 03:10:10,800
hire the edwins of the world when they
 

11355
03:10:10,800 --> 03:10:13,750
hire the edwins of the world when they
make statements and that's why you build

11356
03:10:13,750 --> 03:10:13,760
make statements and that's why you build
 

11357
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:15,510
make statements and that's why you build
up a track record as you just said with

11358
03:10:15,510 --> 03:10:15,520
up a track record as you just said with
 

11359
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:16,790
up a track record as you just said with
ray dalio

11360
03:10:16,790 --> 03:10:16,800
ray dalio
 

11361
03:10:16,800 --> 03:10:18,790
ray dalio
you have to show

11362
03:10:18,790 --> 03:10:18,800
you have to show
 

11363
03:10:18,800 --> 03:10:21,269
you have to show
that you can uh

11364
03:10:21,269 --> 03:10:21,279
that you can uh
 

11365
03:10:21,279 --> 03:10:23,750
that you can uh
like if you're pollock and you show us a

11366
03:10:23,750 --> 03:10:23,760
like if you're pollock and you show us a
 

11367
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:26,790
like if you're pollock and you show us a
painting of a bunch of chaos you have to

11368
03:10:26,790 --> 03:10:26,800
painting of a bunch of chaos you have to
 

11369
03:10:26,800 --> 03:10:28,389
painting of a bunch of chaos you have to
and this is a bad example probably

11370
03:10:28,389 --> 03:10:28,399
and this is a bad example probably
 

11371
03:10:28,399 --> 03:10:29,590
and this is a bad example probably
because he probably never showed this

11372
03:10:29,590 --> 03:10:29,600
because he probably never showed this
 

11373
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:32,469
because he probably never showed this
book he could do it right yeah

11374
03:10:32,469 --> 03:10:32,479
book he could do it right yeah
 

11375
03:10:32,479 --> 03:10:34,630
book he could do it right yeah
it's much more conf it's much more

11376
03:10:34,630 --> 03:10:34,640
it's much more conf it's much more
 

11377
03:10:34,640 --> 03:10:35,990
it's much more conf it's much more
comforting

11378
03:10:35,990 --> 03:10:36,000
comforting
 

11379
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:38,630
comforting
to see that they can paint a good

life of an apple on the table so there's

11384
03:10:43,990 --> 03:10:44,000
life of an apple on the table so there's
 

11385
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:45,750
life of an apple on the table so there's
a meteorite at a time because then i

11386
03:10:45,750 --> 03:10:45,760
a meteorite at a time because then i
 

11387
03:10:45,760 --> 03:10:47,429
a meteorite at a time because then i
mean um

11388
03:10:47,429 --> 03:10:47,439
mean um
 

11389
03:10:47,439 --> 03:10:49,190
mean um
uh because then

11390
03:10:49,190 --> 03:10:49,200
uh because then
 

11391
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:50,710
uh because then
there's something about the scientific

11392
03:10:50,710 --> 03:10:50,720
there's something about the scientific
 

11393
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:52,630
there's something about the scientific
community that they have perhaps an

11394
03:10:52,630 --> 03:10:52,640
community that they have perhaps an
 

11395
03:10:52,640 --> 03:10:54,950
community that they have perhaps an
oversensitive sensor to where

11396
03:10:54,950 --> 03:10:54,960
oversensitive sensor to where
 

11397
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:56,630
oversensitive sensor to where
they're not going to give the full

they're not going to give the full
 

11399
03:10:56,640 --> 03:10:58,630
they're not going to give the full
effort of their attention

11400
03:10:58,630 --> 03:10:58,640
effort of their attention
 

11401

if you don't have the track record now

11402

if you don't have the track record now
 

11403
03:11:00,399 --> 03:11:02,389
if you don't have the track record now
you could say that's the kind of club

11404
03:11:02,389 --> 03:11:02,399
you could say that's the kind of club
 

11405
03:11:02,399 --> 03:11:04,389
you could say that's the kind of club
that only you have to like you have to

11406
03:11:04,389 --> 03:11:04,399
that only you have to like you have to
 

11407

that only you have to like you have to
have 10 you have to this yes that exists

03:11:06,870 --> 03:11:06,880
have 10 you have to this yes that exists
 

11409
03:11:06,880 --> 03:11:07,670
have 10 you have to this yes that exists
but

11410
03:11:07,670 --> 03:11:07,680
but
 

11411
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:09,190
but
there's some aspect in which you have to

11412
03:11:09,190 --> 03:11:09,200
there's some aspect in which you have to
 

11413
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:11,429
there's some aspect in which you have to
play the game a little bit

11414
03:11:11,429 --> 03:11:11,439
play the game a little bit
 

11415
03:11:11,439 --> 03:11:13,670
play the game a little bit
to get the machine of science going

11416
03:11:13,670 --> 03:11:13,680
to get the machine of science going
 

11417
03:11:13,680 --> 03:11:15,190
to get the machine of science going

fear of your ideas being stolen and the
 

11719
03:16:06,319 --> 03:16:08,790
fear of your ideas being stolen and the
ego that's inherent to the scientific

03:16:08,790 --> 03:16:08,800
ego that's inherent to the scientific
 

11721
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:11,990
ego that's inherent to the scientific
pursuit and um right

11722
03:16:11,990 --> 03:16:12,000
pursuit and um right
 

11723
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:14,070
pursuit and um right
now that everybody's

11724
03:16:14,070 --> 03:16:14,080
now that everybody's
 

11725
03:16:14,080 --> 03:16:16,469
now that everybody's
established and known entities let go of

11726

that a little bit so we can

11728
03:16:18,229 --> 03:16:18,239
that a little bit so we can
 

11729
03:16:18,239 --> 03:16:20,389
that a little bit so we can
explore and celebrate ideas i would love

11730
03:16:20,389 --> 03:16:20,399
explore and celebrate ideas i would love
 

11731
03:16:20,399 --> 03:16:21,910
explore and celebrate ideas i would love
to see more of that just because you're

11732
03:16:21,910 --> 03:16:21,920
to see more of that just because you're
 

11733
03:16:21,920 --> 03:16:24,229
to see more of that just because you're
saying especially with these big ideas

11734
03:16:24,229 --> 03:16:24,239
saying especially with these big ideas
 

11735
03:16:24,239 --> 03:16:26,389

03:17:09,269 --> 03:17:09,279
theoretical physics people are looking
 

11785
03:17:09,279 --> 03:17:10,790
theoretical physics people are looking
for the toe

11786

for the toe
 

11787
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:12,950
for the toe
and they're overlooking the gut in other

and they're overlooking the gut in other
 

11789

and they're overlooking the gut in other
words they're spending all this time in

03:17:13,990 --> 03:17:14,000
words they're spending all this time in
 

11791
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:15,910
words they're spending all this time in
the theory of everything that god equate

the theory of everything that god equate
 

11793
03:17:15,920 --> 03:17:17,590
the theory of everything that god equate
and there's this gut that unifies the

11794
03:17:17,590 --> 03:17:17,600
and there's this gut that unifies the
 

11795
03:17:17,600 --> 03:17:19,190
and there's this gut that unifies the
three stronger forces we don't have a

11796
03:17:19,190 --> 03:17:19,200
three stronger forces we don't have a
 

11797
03:17:19,200 --> 03:17:20,710
three stronger forces we don't have a
single theory for that and people like

11798
03:17:20,710 --> 03:17:20,720
single theory for that and people like
 

11799
03:17:20,720 --> 03:17:22,870
single theory for that and people like
lashound they've tried and failed at it

lashound they've tried and failed at it
 

11801
03:17:22,880 --> 03:17:24,830
lashound they've tried and failed at it
yeah people don't know there's four

11802
03:17:24,830 --> 03:17:24,840
yeah people don't know there's four
 

11803
03:17:24,840 --> 03:17:27,110
yeah people don't know there's four
forces gut grant unification theories

11804
03:17:27,110 --> 03:17:27,120
forces gut grant unification theories
 

11805
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:29,429
forces gut grant unification theories
that unifies the three forces stuff and

11806
03:17:29,429 --> 03:17:29,439
that unifies the three forces stuff and
 

11807
03:17:29,439 --> 03:17:31,110
that unifies the three forces stuff and
done trying to get a shortcut to the

11808
03:17:31,110 --> 03:17:31,120
done trying to get a shortcut to the
 

11809
03:17:31,120 --> 03:17:32,790
done trying to get a shortcut to the
theory of everything which unifies the

11810
03:17:32,790 --> 03:17:32,800
theory of everything which unifies the

four
 

11813
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:35,670
four
um and then there's this whole thing

11814
03:17:35,670 --> 03:17:35,680
um and then there's this whole thing
 

11815
03:17:35,680 --> 03:17:37,269
um and then there's this whole thing
that may be quantum gravity is not even

11816
03:17:37,269 --> 03:17:37,279
that may be quantum gravity is not even
 

11817
03:17:37,279 --> 03:17:39,830
that may be quantum gravity is not even
a thing right

11818
03:17:39,830 --> 03:17:39,840
a thing right
 

11819
03:17:39,840 --> 03:17:40,710
a thing right
um

11820
03:17:40,710 --> 03:17:40,720
um
 

11821
03:17:40,720 --> 03:17:43,110
um
so we're we're we're trying to solve

11822
03:17:43,110 --> 03:17:43,120
so we're we're we're trying to solve
 

11823
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:44,469
so we're we're we're trying to solve
uh

11824
03:17:44,469 --> 03:17:44,479
uh
 

11825
03:17:44,479 --> 03:17:46,389
uh
we're trying to solve the puzzle of

11826
03:17:46,389 --> 03:17:46,399
we're trying to solve the puzzle of
 

11827
03:17:46,399 --> 03:17:48,870
we're trying to solve the puzzle of
everything at the physics level

11828
03:17:48,870 --> 03:17:48,880
everything at the physics level
 

11829
03:17:48,880 --> 03:17:51,429
everything at the physics level
and then already before solving it

11830
03:17:51,429 --> 03:17:51,439
and then already before solving it
 

11831
03:17:51,439 --> 03:17:53,590
and then already before solving it
already saying once we solve it here's

11832
03:17:53,590 --> 03:17:53,600
already saying once we solve it here's
 

11833
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:55,429
already saying once we solve it here's
going to be all the beautiful just like

11834
03:17:55,429 --> 03:17:55,439
going to be all the beautiful just like
 

11835
03:17:55,439 --> 03:17:56,950
going to be all the beautiful just like
time levels jumping in yeah going to

11836
03:17:56,950 --> 03:17:56,960
time levels jumping in yeah going to
 

11837
03:17:56,960 --> 03:18:00,790
time levels jumping in yeah going to
level you know 256.

11838

11839
03:18:00,800 --> 03:18:03,590

yeah yeah yeah i mean i i suppose you

11840
03:18:03,590 --> 03:18:03,600
yeah yeah yeah i mean i i suppose you
 

11841
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:06,710
yeah yeah yeah i mean i i suppose you
need that kind of ego that confidence

11842
03:18:06,710 --> 03:18:06,720
need that kind of ego that confidence
 

11843
03:18:06,720 --> 03:18:08,870
need that kind of ego that confidence
that ambition in order to even have a

03:18:08,870 --> 03:18:08,880
that ambition in order to even have a
 

11845
03:18:08,880 --> 03:18:10,229
that ambition in order to even have a
chance at some of these the only two

11846
03:18:10,229 --> 03:18:10,239
chance at some of these the only two

and i know eventually we're gonna talk
 

11861
03:18:22,080 --> 03:18:23,670
and i know eventually we're gonna talk
about the meaning of life but you talk

03:19:47,110 --> 03:19:47,120
try to find ways that we can test stuff
 

11949
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:48,469
try to find ways that we can test stuff
now because i don't know if i'm going to

11950
03:19:48,469 --> 03:19:48,479
now because i don't know if i'm going to

we bypass can we get shortcuts what's
 

11955
03:19:51,840 --> 03:19:53,990
we bypass can we get shortcuts what's
called the low energy regime and to me

11956
03:19:53,990 --> 03:19:54,000
called the low energy regime and to me
 

11957
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:55,750
called the low energy regime and to me
that's that's what's interesting like

11958
03:19:55,750 --> 03:19:55,760
that's that's what's interesting like
 

11959
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:57,269
that's that's what's interesting like
what can we do now i don't care like

11960
03:19:57,269 --> 03:19:57,279
what can we do now i don't care like
 

11961
03:19:57,279 --> 03:19:59,429
what can we do now i don't care like
isaac newton came up with color theory

11962
03:19:59,429 --> 03:19:59,439
isaac newton came up with color theory
 

11963
03:19:59,439 --> 03:20:00,469
isaac newton came up with color theory
and he did something really interesting

11964
03:20:00,469 --> 03:20:00,479
and he did something really interesting
 

11965
03:20:00,479 --> 03:20:01,670

prisms so what did he do he took a white

11968
03:20:03,590 --> 03:20:03,600
prisms so what did he do he took a white
 

11969
03:20:03,600 --> 03:20:05,590
prisms so what did he do he took a white
light he took a prism from the sun

11970
03:20:05,590 --> 03:20:05,600
light he took a prism from the sun
 

11971
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:06,870
light he took a prism from the sun
actually he put it through a slit put it

11972
03:20:06,870 --> 03:20:06,880
actually he put it through a slit put it
 

11973
03:20:06,880 --> 03:20:08,870
actually he put it through a slit put it
through a prism and it made a beautiful

11974
03:20:08,870 --> 03:20:08,880
through a prism and it made a beautiful
 

11975
03:20:08,880 --> 03:20:10,469
through a prism and it made a beautiful
rainbow like you've seen

11976
03:20:10,469 --> 03:20:10,479
rainbow like you've seen
 

11977
03:20:10,479 --> 03:20:12,469
rainbow like you've seen
and then he took another prism and he

11978
03:20:12,469 --> 03:20:12,479
and then he took another prism and he
 

11979
03:20:12,479 --> 03:20:14,550
and then he took another prism and he
put it upside down like you know dark

11980
03:20:14,550 --> 03:20:14,560
put it upside down like you know dark
 

11981
03:20:14,560 --> 03:20:16,150
put it upside down like you know dark
side of the moon whatever and the light

11982
03:20:16,150 --> 03:20:16,160
side of the moon whatever and the light
 

11983
03:20:16,160 --> 03:20:17,429
side of the moon whatever and the light
went through the first prism turned into

11984
03:20:17,429 --> 03:20:17,439
went through the first prism turned into
 

11985
03:20:17,439 --> 03:20:19,429
went through the first prism turned into
a rainbow and then the rainbow went into

11986
03:20:19,429 --> 03:20:19,439
a rainbow and then the rainbow went into
 

11987
03:20:19,439 --> 03:20:21,349
a rainbow and then the rainbow went into
a prism and came out a white light

11988
03:20:21,349 --> 03:20:21,359
a prism and came out a white light
 

11989
03:20:21,359 --> 03:20:23,349
a prism and came out a white light
that's pretty cool then he took a

11990
03:20:23,349 --> 03:20:23,359
that's pretty cool then he took a
 

11991
03:20:23,359 --> 03:20:25,349
that's pretty cool then he took a
popsicle stick or whatever his

11992
03:20:25,349 --> 03:20:25,359
popsicle stick or whatever his
 

11993
03:20:25,359 --> 03:20:27,510
popsicle stick or whatever his
pipe tobacco and and he put it in the

11994
03:20:27,510 --> 03:20:27,520
pipe tobacco and and he put it in the
 

11995
03:20:27,520 --> 03:20:29,750
pipe tobacco and and he put it in the
beam like blocked out the orange and it

11996
03:20:29,750 --> 03:20:29,760
beam like blocked out the orange and it
 

11997
03:20:29,760 --> 03:20:31,830
beam like blocked out the orange and it
didn't make white light come out so he

11998
03:20:31,830 --> 03:20:31,840
didn't make white light come out so he
 

11999
03:20:31,840 --> 03:20:34,150
didn't make white light come out so he
showed like colors of synthesis it's a

12000
03:20:34,150 --> 03:20:34,160
showed like colors of synthesis it's a
 

12001
03:20:34,160 --> 03:20:36,150
showed like colors of synthesis it's a
combination he didn't use like uh the

12002
03:20:36,150 --> 03:20:36,160
combination he didn't use like uh the
 

12003
03:20:36,160 --> 03:20:38,070
combination he didn't use like uh the
large hadron collider to do that you

12004
03:20:38,070 --> 03:20:38,080
large hadron collider to do that you
 

12005
03:20:38,080 --> 03:20:39,590
large hadron collider to do that you
know he used a very low energy

12006
03:20:39,590 --> 03:20:39,600
know he used a very low energy
 

12007
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:41,429
know he used a very low energy
experiment to prove a unification in

chromodynamics but nevertheless can we
 

12015
03:20:46,479 --> 03:20:48,389
chromodynamics but nevertheless can we
find things like that are we spending

12016
03:20:48,389 --> 03:20:48,399
find things like that are we spending
 

12017
03:20:48,399 --> 03:20:50,070
find things like that are we spending
way too much time and energy thinking

12018
03:20:50,070 --> 03:20:50,080
way too much time and energy thinking
 

12019
03:20:50,080 --> 03:20:52,229
way too much time and energy thinking
about the future circular collider which

sufficient complexity and in this case
 

12049
03:21:18,640 --> 03:21:20,389
sufficient complexity and in this case
so in 10 years it'll cost double the

12050
03:21:20,389 --> 03:21:20,399
so in 10 years it'll cost double the
 

12051
03:21:20,399 --> 03:21:22,469
so in 10 years it'll cost double the
cost so never believe a number whether

the hubble ultra deep field you'll maybe
 

12307
03:25:50,640 --> 03:25:52,790
the hubble ultra deep field you'll maybe
put that in you'll show every speck of

03:25:52,790 --> 03:25:52,800
put that in you'll show every speck of
 

12309
03:25:52,800 --> 03:25:55,429
put that in you'll show every speck of
light except for one 4 000 blobs of

12311
03:25:55,439 --> 03:25:57,670
light except for one 4 000 blobs of
light there's one star in our galaxy the

12312
03:25:57,670 --> 03:25:57,680
light there's one star in our galaxy the
 

12313
03:25:57,680 --> 03:26:00,229

than one tenth of your fingernail held

12316
03:26:02,389 --> 03:26:02,399
than one tenth of your fingernail held
 

12317
03:26:02,399 --> 03:26:04,790
than one tenth of your fingernail held
out at arm's length it contains 4 000

12318
03:26:04,790 --> 03:26:04,800
out at arm's length it contains 4 000
 

12319
03:26:04,800 --> 03:26:07,110
out at arm's length it contains 4 000
galaxies so now you can figure out how

12320
03:26:07,110 --> 03:26:07,120
galaxies so now you can figure out how
 

12321
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:09,590
galaxies so now you can figure out how
many galaxies there are in the whole sky

12322
03:26:09,590 --> 03:26:09,600
many galaxies there are in the whole sky
 

12323
03:26:09,600 --> 03:26:11,190
many galaxies there are in the whole sky
just by seeing how long does it take you

12324
03:26:11,190 --> 03:26:11,200
just by seeing how long does it take you
 

12325
03:26:11,200 --> 03:26:12,630
just by seeing how long does it take you
to move your fingernail over the whole

12326
03:26:12,630 --> 03:26:12,640
to move your fingernail over the whole
 

12327
03:26:12,640 --> 03:26:15,190
to move your fingernail over the whole
sky so we have another couple hours

12328
03:26:15,190 --> 03:26:15,200
sky so we have another couple hours
 

12329
03:26:15,200 --> 03:26:16,550
sky so we have another couple hours
no so it comes out to be that's how we

12330
03:26:16,550 --> 03:26:16,560
no so it comes out to be that's how we
 

12331
03:26:16,560 --> 03:26:18,870
no so it comes out to be that's how we
get 500 billion or more galaxies now

12332
03:26:18,870 --> 03:26:18,880
get 500 billion or more galaxies now
 

12333
03:26:18,880 --> 03:26:20,550
get 500 billion or more galaxies now
it's not exact to the galaxy but it's

12334
03:26:20,550 --> 03:26:20,560
it's not exact to the galaxy but it's
 

12335
03:26:20,560 --> 03:26:22,389
it's not exact to the galaxy but it's
it's it's a good order of magnitude

12336
03:26:22,389 --> 03:26:22,399
it's it's a good order of magnitude
 

12337
03:26:22,399 --> 03:26:23,990
it's it's a good order of magnitude
estimate maybe even better

12338
03:26:23,990 --> 03:26:24,000
estimate maybe even better

some dark black piece of sky what they
 

12345
03:26:29,200 --> 03:26:30,870
some dark black piece of sky what they
thought was blank and they saw it same

12346
03:26:30,870 --> 03:26:30,880
thought was blank and they saw it same
 

12347
03:26:30,880 --> 03:26:32,550
thought was blank and they saw it same
thing that happened with the cmb they

12348
03:26:32,550 --> 03:26:32,560
thing that happened with the cmb they
 

12349
03:26:32,560 --> 03:26:33,670
thing that happened with the cmb they
were looking they were something they

12350
03:26:33,670 --> 03:26:33,680
were looking they were something they
 

12351
03:26:33,680 --> 03:26:35,190
were looking they were something they
didn't find same thing they found when

12352
03:26:35,190 --> 03:26:35,200
didn't find same thing they found when
 

12353
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:37,190
didn't find same thing they found when
they were looking for the deceleration

they were looking for the deceleration
 

12355
03:26:37,200 --> 03:26:38,630
they were looking for the deceleration
of the universe and found it was

accelerating um so what i sometimes hear

12358
03:26:42,150 --> 03:26:42,160
accelerating um so what i sometimes hear
 

12359
03:26:42,160 --> 03:26:43,349
accelerating um so what i sometimes hear
is that we don't know what we're gonna

12360
03:26:43,349 --> 03:26:43,359
is that we don't know what we're gonna
 

12361
03:26:43,359 --> 03:26:45,429
is that we don't know what we're gonna
discover i never think that's a good

it was designed and launched um but
 

12473
03:28:31,359 --> 03:28:33,429
it was designed and launched um but
because it is optical telescope it's

okay let's talk about not the distant

12484
03:28:43,910 --> 03:28:43,920
okay let's talk about not the distant
 

12485
03:28:43,920 --> 03:28:47,110
okay let's talk about not the distant
universe but our neighboring planets

12486
03:28:47,110 --> 03:28:47,120
universe but our neighboring planets
 

12487
03:28:47,120 --> 03:28:50,830
universe but our neighboring planets
first i gotta ask you about the moon

12488
03:28:50,830 --> 03:28:50,840
first i gotta ask you about the moon
 

12489
03:28:50,840 --> 03:28:53,910
first i gotta ask you about the moon
um so there's a there's a piece of the

12490
03:28:53,910 --> 03:28:53,920
um so there's a there's a piece of the
 

12491
03:28:53,920 --> 03:28:55,990
um so there's a there's a piece of the
moon on this table that you've given me

12492
03:28:55,990 --> 03:28:56,000
moon on this table that you've given me
 

12493
03:28:56,000 --> 03:28:58,469
moon on this table that you've given me
yes uh that we didn't have to pick up

12494
03:28:58,469 --> 03:28:58,479
yes uh that we didn't have to pick up
 

12495
03:28:58,479 --> 03:29:00,790
yes uh that we didn't have to pick up
that arrived here that's right so how

12496
03:29:00,790 --> 03:29:00,800
that arrived here that's right so how
 

12497
03:29:00,800 --> 03:29:02,550
that arrived here that's right so how
did a piece of the moon arrive here on

12498
03:29:02,550 --> 03:29:02,560
did a piece of the moon arrive here on
 

12499
03:29:02,560 --> 03:29:05,590
did a piece of the moon arrive here on
earth so this chunk of the moon if it

12500
03:29:05,590 --> 03:29:05,600
earth so this chunk of the moon if it
 

12501
03:29:05,600 --> 03:29:07,910
earth so this chunk of the moon if it
were delivered by

12502
03:29:07,910 --> 03:29:07,920
were delivered by
 

12503
03:29:07,920 --> 03:29:10,469
were delivered by
the apollo and nasa emissions uh you and

12504
03:29:10,469 --> 03:29:10,479
the apollo and nasa emissions uh you and
 

12505
03:29:10,479 --> 03:29:12,630
the apollo and nasa emissions uh you and
i would be guilty of a felony right now

12506
03:29:12,630 --> 03:29:12,640
i would be guilty of a felony right now
 

12507
03:29:12,640 --> 03:29:14,229
i would be guilty of a felony right now
because illegal to own pieces of the

12508
03:29:14,229 --> 03:29:14,239
because illegal to own pieces of the
 

12509
03:29:14,239 --> 03:29:16,389
because illegal to own pieces of the
moon collected by the apollo astronauts

12510
03:29:16,389 --> 03:29:16,399
moon collected by the apollo astronauts
 

12511
03:29:16,399 --> 03:29:17,990
moon collected by the apollo astronauts
so don't even joke about that when you

12512
03:29:17,990 --> 03:29:18,000
so don't even joke about that when you
 

12513
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:19,510
so don't even joke about that when you
go over to houston

12514
03:29:19,510 --> 03:29:19,520
go over to houston
 

12515
03:29:19,520 --> 03:29:21,190
go over to houston
this piece of moon rock was delivered

12516
03:29:21,190 --> 03:29:21,200
this piece of moon rock was delivered
 

12517
03:29:21,200 --> 03:29:24,389
this piece of moon rock was delivered
via the old-fashioned way by gravity so

12518
03:29:24,389 --> 03:29:24,399
via the old-fashioned way by gravity so
 

12519
03:29:24,399 --> 03:29:26,790
via the old-fashioned way by gravity so
this was a chunk of the moon which is

12520
03:29:26,790 --> 03:29:26,800
this was a chunk of the moon which is
 

12521
03:29:26,800 --> 03:29:28,790
this was a chunk of the moon which is
blasted off because the moon gets

12522
03:29:28,790 --> 03:29:28,800
blasted off because the moon gets
 

12523
03:29:28,800 --> 03:29:31,670
blasted off because the moon gets
bombarded by asteroids and meteoroids

12524
03:29:31,670 --> 03:29:31,680
bombarded by asteroids and meteoroids
 

12525
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:33,349
bombarded by asteroids and meteoroids
some of them eject material from the

12526
03:29:33,349 --> 03:29:33,359
some of them eject material from the
 

12527
03:29:33,359 --> 03:29:36,070
some of them eject material from the
surface of the moon into space

12528
03:29:36,070 --> 03:29:36,080
surface of the moon into space
 

12529
03:29:36,080 --> 03:29:39,110
surface of the moon into space
and it will then orbit the common uh

12530
03:29:39,110 --> 03:29:39,120
and it will then orbit the common uh
 

12531
03:29:39,120 --> 03:29:41,030
and it will then orbit the common uh
moon earth system

12532
03:29:41,030 --> 03:29:41,040
moon earth system
 

12533
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:42,950
moon earth system
and it will then eventually enter our

12534
03:29:42,950 --> 03:29:42,960
and it will then eventually enter our
 

12535
03:29:42,960 --> 03:29:45,190
and it will then eventually enter our
atmosphere and if the piece is large

12536
03:29:45,190 --> 03:29:45,200
atmosphere and if the piece is large
 

12537
03:29:45,200 --> 03:29:46,630
atmosphere and if the piece is large
enough and the trajectory is proper it

12538
03:29:46,630 --> 03:29:46,640
enough and the trajectory is proper it
 

12539
03:29:46,640 --> 03:29:48,630
enough and the trajectory is proper it
can land intact and this one landed with

12540
03:29:48,630 --> 03:29:48,640
can land intact and this one landed with
 

12541
03:29:48,640 --> 03:29:51,590
can land intact and this one landed with
a few uh 100 grams worth and they sliced

12542
03:29:51,590 --> 03:29:51,600
a few uh 100 grams worth and they sliced
 

12543
03:29:51,600 --> 03:29:54,229
a few uh 100 grams worth and they sliced
it up and then it was delivered via us

12544
03:29:54,229 --> 03:29:54,239
it up and then it was delivered via us
 

12545
03:29:54,239 --> 03:29:56,550
it up and then it was delivered via us
postal service to my house so you can

12546
03:29:56,550 --> 03:29:56,560
postal service to my house so you can
 

12547
03:29:56,560 --> 03:29:58,150
postal service to my house so you can
buy these pieces and actually can buy a

12548
03:29:58,150 --> 03:29:58,160
buy these pieces and actually can buy a
 

12549
03:29:58,160 --> 03:30:00,229
buy these pieces and actually can buy a
piece of mars you can buy a piece of

12550
03:30:00,229 --> 03:30:00,239
piece of mars you can buy a piece of
 

12551
03:30:00,239 --> 03:30:02,550
piece of mars you can buy a piece of
mars delivered by the same route

12552
03:30:02,550 --> 03:30:02,560
mars delivered by the same route
 

12553
03:30:02,560 --> 03:30:04,150
mars delivered by the same route
now what's so interesting about that

12554
03:30:04,150 --> 03:30:04,160
now what's so interesting about that
 

12555
03:30:04,160 --> 03:30:06,469
now what's so interesting about that
well if a piece of mars can get here a

12556
03:30:06,469 --> 03:30:06,479
well if a piece of mars can get here a
 

12557
03:30:06,479 --> 03:30:08,389
well if a piece of mars can get here a
piece of earth can get there

12558
03:30:08,389 --> 03:30:08,399
piece of earth can get there
 

12559
03:30:08,399 --> 03:30:10,710
piece of earth can get there
if some piece of earth has some life

12560
03:30:10,710 --> 03:30:10,720
if some piece of earth has some life
 

12561
03:30:10,720 --> 03:30:13,030
if some piece of earth has some life
forms on it it could get there and if

12562
03:30:13,030 --> 03:30:13,040
forms on it it could get there and if
 

12563
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:14,389
forms on it it could get there and if
that can happen in our solar system it

12564
03:30:14,389 --> 03:30:14,399
that can happen in our solar system it
 

12565
03:30:14,399 --> 03:30:16,389
that can happen in our solar system it
could happen throughout the galaxy

12566
03:30:16,389 --> 03:30:16,399
could happen throughout the galaxy
 

12567
03:30:16,399 --> 03:30:18,630
could happen throughout the galaxy
so i'm actually not of the opinion that

12568
03:30:18,630 --> 03:30:18,640
so i'm actually not of the opinion that
 

12569
03:30:18,640 --> 03:30:21,190
so i'm actually not of the opinion that
there is life elsewhere in the universe

12570
03:30:21,190 --> 03:30:21,200
there is life elsewhere in the universe
 

12571
03:30:21,200 --> 03:30:23,269
there is life elsewhere in the universe
at least technological life that we can

12572
03:30:23,269 --> 03:30:23,279
at least technological life that we can
 

12573
03:30:23,279 --> 03:30:24,790
at least technological life that we can
see i see this look of horror on your

12574
03:30:24,790 --> 03:30:24,800
see i see this look of horror on your
 

12575
03:30:24,800 --> 03:30:27,429
see i see this look of horror on your
face um i view it

12576
03:30:27,429 --> 03:30:27,439
face um i view it
 

12577
03:30:27,439 --> 03:30:29,990
face um i view it
i am personally extremely pessimistic

12578
03:30:29,990 --> 03:30:30,000
i am personally extremely pessimistic
 

12579
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:31,910
i am personally extremely pessimistic
would be extremely surprised i'm just

12580
03:30:31,910 --> 03:30:31,920
would be extremely surprised i'm just
 

12581
03:30:31,920 --> 03:30:34,389
would be extremely surprised i'm just
i'm curious by the transition

12582
03:30:34,389 --> 03:30:34,399
i'm curious by the transition
 

12583
03:30:34,399 --> 03:30:37,269
i'm curious by the transition
because you just said that life

12584
03:30:37,269 --> 03:30:37,279
because you just said that life
 

12585
03:30:37,279 --> 03:30:39,510
because you just said that life
could have arrived from mars or like

12586
03:30:39,510 --> 03:30:39,520
could have arrived from mars or like
 

12587
03:30:39,520 --> 03:30:41,269
could have arrived from mars or like
from planet to planet but because of the

12588
03:30:41,269 --> 03:30:41,279
from planet to planet but because of the
 

12589
03:30:41,279 --> 03:30:43,349
from planet to planet but because of the
meteorites striking and so on yeah and

12590
03:30:43,349 --> 03:30:43,359
meteorites striking and so on yeah and
 

12591
03:30:43,359 --> 03:30:45,030
meteorites striking and so on yeah and
then you went to

12592
03:30:45,030 --> 03:30:45,040
then you went to
 

12593
03:30:45,040 --> 03:30:46,389
then you went to
you don't think there

12594
03:30:46,389 --> 03:30:46,399
you don't think there
 

12595
03:30:46,399 --> 03:30:47,750
you don't think there
there might be life out there in the

12596
03:30:47,750 --> 03:30:47,760
there might be life out there in the
 

12597
03:30:47,760 --> 03:30:49,670
there might be life out there in the
universe technological life

12598
03:30:49,670 --> 03:30:49,680
universe technological life
 

12599
03:30:49,680 --> 03:30:51,590

technological life
 

12601
03:30:51,600 --> 03:30:52,870
technological life
like yeah advanced intelligence

12602
03:30:52,870 --> 03:30:52,880
like yeah advanced intelligence
 

12603
03:30:52,880 --> 03:30:54,389
like yeah advanced intelligence
civilizations okay

12604
03:30:54,389 --> 03:30:54,399
civilizations okay
 

12605
03:30:54,399 --> 03:30:57,590
civilizations okay
uh yeah okay so go on yeah so that's a

12606
03:30:57,590 --> 03:30:57,600
uh yeah okay so go on yeah so that's a
 

12607
03:30:57,600 --> 03:30:59,590
uh yeah okay so go on yeah so that's a
the generalization of what uh the famous

12608
03:30:59,590 --> 03:30:59,600
the generalization of what uh the famous

astronomer fred hoyle called i know this

12610
03:31:01,510 --> 03:31:01,520
astronomer fred hoyle called i know this
 

12611
03:31:01,520 --> 03:31:04,550
astronomer fred hoyle called i know this
is a pg-13 it's called panspermia

12612
03:31:04,550 --> 03:31:04,560
is a pg-13 it's called panspermia
 

12613
03:31:04,560 --> 03:31:07,429
is a pg-13 it's called panspermia
panspermia and uh beep that up yeah yeah

12614
03:31:07,429 --> 03:31:07,439
panspermia and uh beep that up yeah yeah
 

12615
03:31:07,439 --> 03:31:10,790
panspermia and uh beep that up yeah yeah
please and uh that's the exchange of

12616
03:31:10,790 --> 03:31:10,800
please and uh that's the exchange of
 

12617
03:31:10,800 --> 03:31:13,190
please and uh that's the exchange of
genetic life for material from

12618
03:31:13,190 --> 03:31:13,200
genetic life for material from
 

12619
03:31:13,200 --> 03:31:14,950
genetic life for material from
other reaches on earth which explains

12620
03:31:14,950 --> 03:31:14,960
other reaches on earth which explains
 

12621
03:31:14,960 --> 03:31:17,110
other reaches on earth which explains
the origin of life on earth but not the

12622
03:31:17,110 --> 03:31:17,120
the origin of life on earth but not the
 

12623
03:31:17,120 --> 03:31:18,950
the origin of life on earth but not the
origin of life itself which i think is a

12624
03:31:18,950 --> 03:31:18,960
origin of life itself which i think is a
 

12625
03:31:18,960 --> 03:31:20,630
origin of life itself which i think is a
much grander mystery and much more

12626
03:31:20,630 --> 03:31:20,640
much grander mystery and much more
 

12627
03:31:20,640 --> 03:31:22,070
much grander mystery and much more
interesting

12628
03:31:22,070 --> 03:31:22,080
interesting
 

12629
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:23,670
interesting
how did life get here and you've talked

12630
03:31:23,670 --> 03:31:23,680
how did life get here and you've talked
 

12631
03:31:23,680 --> 03:31:25,750
how did life get here and you've talked
with many eminent people about that

12632
03:31:25,750 --> 03:31:25,760
with many eminent people about that
 

12633
03:31:25,760 --> 03:31:27,030
with many eminent people about that
i'm not going to add that much but but

12634
03:31:27,030 --> 03:31:27,040
i'm not going to add that much but but
 

12635
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:29,429
i'm not going to add that much but but
just thinking about the reverse process

12636
03:31:29,429 --> 03:31:29,439
just thinking about the reverse process
 

12637
03:31:29,439 --> 03:31:31,429
just thinking about the reverse process
let's say life started on the earth

12638
03:31:31,429 --> 03:31:31,439
let's say life started on the earth
 

12639
03:31:31,439 --> 03:31:32,550
let's say life started on the earth
somehow

12640
03:31:32,550 --> 03:31:32,560
somehow
 

12641
03:31:32,560 --> 03:31:33,910
somehow
and then made its way out into the

12642
03:31:33,910 --> 03:31:33,920
and then made its way out into the
 

12643
03:31:33,920 --> 03:31:35,990
and then made its way out into the
universe is there enough time for the

12644
03:31:35,990 --> 03:31:36,000
universe is there enough time for the
 

12645
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:38,070
universe is there enough time for the
whatever material went from earth via

12646
03:31:38,070 --> 03:31:38,080
whatever material went from earth via
 

12647
03:31:38,080 --> 03:31:40,870
whatever material went from earth via
panspermic direction you know spraying

03:31:40,870 --> 03:31:40,880
panspermic direction you know spraying

the love gun out into the universe did

12650
03:31:43,030 --> 03:31:43,040
the love gun out into the universe did
 

12651
03:31:43,040 --> 03:31:45,030
the love gun out into the universe did
that then have enough time to incubate

12652
03:31:45,030 --> 03:31:45,040
that then have enough time to incubate
 

12653
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:46,710
that then have enough time to incubate
and go on to a planet that could support

12654
03:31:46,710 --> 03:31:46,720
and go on to a planet that could support
 

12655
03:31:46,720 --> 03:31:49,510
and go on to a planet that could support
it certainly not within our solar system

12656
03:31:49,510 --> 03:31:49,520
it certainly not within our solar system

03:31:49,520 --> 03:31:51,269
it certainly not within our solar system
which traveling at the meteorite speeds

03:31:51,269 --> 03:31:51,279
which traveling at the meteorite speeds
 

12659
03:31:51,279 --> 03:31:52,550
which traveling at the meteorite speeds
would require you know hundreds of

12660
03:31:52,550 --> 03:31:52,560
would require you know hundreds of
 

12661
03:31:52,560 --> 03:31:54,550
would require you know hundreds of
millions of years then looking at the

03:31:54,550 --> 03:31:54,560
millions of years then looking at the
 

12663
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:56,710
millions of years then looking at the

03:31:59,030 --> 03:31:59,040
from you know

from you know
rocks to rock mononof i don't know i can

12670
03:32:00,950 --> 03:32:00,960
rocks to rock mononof i don't know i can
 

12671
03:32:00,960 --> 03:32:02,790
rocks to rock mononof i don't know i can
do this all day oh wow it's pretty good

12672
03:32:02,790 --> 03:32:02,800
do this all day oh wow it's pretty good
 

12673
03:32:02,800 --> 03:32:04,950
do this all day oh wow it's pretty good
how do you get from those very simple

12674
03:32:04,950 --> 03:32:04,960
how do you get from those very simple
 

12675
03:32:04,960 --> 03:32:06,790
how do you get from those very simple
inanimate objects to like i just simply

12676
03:32:06,790 --> 03:32:06,800
inanimate objects to like i just simply
 

12677
03:32:06,800 --> 03:32:08,070
inanimate objects to like i just simply
think there's not enough time for earth

12678
03:32:08,070 --> 03:32:08,080
think there's not enough time for earth
 

12679
03:32:08,080 --> 03:32:09,830
think there's not enough time for earth
to seed life technological life

12680
03:32:09,830 --> 03:32:09,840
to seed life technological life
 

12681
03:32:09,840 --> 03:32:10,870
to seed life technological life
throughout the galaxy i don't think

12682
03:32:10,870 --> 03:32:10,880
throughout the galaxy i don't think
 

12683
03:32:10,880 --> 03:32:13,510
throughout the galaxy i don't think
there's any evidence for that but so you

12684
03:32:13,510 --> 03:32:13,520
there's any evidence for that but so you
 

12685
03:32:13,520 --> 03:32:16,229
there's any evidence for that but so you
you really think that the origin of of

12686
03:32:16,229 --> 03:32:16,239
you really think that the origin of of
 

12687
03:32:16,239 --> 03:32:17,990
you really think that the origin of of
life on earth

12688
03:32:17,990 --> 03:32:18,000
life on earth
 

12689
03:32:18,000 --> 03:32:20,950
life on earth
is a really special event yeah if it did

12690
03:32:20,950 --> 03:32:20,960
is a really special event yeah if it did
 

12691
03:32:20,960 --> 03:32:23,510
is a really special event yeah if it did
originate on earth my question for those

12692
03:32:23,510 --> 03:32:23,520
originate on earth my question for those
 

12693
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:26,150
originate on earth my question for those
that search for life outside the earth

12694
03:32:26,150 --> 03:32:26,160
that search for life outside the earth
 

12695
03:32:26,160 --> 03:32:28,469
that search for life outside the earth
is what if you had a letter from god and

12696
03:32:28,469 --> 03:32:28,479
is what if you had a letter from god and
 

12697
03:32:28,479 --> 03:32:31,590
is what if you had a letter from god and
the letter said um life didn't originate

12698
03:32:31,590 --> 03:32:31,600
the letter said um life didn't originate
 

12699
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:33,670
the letter said um life didn't originate
on earth like would you

12700
03:32:33,670 --> 03:32:33,680
on earth like would you
 

12701
03:32:33,680 --> 03:32:35,510
on earth like would you
choose a different profession like it

12702
03:32:35,510 --> 03:32:35,520
choose a different profession like it
 

12703
03:32:35,520 --> 03:32:36,870
choose a different profession like it
would seem hopeless like in other words

12704
03:32:36,870 --> 03:32:36,880
would seem hopeless like in other words
 

12705
03:32:36,880 --> 03:32:38,550
would seem hopeless like in other words
we only have a sample of one in fact we

12706
03:32:38,550 --> 03:32:38,560
we only have a sample of one in fact we
 

12707
03:32:38,560 --> 03:32:40,309
we only have a sample of one in fact we
only know of one conscious life form let

12708
03:32:40,309 --> 03:32:40,319
only know of one conscious life form let
 

12709
03:32:40,319 --> 03:32:42,150
only know of one conscious life form let
alone one planet that has life on it

12710
03:32:42,150 --> 03:32:42,160
alone one planet that has life on it
 

12711
03:32:42,160 --> 03:32:43,590
alone one planet that has life on it
right what if you knew for sure it

12712
03:32:43,590 --> 03:32:43,600
right what if you knew for sure it
 

12713
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:45,750
right what if you knew for sure it
didn't start here that means that like

12714
03:32:45,750 --> 03:32:45,760
didn't start here that means that like
 

12715
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:48,469
didn't start here that means that like
there's almost nothing about earth that

12716
03:32:48,469 --> 03:32:48,479
there's almost nothing about earth that
 

12717
03:32:48,479 --> 03:32:51,349
there's almost nothing about earth that
is um originated it didn't originate the

12718
03:32:51,349 --> 03:32:51,359
is um originated it didn't originate the
 

12719
03:32:51,359 --> 03:32:53,190
is um originated it didn't originate the
life process so to study purely the

12720
03:32:53,190 --> 03:32:53,200
life process so to study purely the
 

12721
03:32:53,200 --> 03:32:54,710
life process so to study purely the
origin of life not life itself i think

12722
03:32:54,710 --> 03:32:54,720
origin of life not life itself i think
 

12723
03:32:54,720 --> 03:32:56,309
origin of life not life itself i think
that's still fascinating but how could

12724
03:32:56,309 --> 03:32:56,319
that's still fascinating but how could
 

12725
03:32:56,319 --> 03:32:59,110
that's still fascinating but how could
we learn about you know the origin of of

12726
03:32:59,110 --> 03:32:59,120
we learn about you know the origin of of
 

12727
03:32:59,120 --> 03:33:00,630
we learn about you know the origin of of
remember you have to go from inanimate

12728
03:33:00,630 --> 03:33:00,640
remember you have to go from inanimate
 

12729
03:33:00,640 --> 03:33:03,030
remember you have to go from inanimate
object to a living object whatever that

12730
03:33:03,030 --> 03:33:03,040
object to a living object whatever that
 

12731
03:33:03,040 --> 03:33:04,630
object to a living object whatever that
definition of life is and i'm not an

12732
03:33:04,630 --> 03:33:04,640
definition of life is and i'm not an
 

12733
03:33:04,640 --> 03:33:07,429
definition of life is and i'm not an
expert in many definitions max sarah you

12734
03:33:07,429 --> 03:33:07,439
expert in many definitions max sarah you
 

12735
03:33:07,439 --> 03:33:10,150
expert in many definitions max sarah you
know many different uh definitions but

12736
03:33:10,150 --> 03:33:10,160
know many different uh definitions but
 

12737
03:33:10,160 --> 03:33:12,469
know many different uh definitions but
but how do you actually go from from

12738
03:33:12,469 --> 03:33:12,479
but how do you actually go from from
 

12739
03:33:12,479 --> 03:33:14,229
but how do you actually go from from
from inanimate to animate it's a huge

12740
03:33:14,229 --> 03:33:14,239
from inanimate to animate it's a huge
 

12741
03:33:14,239 --> 03:33:16,150
from inanimate to animate it's a huge
question yeah but then you don't have to

12742
03:33:16,150 --> 03:33:16,160
question yeah but then you don't have to
 

12743
03:33:16,160 --> 03:33:19,030
question yeah but then you don't have to
be the place where life originated to

12744
03:33:19,030 --> 03:33:19,040
be the place where life originated to
 

12745
03:33:19,040 --> 03:33:21,590
be the place where life originated to
replicate the origin or to under like uh

12746
03:33:21,590 --> 03:33:21,600
replicate the origin or to under like uh
 

12747
03:33:21,600 --> 03:33:23,030
replicate the origin or to under like uh
yeah that's one way to understand

12748
03:33:23,030 --> 03:33:23,040
yeah that's one way to understand
 

12749
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:24,469
yeah that's one way to understand
something is to

12750
03:33:24,469 --> 03:33:24,479
something is to
 

12751
03:33:24,479 --> 03:33:26,710
something is to
uh build it yeah but another way is to

12752
03:33:26,710 --> 03:33:26,720
uh build it yeah but another way is to
 

12753
03:33:26,720 --> 03:33:29,030
uh build it yeah but another way is to
just observe it you don't have to truly

12754
03:33:29,030 --> 03:33:29,040
just observe it you don't have to truly
 

12755
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:32,870
just observe it you don't have to truly
re-uh re-engineer from scratch so

12756
03:33:32,870 --> 03:33:32,880
re-uh re-engineer from scratch so
 

12757
03:33:32,880 --> 03:33:34,550
re-uh re-engineer from scratch so
you know i

12758
03:33:34,550 --> 03:33:34,560
you know i
 

12759
03:33:34,560 --> 03:33:36,550
you know i
but then yes if it didn't originate on

12760
03:33:36,550 --> 03:33:36,560
but then yes if it didn't originate on
 

12761
03:33:36,560 --> 03:33:40,309
but then yes if it didn't originate on
earth then your intuitions about the

12762
03:33:40,309 --> 03:33:40,319
earth then your intuitions about the
 

12763
03:33:40,319 --> 03:33:43,429
earth then your intuitions about the
basic prerequisites of life are are off

12764
03:33:43,429 --> 03:33:43,439
basic prerequisites of life are are off
 

12765
03:33:43,439 --> 03:33:45,030
basic prerequisites of life are are off
what's the governing principle right

12766
03:33:45,030 --> 03:33:45,040
what's the governing principle right
 

12767
03:33:45,040 --> 03:33:47,349
what's the governing principle right
like me what is um and then you could

12768
03:33:47,349 --> 03:33:47,359
like me what is um and then you could
 

12769
03:33:47,359 --> 03:33:50,229
like me what is um and then you could
have just an almost an arbitrary number

12770
03:33:50,229 --> 03:33:50,239
have just an almost an arbitrary number
 

12771
03:33:50,239 --> 03:33:51,510
have just an almost an arbitrary number
of possible

12772
03:33:51,510 --> 03:33:51,520
of possible
 

12773
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:52,389
of possible
like

12774
03:33:52,389 --> 03:33:52,399
like
 

12775
03:33:52,399 --> 03:33:56,469
like
if life didn't start on earth

12776
03:33:56,469 --> 03:33:56,479

 

12777
03:33:56,479 --> 03:33:58,950

to me that's exciting because it's like

12778
03:33:58,950 --> 03:33:58,960
to me that's exciting because it's like
 

12779
03:33:58,960 --> 03:34:02,070
to me that's exciting because it's like
we know even less than we thought

12780
03:34:02,070 --> 03:34:02,080
we know even less than we thought
 

12781
03:34:02,080 --> 03:34:04,070
we know even less than we thought
the thing is it can prosper on earth

12782
03:34:04,070 --> 03:34:04,080
the thing is it can prosper on earth
 

12783
03:34:04,080 --> 03:34:05,110
the thing is it can prosper on earth
though

12784
03:34:05,110 --> 03:34:05,120
though
 

12785
03:34:05,120 --> 03:34:07,750
though
yeah so maybe the origin of life is

12786
03:34:07,750 --> 03:34:07,760
yeah so maybe the origin of life is
 

12787
03:34:07,760 --> 03:34:09,830
yeah so maybe the origin of life is
fundamentally different from

12788
03:34:09,830 --> 03:34:09,840
fundamentally different from
 

12789
03:34:09,840 --> 03:34:11,910
fundamentally different from
the maintenance of life right and maybe

12790
03:34:11,910 --> 03:34:11,920
the maintenance of life right and maybe
 

12791
03:34:11,920 --> 03:34:14,870
the maintenance of life right and maybe
maybe the existence of the earth life

12792
03:34:14,870 --> 03:34:14,880
maybe the existence of the earth life
 

12793

that it's a planetary phenomenon etc so

12798
03:34:22,469 --> 03:34:22,479
that it's a planetary phenomenon etc so
 

12799
03:34:22,479 --> 03:34:23,910
that it's a planetary phenomenon etc so
doesn't that make it less like in other

words like not only do you need special
 

12803
03:34:25,760 --> 03:34:29,510
words like not only do you need special
life conditions to create life but then

planets in the observable universe not

planets in the observable universe not
 

12917
03:36:18,880 --> 03:36:21,670
planets in the observable universe not
the galaxy so that's a hundred times

12918

the galaxy so that's a hundred times
 

12919
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:24,070
the galaxy so that's a hundred times
fewer than the probability to get you

very low hurdles of one in a thousand
that's fascinating because now i really

12926
03:36:30,389 --> 03:36:30,399
that's fascinating because now i really
 

12927
03:36:30,399 --> 03:36:31,910
that's fascinating because now i really
need to listen to your conversation with

12928
03:36:31,910 --> 03:36:31,920
need to listen to your conversation with
 

12929
03:36:31,920 --> 03:36:34,070
need to listen to your conversation with
lee cronin who i believe you had

12930
03:36:34,070 --> 03:36:34,080
lee cronin who i believe you had
 

12931
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:37,429
lee cronin who i believe you had
because he believes the opposite yes

12932
03:36:37,429 --> 03:36:37,439
because he believes the opposite yes
 

12933
03:36:37,439 --> 03:36:39,590
because he believes the opposite yes
yeah i want to have a debate with him

12934
03:36:39,590 --> 03:36:39,600
yeah i want to have a debate with him
 

12935
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:41,510
yeah i want to have a debate with him
he believes

12936
03:36:41,510 --> 03:36:41,520
he believes
 

12937
03:36:41,520 --> 03:36:42,469
he believes
that

12938
03:36:42,469 --> 03:36:42,479
that
 

12939
03:36:42,479 --> 03:36:45,349
that
the the way biology evolved on earth

12940
03:36:45,349 --> 03:36:45,359
the the way biology evolved on earth
 

12941
03:36:45,359 --> 03:36:47,349
the the way biology evolved on earth
could have evolved almost an infinite

12942
03:36:47,349 --> 03:36:47,359
could have evolved almost an infinite
 

12943
03:36:47,359 --> 03:36:49,750
could have evolved almost an infinite
number of other ways so like if you ran

12944

number of other ways so like if you ran
 

12945
03:36:49,760 --> 03:36:51,429

earth over and over and over you would
keep getting life and it would be very

12948

different
 

12951
03:36:54,160 --> 03:36:55,510
different
so it's

12952
03:36:55,510 --> 03:36:55,520
so it's
 

12953
03:36:55,520 --> 03:36:57,190
so it's
the the fact that our

12954
03:36:57,190 --> 03:36:57,200
the the fact that our
 

12955
03:36:57,200 --> 03:36:59,910
the the fact that our
particular life seems unique

12956
03:36:59,910 --> 03:36:59,920

there's a there's a complicated line
 

13251
03:41:43,840 --> 03:41:45,990
there's a there's a complicated line
here what what if it's this

13252
03:41:45,990 --> 03:41:46,000
here what what if it's this
 

13253
03:41:46,000 --> 03:41:47,750
here what what if it's this
intelligent civilization

13254
03:41:47,750 --> 03:41:47,760
intelligent civilization
 

13255
03:41:47,760 --> 03:41:49,590
intelligent civilization
living

13256
03:41:49,590 --> 03:41:49,600
living
 

13257
03:41:49,600 --> 03:41:51,670
living
obviously probably not on mars but

13258
03:41:51,670 --> 03:41:51,680
obviously probably not on mars but
 

13259
03:41:51,680 --> 03:41:54,550
obviously probably not on mars but
somewhere like uh in neighboring galaxy

13260
03:41:54,550 --> 03:41:54,560
somewhere like uh in neighboring galaxy
 

13261
03:41:54,560 --> 03:41:57,269
somewhere like uh in neighboring galaxy
that we uh sorry in in in the name in a

13262
03:41:57,269 --> 03:41:57,279
that we uh sorry in in in the name in a
 

13263
03:41:57,279 --> 03:42:00,309
that we uh sorry in in in the name in a
neighboring star star system

13264
03:42:00,309 --> 03:42:00,319
neighboring star star system
 

13265
03:42:00,319 --> 03:42:02,150
neighboring star star system
that we discover

13266
03:42:02,150 --> 03:42:02,160
that we discover
 

13267
03:42:02,160 --> 03:42:04,389
that we discover
don't you think that profound change in

13268
03:42:04,389 --> 03:42:04,399
don't you think that profound change in
 

13269
03:42:04,399 --> 03:42:07,030
don't you think that profound change in
meaning i mean i guess again i assume

13270
03:42:07,030 --> 03:42:07,040
meaning i mean i guess again i assume
 

13271
03:42:07,040 --> 03:42:08,950
meaning i mean i guess again i assume
that because of this pan ceramic process

13272
03:42:08,950 --> 03:42:08,960
that because of this pan ceramic process
 

13273
03:42:08,960 --> 03:42:10,389
that because of this pan ceramic process
or whatever that

13274
03:42:10,389 --> 03:42:10,399
or whatever that
 

13275
03:42:10,399 --> 03:42:12,229
or whatever that
the probability is much much greater

13276
03:42:12,229 --> 03:42:12,239
the probability is much much greater
 

13277
03:42:12,239 --> 03:42:14,309
the probability is much much greater
than zero i mean it's not one a hundred

13278
03:42:14,309 --> 03:42:14,319
than zero i mean it's not one a hundred
 

13279
03:42:14,319 --> 03:42:16,309
than zero i mean it's not one a hundred
percent but it's it's much likelier than

13280
03:42:16,309 --> 03:42:16,319
percent but it's it's much likelier than
 

13281
03:42:16,319 --> 03:42:17,910
percent but it's it's much likelier than
that that at least some living material

13282
03:42:17,910 --> 03:42:17,920
that that at least some living material
 

13283
03:42:17,920 --> 03:42:20,790
that that at least some living material
from earth has ejaculated itself into

from earth has ejaculated itself into
 

13285
03:42:20,800 --> 03:42:22,870

please
 

13291
03:42:25,600 --> 03:42:28,309
please
as well that's right so ice like the

13292
03:42:28,309 --> 03:42:28,319
as well that's right so ice like the
 

13293
03:42:28,319 --> 03:42:29,670
as well that's right so ice like the
fact that that could happen and that

13294
03:42:29,670 --> 03:42:29,680
fact that that could happen and that
 

13295
03:42:29,680 --> 03:42:31,110
fact that that could happen and that
you're holding a piece you know from a

13296
03:42:31,110 --> 03:42:31,120
you're holding a piece you know from a
 

13297
03:42:31,120 --> 03:42:32,710
you're holding a piece you know from a
planetary body and one that couldn't

13298
03:42:32,710 --> 03:42:32,720
planetary body and one that couldn't
 

13299
03:42:32,720 --> 03:42:34,870
planetary body and one that couldn't
support life as far as we know uh but i

13300
03:42:34,870 --> 03:42:34,880
support life as far as we know uh but i
 

13301
03:42:34,880 --> 03:42:36,870
support life as far as we know uh but i
could get next time if you're if you if

13302
03:42:36,870 --> 03:42:36,880
could get next time if you're if you if
 

13303
03:42:36,880 --> 03:42:38,389
could get next time if you're if you if
you play nice and you come on my podcast

13304
03:42:38,389 --> 03:42:38,399
you play nice and you come on my podcast
 

13305
03:42:38,399 --> 03:42:40,229
you play nice and you come on my podcast
someday i will give you a tiny chunk of

13306
03:42:40,229 --> 03:42:40,239
someday i will give you a tiny chunk of
 

13307
03:42:40,239 --> 03:42:42,389
someday i will give you a tiny chunk of
mars so mars theoretically could support

13308
03:42:42,389 --> 03:42:42,399
mars so mars theoretically could support
 

13309
03:42:42,399 --> 03:42:44,630
mars so mars theoretically could support
stuff right now so yeah so i believe

13310
03:42:44,630 --> 03:42:44,640
stuff right now so yeah so i believe
 

13311
03:42:44,640 --> 03:42:46,070
stuff right now so yeah so i believe
that there's there could be remnants of

13312
03:42:46,070 --> 03:42:46,080
that there's there could be remnants of
 

13313
03:42:46,080 --> 03:42:47,590
that there's there could be remnants of
earth in this so so that means there

13314
03:42:47,590 --> 03:42:47,600
earth in this so so that means there
 

13315
03:42:47,600 --> 03:42:49,590
earth in this so so that means there
could be evolution i don't think there's

13316
03:42:49,590 --> 03:42:49,600
could be evolution i don't think there's
 

13317
03:42:49,600 --> 03:42:51,269
could be evolution i don't think there's
any chance that there's like you know

13318
03:42:51,269 --> 03:42:51,279
any chance that there's like you know
 

13319
03:42:51,279 --> 03:42:53,349
any chance that there's like you know
people using iphones and having podcasts

13320
03:42:53,349 --> 03:42:53,359
people using iphones and having podcasts
 

13321
03:42:53,359 --> 03:42:54,550
people using iphones and having podcasts
and stuff and probably so there's this

13322
03:42:54,550 --> 03:42:54,560
and stuff and probably so there's this
 

13323
03:42:54,560 --> 03:42:56,229
and stuff and probably so there's this
interesting there's so much some chance

13324
03:42:56,229 --> 03:42:56,239
interesting there's so much some chance
 

13325
03:42:56,239 --> 03:42:58,550
interesting there's so much some chance
though right

13326
03:42:58,550 --> 03:42:58,560
though right
 

13327
03:42:58,560 --> 03:43:00,870
though right
so again yes i think the pro well

13328
03:43:00,870 --> 03:43:00,880
so again yes i think the pro well
 

13329
03:43:00,880 --> 03:43:02,389
so again yes i think the pro well
obviously the simple state statement to

13330
03:43:02,389 --> 03:43:02,399
obviously the simple state statement to
 

13331
03:43:02,399 --> 03:43:04,229
obviously the simple state statement to
say it's much much much higher

13332
03:43:04,229 --> 03:43:04,239
say it's much much much higher
 

13333
03:43:04,239 --> 03:43:05,590
say it's much much much higher
probability that life exists and

13334
03:43:05,590 --> 03:43:05,600
probability that life exists and
 

13335
03:43:05,600 --> 03:43:07,590
probability that life exists and
technological life exists right i don't

13336
03:43:07,590 --> 03:43:07,600
technological life exists right i don't
 

13337
03:43:07,600 --> 03:43:09,510
technological life exists right i don't
think we can argue that um it doesn't

13338
03:43:09,510 --> 03:43:09,520
think we can argue that um it doesn't
 

13339
03:43:09,520 --> 03:43:10,950
think we can argue that um it doesn't
mean it's forbidden again i'm not saying

13340
03:43:10,950 --> 03:43:10,960
mean it's forbidden again i'm not saying
 

13341
03:43:10,960 --> 03:43:12,309
mean it's forbidden again i'm not saying
any of this is forbidden not worth

13342
03:43:12,309 --> 03:43:12,319
any of this is forbidden not worth
 

13343
03:43:12,319 --> 03:43:13,750
any of this is forbidden not worth
studying not interesting it's a

13344
03:43:13,750 --> 03:43:13,760
studying not interesting it's a
 

13345
03:43:13,760 --> 03:43:15,830
studying not interesting it's a
likelihood thing yeah and to answer your

13346
03:43:15,830 --> 03:43:15,840
likelihood thing yeah and to answer your
 

13347
03:43:15,840 --> 03:43:17,750
likelihood thing yeah and to answer your
i think you're wise to push back and

13348
03:43:17,750 --> 03:43:17,760
i think you're wise to push back and
 

13349
03:43:17,760 --> 03:43:19,990
i think you're wise to push back and
like what does it matter what i'm doing

13350
03:43:19,990 --> 03:43:20,000
like what does it matter what i'm doing
 

13351
03:43:20,000 --> 03:43:21,750
like what does it matter what i'm doing
and i like to think about that you know

13352
03:43:21,750 --> 03:43:21,760
and i like to think about that you know
 

13353
03:43:21,760 --> 03:43:23,269
and i like to think about that you know
because it's like what is the value of

13354
03:43:23,269 --> 03:43:23,279
because it's like what is the value of
 

13355
03:43:23,279 --> 03:43:24,790
because it's like what is the value of
what you're doing like you have to

13356
03:43:24,790 --> 03:43:24,800
what you're doing like you have to
 

13357
03:43:24,800 --> 03:43:26,550
what you're doing like you have to
answer that question or else at the end

13358
03:43:26,550 --> 03:43:26,560
answer that question or else at the end
 

13359
03:43:26,560 --> 03:43:27,429
answer that question or else at the end
of your life you'll have these

13360
03:43:27,429 --> 03:43:27,439
of your life you'll have these
 

13361
03:43:27,439 --> 03:43:29,830
of your life you'll have these
existential you know kind of crises

13362
03:43:29,830 --> 03:43:29,840
existential you know kind of crises
 

13363
03:43:29,840 --> 03:43:31,830
existential you know kind of crises
right so when i think about like who i

13364
03:43:31,830 --> 03:43:31,840
right so when i think about like who i
 

13365
03:43:31,840 --> 03:43:33,990
right so when i think about like who i
am part of my identity is answering and

13366
03:43:33,990 --> 03:43:34,000
am part of my identity is answering and
 

13367
03:43:34,000 --> 03:43:35,990
am part of my identity is answering and
asking scientific questions for me

13368
03:43:35,990 --> 03:43:36,000
asking scientific questions for me
 

13369
03:43:36,000 --> 03:43:37,590
asking scientific questions for me
though there is a religious kind of

13370
03:43:37,590 --> 03:43:37,600
though there is a religious kind of
 

13371
03:43:37,600 --> 03:43:40,150
though there is a religious kind of
undercurrent that does undergird in some

13372
03:43:40,150 --> 03:43:40,160
undercurrent that does undergird in some
 

13373
03:43:40,160 --> 03:43:42,309
undercurrent that does undergird in some
sense this quest again i'm not like a

13374
03:43:42,309 --> 03:43:42,319
sense this quest again i'm not like a
 

13375
03:43:42,319 --> 03:43:44,070
sense this quest again i'm not like a
practicing i'm not like wearing a you

13376
03:43:44,070 --> 03:43:44,080
practicing i'm not like wearing a you
 

13377
03:43:44,080 --> 03:43:46,950
practicing i'm not like wearing a you
know like i'm not like full-on into

13378
03:43:46,950 --> 03:43:46,960
know like i'm not like full-on into
 

13379
03:43:46,960 --> 03:43:49,510
know like i'm not like full-on into
my birth religion judaism

13380
03:43:49,510 --> 03:43:49,520
my birth religion judaism
 

13381
03:43:49,520 --> 03:43:52,070
my birth religion judaism
but at the same token i think as you

13382
03:43:52,070 --> 03:43:52,080
but at the same token i think as you
 

13383
03:43:52,080 --> 03:43:53,429
but at the same token i think as you
know one of the things einstein did say

13384
03:43:53,429 --> 03:43:53,439
know one of the things einstein did say
 

13385
03:43:53,439 --> 03:43:54,710
know one of the things einstein did say
is that you know religion without

13386
03:43:54,710 --> 03:43:54,720
is that you know religion without
 

13387
03:43:54,720 --> 03:43:57,910
is that you know religion without
science is blind and uh or is lame and

13388
03:43:57,910 --> 03:43:57,920
science is blind and uh or is lame and
 

13389
03:43:57,920 --> 03:44:01,189
science is blind and uh or is lame and
uh science without religion is lame it's

13390
03:44:01,189 --> 03:44:01,199
uh science without religion is lame it's
 

13391
03:44:01,199 --> 03:44:03,189
uh science without religion is lame it's
blind and lame anyway the point is that

13392
03:44:03,189 --> 03:44:03,199
blind and lame anyway the point is that
 

13393
03:44:03,199 --> 03:44:05,349
blind and lame anyway the point is that
like you can't get meaning

13394
03:44:05,349 --> 03:44:05,359
like you can't get meaning
 

13395
03:44:05,359 --> 03:44:07,429
like you can't get meaning
um you know from just knowing facts like

13396
03:44:07,429 --> 03:44:07,439
um you know from just knowing facts like
 

13397
03:44:07,439 --> 03:44:09,590
um you know from just knowing facts like
wikipedia knows more than all of us will

13398
03:44:09,590 --> 03:44:09,600
wikipedia knows more than all of us will
 

13399
03:44:09,600 --> 03:44:11,670
wikipedia knows more than all of us will
ever know right it has no wisdom you

13400
03:44:11,670 --> 03:44:11,680
ever know right it has no wisdom you
 

13401
03:44:11,680 --> 03:44:13,830
ever know right it has no wisdom you
know wisdom it means you know sapien the

13402
03:44:13,830 --> 03:44:13,840
know wisdom it means you know sapien the

doesn't mean i'm more valuable than
 

13431

doesn't mean i'm more valuable than
surviving

the other hand

13712
03:49:33,590 --> 03:49:33,600
the other hand
 

13713
03:49:33,600 --> 03:49:36,070
the other hand
this is a concept from entropy

13714
03:49:36,070 --> 03:49:36,080
this is a concept from entropy
 

13715
03:49:36,080 --> 03:49:38,309
this is a concept from entropy
i can make your life miserable in an

13716
03:49:38,309 --> 03:49:38,319
i can make your life miserable in an
 

13717
03:49:38,319 --> 03:49:39,990
i can make your life miserable in an
infinite number of ways in other words

13718
03:49:39,990 --> 03:49:40,000
infinite number of ways in other words
 

13719
03:49:40,000 --> 03:49:41,830
infinite number of ways in other words
there's more space space to make your

13720
03:49:41,830 --> 03:49:41,840
there's more space space to make your
 

13721
03:49:41,840 --> 03:49:44,309
there's more space space to make your
life unhappy than happy

13722
03:49:44,309 --> 03:49:44,319
life unhappy than happy
 

13723
03:49:44,319 --> 03:49:45,590
life unhappy than happy
and so i thought about that in the

13724
03:49:45,590 --> 03:49:45,600
and so i thought about that in the
 

13725
03:49:45,600 --> 03:49:48,070
and so i thought about that in the
context of what sam said about happiness

13726
03:49:48,070 --> 03:49:48,080
context of what sam said about happiness
 

13727
03:49:48,080 --> 03:49:50,710
context of what sam said about happiness
um so it's sort of like yeah it's an

13728
03:49:50,710 --> 03:49:50,720
um so it's sort of like yeah it's an
 

13729
03:49:50,720 --> 03:49:53,269
um so it's sort of like yeah it's an
expression of entropy and that what you

13730
03:49:53,269 --> 03:49:53,279
expression of entropy and that what you
 

13731
03:49:53,279 --> 03:49:54,870
expression of entropy and that what you
should be doing in life

13732
03:49:54,870 --> 03:49:54,880
should be doing in life
 

13733
03:49:54,880 --> 03:49:56,950
should be doing in life
is doing that which

13734
03:49:56,950 --> 03:49:56,960
is doing that which
 

13735
03:49:56,960 --> 03:49:58,950
is doing that which
will cause you devastation

13736
03:49:58,950 --> 03:49:58,960
will cause you devastation
 

13737
03:49:58,960 --> 03:50:00,550
will cause you devastation
if it goes away

13738
03:50:00,550 --> 03:50:00,560
if it goes away
 

13739
03:50:00,560 --> 03:50:02,469
if it goes away
because those are the things that like

13740
03:50:02,469 --> 03:50:02,479
because those are the things that like
 

13741
03:50:02,479 --> 03:50:04,550
because those are the things that like
are where you're reducing

13742
03:50:04,550 --> 03:50:04,560
are where you're reducing
 

13743
03:50:04,560 --> 03:50:06,870
are where you're reducing
entropy like a kid like anyone who's a

13744
03:50:06,870 --> 03:50:06,880
entropy like a kid like anyone who's a
 

13745
03:50:06,880 --> 03:50:08,070
entropy like a kid like anyone who's a
parent

13746
03:50:08,070 --> 03:50:08,080
parent
 

13747
03:50:08,080 --> 03:50:10,229
parent
knows instantly what i'm talking about

13748
03:50:10,229 --> 03:50:10,239
knows instantly what i'm talking about
 

13749
03:50:10,239 --> 03:50:12,309
knows instantly what i'm talking about
like how to make your life a billion

13750
03:50:12,309 --> 03:50:12,319
like how to make your life a billion
 

13751
03:50:12,319 --> 03:50:13,590
like how to make your life a billion
times worse

13752
03:50:13,590 --> 03:50:13,600
times worse
 

13753
03:50:13,600 --> 03:50:14,790
times worse
but there's no way to make your life a

13754
03:50:14,790 --> 03:50:14,800
but there's no way to make your life a
 

13755
03:50:14,800 --> 03:50:16,389
but there's no way to make your life a
billion times better

13756
03:50:16,389 --> 03:50:16,399
billion times better
 

13757
03:50:16,399 --> 03:50:18,150
billion times better
and so thinking about that now turning

13758
03:50:18,150 --> 03:50:18,160
and so thinking about that now turning
 

13759
03:50:18,160 --> 03:50:20,950
and so thinking about that now turning
into the question of god's existence

13760
03:50:20,950 --> 03:50:20,960
into the question of god's existence
 

13761
03:50:20,960 --> 03:50:22,790
into the question of god's existence
i feel like there's no way that you can

13762
03:50:22,790 --> 03:50:22,800
i feel like there's no way that you can
 

13763
03:50:22,800 --> 03:50:24,229
i feel like there's no way that you can
believe in god

13764
03:50:24,229 --> 03:50:24,239
believe in god
 

13765
03:50:24,239 --> 03:50:26,790
believe in god
to quote misquote sam but there's ways

13766
03:50:26,790 --> 03:50:26,800
to quote misquote sam but there's ways
 

13767
03:50:26,800 --> 03:50:29,349
to quote misquote sam but there's ways
that you can become a believer in god in

13768
03:50:29,349 --> 03:50:29,359
that you can become a believer in god in
 

13769
03:50:29,359 --> 03:50:31,429
that you can become a believer in god in
other words you could increase the

13770
03:50:31,429 --> 03:50:31,439
other words you could increase the
 

13771
03:50:31,439 --> 03:50:33,990
other words you could increase the
bayesian confidence level that there is

13772
03:50:33,990 --> 03:50:34,000
bayesian confidence level that there is
 

13773
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:35,590
bayesian confidence level that there is
some and let's not call it god because

13774
03:50:35,590 --> 03:50:35,600
some and let's not call it god because
 

13775
03:50:35,600 --> 03:50:37,030
some and let's not call it god because
that's a freighted term let's just call

13776
03:50:37,030 --> 03:50:37,040
that's a freighted term let's just call
 

13777
03:50:37,040 --> 03:50:39,429
that's a freighted term let's just call
it some infinite source of goodness or

13778
03:50:39,429 --> 03:50:39,439
it some infinite source of goodness or
 

13779
03:50:39,439 --> 03:50:41,750
it some infinite source of goodness or
our beautiful power in the universe

13780
03:50:41,750 --> 03:50:41,760
our beautiful power in the universe
 

13781
03:50:41,760 --> 03:50:42,630
our beautiful power in the universe
right

13782
03:50:42,630 --> 03:50:42,640
right
 

13783
03:50:42,640 --> 03:50:44,309
right
simple things can do that you can

13784
03:50:44,309 --> 03:50:44,319
simple things can do that you can
 

13785
03:50:44,319 --> 03:50:47,189
simple things can do that you can
increase your credulity in the goodness

13786
03:50:47,189 --> 03:50:47,199
increase your credulity in the goodness
 

13787
03:50:47,199 --> 03:50:49,510
increase your credulity in the goodness
of life and we have this bias as humans

13788
03:50:49,510 --> 03:50:49,520
of life and we have this bias as humans
 

13789
03:50:49,520 --> 03:50:51,110
of life and we have this bias as humans
towards negativity negativity bias

13790
03:50:51,110 --> 03:50:51,120
towards negativity negativity bias
 

13791
03:50:51,120 --> 03:50:52,870
towards negativity negativity bias
well-known fact

13792
03:50:52,870 --> 03:50:52,880
well-known fact
 

13793
03:50:52,880 --> 03:50:54,790
well-known fact
so what i want to do is

13794
03:50:54,790 --> 03:50:54,800
so what i want to do is
 

13795
03:50:54,800 --> 03:50:56,389
so what i want to do is
let's call god good right that's where

13796
03:50:56,389 --> 03:50:56,399
let's call god good right that's where
 

13797
03:50:56,399 --> 03:50:58,469
let's call god good right that's where
it comes from god good same words in

13798
03:50:58,469 --> 03:50:58,479
it comes from god good same words in
 

13799
03:50:58,479 --> 03:50:59,590
it comes from god good same words in
german

13800
03:50:59,590 --> 03:50:59,600
german
 

13801
03:50:59,600 --> 03:51:00,389
german
and

13802
03:51:00,389 --> 03:51:00,399
and
 

13803
03:51:00,399 --> 03:51:02,469
and
when we think about what is good

13804
03:51:02,469 --> 03:51:02,479
when we think about what is good
 

13805
03:51:02,479 --> 03:51:04,389
when we think about what is good
let's do those things

13806
03:51:04,389 --> 03:51:04,399
let's do those things
 

13807
03:51:04,399 --> 03:51:06,790
let's do those things
that would devastate us

13808
03:51:06,790 --> 03:51:06,800
that would devastate us
 

13809
03:51:06,800 --> 03:51:09,830
that would devastate us
and a lot of that could be relationships

13810
03:51:09,830 --> 03:51:09,840
and a lot of that could be relationships
 

13811
03:51:09,840 --> 03:51:12,469
and a lot of that could be relationships
and there's a powerful concept from

13812
03:51:12,469 --> 03:51:12,479
and there's a powerful concept from
 

13813
03:51:12,479 --> 03:51:15,510
and there's a powerful concept from
um from network theory which is that you

13814
03:51:15,510 --> 03:51:15,520
um from network theory which is that you
 

13815
03:51:15,520 --> 03:51:17,349
um from network theory which is that you
know the number of connections in a

13816
03:51:17,349 --> 03:51:17,359
know the number of connections in a
 

13817
03:51:17,359 --> 03:51:19,429
know the number of connections in a
network you know i'm just saying foreign

13818
03:51:19,429 --> 03:51:19,439
network you know i'm just saying foreign
 

13819
03:51:19,439 --> 03:51:20,870
network you know i'm just saying foreign
it grows as the square of the elements

13820
03:51:20,870 --> 03:51:20,880
it grows as the square of the elements
 

13821
03:51:20,880 --> 03:51:22,710
it grows as the square of the elements
in the matrix in the number right so you

13822
03:51:22,710 --> 03:51:22,720
in the matrix in the number right so you
 

13823
03:51:22,720 --> 03:51:25,110
in the matrix in the number right so you
think of a matrix with n people you know

13824
03:51:25,110 --> 03:51:25,120
think of a matrix with n people you know
 

13825
03:51:25,120 --> 03:51:26,630
think of a matrix with n people you know
person one two three four and then

13826
03:51:26,630 --> 03:51:26,640
person one two three four and then
 

13827
03:51:26,640 --> 03:51:28,550
person one two three four and then
there's four other people there's 16

13828
03:51:28,550 --> 03:51:28,560
there's four other people there's 16
 

13829
03:51:28,560 --> 03:51:30,710
there's four other people there's 16
different pairs but two half of them

13830
03:51:30,710 --> 03:51:30,720
different pairs but two half of them
 

13831
03:51:30,720 --> 03:51:32,790
different pairs but two half of them
overlap the diagonal is where you know

13832
03:51:32,790 --> 03:51:32,800
overlap the diagonal is where you know
 

13833
03:51:32,800 --> 03:51:34,550
overlap the diagonal is where you know
each other you know yourself so there's

13834
03:51:34,550 --> 03:51:34,560
each other you know yourself so there's
 

13835
03:51:34,560 --> 03:51:36,950
each other you know yourself so there's
but that still grows as n squared

13836
03:51:36,950 --> 03:51:36,960
but that still grows as n squared
 

13837
03:51:36,960 --> 03:51:38,950
but that still grows as n squared
so those connections

13838
03:51:38,950 --> 03:51:38,960
so those connections
 

13839
03:51:38,960 --> 03:51:39,910
so those connections
increase

13840
03:51:39,910 --> 03:51:39,920
increase
 

13841
03:51:39,920 --> 03:51:42,309
increase
and decrease right you ever have two

13842
03:51:42,309 --> 03:51:42,319
and decrease right you ever have two
 

13843
03:51:42,319 --> 03:51:43,830
and decrease right you ever have two
friends that are fighting and like

13844
03:51:43,830 --> 03:51:43,840
friends that are fighting and like
 

13845
03:51:43,840 --> 03:51:45,189
friends that are fighting and like
you're kind of upset even though you're

13846
03:51:45,189 --> 03:51:45,199
you're kind of upset even though you're
 

13847
03:51:45,199 --> 03:51:46,790
you're kind of upset even though you're
not fighting with either one of them so

13848
03:51:46,790 --> 03:51:46,800
not fighting with either one of them so
 

13849
03:51:46,800 --> 03:51:48,550
not fighting with either one of them so
like a network grows like that so you

13850
03:51:48,550 --> 03:51:48,560
like a network grows like that so you
 

13851
03:51:48,560 --> 03:51:50,070
like a network grows like that so you
want to increase your network as much as

13852
03:51:50,070 --> 03:51:50,080
want to increase your network as much as
 

13853
03:51:50,080 --> 03:51:52,469
want to increase your network as much as
possible but only the kind of high

13854
03:51:52,469 --> 03:51:52,479
possible but only the kind of high
 

13855
03:51:52,479 --> 03:51:54,790
possible but only the kind of high
quality interstices between them and i

13856
03:51:54,790 --> 03:51:54,800
quality interstices between them and i
 

13857
03:51:54,800 --> 03:51:57,429
quality interstices between them and i
think in doing so you incr you you make

13858
03:51:57,429 --> 03:51:57,439
think in doing so you incr you you make
 

13859
03:51:57,439 --> 03:51:59,910
think in doing so you incr you you make
yourself fragile not anti-fragile and i

13860
03:51:59,910 --> 03:51:59,920
yourself fragile not anti-fragile and i
 

13861
03:51:59,920 --> 03:52:01,830
yourself fragile not anti-fragile and i
think that is where

13862
03:52:01,830 --> 03:52:01,840
think that is where
 

13863
03:52:01,840 --> 03:52:03,510
think that is where
purpose and maybe approaching some

13864
03:52:03,510 --> 03:52:03,520
purpose and maybe approaching some
 

13865
03:52:03,520 --> 03:52:05,510
purpose and maybe approaching some
notion of god can come from

13866
03:52:05,510 --> 03:52:05,520
notion of god can come from
 

13867
