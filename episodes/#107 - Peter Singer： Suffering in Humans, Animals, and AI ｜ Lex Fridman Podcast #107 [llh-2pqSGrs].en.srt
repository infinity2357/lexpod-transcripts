00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,430
I think one of them a beneficial impact
is that it showed what racism and

299
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,790
least as far as the West was concerned I
think that meant that I grew up in an

300
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
think that meant that I grew up in an
 

301
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,540
think that meant that I grew up in an
era in which there wasn't the kind of

growing up in Australia and certainly
 

309
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,939
growing up in Australia and certainly
that was clearly seen as something

310
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:57,949
that was clearly seen as something
 

311
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,770
that was clearly seen as something
completely unacceptable

00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,890
expected would be nuclear because of the
way the Second World War had ended so

way the Second World War had ended so
 

321
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,490

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,279
because of the nuclear cloud that was
spreading from the north so

the Brotherhood that people talk about

from soldiers the the sort of

from soldiers the the sort of
 

407
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,689
from soldiers the the sort of
counterintuitive sad idea that the

counterintuitive sad idea that the
 

409

counterintuitive sad idea that the
closest that people feel to each other

closest that people feel to each other
 

411

closest that people feel to each other
is in those moments of suffering of

is in those moments of suffering of
 

413
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,009
is in those moments of suffering of
being at the sort of the edge of seeing

being at the sort of the edge of seeing
 

415
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,120
being at the sort of the edge of seeing
your comrades dying in your arms that

your comrades dying in your arms that

together suffering brings people closer
 

421
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,960
together suffering brings people closer
together how do you make sense of that

422
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:30,970
together how do you make sense of that
 

423
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,639
together how do you make sense of that
it might bring people close together but

424
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:33,649
it might bring people close together but
 

425
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,519
it might bring people close together but
there are other ways of bonding and

the suffering and death that war entails
perhaps you could see you can already

perhaps you could see you can already

hear the romanticized Russian in me we

434
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,290
hear the romanticized Russian in me we
 

435
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,960
hear the romanticized Russian in me we
tend to romanticize suffering just a

436
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:49,970
tend to romanticize suffering just a
 

437
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,910
tend to romanticize suffering just a
little bit in our literature and culture

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
little bit in our literature and culture
 

439
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,970
little bit in our literature and culture
and so on could you take a step back and

440
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:54,980
and so on could you take a step back and
 

441
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,010
and so on could you take a step back and
I apologize if it's a ridiculous

442
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,020
I apologize if it's a ridiculous
 

443
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,860
I apologize if it's a ridiculous
question but what is suffering if you'll

444
00:09:59,860 --> 00:09:59,870
question but what is suffering if you'll
 

445
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,880
question but what is suffering if you'll
try to define what suffering is how

446
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:03,890
try to define what suffering is how
 

447
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,790
try to define what suffering is how
would you go about it suffering is a

448
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
would you go about it suffering is a
 

449
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,180
would you go about it suffering is a
conscious state they can be neither

450
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,190
conscious state they can be neither
 

451
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,010
conscious state they can be neither
suffering for a being who is completely

452
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,020
suffering for a being who is completely
 

453
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,580
suffering for a being who is completely
unconscious and it's distinguished from

454
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:15,590
unconscious and it's distinguished from
 

455
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,850
unconscious and it's distinguished from
other conscious states in terms of being

456
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:18,860
other conscious states in terms of being
 

457
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,230
other conscious states in terms of being
one that considered just in itself we

458
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,240
one that considered just in itself we
 

459
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,660
one that considered just in itself we
would rather be with that it's a

460
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:25,670
would rather be with that it's a
 

461
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,550
would rather be with that it's a
conscious state that we want to stop if

462
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:27,560
conscious state that we want to stop if
 

463
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,400
conscious state that we want to stop if
we're experiencing or we want to avoid

464
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:30,410
we're experiencing or we want to avoid
 

465
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,860
we're experiencing or we want to avoid
having again if we've experienced it in

466
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:32,870
having again if we've experienced it in
 

467
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,830
having again if we've experienced it in
the past and that's as I say emphasized

468
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:35,840
the past and that's as I say emphasized
 

469
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,990
the past and that's as I say emphasized
for its own sake because of course

470
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
for its own sake because of course
 

471
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,360
for its own sake because of course
people will say well suffering

472
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,370
people will say well suffering
 

473
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,040
people will say well suffering
strengthens the spirit it has good

474
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,050
strengthens the spirit it has good
 

475
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,690
strengthens the spirit it has good
consequences

476
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:43,700
consequences
 

477
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,270
consequences
and sometimes it does have those

478
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,280
and sometimes it does have those
 

479
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,760
and sometimes it does have those
consequences and of course sometimes we

480
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:48,770
consequences and of course sometimes we
 

481
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,190
consequences and of course sometimes we

I think they're both and I think this is

00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:09,369
I think they're both and I think this is
 

579
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:10,859
I think they're both and I think this is
true for poverty as well as suffering

580
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:10,869
true for poverty as well as suffering
 

581
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:14,489
true for poverty as well as suffering
there's an objective level of suffering

582
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:14,499
there's an objective level of suffering
 

583
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:17,929
there's an objective level of suffering
or of poverty where we're talking about

584
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:17,939
or of poverty where we're talking about

objective indicators like you're

586
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:21,249
objective indicators like you're
 

587
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:24,720
objective indicators like you're
constantly hungry you don't you can't

588
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:24,730
constantly hungry you don't you can't

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,960
constantly hungry you don't you can't
get enough food you're constantly cold

590
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:26,970
get enough food you're constantly cold
 

591
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,229
get enough food you're constantly cold
you can't get warm you have some

592
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:31,239
you can't get warm you have some
 

593
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:34,019
you can't get warm you have some
physical pains that you're never rid of

physical pains that you're never rid of
 

595
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,169
physical pains that you're never rid of
I think those things are objective but

596
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:37,179
I think those things are objective but
 

597
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,239
I think those things are objective but
it may also be true that if you do get

00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:39,249
it may also be true that if you do get
 

599
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,679
it may also be true that if you do get
rid of that and you get to the stage

600
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:40,689
rid of that and you get to the stage
 

601
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,019
rid of that and you get to the stage
where all of those basic needs have been

00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:43,029
where all of those basic needs have been
 

603
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,979
where all of those basic needs have been
met there may still be there new forms

604
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:46,989
met there may still be there new forms
 

605
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:49,409
met there may still be there new forms
of suffering that develop and perhaps

of suffering that develop and perhaps
 

607
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,090
of suffering that develop and perhaps
that's what we're seeing in the affluent

608
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:51,100
that's what we're seeing in the affluent
 

609
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,720
that's what we're seeing in the affluent
societies we have that people get bored

610
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:54,730
societies we have that people get bored
 

611
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,939
societies we have that people get bored
for example they don't need to spend so

612
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:56,949
for example they don't need to spend so
 

613
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,759
for example they don't need to spend so
many hours a day earning money to get

00:13:59,759 --> 00:13:59,769
many hours a day earning money to get
 

615
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:02,460
many hours a day earning money to get
enough to eat and shelter so now they're

can happen
and that then is a kind of a relative

and that then is a kind of a relative
 

623
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,319

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:32,730
at all it would be of interest to me if
 

641
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,660
at all it would be of interest to me if
we had eliminated all of the objective

642
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:35,670
we had eliminated all of the objective
 

643
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,229
we had eliminated all of the objective
forms of suffering which I think of as

644
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:38,239
forms of suffering which I think of as
 

645
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:41,329
forms of suffering which I think of as
generally more severe and also perhaps

646
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:41,339
generally more severe and also perhaps
 

647
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,299
generally more severe and also perhaps
here at this stage anyway to know how to

648
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:44,309
here at this stage anyway to know how to
 

649
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:48,199
here at this stage anyway to know how to
eliminate so yes in some future state

650
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:48,209
eliminate so yes in some future state
 

651
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:49,819
eliminate so yes in some future state
when we've eliminated those objective

652
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:49,829
when we've eliminated those objective
 

653
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:51,530
when we've eliminated those objective
forms of suffering I would be interested

654
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:51,540
forms of suffering I would be interested
 

655
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,780
forms of suffering I would be interested
in trying to eliminate the relative

656
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:53,790
in trying to eliminate the relative
 

657
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,809
in trying to eliminate the relative
forms as well well that's not a

658
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:56,819
forms as well well that's not a
 

659
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:59,530
forms as well well that's not a
practical need for me at the moment

660
00:14:59,530 --> 00:14:59,540
practical need for me at the moment
 

661
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,819
practical need for me at the moment
sorry to linger on it because you kind

00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:01,829
sorry to linger on it because you kind
 

663
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,629
sorry to linger on it because you kind
of said it but just the is elimination

664
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:05,639
of said it but just the is elimination

the goal for the affluent society so is

00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:09,629
the goal for the affluent society so is

the goal for the affluent society so is
there a crew you know do you see as

668
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:11,819
there a crew you know do you see as
 

669
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:14,869
there a crew you know do you see as
suffering as a creative force suffering

670
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:14,879
suffering as a creative force suffering
 

671
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,729
suffering as a creative force suffering
can be a creative force

672
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:16,739
can be a creative force
 

673
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:19,759
can be a creative force
I think repeating what I said about the

674
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:19,769
I think repeating what I said about the
 

675
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,739
I think repeating what I said about the
highs and whether we need some of the

676
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:21,749
highs and whether we need some of the
 

677
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:24,530
highs and whether we need some of the
lows to experience the highs so it may

678
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:24,540
lows to experience the highs so it may
 

679
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,179
lows to experience the highs so it may
be that suffering makes us more creative

680
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:26,189
be that suffering makes us more creative
 

681
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:30,019
be that suffering makes us more creative
and we regard that as worthwhile maybe

682
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:30,029
and we regard that as worthwhile maybe
 

683
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,909
and we regard that as worthwhile maybe
that that brings some of those highs

684
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:31,919
that that brings some of those highs
 

685
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,979
that that brings some of those highs
with it that we would not have had if

686
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:33,989
with it that we would not have had if
 

687
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:37,369
with it that we would not have had if
we'd had no suffering I I don't really

688
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:37,379
we'd had no suffering I I don't really
 

689
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,590
we'd had no suffering I I don't really
know many people have suggested that and

690
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
know many people have suggested that and
 

691
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,199
know many people have suggested that and
I certainly can't have no basis for

692
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:42,209
I certainly can't have no basis for
 

693
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,699
I certainly can't have no basis for
denying it

694
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:43,709
denying it
 

695
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,749
denying it
and if it's true then I would not want

696
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
and if it's true then I would not want
 

697
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,019
and if it's true then I would not want
to eliminate suffering completely but

698
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:51,029
to eliminate suffering completely but
 

699
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,379
to eliminate suffering completely but
the focus is on and the absolute not to

the focus is on and the absolute not to

do you think people are inherently good

710
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:07,709
do you think people are inherently good
 

711
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,639
do you think people are inherently good
or do we all have good and evil in us

712
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:10,649
or do we all have good and evil in us
 

713
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,150
or do we all have good and evil in us
that basically everyone is capable of

714
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
that basically everyone is capable of
 

715
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,809
that basically everyone is capable of
evil based on the environment certainly

716
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:17,819
evil based on the environment certainly
 

717

most of us have

most of us have
 

719
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,830
most of us have
potential for both good and evil I'm not

720
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:21,840
potential for both good and evil I'm not
 

721
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,240
potential for both good and evil I'm not
prepared to say that everyone is capable

prepared to say that everyone is capable
 

723
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,850
prepared to say that everyone is capable
of evil maybe some people who even in

724
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:25,860
of evil maybe some people who even in
 

725
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,650

the worst of circumstances would not be

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:27,660
the worst of circumstances would not be
 

727
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,130
the worst of circumstances would not be
capable of it but most of us are very

728
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,140
capable of it but most of us are very
 

729
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,140
capable of it but most of us are very
susceptible through environmental

influences so when we look at things

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480
influences so when we look at things
 

733
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,760

that we were talking about previously

that we were talking about previously

let's say the what the Nazis did during

736
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:41,340
let's say the what the Nazis did during
 

737
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,480
let's say the what the Nazis did during
the Holocaust I think it's quite

738
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:44,490
the Holocaust I think it's quite
 

739
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,740
the Holocaust I think it's quite
difficult to say I know that I would not

740
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:48,750
difficult to say I know that I would not
 

741
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,200
difficult to say I know that I would not
have done those things even if I were in

742
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,210
have done those things even if I were in
 

743
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,020
have done those things even if I were in
the same circumstances as those who did

744
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,030
the same circumstances as those who did
 

745
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,110
the same circumstances as those who did
them even if let's say I had grown up

746
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,120
them even if let's say I had grown up
 

747
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,360
them even if let's say I had grown up
under the Nazi regime and had been

748
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,370
under the Nazi regime and had been
 

749
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,760
under the Nazi regime and had been
indoctrinated with racist ideas had also

750
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:03,770
indoctrinated with racist ideas had also
 

751
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,710
indoctrinated with racist ideas had also
had the the idea that I must obey orders

752
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
had the the idea that I must obey orders
 

753
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,210
had the the idea that I must obey orders
follow the commands of the Fuhrer plus

754
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,220
follow the commands of the Fuhrer plus
 

755
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,800
follow the commands of the Fuhrer plus
of course perhaps the threat that if I

756
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:12,810
of course perhaps the threat that if I
 

757
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,110
of course perhaps the threat that if I
didn't do certain things I might get

758
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
didn't do certain things I might get
 

759
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,540
didn't do certain things I might get
sent to the Russian front and that would

760
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:17,550
sent to the Russian front and that would
 

761
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,570
sent to the Russian front and that would
be a pretty grim fight I think it's

762
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:20,580
be a pretty grim fight I think it's
 

763
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,040
be a pretty grim fight I think it's
really hard for anybody to say

764
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,050
really hard for anybody to say
 

765
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,070
really hard for anybody to say
nevertheless I know I would not have

766
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,080
nevertheless I know I would not have
 

767
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,610
nevertheless I know I would not have
killed those Jews or whatever so what's

768
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:28,620
killed those Jews or whatever so what's
 

769
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,200
killed those Jews or whatever so what's
your intuition how many people will be

770
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,210
your intuition how many people will be
 

771
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,440
your intuition how many people will be
able to say that truly to be able to say

772
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,450
able to say that truly to be able to say
 

773
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,970
able to say that truly to be able to say
it I think very few less than 10% to me

774
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:37,980
it I think very few less than 10% to me
 

775
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,920
it I think very few less than 10% to me
it seems a very interesting and powerful

776
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:39,930
it seems a very interesting and powerful
 

777
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,890
it seems a very interesting and powerful
thing to meditate on so I've read a lot

778
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:42,900
thing to meditate on so I've read a lot
 

779
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,490
thing to meditate on so I've read a lot
about the war a world war 2 and I can't

780
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:46,500
about the war a world war 2 and I can't
 

781
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,890
about the war a world war 2 and I can't
escape the thought that I would have not

782
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:48,900
escape the thought that I would have not
 

783
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,060
escape the thought that I would have not
been one of the 10% right I have to say

784
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,070
been one of the 10% right I have to say
 

785
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,450
been one of the 10% right I have to say
I simply don't know I would like to hope

786
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:56,460
I simply don't know I would like to hope
 

787
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,760
I simply don't know I would like to hope
that I would have been one of the 10%

788
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:58,770
that I would have been one of the 10%
 

789
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,040
that I would have been one of the 10%
but I don't really have any basis for

790
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,050
but I don't really have any basis for
 

791
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,590
but I don't really have any basis for
claiming that I would have been

claiming that I would have been
 

793
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,560
claiming that I would have been
different from the majority is it a

794
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:06,570
different from the majority is it a
 

795
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,920
different from the majority is it a
worthwhile thing to contemplate it would

796
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:09,930
worthwhile thing to contemplate it would
 

797
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,330
worthwhile thing to contemplate it would
be interesting if we could find a way of

798
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:11,340
be interesting if we could find a way of
 

799
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,210
be interesting if we could find a way of
really finding these answers there

800
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,220
really finding these answers there
 

801
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,530
really finding these answers there
obviously is quite a bit of research on

802
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:17,540
obviously is quite a bit of research on
 

803
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,600
obviously is quite a bit of research on
people during the Holocaust on how

804
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:20,610
people during the Holocaust on how
 

805
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,990
people during the Holocaust on how
ordinary Germans got led to do terrible

806
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
ordinary Germans got led to do terrible
 

807
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,630
ordinary Germans got led to do terrible
things and there's what there are also

808
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
things and there's what there are also
 

809
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,270
things and there's what there are also
studies of the resistance some heroic

810
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
studies of the resistance some heroic
 

811
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,850
studies of the resistance some heroic
people in the white rose group for

812
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:31,860
people in the white rose group for
 

813
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,220
people in the white rose group for
example who resisted even though they

814
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,230
example who resisted even though they
 

815
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,090
example who resisted even though they
knew they were likely to die for it but

816
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,100
knew they were likely to die for it but
 

817
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,950
knew they were likely to die for it but
I don't know whether these studies

818
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:39,960
I don't know whether these studies
 

819
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,100
I don't know whether these studies
really can answer your larger question

820
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,110
really can answer your larger question
 

821
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,840
really can answer your larger question
of how many people would have been

822
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:44,850
of how many people would have been
 

823
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,870
of how many people would have been
capable of doing that

824
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
capable of doing that
 

825
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,610
capable of doing that
well sort of the reason I think it's

826
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:49,620
well sort of the reason I think it's
 

827
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,400
well sort of the reason I think it's
interesting is in the world as you

828
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,410
interesting is in the world as you
 

829
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,450
interesting is in the world as you
described you know when when there are

00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:56,460
described you know when when there are
 

831
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,700
described you know when when there are
things that you'd like to do they're

00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:58,710
things that you'd like to do they're
 

833
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,390
things that you'd like to do they're
good that are objectively good it's

834
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
good that are objectively good it's
 

835
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,210
good that are objectively good it's
useful to think about whether I'm not

836
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,220
useful to think about whether I'm not
 

837
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,250
useful to think about whether I'm not
willing to do something or I don't even

838
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,260
willing to do something or I don't even
 

839
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,780
willing to do something or I don't even
I'm not willing to acknowledge something

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:08,790
I'm not willing to acknowledge something
 

841
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,700
I'm not willing to acknowledge something
as good and the right thing to do

842
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:10,710
as good and the right thing to do
 

843
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,690
as good and the right thing to do
because I'm simply scared of putting my

844
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:14,700
because I'm simply scared of putting my
 

845
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,110
because I'm simply scared of putting my
life of damaging my life in some kind of

846
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,120
life of damaging my life in some kind of
 

847
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,330
life of damaging my life in some kind of
way and that kind of thought exercise is

848
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:20,340
way and that kind of thought exercise is
 

849
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,820
way and that kind of thought exercise is
helpful to understand what is what is

850
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:22,830
helpful to understand what is what is
 

851
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,710
helpful to understand what is what is
the right thing in my current skill set

the right thing in my current skill set
 

853
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,950
the right thing in my current skill set
and the capacity to do so if there's

854
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:27,960
and the capacity to do so if there's
 

855
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,890
and the capacity to do so if there's
things that are convenient and there's I

856
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:30,900
things that are convenient and there's I
 

857
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,120
things that are convenient and there's I
wonder if there are things that are

858
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,130
wonder if there are things that are
 

859
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,190
wonder if there are things that are
highly inconvenient where I would have

860
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,200
highly inconvenient where I would have
 

861
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,460
highly inconvenient where I would have
to experience derision or hatred or or

862
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:37,470
to experience derision or hatred or or
 

863
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,740
to experience derision or hatred or or
death or all those kinds of things but

864
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:39,750
death or all those kinds of things but
 

865
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,300
death or all those kinds of things but
it's truly the right thing to do and

866
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,310
it's truly the right thing to do and
 

867
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,480
it's truly the right thing to do and
that kind of balance is I feel like in

868
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,490
that kind of balance is I feel like in
 

869
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,970
that kind of balance is I feel like in
America we don't have it's it's

870
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:46,980
America we don't have it's it's
 

871
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,160
America we don't have it's it's
difficult to think in the current times

872
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,170
difficult to think in the current times
 

873
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,980
difficult to think in the current times
it seems easier to put yourself back in

874
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:51,990
it seems easier to put yourself back in
 

875
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,180
it seems easier to put yourself back in
history when you can sort of objectively

876
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,190
history when you can sort of objectively
 

877
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,430
history when you can sort of objectively
contemplate whether how willing you are

878
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:58,440
contemplate whether how willing you are
 

879
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,620
contemplate whether how willing you are
to do the right thing when the cost is

880
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:00,630
to do the right thing when the cost is
 

881
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,000
to do the right thing when the cost is
high true but I think we do face those

882
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,010
high true but I think we do face those
 

883
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,400
high true but I think we do face those
challenges today and I think we can

884
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,410
challenges today and I think we can
 

885
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,100
challenges today and I think we can
still ask ourselves those questions so

886
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,110
still ask ourselves those questions so
 

887
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,800
still ask ourselves those questions so
one stand that I took more than 40 years

888
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:12,810
one stand that I took more than 40 years
 

889
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,530
one stand that I took more than 40 years
ago now was to stop eating meat become a

890
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:15,540
ago now was to stop eating meat become a
 

891
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,250
ago now was to stop eating meat become a
vegetarian at a time when you hardly met

892
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,260
vegetarian at a time when you hardly met
 

893
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,680
vegetarian at a time when you hardly met
anybody who was a vegetarian or if you

894
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:21,690
anybody who was a vegetarian or if you
 

895
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,470
anybody who was a vegetarian or if you
did they might have been a Hindu or they

896
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
did they might have been a Hindu or they
 

897
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,770
did they might have been a Hindu or they
might have had some weird theories about

898
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:27,780
might have had some weird theories about
 

899
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,090
might have had some weird theories about
meat and health and I I know thinking

900
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,100
meat and health and I I know thinking
 

901
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,740
meat and health and I I know thinking
about making that decision I was

902
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:33,750
about making that decision I was
 

903
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,940
about making that decision I was
convinced that it was the right thing to

904
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:34,950
convinced that it was the right thing to
 

905
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,550
convinced that it was the right thing to
do but I still did have to think how all

906
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:37,560
do but I still did have to think how all
 

907
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,690
do but I still did have to think how all
my friends are going to think that I'm a

908
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:38,700
my friends are going to think that I'm a
 

909
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,340
my friends are going to think that I'm a
crank

910
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,350
crank
 

911
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,310
crank
because I'm now refusing to eat meat

912
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,320
because I'm now refusing to eat meat
 

913
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,260
because I'm now refusing to eat meat
so you know I'm not saying there were

914
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,270
so you know I'm not saying there were
 

915
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,510
so you know I'm not saying there were
any terrible sanctions obviously but I

916
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:48,520
any terrible sanctions obviously but I
 

917
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,210
any terrible sanctions obviously but I
thought about that and I guess I decided

918
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:51,220
thought about that and I guess I decided
 

919
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,550
thought about that and I guess I decided
well I still think this is the right

920
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:53,560
well I still think this is the right
 

921
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,650
well I still think this is the right
thing to do and if I'll put up with that

922
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:55,660
thing to do and if I'll put up with that
 

923
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,450
thing to do and if I'll put up with that
if it happens and one or two friends

924
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:57,460
if it happens and one or two friends
 

925
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,300
if it happens and one or two friends
were clearly uncomfortable with that

926
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,310
were clearly uncomfortable with that
 

927
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,030
were clearly uncomfortable with that
decision but you know that was pretty

928
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,040
decision but you know that was pretty
 

929
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,890
decision but you know that was pretty
minor compared to the historical

930
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:04,900
minor compared to the historical
 

931
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,100
minor compared to the historical
examples that we've been talking about

932
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,110
examples that we've been talking about
 

933
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,600
examples that we've been talking about
but other issues that we have around too

934
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:09,610
but other issues that we have around too
 

935
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,570
but other issues that we have around too
like global poverty and what we ought to

936
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:12,580
like global poverty and what we ought to
 

937
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,700
like global poverty and what we ought to
be doing about that is is another

938
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:14,710
be doing about that is is another
 

939
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,460
be doing about that is is another
question where people I think can have

940
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:17,470
question where people I think can have
 

941
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,080
question where people I think can have
have the opportunity to take a stand on

942
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,090
have the opportunity to take a stand on
 

943
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,360
have the opportunity to take a stand on
what's the right thing to do now climate

944
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,370
what's the right thing to do now climate
 

945
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,280
what's the right thing to do now climate
change would be a third question where

946
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,290
change would be a third question where
 

947
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,040
change would be a third question where
again people are taking a stand over you

948
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,050
again people are taking a stand over you
 

949
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,200
again people are taking a stand over you
know look at great Atun Berg there and

950
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,210
know look at great Atun Berg there and
 

951
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,740
know look at great Atun Berg there and
say well I think it must have taken a

952
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:31,750
say well I think it must have taken a
 

953
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,590
say well I think it must have taken a

and I think that's the indication that

is not conscious and that's the way to

1080
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,170
is not conscious and that's the way to
 

1081
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,200
is not conscious and that's the way to
think about it now it may be difficult

1082
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,210
think about it now it may be difficult
 

1083
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,750
think about it now it may be difficult
to tell of course whether a certain eye

1084
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:32,760
to tell of course whether a certain eye
 

1085
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,520
to tell of course whether a certain eye
eye is or isn't conscious it may mimic

1086
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:34,530
eye is or isn't conscious it may mimic
 

1087
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,110
eye is or isn't conscious it may mimic
consciousness and we can't tell if it's

1088
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,120
consciousness and we can't tell if it's
 

1089
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,150
consciousness and we can't tell if it's
only mimicking it or if it's the real

1090
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:38,160
only mimicking it or if it's the real
 

1091
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,340
only mimicking it or if it's the real
thing but that's what we're looking for

1092
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:40,350
thing but that's what we're looking for
 

1093
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,520
thing but that's what we're looking for
is there a subjective experience a

1094
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:43,530
is there a subjective experience a
 

1095
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,430
is there a subjective experience a
perspective on the world from which

1096

things can go well or badly from that

1098
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:48,690
things can go well or badly from that
 

1099
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,130
things can go well or badly from that
perspective so our idea what Cocteau of

1100
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,140
perspective so our idea what Cocteau of
 

1101
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,950
perspective so our idea what Cocteau of
what suffering looks like comes from our

1102
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
what suffering looks like comes from our
 

1103
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,520
what suffering looks like comes from our
just watching our selves when we're in

1104

just watching our selves when we're in
 

1105
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,060
just watching our selves when we're in
pain sort of oh when we're experiencing

1109
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,160
pleasure it's not only a pleasure and
pain yes yes so and then you could

1110
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,170
pain yes yes so and then you could
 

1111
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,330

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:08,340
actually
 

1113
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,830
actually
back on us but I would say that's how we

1114
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
back on us but I would say that's how we
 

1115
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,549
back on us but I would say that's how we
kind of build an intuition about animals

1116
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:13,559
kind of build an intuition about animals
 

1117
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,360
kind of build an intuition about animals
is we can infer the similarities between

1118
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,370
is we can infer the similarities between
 

1119
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,669
is we can infer the similarities between
humans and animals and so infer that

1120
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
humans and animals and so infer that
 

1121
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,380
humans and animals and so infer that
they're suffering or not based on

1122
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:21,390
they're suffering or not based on
 

1123
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,510
they're suffering or not based on
certain things and they're conscious or

1124
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
certain things and they're conscious or
 

1125
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,360
certain things and they're conscious or
not so what if robots you mentioned

1126
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,370
not so what if robots you mentioned
 

1127
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,940
not so what if robots you mentioned
Google Maps and I've done this

1128
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:31,950
Google Maps and I've done this
 

1129
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,950
Google Maps and I've done this
experiment so I work in robotics just

1130
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:33,960
experiment so I work in robotics just
 

1131
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,169
experiment so I work in robotics just
from my own self or I have several

1132
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:36,179
from my own self or I have several
 

1133
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,810
from my own self or I have several
Roomba robots and I play with different

1134
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:38,820
Roomba robots and I play with different
 

1135
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,419
Roomba robots and I play with different
speech interaction voice based

1136
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:41,429
speech interaction voice based
 

1137
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:44,240
speech interaction voice based
interaction and if the Roomba or the

1138
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,250
interaction and if the Roomba or the
 

1139
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,260
interaction and if the Roomba or the
robot or Google Maps shows any signs of

1140
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,270
robot or Google Maps shows any signs of
 

1141
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,590
robot or Google Maps shows any signs of
pain like screaming or moaning or being

1142
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
pain like screaming or moaning or being
 

1143
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,409
pain like screaming or moaning or being
displeased by something you've done that

1144
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:54,419
displeased by something you've done that
 

1145
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,260
displeased by something you've done that
in my mind I can't help but immediately

1146
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,270
in my mind I can't help but immediately
 

1147
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,830
in my mind I can't help but immediately
upgrade it and even when I myself

1148
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:00,840
upgrade it and even when I myself
 

1149
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,560
upgrade it and even when I myself
programmed it in just having another

1150
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:03,570
programmed it in just having another
 

1151
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,810
programmed it in just having another
entity that's now for the moment

1152
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:05,820
entity that's now for the moment
 

1153
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,450
entity that's now for the moment
disjoint from me showing signs of pain

1154
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,460
disjoint from me showing signs of pain
 

1155
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,210
disjoint from me showing signs of pain
makes me feel like it is conscious like

1156
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:11,220
makes me feel like it is conscious like
 

1157
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,909
makes me feel like it is conscious like
I immediately and then the whatever the

1158
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:13,919
I immediately and then the whatever the
 

1159
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,600
I immediately and then the whatever the
I immediately realize it's not obviously

1160
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:17,610
I immediately realize it's not obviously
 

1161
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,630
I immediately realize it's not obviously
but that feeling is there so sort of I

1162
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
but that feeling is there so sort of I
 

1163
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,049
but that feeling is there so sort of I
guess I guess what do you think about a

1164
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:24,059
guess I guess what do you think about a
 

1165
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:29,269
guess I guess what do you think about a
world where Google Maps and rope rumbas

1166
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
world where Google Maps and rope rumbas
 

1167
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,769
world where Google Maps and rope rumbas
are pretending to be conscious and we

1168
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:32,779
are pretending to be conscious and we
 

1169
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:35,149
are pretending to be conscious and we
descendants of apes are not smart enough

1170
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:35,159
descendants of apes are not smart enough
 

1171
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,149
descendants of apes are not smart enough
to realize it or not or or whatever or

1172
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:38,159
to realize it or not or or whatever or
 

1173
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,649
to realize it or not or or whatever or
that is conscious they appear to be

1174
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:39,659
that is conscious they appear to be
 

1175
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:42,830
that is conscious they appear to be
conscious and so you then have to give

1176
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:42,840
conscious and so you then have to give
 

1177
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,110
conscious and so you then have to give
them rights the reason I'm asking that

1178
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,120
them rights the reason I'm asking that
 

1179
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,990
them rights the reason I'm asking that
is that kind of capability may be closer

1180
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,000
is that kind of capability may be closer
 

1181
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,120
is that kind of capability may be closer
than then we realize yes that kind of

1182
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,130
than then we realize yes that kind of
 

1183
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:59,090
than then we realize yes that kind of
capability may be closer but I don't

1184
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,100
capability may be closer but I don't
 

1185
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,230
capability may be closer but I don't
think it follows that we have to give

1186
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,240
think it follows that we have to give
 

1187
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,769
think it follows that we have to give
them rights

1188
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:00,779
them rights
 

1189
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,340
them rights
I suppose the the argument for saying

1190
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,350
I suppose the the argument for saying
 

1191
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,539
I suppose the the argument for saying
that in those circumstances we should

1192
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:05,549
that in those circumstances we should
 

1193
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:07,460
that in those circumstances we should
give them rights is that if we don't

1194
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,470
give them rights is that if we don't
 

1195
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:11,029
give them rights is that if we don't
we'll harden ourselves against other

1196
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
we'll harden ourselves against other
 

1197
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,310
we'll harden ourselves against other
beings who are not robots and who really

1198
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,320
beings who are not robots and who really
 

1199
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,389
beings who are not robots and who really
do suffer that's a possibility that you

1200
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:17,399
do suffer that's a possibility that you
 

1201
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:19,220
do suffer that's a possibility that you
know if we get used to looking at a

1202
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,230
know if we get used to looking at a
 

1203
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,920
know if we get used to looking at a
being suffering

1204
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:20,930
being suffering
 

1205
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,720
being suffering
and saying man we don't have to do

1206
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:22,730
and saying man we don't have to do
 

1207
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,920
and saying man we don't have to do
anything about that that being doesn't

1208
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:23,930
anything about that that being doesn't
 

1209
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,610
anything about that that being doesn't
have any rights

1210
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:24,620
have any rights
 

1211
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,070
have any rights
maybe we'll feel the same about animals

1212
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,080
maybe we'll feel the same about animals
 

1213
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,100
maybe we'll feel the same about animals
for instance and interestingly among

1214
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,110
for instance and interestingly among
 

1215
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:37,050
for instance and interestingly among
philosophers and thinkers who denied

1216
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,060
philosophers and thinkers who denied
 

1217
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,610
philosophers and thinkers who denied
that we have any direct duties to

1218
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:39,620
that we have any direct duties to
 

1219
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,440
that we have any direct duties to
animals and this includes people like

1220
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,450
animals and this includes people like
 

1221
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,920
animals and this includes people like
Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant they

1222
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:44,930
Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant they
 

1223
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,340
Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant they
did say yes but still it's better not to

1224
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:48,350
did say yes but still it's better not to
 

1225
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,560
did say yes but still it's better not to
be cruel to them not because of the

1226
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,570
be cruel to them not because of the
 

1227
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,700
be cruel to them not because of the
suffering we're inflicting on the

1228
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:51,710
suffering we're inflicting on the
 

1229
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,270
suffering we're inflicting on the
animals but because if we are we may

1230
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:55,280
animals but because if we are we may
 

1231
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,370
animals but because if we are we may
develop a cruel disposition and this

1232
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:57,380
develop a cruel disposition and this
 

1233
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,820
develop a cruel disposition and this
will be bad for humans you know because

1234
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:00,830
will be bad for humans you know because
 

1235
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,290
will be bad for humans you know because
we were more likely to be cruel to other

1236
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:02,300
we were more likely to be cruel to other
 

1237
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,190
we were more likely to be cruel to other
humans and that would be wrong so but

1238
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,200
humans and that would be wrong so but
 

1239
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,020
humans and that would be wrong so but
you don't accept that kahin I don't

1240
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,030
you don't accept that kahin I don't
 

1241
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,760
you don't accept that kahin I don't
accept that as a the basis of the

1242
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:09,770
accept that as a the basis of the
 

1243
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,140
accept that as a the basis of the
argument for why we shouldn't be cruel

1244
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,150
argument for why we shouldn't be cruel
 

1245
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,310
argument for why we shouldn't be cruel
to animals I think the basis of the

1246
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
to animals I think the basis of the
 

1247
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,570
to animals I think the basis of the
argument for why we shouldn't be cruel

1248
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:13,580
argument for why we shouldn't be cruel
 

1249
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,640
argument for why we shouldn't be cruel
to animals is just that we're inflicting

1250
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:15,650
to animals is just that we're inflicting
 

1251
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,110
to animals is just that we're inflicting
suffering on them and the suffering is a

1252
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,120
suffering on them and the suffering is a
 

1253
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,940
suffering on them and the suffering is a
bad thing but possibly I might accept

1254
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:21,950
bad thing but possibly I might accept
 

1255
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,380
bad thing but possibly I might accept
some sort of parallel of that argument

1256
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,390
some sort of parallel of that argument
 

1257
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,900
some sort of parallel of that argument
as a reason why you shouldn't be cruel

1258
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:25,910
as a reason why you shouldn't be cruel
 

1259
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,680
as a reason why you shouldn't be cruel
to these robots that mimic the symptoms

1260
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:29,690
to these robots that mimic the symptoms
 

1261
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,110
to these robots that mimic the symptoms
of pain if if it's gonna be harder for

1262
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,120
of pain if if it's gonna be harder for
 

1263
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,330
of pain if if it's gonna be harder for
us to distinguish I would venture to say

1264
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:34,340
us to distinguish I would venture to say
 

1265
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,240
us to distinguish I would venture to say
I'd like to disagree with you and what

1266
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,250
I'd like to disagree with you and what
 

1267
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,420
I'd like to disagree with you and what
most people I think at the risk of

if that Roomba is dedicated to faking
the consciousness in the suffering I

1274
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:50,570
the consciousness in the suffering I
 

1275
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,890
the consciousness in the suffering I
think we will it will be impossible for

1276
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:53,900
think we will it will be impossible for
 

1277
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,490
think we will it will be impossible for
us

arguments with animals to robots that
 

1283
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,070
arguments with animals to robots that
they deserve rights in that sense now we

1284
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,080
they deserve rights in that sense now we
 

1285
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,460
they deserve rights in that sense now we
might outlaw the addition of those kinds

might outlaw the addition of those kinds

I think I'm quite surprised by the

00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,600
upgrade in consciousness that the
 

1293
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,980
upgrade in consciousness that the

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:20,990
display of suffering creates it's a
 

1295
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,850
display of suffering creates it's a
totally open world but I'd like to just

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:23,860
totally open world but I'd like to just
 

1297

totally open world but I'd like to just
sort of the difference between animals

1298

sort of the difference between animals
 

1299
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,810
sort of the difference between animals
and other humans is that in the robot

00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:28,820
and other humans is that in the robot
 

1301
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,830
and other humans is that in the robot
case we've added it in ourselves

1302
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:31,840
case we've added it in ourselves
 

1303
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,510
case we've added it in ourselves
therefore we can say something about

therefore we can say something about
 

1305
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,710
therefore we can say something about
the how real it is but I would like to

00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:38,720
the how real it is but I would like to
 

1307
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,600
the how real it is but I would like to
say that the display of it is what makes

1308
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:40,610
say that the display of it is what makes
 

1309
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,390
say that the display of it is what makes
it real and there's some I'm not a

but at least like to add that as a
 

1315
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,590
but at least like to add that as a

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:50,600
possibility and I've been surprised by
 

1317
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,830

1325
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,870
humans which is rather like what you're
talking about and that's behaviorism so

00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:04,880
talking about and that's behaviorism so
 

1327
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,460

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:17,690
well you need to have behavior because
 

1339
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,940
well you need to have behavior because
that's what you can observe you can't

that's what you can observe you can't
 

1341
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,820
that's what you can observe you can't
observe consciousness but in philosophy

1342
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:21,830
observe consciousness but in philosophy
 

1343
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,280

1387
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,169
have a dream it's to basically to wake
up and recall something so you could

up and recall something so you could

about
 

1393

about
and say so what it is to be in pain is

and say so what it is to be in pain is
 

1395

and say so what it is to be in pain is
to exhibit these symptoms of pain

to exhibit these symptoms of pain

to exhibit these symptoms of pain
behavior and therefore these robots are

1398

behavior and therefore these robots are
 

1399
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,150
behavior and therefore these robots are
in pain that's what the word means but

in pain that's what the word means but
 

1401
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,530
in pain that's what the word means but
nowadays not many people think that

nowadays not many people think that

1405
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:42,880
riles kind of philosophical behaviorism
is really very plausible so I think they

1406
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:42,890
is really very plausible so I think they
 

1407
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,220
is really very plausible so I think they
would say the same about your view so

1408
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,230
would say the same about your view so
 

1409
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,930
would say the same about your view so
yes I'd just spoken with Noam Chomsky

human behavior but I am one of the few

scream in pain and I just don't know

1422
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:11,730
scream in pain and I just don't know
 

1423
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,899
scream in pain and I just don't know
what to do with that empirical evidence

1424
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:13,909
what to do with that empirical evidence
 

1425
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:17,299
what to do with that empirical evidence
because it's hard it's sort of

1426
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:17,309
because it's hard it's sort of
 

1427
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:21,350
because it's hard it's sort of
philosophically I agree but the only

1428
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
philosophically I agree but the only
 

1429
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,909
philosophically I agree but the only
reason I philosophically agree in that

1430
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:22,919
reason I philosophically agree in that
 

1431
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,470
reason I philosophically agree in that
case is because that was the programmer

1432
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,480
case is because that was the programmer
 

1433
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,570
case is because that was the programmer
but if somebody else was a programmer

1434
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:26,580
but if somebody else was a programmer
 

1435
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,009
but if somebody else was a programmer
I'm not sure I would be able to

00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:28,019
I'm not sure I would be able to
 

1437
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,440
I'm not sure I would be able to
interpret that wall so it's uh I think

1438
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,450
interpret that wall so it's uh I think
 

1439
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,899
interpret that wall so it's uh I think
it's a new world that I was just curious

1440
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:35,909
it's a new world that I was just curious
 

1441
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:38,480
it's a new world that I was just curious
what your thoughts are for now you feel

that the display of the what we can kind
of intellectual say is a fake display of

of intellectual say is a fake display of

00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:51,470
of intellectual say is a fake display of
suffering is not suffering that's right

1448
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:51,480
suffering is not suffering that's right
 

1449
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,629
suffering is not suffering that's right
that would be my view but that's

1450
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:53,639
that would be my view but that's
 

1451
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:54,980
that would be my view but that's
consistent of course with the idea that

00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:54,990
consistent of course with the idea that
 

1453
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,740
consistent of course with the idea that
it's part of our nature to respond to

it's part of our nature to respond to
 

1455
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,360
it's part of our nature to respond to
this display if it's reasonably

this display if it's reasonably
 

1457
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:04,039
this display if it's reasonably
authentically done and therefore it's

1458
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:04,049
authentically done and therefore it's
 

1459
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,480
authentically done and therefore it's
understandable that people would feel

understandable that people would feel
 

1461
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,230
understandable that people would feel
this and maybe as I said it's even a

1462
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:09,240
this and maybe as I said it's even a
 

1463
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,820
this and maybe as I said it's even a
good thing that they do feel it and you

1464
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:10,830
good thing that they do feel it and you
 

1465
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,440
good thing that they do feel it and you
wouldn't want to harden yourself against

1466
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:12,450
wouldn't want to harden yourself against
 

1467
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,029
wouldn't want to harden yourself against
it because then you might harden

1468
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:14,039
it because then you might harden
 

1469
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,799
it because then you might harden
yourself against beings who are really

1470
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:15,809
yourself against beings who are really
 

1471
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:19,159

suffering but there's this line you know

about this could could look at the

more cheaply using them in some research
that's by no means essential for

that's by no means essential for

00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,940
that's by no means essential for

so I think that's unjustified because I

so I think that's unjustified because I
think the significance of pain and

00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
think the significance of pain and
 

1757
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,400
think the significance of pain and
suffering does not depend on the species

1758

suffering does not depend on the species

any more than it depends on the race or

you you know we often ask people so

00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,760
you you know we often ask people so
suppose you're in a car accident and

00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:48,770
suppose you're in a car accident and

suppose you're in a car accident and
your brain were transplanted into

1826
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:50,360
your brain were transplanted into
 

1827
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,570
your brain were transplanted into
someone else's body do you think you

1828
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:52,580
someone else's body do you think you
 

1829
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,310
someone else's body do you think you
would survive or would it be the person

1830
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:54,320
would survive or would it be the person
 

1831
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,960
would survive or would it be the person
whose body was still surviving

1832
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:55,970
whose body was still surviving
 

1833
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,570
whose body was still surviving
you know your body having been destroyed

1834
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:57,580
you know your body having been destroyed
 

1835
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,190
you know your body having been destroyed
and most people say I think I would you

1836
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:00,200
and most people say I think I would you
 

1837
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,750
and most people say I think I would you
know if my brain was transplanted along

1838
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:01,760
know if my brain was transplanted along
 

1839
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,160
know if my brain was transplanted along
with my memories and so on I would

1840
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,170
with my memories and so on I would
 

1841
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,730
with my memories and so on I would
survive so we could ask Adi those kinds

1842
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:06,740
survive so we could ask Adi those kinds
 

1843
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,640
survive so we could ask Adi those kinds
of questions if they were transferred to

1844
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:09,650
of questions if they were transferred to
 

1845
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,070
of questions if they were transferred to
a different piece of hardware would they

1846
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:12,080
a different piece of hardware would they
 

1847
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,770
a different piece of hardware would they
survive what would survive that effect

1848
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:14,780
survive what would survive that effect
 

1849
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,770
survive what would survive that effect
so it's sort of on that line another

1850
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:17,780
so it's sort of on that line another
 

1851
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,580
so it's sort of on that line another
perhaps absurd question but do you think

1852
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:20,590
perhaps absurd question but do you think
 

1853
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:23,530
perhaps absurd question but do you think
having a body is necessary for

00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:23,540
having a body is necessary for
 

1855
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,910
having a body is necessary for
consciousness so do you think digital

1856
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:27,920
consciousness so do you think digital
 

1857
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,840
consciousness so do you think digital
beings can suffer presumably digital

1858
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:31,850
beings can suffer presumably digital
 

1859
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:35,890
beings can suffer presumably digital
beings need to be running on some kind

1860
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:35,900
beings need to be running on some kind
 

1861
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,960
beings need to be running on some kind
of hardware right yes it ultimately

1862
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:37,970
of hardware right yes it ultimately
 

1863
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,850
of hardware right yes it ultimately
boils down to but this is exactly we

1864
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:39,860
boils down to but this is exactly we
 

1865
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,980
boils down to but this is exactly we
just said is moving the brain right one

1866
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:41,990
just said is moving the brain right one
 

1867
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,270
just said is moving the brain right one
place so you couldn't move it to a

1868
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:43,280
place so you couldn't move it to a
 

1869
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,830
place so you couldn't move it to a
different kind of highway you know and I

1870
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:44,840
different kind of highway you know and I
 

1871
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,080
different kind of highway you know and I
could say look you know your hardware is

1872
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,090
could say look you know your hardware is
 

1873
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,720
could say look you know your hardware is
needs getting worn out we're going to

1874
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:49,730
needs getting worn out we're going to
 

1875
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,640
needs getting worn out we're going to
transfer you to a fresh piece of

1876
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:51,650
transfer you to a fresh piece of
 

1877
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,180
transfer you to a fresh piece of
hardware so we kind of

1878
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,190
hardware so we kind of
 

1879
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,940
hardware so we kind of
shut you down for a time but don't worry

1880
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:55,950
shut you down for a time but don't worry
 

1881
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,220
shut you down for a time but don't worry
you know you'll be running very soon on

1882
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,230
you know you'll be running very soon on
 

1883
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,800
you know you'll be running very soon on
a nice fresh piece of hardware and you

1884
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:00,810
a nice fresh piece of hardware and you
 

1885
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,839
a nice fresh piece of hardware and you
could imagine this conscious AG are

1886
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:02,849
could imagine this conscious AG are
 

1887
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:04,370
could imagine this conscious AG are

saying that's fine I don't mind having a
little rest just make sure you don't

1890
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:06,089
little rest just make sure you don't
 

1891
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:09,500
little rest just make sure you don't
lose me like that yeah I mean that's an

1892
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:09,510
lose me like that yeah I mean that's an
 

1893
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,480
lose me like that yeah I mean that's an
interesting thought that even with us

1894
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:11,490
interesting thought that even with us
 

1895
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,120
interesting thought that even with us
humans the suffering is in the software

we right now don't know how to repair
 

1899
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,760
we right now don't know how to repair
the hardware yeah but we're learning

1900
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:19,770
the hardware yeah but we're learning
 

1901
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,069
the hardware yeah but we're learning
we're getting better at it and better

we're getting better at it and better
 

1903
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,800
we're getting better at it and better
and the idea I mean a lot of some people

1904
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:24,810
and the idea I mean a lot of some people
 

1905
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,599
and the idea I mean a lot of some people
dream about one day being able to

transfer certain aspects of the software
 

1909
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,559
transfer certain aspects of the software
to another piece of hardware what do you

1910
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:33,569
to another piece of hardware what do you
 

1911
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,380
to another piece of hardware what do you
think just on that topic there's been a

1912
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:36,390
think just on that topic there's been a
 

1913
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:39,890
think just on that topic there's been a
lot of exciting innovation in brain

interesting to you as the expansion of
the human mind yes that's very

the human mind yes that's very
 

1943
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,609

1947
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,200
I'd love to be able to have that
increased bandwidth and I you know if I

1948
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,210
increased bandwidth and I you know if I
 

1949
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,089
increased bandwidth and I you know if I
want better access to my memory I have

want better access to my memory I have
 

1951
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,380
want better access to my memory I have
to say to is yet older you know you I

1952
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,390
to say to is yet older you know you I
 

1953
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:28,490
to say to is yet older you know you I
talked to my wife about things that we

1954
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:28,500
talked to my wife about things that we
 

1955
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,680
talked to my wife about things that we
did 20 years ago or something her memory

1956
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:30,690
did 20 years ago or something her memory
 

1957

is often better about particular events

1958

is often better about particular events
 

1959
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:35,359
is often better about particular events
where were we who was at that event what

1960
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:35,369
where were we who was at that event what
 

1961
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:37,220
where were we who was at that event what
did he or she where even she may know

1962
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:37,230
did he or she where even she may know
 

1963
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,809
did he or she where even she may know
and I have not the faintest idea about

1964
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:38,819
and I have not the faintest idea about
 

1965
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:40,490
and I have not the faintest idea about
this but perhaps it's somewhere in my

1966
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:40,500
this but perhaps it's somewhere in my
 

1967
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,200
this but perhaps it's somewhere in my
memory and if I had at this extended

1968
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,210
memory and if I had at this extended
 

1969
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,880
memory and if I had at this extended
memory I could I could search that

1970
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:43,890
memory I could I could search that
 

1971
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,609
memory I could I could search that
particular year and rerun those things I

1972
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:46,619
particular year and rerun those things I
 

1973
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:50,089
particular year and rerun those things I
think that would be great in some sense

1974
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:50,099
think that would be great in some sense
 

1975
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:51,890
think that would be great in some sense
we already have that by storing so much

for that because you know people people

1982
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:57,810
for that because you know people people

email me as if they know me well yeah I
 

1985
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,670
email me as if they know me well yeah I
haven't got a clue who they are but then

1986
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:01,680
haven't got a clue who they are but then
 

1987
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,470
haven't got a clue who they are but then
I search for their name email me in 2007

1988
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:05,480
I search for their name email me in 2007
 

1989
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,690
I search for their name email me in 2007
and I know who they are now yeah so we

1990
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:07,700
and I know who they are now yeah so we
 

1991
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,700
and I know who they are now yeah so we
already do it taking the first steps

00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:27,260
values or ethics do you think sort of
 

2005
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,030
values or ethics do you think sort of
high level how do we go about building

2006
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:30,040
high level how do we go about building
 

2007
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,410
high level how do we go about building
systems do you think is it possible that

2008
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:32,420
systems do you think is it possible that
 

2009
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,230
systems do you think is it possible that
align with our values align with our

presumably it's it's possible to do that
 

2015
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,120
presumably it's it's possible to do that
I know that lot of people who think that

2016
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:46,130
I know that lot of people who think that
 

2017
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,069
I know that lot of people who think that
there's a real danger that we won't that

2018
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
there's a real danger that we won't that
 

2019
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,690
there's a real danger that we won't that

2025
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:59,500
yourself personally I'm not quite sure
what to think I talk to philosophers

2026
00:45:59,500 --> 00:45:59,510
what to think I talk to philosophers
 

2027
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,170
what to think I talk to philosophers
like Nick Bostrom and Toby Ord and they

2028
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:02,180
like Nick Bostrom and Toby Ord and they
 

2029
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,230
like Nick Bostrom and Toby Ord and they
think that this is a real problem where

2030
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:05,240
think that this is a real problem where
 

2031
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,900
think that this is a real problem where
you need to worry about then I talk to

2032
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:07,910
you need to worry about then I talk to
 

2033
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,289
you need to worry about then I talk to
people who work for Microsoft or

2034
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:11,299
people who work for Microsoft or
 

2035
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:14,260
people who work for Microsoft or
deepmind or somebody and I say no we're

2036
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:14,270
deepmind or somebody and I say no we're
 

2037
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,980
deepmind or somebody and I say no we're
not really that close to producing a gr

2038
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:17,990
not really that close to producing a gr
 

2039
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,930
not really that close to producing a gr
you know super intelligence so if you

2040
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:19,940
you know super intelligence so if you
 

2041
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,099
you know super intelligence so if you
look at Nick Bostrom's of the arguments

2042
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:23,109
look at Nick Bostrom's of the arguments
 

2043
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:25,660
look at Nick Bostrom's of the arguments
it's very hard to defend some of course

2044
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:25,670
it's very hard to defend some of course
 

2045
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:28,359
it's very hard to defend some of course
and I myself engineer I a system so I'm

2046
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:28,369
and I myself engineer I a system so I'm
 

2047
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,490
and I myself engineer I a system so I'm
more with the deep mind folks were it

2048
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:30,500
more with the deep mind folks were it
 

2049
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,440
more with the deep mind folks were it
seems that we're really far away but

2050
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:32,450
seems that we're really far away but
 

2051
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,170
seems that we're really far away but
then the counter-argument is is there

2052
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:35,180
then the counter-argument is is there
 

2053
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,210
then the counter-argument is is there
any fundamental reasonable that we'll

2054
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:37,220
any fundamental reasonable that we'll
 

2055
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,000
any fundamental reasonable that we'll
never achieve it and if not and

2056
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,010
never achieve it and if not and
 

2057
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,549
never achieve it and if not and
eventually there will be a dire

2058
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:42,559
eventually there will be a dire
 

2059
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:44,920
eventually there will be a dire
existential risk so we should be

2060
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:44,930
existential risk so we should be
 

2061
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,849
existential risk so we should be
concerned about it and do you have give

2062
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:47,859
concerned about it and do you have give
 

2063
00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:50,829
concerned about it and do you have give
define that argument at all appealing in

00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:52,299

eventually this will be a problem so we

2068
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,170
eventually this will be a problem so we
 

2069
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:57,339
eventually this will be a problem so we
should be worried about it yes I think

2070
00:46:57,339 --> 00:46:57,349
should be worried about it yes I think
 

2071
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:00,880
should be worried about it yes I think
it's a problem I think there's that's a

2072
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:00,890
it's a problem I think there's that's a
 

2073
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,990
it's a problem I think there's that's a
valid point of course when you say

2074
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,000
valid point of course when you say
 

2075
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,599
valid point of course when you say
eventually that raises the question how

2076
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:10,609
eventually that raises the question how
 

2077
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:12,099
eventually that raises the question how
far off is that and is there something

2078
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:12,109
far off is that and is there something
 

2079
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:14,200
far off is that and is there something
that we can do about it now because if

2080
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:14,210
that we can do about it now because if
 

2081
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:16,030
that we can do about it now because if
we're talking about this is going to be

2082
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:16,040
we're talking about this is going to be
 

2083
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,710
we're talking about this is going to be
a hundred years in the future

2084
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:17,720
a hundred years in the future
 

2085
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,180
a hundred years in the future
and you consider how rapid

2086
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:19,190
and you consider how rapid
 

2087
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:21,190

our knowledge of artificial intelligence
 

2089
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,010
our knowledge of artificial intelligence
has grown in the last 10 or 20 years it

2090
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:24,020
has grown in the last 10 or 20 years it
 

2091
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,589
has grown in the last 10 or 20 years it
seems unlikely that there's anything

2092
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:26,599
seems unlikely that there's anything
 

2093
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:28,780
seems unlikely that there's anything
much we could do now that would

2094
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:28,790
much we could do now that would
 

2095
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,640
much we could do now that would
influence whether this is going to

2096
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:30,650
influence whether this is going to
 

2097
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,280
influence whether this is going to
happen a hundred years in the future you

2098
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:33,290
happen a hundred years in the future you
 

2099
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,930
happen a hundred years in the future you
know people in 80 years in the future

2100

know people in 80 years in the future
 

2101
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,609
know people in 80 years in the future
would be in a much better position to

2102
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:36,619
would be in a much better position to
 

2103
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:38,470
would be in a much better position to
say this is what we need to do to

2104
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
say this is what we need to do to
 

2105
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,690
say this is what we need to do to
prevent this happening then than we are

2106
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:40,700
prevent this happening then than we are
 

2107
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,170
prevent this happening then than we are

now
 

2109
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,900
now
so to some extent I find that reassuring

2110
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:43,910
so to some extent I find that reassuring
 

2111
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:47,650
so to some extent I find that reassuring

but I'm all in favor of some people

doing research into this to see if
 

2115
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,690
doing research into this to see if
indeed it is that far off or if we are

that extinction is a terrible thing and
 

2123
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,089
that extinction is a terrible thing and
therefore even if the risk of extinction

2124
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:04,099
therefore even if the risk of extinction
 

2125
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:08,290
therefore even if the risk of extinction
is very small if we can reduce that risk

2126
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:08,300
is very small if we can reduce that risk
 

2127
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,349
is very small if we can reduce that risk
that's something that we ought to do my

extinction risks is only about how much

priority is difficult to do that if we
don't know the time scale and you can

don't know the time scale and you can

00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:40,940
is that the loss of future lives that is
 

2199
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,329
is that the loss of future lives that is
of merely possible lives of beings who

2200
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:43,339
of merely possible lives of beings who
 

2201
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:47,319
of merely possible lives of beings who
may never exist at all is in some way

2202
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:47,329
may never exist at all is in some way
 

2203
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:51,069
may never exist at all is in some way
comparable to the sufferings or deaths

2204
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:51,079
comparable to the sufferings or deaths
 

2205
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:53,370
comparable to the sufferings or deaths
of people who who do exist at some point

2206
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:53,380
of people who who do exist at some point
 

2207
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,520
of people who who do exist at some point
and that's not clear to me I think

2208
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:57,530
and that's not clear to me I think
 

2209
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,470
and that's not clear to me I think
there's a case for saying that but I

2210
00:49:59,470 --> 00:49:59,480
there's a case for saying that but I
 

2211
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,849
there's a case for saying that but I
also think there's a case for taking the

2212
00:50:00,849 --> 00:50:00,859
also think there's a case for taking the
 

2213
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:04,420
also think there's a case for taking the
other view so that has some impact on it

2214
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:04,430
other view so that has some impact on it
 

2215
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,160
other view so that has some impact on it
of course you might say ah yes but still

2216
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:06,170
of course you might say ah yes but still
 

2217
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,290
of course you might say ah yes but still
if there's some uncertainty about this

2218
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:08,300
if there's some uncertainty about this
 

2219
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,859
if there's some uncertainty about this
and the the costs of extinction are

2220
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:11,869
and the the costs of extinction are
 

2221
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:13,960
and the the costs of extinction are
infinite then still it's gonna overwhelm

2222
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:13,970
infinite then still it's gonna overwhelm
 

2223
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:18,069
infinite then still it's gonna overwhelm
and everything else but I suppose I I'm

2224
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:18,079
and everything else but I suppose I I'm
 

2225
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,430
and everything else but I suppose I I'm
not convinced of that I'm not convinced

2226
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:21,440
not convinced of that I'm not convinced
 

2227
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,670
not convinced of that I'm not convinced
that it's really infinite here and even

2228
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:23,680
that it's really infinite here and even
 

2229

infinite number of lives live is he and
 

2235
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:33,280
infinite number of lives live is he and
what is a 10 to the 56th or something

2236
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:33,290
what is a 10 to the 56th or something
 

2237
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,410
what is a 10 to the 56th or something
it's a vast number that I think he

2238
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:35,420
it's a vast number that I think he
 

2239
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,970
it's a vast number that I think he
calculates this is assuming we can

2240
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:36,980
calculates this is assuming we can

00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,400
energy efficient but he calculates the
 

2249
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,680
energy efficient but he calculates the
amount of energy in the universe or

amount of energy in the universe or
 

2251
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,420

something like that so then I was a vast

something like that so then I was a vast

wrong but in simple case let's assume we

then the right action is the action that

then the right action is the action that
will produce the best consequences is

will produce the best consequences is

2317
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,960
but is that an easy calculation no it's
a difficult calculation and actually

a difficult calculation and actually
 

2319
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,120
a difficult calculation and actually
there's one thing that I need to add and

there's one thing that I need to add and
 

2321
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:13,840
there's one thing that I need to add and
that is utilitarians certainly the

that is utilitarians certainly the

00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,820
that is utilitarians certainly the

00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,870

happiness and the absence of pain and
 

2329
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,370
happiness and the absence of pain and
suffering there are other

2330
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:21,380
suffering there are other
 

2331
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,400
suffering there are other

consequences too and that makes the

2342
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:36,560
consequences too and that makes the
 

2343
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,080
consequences too and that makes the
calculations even more difficult because

2344
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,090
calculations even more difficult because
 

2345
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,190
calculations even more difficult because
then you need to know how to balance

2346
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
then you need to know how to balance
 

2347
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,920
then you need to know how to balance
these things off if you are just talking

about well-being using that term to

00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,050
about well-being using that term to
express happiness and the absence of

00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:47,060
express happiness and the absence of
 

2353
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:51,370
express happiness and the absence of

00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:51,380
suffering I think that the calculation
 

2355
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,510
suffering I think that the calculation
becomes more manageable in a

2356
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:54,520
becomes more manageable in a

practice we don't know how to do it we

2360
00:52:59,320 --> 00:52:59,330
practice we don't know how to do it we
 

2361
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:01,090
practice we don't know how to do it we
don't know how to measure quantities of

00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:01,100
don't know how to measure quantities of
 

2363
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,340
don't know how to measure quantities of
happiness and misery we don't know how

2364
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:03,350
happiness and misery we don't know how
 

2365
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,020
happiness and misery we don't know how
to calculate the probabilities that

2366
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,030
to calculate the probabilities that
 

2367
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,210
to calculate the probabilities that
different actions will produce this or

different actions will produce this or
 

2369
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,350
different actions will produce this or
that so at best we can use it as a as a

that so at best we can use it as a as a

ethical maybe poetic suffering of very

00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,970

that that gets overwritten by benefits

2400
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:57,980
that that gets overwritten by benefits

that that gets overwritten by benefits
to very large numbers of India

2402
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:00,089
to very large numbers of India
 

2403
00:54:00,089 --> 00:54:02,079
to very large numbers of India
I think that can can be the right answer

2404
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:02,089
I think that can can be the right answer
 

2405
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:04,999
I think that can can be the right answer
but before we conclude that is the right

2406
00:54:04,999 --> 00:54:05,009
but before we conclude that is the right
 

2407
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,059
but before we conclude that is the right
us that we have to know how severe the

2408
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:08,069
us that we have to know how severe the
 

2409
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:10,039
us that we have to know how severe the
suffering is and how that compares with

2410
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:10,049
suffering is and how that compares with
 

2411
00:54:10,049 --> 00:54:14,589
suffering is and how that compares with
the benefits so I I tend to think that

2412
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:14,599
the benefits so I I tend to think that
 

2413
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:19,880
the benefits so I I tend to think that
extreme suffering is worse than always

2414
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:19,890
extreme suffering is worse than always
 

2415
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,819
extreme suffering is worse than always
further if you like below the neutral

2416
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:22,829
further if you like below the neutral
 

2417
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:26,150
further if you like below the neutral
level then extreme happiness or bliss is

2418
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
level then extreme happiness or bliss is
 

2419
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,239
level then extreme happiness or bliss is
above it so when I think about the worst

2420
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:29,249
above it so when I think about the worst
 

2421
00:54:29,249 --> 00:54:31,160

2423

2425
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:36,529

them as equidistant from neutral so like

2426
00:54:36,529 --> 00:54:36,539
them as equidistant from neutral so like
 

2427
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,390

00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,239
it's a scale that goes from minus 100

not exchange an hour of my most

not exchange an hour of my most

00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,420
not exchange an hour of my most

pleasurable experiences for an hour of
 

2437
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,910
pleasurable experiences for an hour of
my most painful experiences even I

2438
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:52,920
my most painful experiences even I
 

2439
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,009
my most painful experiences even I
wouldn't have an hour of my most painful

2440
00:54:55,009 --> 00:54:55,019
wouldn't have an hour of my most painful
 

2441
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:57,710
wouldn't have an hour of my most painful
experiences even for two hours or ten

00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:57,720
experiences even for two hours or ten
 

2443
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,849

hours of my most painful experiences did

2444
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:01,859
hours of my most painful experiences did
 

2445
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:04,370
hours of my most painful experiences did
I say that correctly yeah maybe 20 hours

2446
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:04,380
I say that correctly yeah maybe 20 hours
 

2447
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,380
I say that correctly yeah maybe 20 hours
then yeah well one what's the exchange

2448
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:06,390
then yeah well one what's the exchange
 

2449
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,210
then yeah well one what's the exchange
rate oh that's the question what is the

2450
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:08,220
rate oh that's the question what is the
 

2451
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,920
rate oh that's the question what is the
exchange rate but I think it's it can be

2452
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:09,930
exchange rate but I think it's it can be
 

2453
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,589
exchange rate but I think it's it can be
quite high so that's why you shouldn't

2454
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:12,599
quite high so that's why you shouldn't
 

2455
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:16,039
quite high so that's why you shouldn't
just assume that you know it's okay to

2456
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:16,049
just assume that you know it's okay to
 

2457
00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:18,559
just assume that you know it's okay to
make one person suffer extremely in

2458
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:18,569
make one person suffer extremely in
 

2459
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:21,200
make one person suffer extremely in
order to make two people much better off

2460
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:21,210
order to make two people much better off
 

2461
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,989
order to make two people much better off
it might be a much larger number but at

2462
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:23,999
it might be a much larger number but at
 

2463
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:26,569
it might be a much larger number but at
some point I do think you should

2464
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:26,579
some point I do think you should
 

2465
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:29,989
some point I do think you should
aggregate and and the result will be

2466
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:29,999
aggregate and and the result will be
 

2467
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:32,569
aggregate and and the result will be
even though it violates our intuitions

are worse off at some point I still

here's a tax rate at which well-being

here's a tax rate at which well-being
 

2511
00:56:26,669 --> 00:56:28,880
here's a tax rate at which well-being
will be optimized and yeah that would be

00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:28,890
will be optimized and yeah that would be
 

2513
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,979
will be optimized and yeah that would be
great if we could if we really knew that

great if we could if we really knew that

nobody do you think it's possible to

is just a hopeless pursuit I don't think

is just a hopeless pursuit I don't think
it's hopeless I think it's difficult be

00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,499
gains that those who are sort of medium
badly off could be making so we still

2546
00:57:06,499 --> 00:57:06,509
badly off could be making so we still
 

2547
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:08,599
badly off could be making so we still
have all of these intuitions that we we

argue about so I don't think we would
get agreement but the fact that we

get agreement but the fact that we
 

2553
00:57:12,449 --> 00:57:15,019
get agreement but the fact that we
wouldn't get agreement doesn't show that

there isn't a right answer there do you
think who gets to say what is right and

your income tax scales reflect the idea
that the more income you have the more

2822
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:16,530
that the more income you have the more
 

2823
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,830
that the more income you have the more
you can pay tax and I think the same is

01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:18,840
you can pay tax and I think the same is
 

2825
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,550
you can pay tax and I think the same is
true in what you can give so I I do set

01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:22,560
true in what you can give so I I do set
 

2827
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,580
true in what you can give so I I do set
out a progressive donor scale which

out a progressive donor scale which
starts out at 1% for people on modest

01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:38,820
don't think any of these amounts really

don't think any of these amounts really

something significant to play their part
in reducing the huge gap between people
