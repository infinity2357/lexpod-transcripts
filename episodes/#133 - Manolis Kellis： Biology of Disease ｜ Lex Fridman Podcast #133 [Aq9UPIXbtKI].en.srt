the old way of doing basic biology you
 

271
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,270
the old way of doing basic biology you
would start with the animal models the

would start with the animal models the
 

273
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,710
would start with the animal models the
eukaryotic models

eukaryotic models
 

275
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,550
eukaryotic models
the mammalian models and then you would

276
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
the mammalian models and then you would
 

277
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,310
the mammalian models and then you would
go to human

278
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
go to human
 

279
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,950

systems
 

301
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,150
systems
so an engineer builds systems and then

302
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
so an engineer builds systems and then
 

303
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,670
so an engineer builds systems and then
they know how they work from the inside

304
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
they know how they work from the inside
 

305
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,150
they know how they work from the inside

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
you basically say if i poke that balloon
 

313
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,270
you basically say if i poke that balloon
what's going to happen and i'm going to

314
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
what's going to happen and i'm going to
 

315
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,629
what's going to happen and i'm going to
film it in super high resolution

316
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
film it in super high resolution
 

317
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,749
film it in super high resolution
understand i don't know

318
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
understand i don't know
 

319
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,350
understand i don't know
aerodynamics or fluid dynamics if it's

320
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
aerodynamics or fluid dynamics if it's
 

321
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,590
aerodynamics or fluid dynamics if it's
filled with water etc so you can then

322
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
filled with water etc so you can then
 

323
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,230
filled with water etc so you can then
make experimentation by perturbation and

324
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
make experimentation by perturbation and
 

325
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,070
make experimentation by perturbation and
then the scientific process is sort of

326
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
then the scientific process is sort of
 

327
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,110
then the scientific process is sort of
building models that

328
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
building models that
 

329
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,110
building models that
best fit the data designing new

330
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
best fit the data designing new
 

331
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,110
best fit the data designing new
experiments that best test your models

332
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
experiments that best test your models
 

333
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,110
experiments that best test your models
and challenge your models and so forth

334
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
and challenge your models and so forth
 

335
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,390
and challenge your models and so forth
that's the same thing with science

336
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
that's the same thing with science
 

337
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,670
that's the same thing with science
basically if you're trying to understand

338
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
basically if you're trying to understand
 

339
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,510
basically if you're trying to understand
biological science

340
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
biological science
 

341
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,430
biological science
you basically want to do perturbations

342
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
you basically want to do perturbations
 

343
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,670
you basically want to do perturbations
that then drive

344
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
that then drive
 

345
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,909
that then drive
the models so how do these perturbations

346
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
the models so how do these perturbations
 

347
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,189
the models so how do these perturbations
allow you to understand

348
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
allow you to understand
 

349
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,390
allow you to understand
disease so if if you know that

350
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
disease so if if you know that
 

351
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,469
disease so if if you know that
a gene is related to disease you don't

352
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
a gene is related to disease you don't
 

353
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,230
a gene is related to disease you don't
want to just know that it's related to

354
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
want to just know that it's related to
 

355
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,150
want to just know that it's related to
the disease you want to know what is the

356
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
the disease you want to know what is the
 

357
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,189
the disease you want to know what is the
disease mechanism

358
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
disease mechanism
 

359
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,309
disease mechanism
because you want to go and intervene so

360
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
because you want to go and intervene so
 

361
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,830
because you want to go and intervene so
the way that i like to describe it is

362
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
the way that i like to describe it is
 

363
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,309
the way that i like to describe it is
that traditionally

364
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:15,319
that traditionally
 

365
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,350
that traditionally
epidemiology which is basically the

366
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
epidemiology which is basically the
 

367
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,790
epidemiology which is basically the
study of disease

368
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
study of disease
 

369
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,629
study of disease
you know sort of the observational study

370
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
you know sort of the observational study
 

371
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,710
you know sort of the observational study
of disease has been

372
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
of disease has been
 

373
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,950
of disease has been
about correlating one thing with another

374
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
about correlating one thing with another
 

375
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,950
about correlating one thing with another
thing so if you if you have a lot of

376
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
thing so if you if you have a lot of
 

377
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,550
thing so if you if you have a lot of
people with liver disease who are also

378
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
people with liver disease who are also
 

379
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,510
people with liver disease who are also
alcoholics

380
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
alcoholics
 

381
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,749
alcoholics
you might say well maybe the alcoholism

382
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
you might say well maybe the alcoholism
 

383
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,510
you might say well maybe the alcoholism
is driving the liver disease

384
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
is driving the liver disease
 

385
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,950
is driving the liver disease
or maybe those who have liver disease

386
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
or maybe those who have liver disease
 

387
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,550
or maybe those who have liver disease
self-medicate with alcohol

388
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
self-medicate with alcohol
 

389
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,390
self-medicate with alcohol
so that the connection could be either

390
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
so that the connection could be either
 

391
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,830
so that the connection could be either
way

392
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
way
 

393
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,870
way
with genetic epidemiology it's about

394
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
with genetic epidemiology it's about
 

395
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,590
with genetic epidemiology it's about
correlating changes in the genome

396
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
correlating changes in the genome
 

397
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,150
correlating changes in the genome
with phenotypic differences and then you

398
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
with phenotypic differences and then you
 

399
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,909
with phenotypic differences and then you
know the direction of causality

400
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
know the direction of causality
 

401
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,629
know the direction of causality
so if you know that a particular gene is

402
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
so if you know that a particular gene is
 

403
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,350
so if you know that a particular gene is
related

404
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
related
 

405
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,629
related
to the disease you can basically say

406
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
to the disease you can basically say
 

407
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,990
to the disease you can basically say
okay perturbing that gene in mouse

408
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
okay perturbing that gene in mouse
 

409
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,670
okay perturbing that gene in mouse
causes the mice to have x phenotype

410
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
causes the mice to have x phenotype
 

411
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,469
causes the mice to have x phenotype
so perturbing that gene in human causes

412
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
so perturbing that gene in human causes
 

413
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,070
so perturbing that gene in human causes
the humans to have the disease

414
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
the humans to have the disease
 

415
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,830
the humans to have the disease
so i can now figure out what are the

416
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
so i can now figure out what are the
 

417
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,870
so i can now figure out what are the
detailed molecular phenotypes

418
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
detailed molecular phenotypes
 

419
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,510
detailed molecular phenotypes
in the human that are related to that

420
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
in the human that are related to that
 

421
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,550
in the human that are related to that
organismal

422
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
organismal
 

423
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,029
organismal
phenotype in the disease so it's all

424
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
phenotype in the disease so it's all
 

425
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,070
phenotype in the disease so it's all
about understanding

426
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
about understanding
 

427
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,909
about understanding
disease mechanism understanding what are

428
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
disease mechanism understanding what are
 

429
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,309
disease mechanism understanding what are
the pathways what are the tissues

430
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
the pathways what are the tissues
 

431
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,309
the pathways what are the tissues
what are the processes that are

432
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
what are the processes that are
 

433
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,589
what are the processes that are
associated with the disease so that we

434
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
associated with the disease so that we
 

435
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,790
associated with the disease so that we
know how to intervene

436
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
know how to intervene
 

437
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,230
know how to intervene
you can then prescribe particular

438
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
you can then prescribe particular
 

439
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,390
you can then prescribe particular
medications that also alter these

440
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
medications that also alter these
 

441
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,110
medications that also alter these
processes

442
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
processes
 

443
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,430
processes
you can prescribe lifestyle changes that

444
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
you can prescribe lifestyle changes that
 

445
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,029
you can prescribe lifestyle changes that
also affect these processes

446
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
also affect these processes
 

447
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,029
also affect these processes
and so forth that's such a beautiful

448
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
and so forth that's such a beautiful
 

449
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,870
and so forth that's such a beautiful
puzzle to try to solve

450
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
puzzle to try to solve
 

451
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,309
puzzle to try to solve
like what kind of perturbations

452
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
like what kind of perturbations
 

453
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,070
like what kind of perturbations
eventually have this ripple effect that

454
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
eventually have this ripple effect that
 

455
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,510
eventually have this ripple effect that
leads to disease

456
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
leads to disease
 

457
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,589
leads to disease
across the population and then you study

458
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
across the population and then you study
 

459
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,790
across the population and then you study
that for animals

460
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
that for animals
 

461
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,430
that for animals
a mice first and then see how that might

462
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
a mice first and then see how that might
 

463
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,270
a mice first and then see how that might
possibly connect to

464
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
possibly connect to
 

465
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,869
possibly connect to
humans how hard is that puzzle of

466
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
humans how hard is that puzzle of
 

467
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,990
humans how hard is that puzzle of
trying to figure out how little

468
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
trying to figure out how little
 

469
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,230
trying to figure out how little
perturbations might lead

470
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
perturbations might lead
 

471
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,909
perturbations might lead
to in a stable way to a disease

472
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
to in a stable way to a disease
 

473
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,270
to in a stable way to a disease
in animals we make the puzzle

474
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
in animals we make the puzzle
 

475
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,070
in animals we make the puzzle
simpler because we perturb one gene at a

476
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
simpler because we perturb one gene at a
 

477
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,790
simpler because we perturb one gene at a
time

478
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
time
 

479
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,390
time
that's the beauty of it's the power of

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
that's the beauty of it's the power of
 

481
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,869
that's the beauty of it's the power of
animal models you can basically decouple

482
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
animal models you can basically decouple
 

483
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,790
animal models you can basically decouple
the perturbations you only do one

484
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
the perturbations you only do one
 

485
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,110
the perturbations you only do one
perturbation and you only do strong

486
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
perturbation and you only do strong
 

487
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,029
perturbation and you only do strong
perturbations at a time

488
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
perturbations at a time
 

489
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,830
perturbations at a time
in human the puzzle is incredibly

490
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
in human the puzzle is incredibly
 

491
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,110
in human the puzzle is incredibly
complex

492
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
complex
 

493
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,029
complex
because i mean obviously you don't do

494
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
because i mean obviously you don't do
 

495
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,390
because i mean obviously you don't do
human experimentation

496
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
human experimentation
 

497
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,950
human experimentation
you wait for natural selection and

498
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
you wait for natural selection and
 

499
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,029
you wait for natural selection and
natural genetic variation

500
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
natural genetic variation
 

501
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,709

across
 

513
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,190
across
you know the the history leading to the

514
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
you know the the history leading to the
 

515
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,110
you know the the history leading to the
human population

516
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
human population
 

517
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,110
human population
so you basically take this natural

518
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
so you basically take this natural
 

519
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,550
so you basically take this natural
genetic variation

520
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560

521
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,710

527
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,310
six million perturbations so i've done

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
between us the reason why two twins are
 

571
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,630
between us the reason why two twins are
identical is because

572
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
identical is because
 

573
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,030
identical is because

how happy are you with this kind of data

580
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
how happy are you with this kind of data
 

581
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,750
how happy are you with this kind of data
set is it uh

582
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
set is it uh
 

583
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,949

large enough of the human population of

584
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
large enough of the human population of
 

585
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,230
large enough of the human population of
earth is that too big

earth is that too big
 

587
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,829
earth is that too big
too small yeah so so the the is it is it

is a power analysis question and in
 

593
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,710
is a power analysis question and in
every one of our grants we do a power

594
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
every one of our grants we do a power
 

595
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,350
every one of our grants we do a power

analysis
 

597
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,590

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
would like to detect
 

601
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,190
would like to detect
and what is the natural variation

602
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
and what is the natural variation
 

603
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,509
and what is the natural variation
in the two forms so every time you do a

604
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
in the two forms so every time you do a
 

605
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,949
in the two forms so every time you do a
perturbation you're asking i'm changing

606
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
perturbation you're asking i'm changing

form a into for
b form a has some natural genetic vary

610
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
b form a has some natural genetic vary
 

611
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,870
b form a has some natural genetic vary
some natural phenotypic variation around

some natural phenotypic variation around
 

613
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,269
some natural phenotypic variation around
it

614
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
it
 

615
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,670
it
and form b has some natural phenotypic

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
and form b has some natural phenotypic
 

617
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,030
and form b has some natural phenotypic
variation around it

618
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
variation around it
 

619
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,269
variation around it
if those variances are large and the

620
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
if those variances are large and the
 

621
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,790
if those variances are large and the
differences between the mean of a and

622
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
differences between the mean of a and
 

623
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,990
differences between the mean of a and
the mean of b

624
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
the mean of b
 

625
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,829
the mean of b
are small then you have very little

626
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
are small then you have very little
 

627
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,949
are small then you have very little
power the further the means go apart

628
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
power the further the means go apart
 

629
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,590
power the further the means go apart
that's the effect size the more power

630
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
that's the effect size the more power
 

631
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,310
that's the effect size the more power
you have

632
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
you have
 

633
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,110
you have
and the smaller the standard deviation

634
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
and the smaller the standard deviation
 

635
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,550
and the smaller the standard deviation
the more power you have

636
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
the more power you have
 

637
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,110
the more power you have
so basically when you're asking is that

638
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
so basically when you're asking is that
 

639
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,470
so basically when you're asking is that
sufficiently large

640
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
sufficiently large
 

641
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,470
sufficiently large
certainly not for everything but we

642
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
certainly not for everything but we
 

643
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,069
certainly not for everything but we
already have enough power

644
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
already have enough power
 

645
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,110
already have enough power
for many of the stronger effects

646
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
for many of the stronger effects
 

647
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,670
for many of the stronger effects
in the more tight distributions so

648
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
in the more tight distributions so
 

649
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,350
in the more tight distributions so
that's a hopeful message that

650
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
that's a hopeful message that
 

651
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,190
that's a hopeful message that
there exists parts of the genome

652
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
there exists parts of the genome
 

653
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,150
there exists parts of the genome
that that have a strong effect that has

654
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
that that have a strong effect that has
 

655
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,829
that that have a strong effect that has
a small

656
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
a small
 

657
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,069
a small
variance that's exactly right

658
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
variance that's exactly right
 

659
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:14,949
variance that's exactly right
unfortunately

660
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
unfortunately
 

661
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,790
unfortunately
those perturbations are the basis of

662
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
those perturbations are the basis of
 

663
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,470
those perturbations are the basis of
disease in many cases

664
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
disease in many cases
 

665
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,389
disease in many cases
so it's not a you know hopeful message

666
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
so it's not a you know hopeful message
 

667
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,470
so it's not a you know hopeful message
sometimes it's a terrible message

668
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
sometimes it's a terrible message
 

669
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,630
sometimes it's a terrible message
it's basically well some people are sick

670
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
it's basically well some people are sick
 

671
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,670
it's basically well some people are sick
but if when

672
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
but if when
 

673
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,269
but if when
if we can figure out what are these

674
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
if we can figure out what are these
 

675
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,870
if we can figure out what are these

we can then help make them better and

678
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
we can then help make them better and
 

679
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,310
we can then help make them better and
help many other people better

680
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
help many other people better
 

681
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,949
help many other people better
who don't carry that exact mutation but

682
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
who don't carry that exact mutation but
 

683
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,670
who don't carry that exact mutation but
who carry

684
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
who carry
 

685
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,710
who carry
mutations on the same pathways

mutations on the same pathways
 

687
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,310
mutations on the same pathways
and that's what we like to call the

688
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
and that's what we like to call the
 

689
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,550
and that's what we like to call the
allelic series of a gene

690
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
allelic series of a gene
 

691
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,069
allelic series of a gene
you basically have many perturbations

00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
you basically have many perturbations
 

693
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,030
you basically have many perturbations
of the same gene in different people

694
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
of the same gene in different people
 

695
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,389

each with a different
 

697
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,470

frequency in the human population and

698
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
frequency in the human population and
 

699
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,389
frequency in the human population and
each with a different effect

700
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
each with a different effect
 

701
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,269
each with a different effect
on the individual charism so you said uh

702
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
on the individual charism so you said uh
 

703
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,470
on the individual charism so you said uh
in the past

704
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
in the past
 

705
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,629

00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
there would be these small experiments
 

707
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,750
there would be these small experiments
on perturbations and animal models

708
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
on perturbations and animal models
 

709
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,790
on perturbations and animal models
what does this puzzle solving process

so we basically have you know something

714
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
so we basically have you know something
 

715
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,389
so we basically have you know something
like seven billion people in the planet

716
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
like seven billion people in the planet
 

717
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,829
like seven billion people in the planet
and every one of them carries something

718
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
and every one of them carries something
 

719
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,550
and every one of them carries something
like six million mutations

720
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
like six million mutations
 

721
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,590
like six million mutations
you basically have an enormous matrix

722
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
you basically have an enormous matrix
 

723
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,870
you basically have an enormous matrix
of genotype by phenotype

724
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
of genotype by phenotype
 

725
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,110
of genotype by phenotype
by systematically measuring the

726
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
by systematically measuring the
 

727
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,910
by systematically measuring the
phenotype

728
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
phenotype
 

729
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,710
phenotype
of these individuals and the traditional

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
of these individuals and the traditional
 

731
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,389
of these individuals and the traditional
way of measuring this phenotype

732
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
way of measuring this phenotype
 

733
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,509
way of measuring this phenotype
has been to look at one trait at a time

734
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
has been to look at one trait at a time
 

735
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,829
has been to look at one trait at a time
you would gather families and you would

736
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
you would gather families and you would
 

737
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,110
you would gather families and you would
sort of paint

738
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
sort of paint
 

739
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,230
sort of paint
the pedigrees of a strong effect what we

740
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
the pedigrees of a strong effect what we
 

741
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,870
the pedigrees of a strong effect what we
like to call

742
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
like to call
 

743
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,230
like to call
mendelian mutation so a mutation that

744
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
mendelian mutation so a mutation that
 

745
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,670
mendelian mutation so a mutation that
gets transmitted in a dominant or a

746
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
gets transmitted in a dominant or a
 

747
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,550
gets transmitted in a dominant or a
recessive

748
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
recessive
 

749
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,629
recessive
but strong effect form where basically

750
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
but strong effect form where basically
 

751
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,670
but strong effect form where basically
one locus

752
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
one locus
 

753
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,310
one locus
plays a very big role in that disease

754
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
plays a very big role in that disease
 

755
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,509
plays a very big role in that disease
and you could then look at carriers

756
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
and you could then look at carriers
 

757
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,790
and you could then look at carriers
versus non-carriers

758
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
versus non-carriers
 

759
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,509
versus non-carriers
in one family carries versus

760
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
in one family carries versus
 

761
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,949
in one family carries versus
non-carriers in another family

762
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
non-carriers in another family
 

763
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,949
non-carriers in another family
and do that for hundreds sometimes

764
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
and do that for hundreds sometimes
 

765
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,310
and do that for hundreds sometimes
thousands of families

766
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
thousands of families
 

767
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,750
thousands of families
and then trace these inheritance

768
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
and then trace these inheritance
 

769
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,750
and then trace these inheritance
patterns and then figure out what is the

770
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
patterns and then figure out what is the
 

771
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,150
patterns and then figure out what is the
gene

772
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
gene
 

773
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,230
gene
that plays that role is this the matrix

774
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
that plays that role is this the matrix
 

775
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,269
that plays that role is this the matrix
that you're showing

776
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
that you're showing
 

777
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,310
that you're showing
in in talks or lectures

778
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
in in talks or lectures
 

779
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,829
in in talks or lectures
so that matrix is the

780
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
so that matrix is the
 

781
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,790
so that matrix is the
input to the stuff that i saw in talks

782
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
input to the stuff that i saw in talks
 

783
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,150
input to the stuff that i saw in talks
so basically that matrix has

784
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
so basically that matrix has
 

785
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,710
so basically that matrix has
traditionally been strong effect genes

786
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
traditionally been strong effect genes
 

787
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,870
traditionally been strong effect genes
what the matrix looks like now is

788
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
what the matrix looks like now is
 

789
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,350
what the matrix looks like now is
instead of pedigrees instead of families

instead of pedigrees instead of families
 

791
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,750
instead of pedigrees instead of families
you basically have thousands and

792
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
you basically have thousands and
 

793
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,470
you basically have thousands and

so all of these things are basically um

1064
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
so all of these things are basically um
 

1065
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,909
so all of these things are basically um

across millions of cells and then now
 

1077
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,390

you have

1078
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400
you have
 

1079
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,549

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
okay maybe i'm romanticizing it but
 

1093
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,310
okay maybe i'm romanticizing it but
cognition seems to be very complicated

cognition seems to be very complicated
 

1095
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,830
cognition seems to be very complicated
so uh separating into the function

1102
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
challenging
 

1103
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,950
challenging
is that basically you're trying to find

00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
is that basically you're trying to find
 

1105
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,190
is that basically you're trying to find
a way that

1106

a way that
 

1107
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,390
a way that
some perturbation and genome

some perturbation and genome
 

1109
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,590
some perturbation and genome
results in some obvious

1110
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
results in some obvious
 

1111
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,669

major dysfunction in the cell
 

1113
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,350
major dysfunction in the cell
you're trying to find something like

1114
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
you're trying to find something like
 

1115
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,590
you're trying to find something like
that exactly so so

1116
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
that exactly so so
 

1117
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,029
that exactly so so
what does human genetics do human

1118
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
what does human genetics do human
 

1119
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,630
what does human genetics do human
genetics basically looks at the whole

1120
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
genetics basically looks at the whole
 

1121
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,590
genetics basically looks at the whole
path

1122
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
path
 

1123
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,510
path
from genetic variation all the way to

1124
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
from genetic variation all the way to
 

1125
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,950
from genetic variation all the way to
disease

1126
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
disease
 

1127
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,669
disease
so human genetics has basically taken

1128
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
so human genetics has basically taken
 

1129
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,630
so human genetics has basically taken
thousands

1130
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
thousands
 

1131
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,990
thousands
of alzheimer's cases

1132
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
of alzheimer's cases
 

1133
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,310
of alzheimer's cases
and thousands of controls matched for

1134
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
and thousands of controls matched for
 

1135
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,190

backgrounds and so forth and then looked

1140
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
backgrounds and so forth and then looked
 

1141
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,150
backgrounds and so forth and then looked
at that map

1142
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
at that map
 

1143
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,630
at that map
where you're asking what are the

1144
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
where you're asking what are the
 

1145
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,470
where you're asking what are the
individual genetic persuasions

1146
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
individual genetic persuasions
 

1147
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,789
individual genetic persuasions
and how are they related to all the way

1148
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
and how are they related to all the way
 

1149
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,310
and how are they related to all the way
to alzheimer's disease

1150
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
to alzheimer's disease
 

1151
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,070
to alzheimer's disease
and that has actually been quite

1152
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
and that has actually been quite
 

1153
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,150
and that has actually been quite
successful so we now have

1154
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
successful so we now have
 

1155
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,630
successful so we now have
you know more than 27 different loci

1156
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
you know more than 27 different loci
 

1157
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,630
you know more than 27 different loci
these are genomic regions

1158
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
these are genomic regions
 

1159
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,669
these are genomic regions
that are associated with alzheimer's at

1160
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
that are associated with alzheimer's at
 

1161
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,310
that are associated with alzheimer's at
this

1162
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
this
 

1163
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,110
this
end-to-end level but the moment you sort

1164
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
end-to-end level but the moment you sort
 

1165
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,350

you can basically say from genetics what
 

1173
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,230
you can basically say from genetics what
are the epigenomic alterations

all the way to the end i mean it's just

all the way to the end i mean it's just
 

1215
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,470
all the way to the end i mean it's just
mind-boggling that that's even possible

00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
mind-boggling that that's even possible
 

1217
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,630
mind-boggling that that's even possible
but indeed yeah but indeed there are

00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
but indeed yeah but indeed there are
 

1219
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,590

such effects
 

1221
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,909
such effects
so the hope is or the most

00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
so the hope is or the most
 

1223
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,350

the alteration that results in disease
 

1229
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,909
the alteration that results in disease
is

1230
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
is
 

1231
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,149
is
earlier on in the pipeline as early as

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
possible it's
 

1235
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,750
possible it's
it's a trade-off if you go very early on

1236
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
it's a trade-off if you go very early on
 

1237

it's a trade-off if you go very early on

1238
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
in the pipeline
 

1239
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,510
in the pipeline
now each of these epigenomic alterations

1240
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
now each of these epigenomic alterations
 

1241
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,470
now each of these epigenomic alterations
for example this enhancer control region

1242
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
for example this enhancer control region
 

1243
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,830
for example this enhancer control region
is active maybe 50 less which is a

1244
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
is active maybe 50 less which is a
 

1245
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,350
is active maybe 50 less which is a
dramatic effect

1246
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,360
dramatic effect
 

1247
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,789
dramatic effect
now you can ask well how much does

1248
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
now you can ask well how much does
 

1249
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,470
now you can ask well how much does
changing one regulatory region in the

1250
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
changing one regulatory region in the
 

1251
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,270
changing one regulatory region in the
genome

1252
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
genome
 

1253
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,430
genome
in one cell type change disease well

1254
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
in one cell type change disease well
 

1255
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,750
in one cell type change disease well
that path is now long

1256
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
that path is now long
 

1257
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,510
that path is now long
so if you instead look at expression

1258
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
so if you instead look at expression
 

1259
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,190
so if you instead look at expression
the path between genetic variation the

1260
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
the path between genetic variation the
 

1261
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,190
the path between genetic variation the
expression of one gene goes through many

1262
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,200
expression of one gene goes through many
 

1263
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,549
expression of one gene goes through many
enhancer regions

1264
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
enhancer regions
 

1265
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,230
enhancer regions
and therefore it's a subtler effect at

1266
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
and therefore it's a subtler effect at
 

1267
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,230
and therefore it's a subtler effect at
the gene level but then now you're

1268
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240
the gene level but then now you're
 

1269
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,830
the gene level but then now you're
closer because

1270
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:47,840
closer because
 

1271
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,750
closer because
one gene is acting on you know in the

1272
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
one gene is acting on you know in the
 

1273
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,149
one gene is acting on you know in the
context of only 20 000 other genes

1274
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
context of only 20 000 other genes
 

1275
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,750
context of only 20 000 other genes
as opposed to one enhancer acting in the

1276
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
as opposed to one enhancer acting in the
 

1277
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,950
as opposed to one enhancer acting in the
context of two million other enhancers

1278
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
context of two million other enhancers
 

1279
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,909
context of two million other enhancers
so you basically now have genetic

1280
00:21:59,909 --> 00:21:59,919
so you basically now have genetic
 

1281
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,990
so you basically now have genetic
epigenomic the circuitry

1282
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
epigenomic the circuitry
 

1283
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,950
epigenomic the circuitry
transcriptomic the gene expression level

1284
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
transcriptomic the gene expression level
 

1285
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,750
transcriptomic the gene expression level
and then

1286
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
and then
 

1287
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,590
and then
cellular where you can basically say i

1288
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
cellular where you can basically say i
 

1289
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,909
cellular where you can basically say i
can measure various properties of those

1290
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
can measure various properties of those
 

1291
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:10,870
can measure various properties of those
cells

1292
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880
cells
 

1293
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,149
cells
what is the calcium influx

1294
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,159
what is the calcium influx
 

1295
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,270
what is the calcium influx
rate when i have this genetic variation

1296
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
rate when i have this genetic variation
 

1297
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,149
rate when i have this genetic variation
what is the synaptic density what is the

1298
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
what is the synaptic density what is the
 

1299
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,270
what is the synaptic density what is the
electric

1300
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
electric
 

1301
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,310
electric
impulse conductivity and so on so forth

1302
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
impulse conductivity and so on so forth
 

1303
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,230
impulse conductivity and so on so forth
so you can measure things along this

1304
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
so you can measure things along this
 

1305
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,430
so you can measure things along this
path to disease and you can also measure

1306
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
path to disease and you can also measure
 

1307
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,390
path to disease and you can also measure
endophenotypes you can basically measure

1308
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
endophenotypes you can basically measure
 

1309
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,830
endophenotypes you can basically measure
you know

1310
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
you know
 

1311
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,549
you know
your brain activity you can do imaging

00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
your brain activity you can do imaging
 

1313
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,430
your brain activity you can do imaging
in the brain

1314
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
in the brain
 

1315
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,110
in the brain
you can basically measure i don't know

1316
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
you can basically measure i don't know
 

1317
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,110
you can basically measure i don't know
the heart rate the pulse the lipids

1318
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
the heart rate the pulse the lipids
 

1319
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,830
the heart rate the pulse the lipids
the amount of blood secreted and so

1320
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
the amount of blood secreted and so
 

1321
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,470
the amount of blood secreted and so
forth

1322
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
forth
 

1323
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,870
forth
and then through all of that you can

1324
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
and then through all of that you can
 

1325
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,230
and then through all of that you can
basically get at

1326
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
basically get at
 

1327
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,830
basically get at
the path to causality the path to

and is there something beyond cellular

1332
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
and is there something beyond cellular
 

1333
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,149
and is there something beyond cellular
so you mentioned lifestyle

1334
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
so you mentioned lifestyle
 

1335
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,149
so you mentioned lifestyle
interventions or changes as a way to

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
like what what about organs what about
 

1343
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,110
like what what about organs what about
like

1344
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
like
 

1345
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,430
like
the function of the body as a whole yeah

1346
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
the function of the body as a whole yeah
 

1347
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,710
the function of the body as a whole yeah
absolutely so basically

1348
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
absolutely so basically
 

1349
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,549
absolutely so basically
when you go to your doctor they always

1350
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
when you go to your doctor they always
 

1351
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,470
when you go to your doctor they always
measure you know your pulse they always

1352
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
measure you know your pulse they always
 

1353
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,909
measure you know your pulse they always
measure your height those measure your

1354
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
measure your height those measure your
 

1355
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,310
measure your height those measure your
weight

1356
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320
weight
 

1357
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,750
weight
your you know your bmis basically these

1358
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
your you know your bmis basically these
 

1359
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,909
your you know your bmis basically these
are just very basic variables

1360
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919
are just very basic variables
 

1361
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,310
are just very basic variables
but with digital devices nowadays you

1362
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
but with digital devices nowadays you
 

1363
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,430
but with digital devices nowadays you
can start measuring hundreds of

1364
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
can start measuring hundreds of
 

1365
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,350
can start measuring hundreds of
variables for every individual

1366
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
variables for every individual
 

1367
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,990
variables for every individual
you can basically also phenotype

1368
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
you can basically also phenotype
 

1369
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,830
you can basically also phenotype
cognitively

1370
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:33,840
cognitively
 

1371
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,029
cognitively
through tests uh alzheimer's patients

1372
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:37,039
through tests uh alzheimer's patients
 

1373
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,470
through tests uh alzheimer's patients
there are cognitive tests that you can

1374
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
there are cognitive tests that you can
 

1375
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,870
there are cognitive tests that you can
imagine that you that you typically do

1376
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
imagine that you that you typically do
 

1377
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,669
imagine that you that you typically do
for uh cognitive decline these

1378
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
for uh cognitive decline these
 

1379
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,549
for uh cognitive decline these
minimental

1380
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:44,559
minimental
 

1381
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,789
minimental
you know observations that that you have

1382
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
you know observations that that you have
 

1383
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,310
you know observations that that you have
specific questions too

1384
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
specific questions too
 

1385
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,909
specific questions too
you can think of sort of enlarging the

1386
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
you can think of sort of enlarging the
 

1387
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,750
you can think of sort of enlarging the
set of cognitive tests

1388
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
set of cognitive tests
 

1389
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,190
set of cognitive tests
so in the mouse for example you do

1390
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
so in the mouse for example you do
 

1391
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,630
so in the mouse for example you do
experiments for how do they get out of

1392
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
experiments for how do they get out of
 

1393
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,590
experiments for how do they get out of
mazes

1394
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
mazes
 

1395
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,430
mazes
how do they find food whether they

1396
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,440
how do they find food whether they
 

1397
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,110
how do they find food whether they
recall a fear

1398
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
recall a fear
 

1399
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,190
recall a fear
whether they shake in a new environment

1400
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
whether they shake in a new environment
 

1401
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,230
whether they shake in a new environment
and so forth

1402
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
and so forth
 

1403
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,510
and so forth
in the human you can have much much

1404
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
in the human you can have much much
 

1405
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,110
in the human you can have much much
richer phenotypes where you can

1406
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
richer phenotypes where you can
 

1407
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,310
richer phenotypes where you can
basically say

1408
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
basically say
 

1409
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,430
basically say
not just imaging at the you know

1410
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
not just imaging at the you know
 

1411
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,149
not just imaging at the you know
organ level but and all kinds of other

1412
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
organ level but and all kinds of other
 

1413
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,590
organ level but and all kinds of other
activities at the organ level

1414
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
activities at the organ level
 

1415
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,710
activities at the organ level
but you can also do at the organism

1416
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
but you can also do at the organism
 

1417
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,350
but you can also do at the organism
level

1418
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
level
 

1419
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,669
level
you can do behavioral tests and how did

1420
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
you can do behavioral tests and how did
 

1421
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,870
you can do behavioral tests and how did
they do on empathy

1422
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
they do on empathy
 

1423
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,190
they do on empathy
how did they do on memory how did they

1424
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
how did they do on memory how did they
 

1425
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,909
how did they do on memory how did they
do on

1426
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
do on
 

1427
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,269
do on
long-term memory versus short-term

1428
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
long-term memory versus short-term
 

1429
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,190
long-term memory versus short-term
memory and so forth i love how you're

1430
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
memory and so forth i love how you're
 

1431
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,630
memory and so forth i love how you're
calling that phenotype

1432
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,640
calling that phenotype
 

1433
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,430
calling that phenotype
i guess it is it is but like your

1434
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
i guess it is it is but like your
 

1435
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:31,990
i guess it is it is but like your
behavior

1436
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
behavior
 

1437
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,630
behavior
patterns that might change over over uh

1438
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
patterns that might change over over uh
 

1439
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,470
patterns that might change over over uh
over a period of a life

1440
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,480
over a period of a life
 

1441
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,310
over a period of a life
it's yeah your ability to remember

1442
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
it's yeah your ability to remember
 

1443
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,070
it's yeah your ability to remember
things your ability to be

1444
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
things your ability to be
 

1445
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,789
things your ability to be
yeah empathetic or emotionally your

1446
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
yeah empathetic or emotionally your
 

1447
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,990
yeah empathetic or emotionally your
intelligence

1448
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
intelligence
 

1449
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,750
intelligence
perhaps even yeah but intelligence has

1450
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
perhaps even yeah but intelligence has
 

1451
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,029
perhaps even yeah but intelligence has
hundreds of variables

1452
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
hundreds of variables
 

1453
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,390
hundreds of variables
you can be your math intelligence your

1454
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
you can be your math intelligence your
 

1455
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,510
you can be your math intelligence your
literary intelligence your

1456
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
literary intelligence your
 

1457
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,190
literary intelligence your
puzzle-solving intelligence your logic

1458
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,200
puzzle-solving intelligence your logic
 

1459
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,710
puzzle-solving intelligence your logic
it could be like hundreds of things

1460
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
it could be like hundreds of things
 

1461
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,110
it could be like hundreds of things
and all of that is it's we were able to

1462
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
and all of that is it's we were able to
 

1463
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,470
and all of that is it's we were able to
measure that better and better so and

1464
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,480
measure that better and better so and
 

1465
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,750
measure that better and better so and
all that could be connected to the

1466
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
all that could be connected to the
 

1467
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,789
all that could be connected to the
entire pipeline

1468
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
entire pipeline
 

1469
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,310
entire pipeline
we used to think of each of these as a

1470
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,320
we used to think of each of these as a
 

1471
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,909
we used to think of each of these as a
single variable like intelligence i mean

1472
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
single variable like intelligence i mean
 

1473
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,110
single variable like intelligence i mean
that's ridiculous

1474
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
that's ridiculous
 

1475
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,470
that's ridiculous
it's basically dozens of different genes

1476
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
it's basically dozens of different genes
 

1477
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,990
it's basically dozens of different genes
that are controlling every single

1478
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
that are controlling every single
 

1479
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,990
that are controlling every single
variable you can basically think of you

1480
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,000
variable you can basically think of you
 

1481
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,990
variable you can basically think of you
know imagine us in a video game

1482
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
know imagine us in a video game
 

1483
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,710
know imagine us in a video game
where every one of us has measures of

1484
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
where every one of us has measures of
 

1485
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,390
where every one of us has measures of
you know strength stamina

1486
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
you know strength stamina
 

1487
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,029
you know strength stamina
you know energy left and so forth but

1488
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,039
you know energy left and so forth but
 

1489
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,310
you know energy left and so forth but
you could click on each of those like

1490
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
you could click on each of those like
 

1491
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,990
you could click on each of those like
five bars that are just the main bars

1492
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
five bars that are just the main bars
 

1493
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,230
five bars that are just the main bars
and

1494
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
and
 

1495
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,590
and
each of those will just give you then

1496
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,600
each of those will just give you then
 

1497
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,190
each of those will just give you then
hundreds of bars yeah and you can

1498
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
hundreds of bars yeah and you can
 

1499
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,990
hundreds of bars yeah and you can
basically say

1500
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
basically say
 

1501
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,149
basically say
okay great for my you know machine

1502
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:30,159
okay great for my you know machine
 

1503
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,110
okay great for my you know machine
learning task

1504
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,120
learning task
 

1505
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,310
learning task
i want someone who i'm a human

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,310
i want someone who i'm a human
who has these particular forms of

who has these particular forms of
 

1509
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,549
who has these particular forms of
intelligence i require now these

you know 20 different things and then

1512
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
you know 20 different things and then
 

1513
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,149
you know 20 different things and then
you can combine those things

1514
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:42,159
you can combine those things
 

1515
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,470
you can combine those things
and then relate them to of course

1516
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:44,480
and then relate them to of course
 

1517
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,990
and then relate them to of course
performance in a particular task

1518
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,000
performance in a particular task
 

1519
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,310
performance in a particular task
but you can also relate them to genetic

1520
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
but you can also relate them to genetic
 

1521
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,269
but you can also relate them to genetic
variation

1522
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
variation
 

1523
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,669
variation
that might be affecting different parts

1524
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:51,679
that might be affecting different parts
 

1525
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,549
that might be affecting different parts
of the brain

1526
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
of the brain
 

1527
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,470
of the brain
for example your frontal cortex versus

1528
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,480
for example your frontal cortex versus
 

1529
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,149
for example your frontal cortex versus
your temporal cortex versus your visual

cortex
 

1533
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,510
cortex
and so forth so genetic variation that

1534
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
and so forth so genetic variation that
 

1535
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,269
and so forth so genetic variation that
affects expression of genes in different

1536

affects expression of genes in different
parts of your brain

1538
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
parts of your brain
 

1539
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,630
parts of your brain
can basically affect your you know music

1540
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
can basically affect your you know music
 

1541
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,430
can basically affect your you know music
ability your auditory ability your smell

phenotypes
 

1547
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,070
phenotypes
can be broken down into you know

1548
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
can be broken down into you know
 

1549
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,909
can be broken down into you know
hundreds of cognitive variables and then

1550
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
hundreds of cognitive variables and then
 

1551
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,350
hundreds of cognitive variables and then
relate each of those

1552
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
relate each of those
 

1553
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,110
relate each of those
to thousands of genes that are

1554
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,120
to thousands of genes that are
 

1555
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,710
to thousands of genes that are
associated with them

associated with them
 

1557
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,430
associated with them
so somebody who loves rpgs role-playing

1558
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
so somebody who loves rpgs role-playing
 

1559

so somebody who loves rpgs role-playing
games

1560
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
games
 

1561
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,510
games
there's uh there's too few variables

1562
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:27,520
there's uh there's too few variables
 

1563
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,269
there's uh there's too few variables
that we can control so i'm excited

1564
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
that we can control so i'm excited
 

1565
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,950
that we can control so i'm excited
if we're in fact living in a simulation

1566
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
if we're in fact living in a simulation
 

1567
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,470
if we're in fact living in a simulation
and this is a video game

1568
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:32,480
and this is a video game
 

1569
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,950
and this is a video game
i'm excited by the quality of of the

1570
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:34,960
i'm excited by the quality of of the
 

1571
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,830
i'm excited by the quality of of the
video game the

1572
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
video game the
 

1573
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,950
video game the
the the the game designer did a hell of

1574
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960
the the the game designer did a hell of
 

1575
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,590
the the the game designer did a hell of
a good job

1576
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
a good job
 

1577
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,669
a good job
so we're impressed oh i don't know the

1578
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
so we're impressed oh i don't know the
 

1579
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,710
so we're impressed oh i don't know the
sunset last night was a little

sunset last night was a little
 

1581
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,950
sunset last night was a little
unrealistic

1582
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:44,960
unrealistic
 

1583
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,830

to zoom back out we've been talking

1588
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,480
to zoom back out we've been talking
 

1589
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,390
to zoom back out we've been talking
about the

1590
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,400
about the
 

1591
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,310
about the
genetic origins of diseases but i think

1592
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
genetic origins of diseases but i think
 

1593
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,070
genetic origins of diseases but i think
it's fascinating to

1594
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080
it's fascinating to
 

1595
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,870
it's fascinating to
talk about what are the most important

1596
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
talk about what are the most important
 

1597
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,630
talk about what are the most important
diseases to understand

1598
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
diseases to understand
 

1599
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,029
diseases to understand
and especially as it connects to the

1600
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,039
and especially as it connects to the
 

1601
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,110
and especially as it connects to the
things that you're working on

1602
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
things that you're working on
 

1603
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,430
things that you're working on
so it's very difficult to think about

1604
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
so it's very difficult to think about
 

1605
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,789
so it's very difficult to think about
important diseases to understand there's

1606
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
important diseases to understand there's
 

1607
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,230
important diseases to understand there's
many metrics of importance

1608
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
many metrics of importance
 

1609
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,269
many metrics of importance
one is lifestyle impact i mean if you

1610
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
one is lifestyle impact i mean if you
 

1611
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,269
one is lifestyle impact i mean if you
look at kovid the impact on lifestyle

1612
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
look at kovid the impact on lifestyle
 

1613
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,590
look at kovid the impact on lifestyle
has been enormous so understanding kovid

1614
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
has been enormous so understanding kovid
 

1615
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,710
has been enormous so understanding kovid
is important because it has impacted the

1616
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
is important because it has impacted the
 

1617
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,909
is important because it has impacted the
well-being

1618
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:21,919
well-being
 

1619
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,389
well-being
in terms of ability to have a job

1620
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
in terms of ability to have a job
 

1621
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,070
in terms of ability to have a job
ability to have an apartment ability to

1622
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
ability to have an apartment ability to
 

1623
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,789
ability to have an apartment ability to
go to work

1624
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:26,799
go to work

ability to have a mental circle of
 

1627
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,470
ability to have a mental circle of
support

1628
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
support
 

1629
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,950
support
and all of that for you know millions of

1630
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
and all of that for you know millions of
 

1631
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,630
and all of that for you know millions of
americans like huge huge

1632
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:34,640
americans like huge huge
 

1633
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,470
americans like huge huge
impact so that's one aspect of

1634
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
impact so that's one aspect of
 

1635
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,630
impact so that's one aspect of
importance so basically mental disorders

1636
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
importance so basically mental disorders
 

1637
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,750
importance so basically mental disorders
alzheimer's has a huge importance in the

1638
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
alzheimer's has a huge importance in the
 

1639
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,669
alzheimer's has a huge importance in the
well-being of americans

1640
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
well-being of americans
 

1641
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,830
well-being of americans
whether or not it die it kills someone

1642
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:45,840
whether or not it die it kills someone
 

1643
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,990
whether or not it die it kills someone
for many many years it has a huge impact

1644
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
for many many years it has a huge impact
 

1645
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,389
for many many years it has a huge impact
so the first measure of importance is

1646
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:50,399
so the first measure of importance is
 

1647
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,750
so the first measure of importance is
just well-being

1648
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:51,760
just well-being
 

1649
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,430
just well-being
like impact on the quality of life

1650
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
like impact on the quality of life
 

1651
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,669

impact on the quality of life absolutely
 

1653
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,430
impact on the quality of life absolutely
the second metric which is much easier

1654
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
the second metric which is much easier
 

1655
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,909
the second metric which is much easier
to quantify is deaths

1656
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
to quantify is deaths
 

1657
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,149
to quantify is deaths

accidents
 

1675
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,590

every single accident combined so
 

1677
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,430
every single accident combined so
basically you you know you read the news

1678
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
basically you you know you read the news
 

1679
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,350
basically you you know you read the news
accidents like you know there was a huge

but but if you think about sort of what
 

1725
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,470
but but if you think about sort of what
do we use what are the most important

1726
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
do we use what are the most important
 

1727
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,070
do we use what are the most important
diseases you have to understand

1728
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
diseases you have to understand
 

1729
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,350
diseases you have to understand
both the quality of life and the

1730

both the quality of life and the
 

1731
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,190
both the quality of life and the

the sheer number of deaths and just
 

1733
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,029
the sheer number of deaths and just

numbers of years lost if you wish
 

1735
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,110
numbers of years lost if you wish
and and uh each of these diseases you

1736
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
and and uh each of these diseases you
 

1737
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,710
and and uh each of these diseases you
can think of as uh

1738
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
can think of as uh
 

1739
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,870
can think of as uh
and also including terrorist attacks and

1740
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:30,880
and also including terrorist attacks and
 

1741
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,750
and also including terrorist attacks and
school shootings for example

1742
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
school shootings for example
 

1743
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,789
school shootings for example
things which lead to fatalities you can

1744
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
things which lead to fatalities you can
 

1745
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,510
things which lead to fatalities you can
look at

1746
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
look at
 

1747
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,029
look at
as problems that could be solved

1748
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,039
as problems that could be solved
 

1749
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,350
as problems that could be solved
and some problems are harder to solve

1750
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
and some problems are harder to solve
 

1751
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,789
and some problems are harder to solve
than others

1752
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:44,799
than others
 

1753
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,789
than others
i mean that's part of the equation so

1754
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:46,799
i mean that's part of the equation so
 

1755
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,630
i mean that's part of the equation so
maybe if you look at these diseases if

1756
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:48,640
maybe if you look at these diseases if
 

1757
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,950
maybe if you look at these diseases if
you look at heart disease or cancer

1758
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
you look at heart disease or cancer
 

1759
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,710
you look at heart disease or cancer
or alzheimer's or just

1760
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:54,720
or alzheimer's or just
 

1761
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,909
or alzheimer's or just
like schizophrenia and obesity w like

1762
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:57,919
like schizophrenia and obesity w like
 

1763
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,909
like schizophrenia and obesity w like
not necessarily things that kill you but

1764
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
not necessarily things that kill you but
 

1765
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,590
not necessarily things that kill you but
affect the quality of life

1766
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:01,600
affect the quality of life
 

1767
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,789
affect the quality of life
which problems are solvable which aren't

love your question because it puts it in

1772
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
love your question because it puts it in
 

1773
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,750
love your question because it puts it in
the context

1774
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:09,760
the context
 

1775
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,269
the context
of a global um effort

1776
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:13,279
of a global um effort
 

1777
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,029
of a global um effort
rather than just a local effort so

1778
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
rather than just a local effort so
 

1779
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,029
rather than just a local effort so
basically if you look at

1780
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:17,039
basically if you look at
 

1781
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,389
basically if you look at
the global aspect exercise

1782
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:20,399
the global aspect exercise
 

1783
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,710
the global aspect exercise
and nutrition are two interventions that

1784
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
and nutrition are two interventions that
 

1785
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,630
and nutrition are two interventions that
we can as a society

1786
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,640
we can as a society
 

1787
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,110
we can as a society
make a much better job at so if you

1788
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
make a much better job at so if you
 

1789
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,870
make a much better job at so if you
think about sort of the availability

1790
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
think about sort of the availability
 

1791
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,990
think about sort of the availability
of cheap food it's extremely high in

1792
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
of cheap food it's extremely high in
 

1793
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,789
of cheap food it's extremely high in
calories

1794
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
calories
 

1795
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,950
calories
it's extremely detrimental for you like

1796
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:34,960
it's extremely detrimental for you like
 

1797
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,990
it's extremely detrimental for you like
a lot of processed food

1798
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
a lot of processed food
 

1799
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,510
a lot of processed food
etc so if we change that equation

1800
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:39,520
etc so if we change that equation
 

1801
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,830
etc so if we change that equation
and as a society we made availability of

1802
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
and as a society we made availability of
 

1803
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,710
and as a society we made availability of
healthy food

1804
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
healthy food
 

1805
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,230
healthy food
much much easier and charged

1806
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
much much easier and charged
 

1807
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,430
much much easier and charged
a burger at mcdonald's the price that it

1808
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
a burger at mcdonald's the price that it
 

1809
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,070
a burger at mcdonald's the price that it
costs

1810
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,080
costs
 

1811
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,430
costs
on the health system then people would

1812
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,440
on the health system then people would
 

1813
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,830
on the health system then people would
actually start buying more healthy

1814
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:55,840
actually start buying more healthy
 

1815
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,190
actually start buying more healthy
foods so basically that's sort of a

1816
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
foods so basically that's sort of a
 

1817
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,350
foods so basically that's sort of a
societal intervention if you wish

1818
00:30:59,350 --> 00:30:59,360
societal intervention if you wish
 

1819
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,789
societal intervention if you wish
in the same way increasing empathy

1820
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:02,799
in the same way increasing empathy
 

1821
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,630
in the same way increasing empathy
increasing education increasing the

1822
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:04,640
increasing education increasing the
 

1823
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,750
increasing education increasing the
social

1824
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:05,760
social
 

1825
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,389
social
framework and support would basically

1826
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
framework and support would basically
 

1827
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,830
framework and support would basically
lead to fewer suicides

1828
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
lead to fewer suicides
 

1829
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,990
lead to fewer suicides
it would lead to fewer murders it would

1830
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,000
it would lead to fewer murders it would
 

1831
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,950
it would lead to fewer murders it would
lead to fewer

1832
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
lead to fewer
 

1833
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,149
lead to fewer
you know deaths overall so

1834
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
you know deaths overall so
 

1835
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,269
you know deaths overall so
you know that's something that we as a

1836
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279
you know that's something that we as a
 

1837
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,350
you know that's something that we as a
society can do you can you can also

1838
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
society can do you can you can also
 

1839
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,029
society can do you can you can also
think about external factors versus

1840
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039
think about external factors versus
 

1841
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,789
think about external factors versus
internal factors so the external factors

1842
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
internal factors so the external factors
 

1843
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,630
internal factors so the external factors
are basically communicable diseases

1844
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,640
are basically communicable diseases
 

1845
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,149
are basically communicable diseases
like covid like the flu etc and

1846
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:28,159
like covid like the flu etc and
 

1847
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,990
like covid like the flu etc and
the internal factors are basically

1848
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,000
the internal factors are basically
 

1849
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,830
the internal factors are basically
things like you know cancer and

1850
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:31,840
things like you know cancer and
 

1851
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,509
things like you know cancer and
alzheimer's where basically your

1852
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:33,519
alzheimer's where basically your
 

1853
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,669
alzheimer's where basically your
your genetics will eventually you know

1854
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,679
your genetics will eventually you know
 

1855
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,870
your genetics will eventually you know
drive you there

1856
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:36,880
drive you there
 

1857
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,909
drive you there
um and then of course

1858
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
um and then of course
 

1859
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,149
um and then of course
with all of these factors every single

1860
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
with all of these factors every single
 

1861
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,389
with all of these factors every single
disease has both a genetic component

1862
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
disease has both a genetic component
 

1863
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,389
disease has both a genetic component
and environmental component so heart

1864
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
and environmental component so heart
 

1865
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,070
and environmental component so heart
disease you know huge then they

1866
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
disease you know huge then they
 

1867
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,549
disease you know huge then they
contribute

1868
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:48,559
contribute
 

1869
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,269
contribute
contribution alzheimer's it's like you

1870
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
contribution alzheimer's it's like you
 

1871
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:51,990
contribution alzheimer's it's like you
know

1872
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
know
 

1873
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,430
know
60 plus genetic

1874
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
60 plus genetic
 

1875
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,710
60 plus genetic
so i think it's like 79 heritability

1876
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
so i think it's like 79 heritability
 

1877
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,870
so i think it's like 79 heritability
so that basically means that genetics

1878
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:00,880
so that basically means that genetics
 

1879
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,549
so that basically means that genetics
alone explains

1880
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
alone explains
 

1881
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,990
alone explains
79 of alzheimer's incidence

1882
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
79 of alzheimer's incidence
 

1883
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,029
79 of alzheimer's incidence
and yes there's a 21 environmental

1884
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
and yes there's a 21 environmental
 

1885
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,149
and yes there's a 21 environmental
component

1886
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:10,159
component
 

1887
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,350
component
where you could basically enrich your

1888
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,360
where you could basically enrich your
 

1889
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,110
where you could basically enrich your
cognitive environment enrich your social

1890
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,120
cognitive environment enrich your social
 

1891
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,669
cognitive environment enrich your social

00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:23,440
go running you know sort of have a more
 

1897
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,549
go running you know sort of have a more
fulfilling life

1898

all of that will actually decrease

1900
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
all of that will actually decrease
 

1901
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,909
all of that will actually decrease
alzheimer's but there's a limit to how

1902
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:27,919
alzheimer's but there's a limit to how
 

1903
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:28,389
alzheimer's but there's a limit to how
much that

1904
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:28,399
much that
 

1905
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,310
much that
that can impact because of the huge

1906
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,320
that can impact because of the huge
 

1907
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,909
that can impact because of the huge
genetic footprint so this is fascinating

1908
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:31,919
genetic footprint so this is fascinating
 

1909
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:32,630
genetic footprint so this is fascinating
so

1910
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
so
 

1911
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,029
so
each one of these problems have a

1912
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:35,039
each one of these problems have a
 

1913
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,710
each one of these problems have a
genetic component

1914
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:36,720
genetic component
 

1915
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,269
genetic component
and an environment component and so like

1916
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:39,279
and an environment component and so like
 

1917
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,190
and an environment component and so like
when there's a genetic component

1918
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,200
when there's a genetic component
 

1919
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,470
when there's a genetic component
what can we do about some of these

1920
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
what can we do about some of these
 

1921
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,630
what can we do about some of these
diseases what what have you worked on

1922
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,640
diseases what what have you worked on
 

1923
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,710
diseases what what have you worked on
what can you say that's uh in terms of

1924
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:46,720
what can you say that's uh in terms of
 

1925
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,470
what can you say that's uh in terms of
problems that are solvable here

1926
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,480
problems that are solvable here
 

1927
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,430
problems that are solvable here
or understandable so my group works on

1928
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:51,440
or understandable so my group works on
 

1929
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,710
or understandable so my group works on
the genetic component

1930
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
the genetic component
 

1931
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,789
the genetic component
but i would argue that understanding the

1932
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799
but i would argue that understanding the
 

1933
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,430
but i would argue that understanding the
genetic component can have a huge impact

1934
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,440
genetic component can have a huge impact
 

1935
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,750
genetic component can have a huge impact
even on the environmental component why

1936
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
even on the environmental component why
 

1937
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,470
even on the environmental component why
is that

1938
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:00,480
is that
 

1939
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,070
is that
because genetics gives us access to

1940
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
because genetics gives us access to
 

1941
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,310
because genetics gives us access to
mechanism and if we can alter the

1942
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
mechanism and if we can alter the
 

1943
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,430
mechanism and if we can alter the
mechanism

1944
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
mechanism
 

1945
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,909
mechanism
if we can impact the mechanism we can

1946
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
if we can impact the mechanism we can
 

1947
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,509
if we can impact the mechanism we can
perhaps counteract

1948
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
perhaps counteract
 

1949
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,029
perhaps counteract
some of the environmental components

1950
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039
some of the environmental components
 

1951
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,630
some of the environmental components
interesting so

1952
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
interesting so
 

1953
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,669
interesting so
understanding the biological mechanisms

1954
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
understanding the biological mechanisms
 

1955
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,110
understanding the biological mechanisms
leading to disease

1956
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
leading to disease
 

1957
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,509
leading to disease
is extremely important in being able to

1958
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:19,519
is extremely important in being able to
 

1959
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,549
is extremely important in being able to
intervene

1960
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
intervene
 

1961
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,350
intervene
but when you can intervene what you know

1962
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
but when you can intervene what you know
 

1963
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,950
but when you can intervene what you know

to give is for example for obesity you

1966
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:27,039
to give is for example for obesity you
 

1967
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,190
to give is for example for obesity you
know think of it as a giant bathtub of

1968
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,200
know think of it as a giant bathtub of
 

1969
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,750
know think of it as a giant bathtub of
fat there's basically fat coming in from

1970
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
fat there's basically fat coming in from
 

1971
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,870
fat there's basically fat coming in from
your diet

1972
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:32,880
your diet
 

1973
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,830
your diet
and there's fat coming out from your

1974
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
and there's fat coming out from your
 

1975

okay that's an in out equation and

1978
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080
okay that's an in out equation and
 

1979
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,190
okay that's an in out equation and
that's the equation that everybody's

metabolism controls
 

1989
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,789
metabolism controls
the rate at which you're burning energy

the rate at which you're burning energy
 

1991
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,310
the rate at which you're burning energy
it controls away the rate at which

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,669
you're storing energy
and it also teaches you about

1996
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
and it also teaches you about
 

1997
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,990
and it also teaches you about
the various valves that control the

1998
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
the various valves that control the
 

1999
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,750
the various valves that control the
input and the output equation

2000
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,760
input and the output equation
 

2001
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,789
input and the output equation
so if we can learn from the genetics

2002
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
so if we can learn from the genetics
 

2003
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,190
so if we can learn from the genetics
the valves we can then manipulate those

2004
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
the valves we can then manipulate those
 

2005
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,950
the valves we can then manipulate those
valves

2006
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:10,960
valves
 

2007
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,790
valves
and even if the environment is feeding

2008
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:12,800
and even if the environment is feeding
 

2009
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,990
and even if the environment is feeding
you a lot of fat

2010
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000
you a lot of fat
 

2011
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,230
you a lot of fat
and getting a little that out you just

2012
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
and getting a little that out you just
 

2013
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,069
and getting a little that out you just
poke another hole at the bathtub

2014
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:18,079
poke another hole at the bathtub
 

2015
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,990
poke another hole at the bathtub
and just get a lot of the fat out yeah

2016
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
and just get a lot of the fat out yeah
 

2017
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,589
and just get a lot of the fat out yeah
that's fascinating

2018
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
that's fascinating
 

2019
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,510
that's fascinating
yeah so that we're not just passive

2020
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,520
yeah so that we're not just passive
 

2021
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,589
yeah so that we're not just passive
observers of our genetics

2022
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
observers of our genetics
 

2023
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,510
observers of our genetics
the more we understand the more we can

2024
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
the more we understand the more we can
 

2025
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,430
the more we understand the more we can
come up with actual treatments

2026
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440
come up with actual treatments
 

2027
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,190
come up with actual treatments
and i think that's an important uh

2028
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,200
and i think that's an important uh
 

2029
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,030
and i think that's an important uh
aspect to realize

2030
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,040
aspect to realize
 

2031
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,669
aspect to realize
when people are thinking about strong

2032
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:35,679
when people are thinking about strong
 

2033
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,829
when people are thinking about strong
effect versus weak effect variants

2034
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
effect versus weak effect variants
 

2035
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,510
effect versus weak effect variants
so some variants have strong effects we

2036
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:39,520
so some variants have strong effects we
 

2037
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,190
so some variants have strong effects we
talked about these mendelian disorders

2038
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
talked about these mendelian disorders
 

2039
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,109
talked about these mendelian disorders
where a single gene has a sufficiently

2040
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
where a single gene has a sufficiently
 

2041
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:43,909
where a single gene has a sufficiently
large effect

2042
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:43,919
large effect
 

2043
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,589
large effect
pen and trans expressivity and so so

2044
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
pen and trans expressivity and so so
 

2045
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,510
pen and trans expressivity and so so
forth that basically

2046
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
forth that basically
 

2047
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,030
forth that basically
you can um trace it in families with

2048
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,040
you can um trace it in families with
 

2049
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,109
you can um trace it in families with
cases and not cases cases not cases and

2050
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
cases and not cases cases not cases and
 

2051
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,950
cases and not cases cases not cases and
so forth

2052
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:54,960
so forth
 

2053
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,230
so forth
but even the you know but

2054
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,240
but even the you know but
 

2055
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,790
but even the you know but
so so these are the genes that everybody

2056
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:00,800
so so these are the genes that everybody
 

2057
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,390
so so these are the genes that everybody
says oh that's the genes we should go

2058
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
says oh that's the genes we should go
 

2059
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,790
says oh that's the genes we should go
after

2060
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:02,800
after
 

2061
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,950
after
because that's a strong effect gene i

2062
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:04,960
because that's a strong effect gene i
 

2063
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,990
because that's a strong effect gene i
like to think about it slightly

2064
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
like to think about it slightly
 

2065
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,630
like to think about it slightly
differently

2066
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:06,640
differently
 

2067
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,670
differently
these are the genes where genetic

2068
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
these are the genes where genetic
 

2069
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,870
these are the genes where genetic
impacts that have a strong effect were

2070
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
impacts that have a strong effect were
 

2071
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,030
impacts that have a strong effect were
tolerated

2072
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,040
tolerated
 

2073
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,390
tolerated
because every single time we have a

2074
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
because every single time we have a
 

2075
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,310
because every single time we have a
genetic association with disease

2076
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:18,320
genetic association with disease
 

2077
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,950
genetic association with disease
it depends on two things number one the

2078
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
it depends on two things number one the
 

2079
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,750
it depends on two things number one the
obvious one

2080
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
obvious one
 

2081
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,270
obvious one
whether the gene has an impact on the

2082
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,280
whether the gene has an impact on the
 

2083
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,150
whether the gene has an impact on the
disease number two the more subtle one

2084
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
disease number two the more subtle one
 

2085
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,310
disease number two the more subtle one
is whether there is genetic in variation

2086
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
is whether there is genetic in variation
 

2087
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,030
is whether there is genetic in variation
standing and circulating and segregating

2088
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,040
standing and circulating and segregating
 

2089
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,030
standing and circulating and segregating
in the human population

2090
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,040
in the human population
 

2091
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,390
in the human population
that impacts that gene some genes

2092
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
that impacts that gene some genes
 

2093
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,589
that impacts that gene some genes
are so darn important that if you mess

2094
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:41,599
are so darn important that if you mess
 

2095
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,069
are so darn important that if you mess
with them

2096
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:42,079
with them
 

2097
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,950
with them
even a tiny little amount that person is

2098
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
even a tiny little amount that person is
 

2099
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,230
even a tiny little amount that person is
dead

2100
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,240
dead
 

2101
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,790
dead
so those genes don't have variation

2102
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
so those genes don't have variation
 

2103
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,310
so those genes don't have variation
you're not going to find the genetic

2104
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,320
you're not going to find the genetic
 

2105
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,790
you're not going to find the genetic
association if you don't have variation

2106
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:52,800
association if you don't have variation
 

2107
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,230
association if you don't have variation
that doesn't mean that the gene has no

2108
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
that doesn't mean that the gene has no
 

2109
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,190
that doesn't mean that the gene has no
role

2110
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200
role
 

2111
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,630
role
it's simply that the gene it simply

2112
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
it's simply that the gene it simply
 

2113
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,829
it's simply that the gene it simply
means that the gene tolerates no

2114
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:57,839
means that the gene tolerates no
 

2115
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,870
means that the gene tolerates no
mutations

2116
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:58,880
mutations
 

2117
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,470
mutations
so that's actually a strong signal when

2118
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
so that's actually a strong signal when
 

2119
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,069
so that's actually a strong signal when
there's no variation that's so fast

2120
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:02,079
there's no variation that's so fast
 

2121
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,550
there's no variation that's so fast
exactly genes that have very little

2122
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,560
exactly genes that have very little
 

2123
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,349
exactly genes that have very little
variation

2124
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
variation
 

2125
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,270
variation
are hugely important you can actually

2126
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
are hugely important you can actually
 

2127
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,710
are hugely important you can actually
rank the importance of genes

2128
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:08,720
rank the importance of genes
 

2129
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,630
rank the importance of genes
based on how little variation they have

2130
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:10,640
based on how little variation they have
 

2131
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,990
based on how little variation they have
and those genes that have very little

2132
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
and those genes that have very little
 

2133
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,349
and those genes that have very little
variation but no association

2134
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
variation but no association
 

2135
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,750
variation but no association
with disease that's a very good metric

2136
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
with disease that's a very good metric
 

2137
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,630
with disease that's a very good metric
to say oh that's probably a

2138
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:18,640
to say oh that's probably a
 

2139
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,670
to say oh that's probably a
developmental gene

2140
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680
developmental gene
 

2141
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,950
developmental gene
because we're not good at measuring

2142
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
because we're not good at measuring
 

2143
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,589
because we're not good at measuring
those phenotypes so it's genes that you

2144
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:23,599
those phenotypes so it's genes that you
 

2145
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,310
those phenotypes so it's genes that you
can tell

2146
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:24,320
can tell
 

2147
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,069
can tell
evolution has excluded mutations from

evolution has excluded mutations from
 

2149
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,829
evolution has excluded mutations from
but yet we can't see them associated

2150
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:29,839
but yet we can't see them associated
 

2151
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,870
but yet we can't see them associated
with anything that we can measure

00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:34,640
it's probably early embryonic lethal
 

2157
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,910
it's probably early embryonic lethal
what are all the words you just said

00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:35,920
what are all the words you just said
 

2159
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,109
what are all the words you just said
earlier in brionic what

2160
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:37,119
earlier in brionic what
 

2161
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,310
earlier in brionic what
lethal meaning meaning that if you don't

2162
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
lethal meaning meaning that if you don't
 

2163
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,430
lethal meaning meaning that if you don't
have it

2164
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,440
have it
 

2165
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,950
have it
okay there's a bunch of stuff that um

2166
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
okay there's a bunch of stuff that um
 

2167
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,670
okay there's a bunch of stuff that um
is required for a stable functional

2168
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:47,680
is required for a stable functional

00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
organism
 

2171
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,829
organism
exactly across the board for our entire

2172
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
exactly across the board for our entire
 

2173
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,990
exactly across the board for our entire
for for entire species i guess if you

2174
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,000
for for entire species i guess if you
 

2175
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,430
for for entire species i guess if you
look at sperm

2176
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440
look at sperm
 

2177
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,470
look at sperm
it expresses thousands of proteins

2178
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
it expresses thousands of proteins
 

2179
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,470
it expresses thousands of proteins
does sperm actually need thousands of

2180
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
does sperm actually need thousands of
 

2181
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,670
does sperm actually need thousands of
proteins no

2182
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
proteins no
 

2183
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,109
proteins no
but it's probably just testing them

2184
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
but it's probably just testing them
 

2185
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,390
but it's probably just testing them
so my speculation is that misfolding of

2186
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
so my speculation is that misfolding of
 

2187
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,870
so my speculation is that misfolding of
these proteins is an early test for

2188
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:10,880
these proteins is an early test for
 

2189
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,750
these proteins is an early test for
failure

2190
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
failure
 

2191
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,910
failure
so that out of the you know millions of

2192
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:13,920
so that out of the you know millions of
 

2193
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,790
so that out of the you know millions of
sperm

2194
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:14,800
sperm
 

2195
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,150
sperm
that are possible you select the subset

2196
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
that are possible you select the subset
 

2197
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,470
that are possible you select the subset
that are just not grossly misfolding

2198
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,480
that are just not grossly misfolding
 

2199
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,670
that are just not grossly misfolding
thousands of proteins

2200
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,680
thousands of proteins
 

2201
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,150
thousands of proteins
so it's kind of an assert uh that this

2202
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,160
so it's kind of an assert uh that this
 

2203
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,710
so it's kind of an assert uh that this
is followed

2204
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:24,720
is followed
 

2205
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,430
is followed
correctly correct yeah this uh just uh

2206
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,440
correctly correct yeah this uh just uh
 

2207
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,390
correctly correct yeah this uh just uh
because

2208
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,400
because
 

2209
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,230
because
if this little thing about the folding

2210
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240
if this little thing about the folding
 

2211
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,230
if this little thing about the folding
of a protein is incorrect

2212
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,240
of a protein is incorrect
 

2213
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,069
of a protein is incorrect
that probably means somewhere down the

2214
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:34,079
that probably means somewhere down the
 

2215
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,510
that probably means somewhere down the
line there's a bigger issue

2216
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,520
line there's a bigger issue
 

2217
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,510
line there's a bigger issue
that's exactly right so fail fast so

2218
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
that's exactly right so fail fast so
 

2219
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,550
that's exactly right so fail fast so
basically if you look at

2220
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,560
basically if you look at
 

2221
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,069
basically if you look at
the mammalian investment in

2222
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:42,079
the mammalian investment in
 

2223
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,829
the mammalian investment in
a new born that investment is enormous

2224
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:45,839
a new born that investment is enormous
 

2225
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,510
a new born that investment is enormous
in terms of resources

2226
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:47,520
in terms of resources
 

2227
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,910
in terms of resources
so mammals have basically evolved

2228
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:49,920
so mammals have basically evolved
 

2229
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,030
so mammals have basically evolved
mechanisms

2230
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,040
mechanisms
 

2231
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,829
mechanisms
for fail fast where basically in those

2232
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:53,839
for fail fast where basically in those
 

2233
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:54,470
for fail fast where basically in those
early

2234
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480
early
 

2235
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,109
early
months of development i mean it's it's

2236
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
months of development i mean it's it's
 

2237
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,870
months of development i mean it's it's
horrendous of course at the personal

2238
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
horrendous of course at the personal
 

2239
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,589
horrendous of course at the personal
level

2240
00:37:59,589 --> 00:37:59,599

2241
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,390
level
when you lose a uh you know your future

2242
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
when you lose a uh you know your future
 

2243
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,270
when you lose a uh you know your future
child

2244
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,280
child
 

2245
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,030
child
but in some ways

2246
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
but in some ways
 

2247
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,030
but in some ways
there's so little hope for that child to

2248
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
there's so little hope for that child to
 

2249
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,150
there's so little hope for that child to
develop

2250
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
develop
 

2251
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,190
develop
and sort of make it through the

2252
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,200
and sort of make it through the
 

2253
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,870
and sort of make it through the
remaining months that sort of fail fast

2254
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:12,880
remaining months that sort of fail fast
 

2255
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,069
remaining months that sort of fail fast
is probably

2256
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:14,079
is probably
 

2257
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,630
is probably
a good evolutionary principle from an

2258
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,640
a good evolutionary principle from an
 

2259
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,230
a good evolutionary principle from an
evolutionary perspective for

2260
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,240
evolutionary perspective for
 

2261
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,349
evolutionary perspective for
mammals and of course humans

2262
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:21,359
mammals and of course humans
 

2263
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,910
mammals and of course humans
have a lot of medical resources that you

2264
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:23,920
have a lot of medical resources that you
 

2265
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,630
have a lot of medical resources that you
can sort of give those children a chance

2266
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:26,640
can sort of give those children a chance
 

2267
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,990
can sort of give those children a chance
and you know we have so much more

2268
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
and you know we have so much more
 

2269
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,870
and you know we have so much more
success in sort of giving folks who have

2270
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:32,880
success in sort of giving folks who have
 

2271
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,270
success in sort of giving folks who have
these strong carrier mutations a chance

2272
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
these strong carrier mutations a chance
 

2273
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,550
these strong carrier mutations a chance
but if they're not even making it

2274
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:36,560
but if they're not even making it
 

2275
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,390
but if they're not even making it
through the first three months

2276
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
through the first three months
 

2277
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,990
through the first three months
we're not going to see them so that's

2278
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
we're not going to see them so that's
 

2279
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,510
we're not going to see them so that's
why when we

2280
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:41,520
why when we
 

2281
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,270
why when we
when we say what are the most important

2282
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:43,280
when we say what are the most important
 

2283
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,430
when we say what are the most important
genes to focus on the ones that have a

2291
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,109

well you know the jury might be out

2292
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:51,119
well you know the jury might be out
 

2293
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,310
well you know the jury might be out
because the ones that have a strong

are basically you know not mattering as

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,950
by understanding through genetics that
they have a weak effect mutation

00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:06,960
they have a weak effect mutation

they have a weak effect mutation
and understanding that they have a

we can then say okay great evolution has

00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:11,760
we can then say okay great evolution has
 

2315
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,510
we can then say okay great evolution has
only tolerated a two percent

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,109
that gene
and maybe i will poke another hole at

2324
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:23,119
and maybe i will poke another hole at
 

2325
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,790
and maybe i will poke another hole at
the bathtub

2326
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
the bathtub
 

2327
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,470
the bathtub
that was not easy

2328
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
that was not easy
 

2329
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,550
that was not easy
to control in you know many of the other

2330
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:32,560
to control in you know many of the other
 

2331
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,870
to control in you know many of the other
sort of strong effect genetic variants

2332
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:34,880
sort of strong effect genetic variants
 

2333
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,790
sort of strong effect genetic variants
so okay so there's this beautiful map

2334
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:36,800
so okay so there's this beautiful map
 

2335
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,390
so okay so there's this beautiful map
of uh across the population of things

2336
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,400
of uh across the population of things
 

2337
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:40,950
of uh across the population of things
that

2338
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:40,960
that
 

2339
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,710
that
you're saying strong and weak effects so

2340
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
you're saying strong and weak effects so
 

2341
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,150
you're saying strong and weak effects so
stuff with a lot of

2342
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,160
stuff with a lot of
 

2343
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,670
stuff with a lot of
mutations and stuff with little

2344
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
mutations and stuff with little
 

2345
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,430
mutations and stuff with little
mutations with

2346
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,440
mutations with
 

2347
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,190
mutations with
no mutations and you have this map and

2348
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,200
no mutations and you have this map and
 

2349
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,270
no mutations and you have this map and
it's it lays out the puzzle

2350
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,280
it's it lays out the puzzle
 

2351
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,430
it's it lays out the puzzle
yeah so so when i say strong effect i

2352
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:53,440
yeah so so when i say strong effect i
 

2353
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,870
yeah so so when i say strong effect i
mean at the level of individual

2354
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:54,880
mean at the level of individual
 

2355
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,950
mean at the level of individual
mutations so so basically

2356
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:56,960
mutations so so basically
 

2357
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,710
mutations so so basically
genes where so so

2358
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
genes where so so
 

2359
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,550
genes where so so
you have to think of first the effect of

2360
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:02,560
you have to think of first the effect of
 

2361
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,150
you have to think of first the effect of
the gene on the disease remember how i

2362
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,160
the gene on the disease remember how i
 

2363
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,270
the gene on the disease remember how i
was sort of

2364
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
was sort of
 

2365
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,750
was sort of
painting that map earlier from genetics

2366
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:07,760
painting that map earlier from genetics
 

2367
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,990
painting that map earlier from genetics
all the way to phenotype

2368
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,000
all the way to phenotype
 

2369
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,950
all the way to phenotype
that gene can have a strong effect on

2370
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:12,960
that gene can have a strong effect on
 

2371
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,990
that gene can have a strong effect on
the disease

2372
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,000
the disease
 

2373
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,069
the disease
but the genetic variant might have a

2374
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:16,079
but the genetic variant might have a
 

2375
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,349
but the genetic variant might have a
weak effect on

2376
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:17,359
weak effect on
 

2377
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,790
weak effect on
the gene so basically when you ask

2378
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
the gene so basically when you ask
 

2379
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,870
the gene so basically when you ask
what is the effect of that genetic

2380
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:22,880
what is the effect of that genetic
 

2381
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,710
what is the effect of that genetic
variant on the disease

2382
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:24,720
variant on the disease
 

2383
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,390
variant on the disease
it could be that that genetic variant

2384
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
it could be that that genetic variant
 

2385
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,390
it could be that that genetic variant
impacts the gene by a lot

2386
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,400
impacts the gene by a lot
 

2387
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,069
impacts the gene by a lot
and then the gene impacts the disease by

2388
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
and then the gene impacts the disease by
 

2389
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,829
and then the gene impacts the disease by
a little or it could be that the genetic

2390
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:31,839
a little or it could be that the genetic
 

2391
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,309
a little or it could be that the genetic
variant

2392
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:32,319
variant
 

2393
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,670
variant
impacts the gene by a little and then

2394
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:33,680
impacts the gene by a little and then
 

2395
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,670
impacts the gene by a little and then
the gene impacts the disease by a lot

2396
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:35,680
the gene impacts the disease by a lot
 

2397
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,030
the gene impacts the disease by a lot
so what we care about is genes that

2398
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,040
so what we care about is genes that
 

2399
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,630
so what we care about is genes that
impact the disease a lot

2400
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
impact the disease a lot
 

2401
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,430
impact the disease a lot
but genetics gives us the full equation

2402
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,440
but genetics gives us the full equation
 

2403
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,630
but genetics gives us the full equation
and what i would argue

2404
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
and what i would argue
 

2405
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,069
and what i would argue
is if we couple the genetics

2406
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:48,079
is if we couple the genetics
 

2407
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,390
is if we couple the genetics
with expression variation to basically

2408
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:52,400
with expression variation to basically
 

2409
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,030
with expression variation to basically
ask what

2410
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,040
ask what
 

2411
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,430
ask what
genes change by a lot

2412
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:57,440

 

2413
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,910

and you know which genes correlate with

2414
00:40:59,910 --> 00:40:59,920
and you know which genes correlate with
 

2415
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,109
and you know which genes correlate with
disease by a lot

2416
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
disease by a lot
 

2417
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,870
disease by a lot
even if the genetic variants change them

2418
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
even if the genetic variants change them
 

2419
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,470
even if the genetic variants change them
by a little

2420
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
by a little
 

2421
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,550
by a little
then that those are the best places to

2422
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
then that those are the best places to
 

2423
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,589
then that those are the best places to
intervene

2424
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:07,599
intervene
 

2425
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,790
intervene
those are the best places where

2426
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
those are the best places where
 

2427
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,349
those are the best places where
pharmaceutically if i have

2428
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:11,359
pharmaceutically if i have
 

2429
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,190
pharmaceutically if i have
even a modest effect i will have a

2430
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,200
even a modest effect i will have a
 

2431
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,030
even a modest effect i will have a
strong effect on the disease

2432
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,040
strong effect on the disease
 

2433
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,390
strong effect on the disease
whereas those genetic variants that have

2434
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:16,400
whereas those genetic variants that have
 

2435
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,630
whereas those genetic variants that have
a huge effect on the disease i might not

2436
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,640
a huge effect on the disease i might not
 

2437
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,309
a huge effect on the disease i might not
be able to change that gene by this much

2438
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:20,319
be able to change that gene by this much
 

2439
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,670
be able to change that gene by this much
without affecting all kinds of other

2440
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:21,680
without affecting all kinds of other
 

2441
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,630
without affecting all kinds of other
things

2442
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:22,640
things
 

2443
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,550
things
interesting so yeah okay so that's what

2444
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:24,560
interesting so yeah okay so that's what
 

2445
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,750
interesting so yeah okay so that's what
we're looking at then

2446
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:25,760
we're looking at then
 

2447
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,150
we're looking at then
what have we been able to find in terms

2448
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,160
what have we been able to find in terms
 

2449
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,349
what have we been able to find in terms
of

2450
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
of
 

2451
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,190
of
which disease could be helped again

2452
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
which disease could be helped again
 

2453
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,870
which disease could be helped again
don't get me started this is um

2454
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
don't get me started this is um
 

2455
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,750
don't get me started this is um
we have found so much our understanding

2456
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:39,760
we have found so much our understanding
 

2457
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,630
we have found so much our understanding
of disease

2458
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:40,640
of disease
 

2459
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,630
of disease
has changed so dramatically with

2460
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,640
has changed so dramatically with
 

2461
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,349
has changed so dramatically with
genetics i mean places that we had no

2462
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:47,359
genetics i mean places that we had no
 

2463
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,790
genetics i mean places that we had no
idea would be involved

2464
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:48,800
idea would be involved
 

2465
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,950
idea would be involved
so one of the worst things about my

2466
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:50,960
so one of the worst things about my
 

2467
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,710
so one of the worst things about my
genome is that i have a genetic

2468
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:52,720
genome is that i have a genetic
 

2469
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,829
genome is that i have a genetic
predisposition to

2470
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:53,839
predisposition to
 

2471
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,190
predisposition to
age-related macular degeneration amd

2472
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
age-related macular degeneration amd
 

2473
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,870
age-related macular degeneration amd
so it's a form of blindness that causes

2474
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
so it's a form of blindness that causes
 

2475
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,630
so it's a form of blindness that causes
you to to lose the central part of your

2476
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:00,640
you to to lose the central part of your
 

2477
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,589
you to to lose the central part of your
vision

2478
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:01,599
vision
 

2479
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,470
vision
progressively as you grow older my

2480
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
progressively as you grow older my
 

2481
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,349
progressively as you grow older my
increased risk

2482
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,359
increased risk
 

2483
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,950
increased risk
is fairly small i have an eight percent

2484
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960
is fairly small i have an eight percent
 

2485
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,470
is fairly small i have an eight percent
chance you only have a six percent

2486
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:08,480
chance you only have a six percent
 

2487
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,510
chance you only have a six percent
chance

2488
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,520
chance
 

2489
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,470
chance
you i'm on average yeah by the way when

2490
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,480
you i'm on average yeah by the way when
 

2491
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,390
you i'm on average yeah by the way when
you say my you mean literally yours

2492
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400
you say my you mean literally yours
 

2493
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,390
you say my you mean literally yours
you know this about you i know this

2494
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
you know this about you i know this
 

2495
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,430
you know this about you i know this
about me

2496
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,440
about me
 

2497
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,550
about me
yeah which is kind of uh

2498
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:20,560
yeah which is kind of uh
 

2499
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,950
yeah which is kind of uh
i mean uh philosophically speaking is a

2500
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:22,960
i mean uh philosophically speaking is a
 

2501
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,630
i mean uh philosophically speaking is a
pretty powerful thing

2502
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:24,640
pretty powerful thing
 

2503
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,109
pretty powerful thing
so to live with i mean maybe that's uh

2504
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
so to live with i mean maybe that's uh
 

2505
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,190
so to live with i mean maybe that's uh
so we agreed to talk again by the way

2506
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,200
so we agreed to talk again by the way
 

2507
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,150
so we agreed to talk again by the way
for the

2508
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
for the
 

2509
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,069
for the
listeners to where we're going to try to

2510
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:32,079
listeners to where we're going to try to
 

2511
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,829
listeners to where we're going to try to
focus on science today and

2512
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
focus on science today and
 

2513
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,950
focus on science today and
a little bit of philosophy next time but

2514
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:36,960
a little bit of philosophy next time but
 

2515
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,309
a little bit of philosophy next time but
it's uh interesting to think about

2516
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,319
it's uh interesting to think about
 

2517
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,990
it's uh interesting to think about
the more you're able to know about

2518
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,000
the more you're able to know about
 

2519
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,990
the more you're able to know about
yourself from the genetic information in

2520
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,000
yourself from the genetic information in
 

2521
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,829
yourself from the genetic information in
terms of the diseases

2522
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:45,839
terms of the diseases
 

2523
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,630
terms of the diseases
how that changes your own view of life

2524
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640
how that changes your own view of life
 

2525
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,190
how that changes your own view of life
yeah

2526
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,200
yeah
 

2527
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,829
yeah
so there's there's a lot of impact there

2528
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:51,839
so there's there's a lot of impact there
 

2529
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:52,630
so there's there's a lot of impact there
and there's a

2530
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:52,640
and there's a
 

2531
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,750
and there's a
something called genetic exceptionalism

2532
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
something called genetic exceptionalism
 

2533
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,069
something called genetic exceptionalism
which basically thinks of genetics as

2534
00:42:58,069 --> 00:42:58,079
which basically thinks of genetics as
 

2535
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,910
which basically thinks of genetics as
something very very different

2536
00:42:59,910 --> 00:42:59,920
something very very different
 

2537
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,069
something very very different
than everything else as a type of

2538
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,079
than everything else as a type of
 

2539
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,670
than everything else as a type of
determinism

2540
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:03,680
determinism
 

2541
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,230
determinism
and um you know let's talk about that

2542
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
and um you know let's talk about that
 

2543
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,109
and um you know let's talk about that
next time

2544
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
next time
 

2545
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,230
next time
so basically it's a good preview yeah so

2546
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,240
so basically it's a good preview yeah so
 

2547
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,230
so basically it's a good preview yeah so
let's go back to amd so basically with

2548
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,240
let's go back to amd so basically with
 

2549
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,910
let's go back to amd so basically with
amd

2550
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:13,920
amd
 

2551
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,990
amd
we have no idea what causes amd you know

2552
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,000
we have no idea what causes amd you know
 

2553
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,109
we have no idea what causes amd you know
it was it was a mystery

2554
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:21,119
it was it was a mystery
 

2555
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,670
it was it was a mystery
until the genetics were worked out and

2556
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:23,680
until the genetics were worked out and
 

2557
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,270
until the genetics were worked out and
now the fact that i know that i have a

2558
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
now the fact that i know that i have a
 

2559
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,030
now the fact that i know that i have a
predisposition

2560
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,040
predisposition
 

2561
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,870
predisposition
allows me to sort of make some life

2562
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:28,880
allows me to sort of make some life
 

2563
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,309
allows me to sort of make some life
choices number one

2564
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
choices number one
 

2565
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,829
choices number one
but number two the genes that lead to

2566
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
but number two the genes that lead to
 

2567
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,750
but number two the genes that lead to
that predisposition give us insights as

2568
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:35,760
that predisposition give us insights as
 

2569
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,230
that predisposition give us insights as
to how does it actually work

2570
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,240
to how does it actually work
 

2571
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,870
to how does it actually work
and that's a place where genetics gave

2572
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:40,880
and that's a place where genetics gave
 

2573
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,790
and that's a place where genetics gave
us something totally unexpected

2574
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
us something totally unexpected
 

2575
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,230
us something totally unexpected
so there's a complement pathway

2576
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,240
so there's a complement pathway
 

2577
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,390
so there's a complement pathway
which is an immune function pathway that

2578
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
which is an immune function pathway that
 

2579
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,670
which is an immune function pathway that
was in you know most of the loci

2580
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:53,680
was in you know most of the loci
 

2581
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,390
was in you know most of the loci
associated with amd and that basically

2582
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
associated with amd and that basically
 

2583
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,109
associated with amd and that basically
told us that wow there's an immune basis

2584
00:43:59,109 --> 00:43:59,119
told us that wow there's an immune basis
 

2585
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,390
told us that wow there's an immune basis
to this eye disorder

2586
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
to this eye disorder
 

2587
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,030
to this eye disorder
that people had just not expected before

2588
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:05,040
that people had just not expected before
 

2589
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,630
that people had just not expected before
if you look at complement

2590
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:06,640
if you look at complement
 

2591
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,630
if you look at complement
it was recently also implicated in

2592
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
it was recently also implicated in
 

2593
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,870
it was recently also implicated in
schizophrenia

2594
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
schizophrenia
 

2595
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,150
schizophrenia
and there's a type of microglia

2596
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,160
and there's a type of microglia
 

2597
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,270
and there's a type of microglia
that is involved in synaptic pruning so

2598
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
that is involved in synaptic pruning so
 

2599
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,950
that is involved in synaptic pruning so
synapses are the connections between

2600
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
synapses are the connections between
 

2601
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,150
synapses are the connections between
neurons

2602
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,160
neurons
 

2603
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,870
neurons
and in this whole use it or lose it view

2604
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:22,880
and in this whole use it or lose it view
 

2605
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,430
and in this whole use it or lose it view
of

2606
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
of
 

2607
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,950
of
mental cognition and other capabilities

2608
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
mental cognition and other capabilities
 

2609
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,630
mental cognition and other capabilities
you basically have uh microglia which

2610
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
you basically have uh microglia which
 

2611
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,750
you basically have uh microglia which
are immune cells that are sort of

2612
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:31,760
are immune cells that are sort of
 

2613
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,829
are immune cells that are sort of
constantly traversing your brain

2614
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:33,839
constantly traversing your brain
 

2615
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,230
constantly traversing your brain
and then pruning neuronal connections

2616
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,240
and then pruning neuronal connections
 

2617
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,990
and then pruning neuronal connections
pruning synaptic connections

2618
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,000
pruning synaptic connections
 

2619
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,349
pruning synaptic connections
that are not utilized so

2620
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:41,359
that are not utilized so
 

2621
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,710
that are not utilized so
in schizophrenia there's thought to be

2622
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:44,720
in schizophrenia there's thought to be
 

2623
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,750
in schizophrenia there's thought to be
a change in the pruning that basically

2624
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
a change in the pruning that basically
 

2625
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,510
a change in the pruning that basically
if you don't prune your synapses the

2626
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:49,520
if you don't prune your synapses the
 

2627
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,950
if you don't prune your synapses the
right way

2628
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:50,960
right way
 

2629
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,030
right way
you will actually have an increased role

2630
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,040
you will actually have an increased role
 

2631
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,230
you will actually have an increased role
of schizophrenia this is something that

2632
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,240
of schizophrenia this is something that
 

2633
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,309
of schizophrenia this is something that
was completely unexpected

2634
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:56,319
was completely unexpected
 

2635
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,750
was completely unexpected
for schizophrenia of course we knew it

2636
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:57,760
for schizophrenia of course we knew it
 

2637
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,589
for schizophrenia of course we knew it
has to do with neurons but the role of

2638
00:44:59,589 --> 00:44:59,599
has to do with neurons but the role of
 

2639
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,270
has to do with neurons but the role of
the complement complex

2640
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,280
the complement complex
 

2641
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,990
the complement complex
which is also implicated in amd which is

2642
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,000
which is also implicated in amd which is
 

2643
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,589
which is also implicated in amd which is
now also implicating schizophrenia was a

2644
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:05,599
now also implicating schizophrenia was a
 

2645
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,190
now also implicating schizophrenia was a
huge surprise what's the complement

2646
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,200
huge surprise what's the complement
 

2647
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,829
huge surprise what's the complement
complex

2648
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:07,839
complex
 

2649
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,069
complex
so it's basically a set of genes the

2650
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:10,079
so it's basically a set of genes the
 

2651
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,030
so it's basically a set of genes the
complement genes

2652
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,040
complement genes
 

2653
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,550
complement genes
that are basically having various immune

2654
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:14,560
that are basically having various immune
 

2655
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,550
that are basically having various immune
roles and as i was saying earlier our

2656
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:16,560
roles and as i was saying earlier our
 

2657
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,550
roles and as i was saying earlier our
immune system has been co-opted

2658
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:18,560
immune system has been co-opted
 

2659
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,030
immune system has been co-opted
for many different roles across the body

2660
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
for many different roles across the body
 

2661
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,150
for many different roles across the body
so they actually play

2662
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,160
so they actually play
 

2663
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,150
so they actually play
many diverse roles and somehow the

2664
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,160
many diverse roles and somehow the
 

2665
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,670
many diverse roles and somehow the
immune system

2666
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
immune system
 

2667
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,589
immune system
is connected to the synaptic pruning

2668
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:27,599
is connected to the synaptic pruning
 

2669
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,109
is connected to the synaptic pruning
process exact process

2670
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:29,119
process exact process
 

2671
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,150
process exact process
exactly so immune cells were co-opted to

2672
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,160
exactly so immune cells were co-opted to
 

2673
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,829
exactly so immune cells were co-opted to
prune synapses how did you figure this

2674
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
prune synapses how did you figure this
 

2675
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,510
prune synapses how did you figure this
out

2676
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:35,520
out
 

2677
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,150
out
how does one go about figuring this

2678
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
how does one go about figuring this
 

2679
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,430
how does one go about figuring this
intricate connection

2680
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:39,440
intricate connection
 

2681
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,230
intricate connection
uh like pipeline of connections out yeah

2682
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
uh like pipeline of connections out yeah
 

2683
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,829
uh like pipeline of connections out yeah
let me give you another example

2684
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:43,839
let me give you another example
 

2685
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,550
let me give you another example
so so alzheimer's disease the first

2686
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
so so alzheimer's disease the first
 

2687
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,390
so so alzheimer's disease the first
place that you would expect it to act is

2688
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:48,400
place that you would expect it to act is
 

2689
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,589
place that you would expect it to act is
obviously the brain

2690
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:49,599
obviously the brain
 

2691
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,270
obviously the brain
so we had basically this roadmap

2692
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,280
so we had basically this roadmap
 

2693
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,230
so we had basically this roadmap
epigenomics consortium view of the human

2694
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,240
epigenomics consortium view of the human
 

2695
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:56,870
epigenomics consortium view of the human
epigenome

2696
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:56,880
epigenome
 

2697
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,030
epigenome
the largest map of the human epigenome

2698
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,040
the largest map of the human epigenome
 

2699
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,670
the largest map of the human epigenome
that has ever been built

2700
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:01,680
that has ever been built
 

2701
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,670
that has ever been built
across 127 different tissues and samples

2702
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:05,680
across 127 different tissues and samples
 

2703
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,230
across 127 different tissues and samples
with dozens of epigenomic marks measured

2704
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:08,240
with dozens of epigenomic marks measured
 

2705
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:08,950
with dozens of epigenomic marks measured
in you know

2706
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:08,960
in you know
 

2707
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,510
in you know
hundreds of donors so what we've

2708
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
hundreds of donors so what we've
 

2709
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,150
hundreds of donors so what we've
basically

2710
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:12,160
basically
 

2711
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,630
basically
learned through that is that you you

2712
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:14,640
learned through that is that you you
 

2713
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,829
learned through that is that you you
basically can map

2714
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
basically can map
 

2715
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,670
basically can map
what are the active gene regulatory

2716
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
what are the active gene regulatory
 

2717
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,190
what are the active gene regulatory
elements for every one of the tissues in

2718
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,200
elements for every one of the tissues in
 

2719
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,069
elements for every one of the tissues in
the body

2720
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:20,079
the body
 

2721
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,550
the body
and then we connected these gene

2722
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
and then we connected these gene
 

2723
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,510
and then we connected these gene
regulatory

2724
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
regulatory
 

2725
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,030
regulatory
active maps of basically what regions

2726
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,040
active maps of basically what regions
 

2727
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,670
active maps of basically what regions
of the human genome are turning on in

2728
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680
of the human genome are turning on in
 

2729
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,829
of the human genome are turning on in
every one of different tissues

2730
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:31,839
every one of different tissues
 

2731
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,950
every one of different tissues
we then can go back and say where are

2732
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
we then can go back and say where are
 

2733
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,270
we then can go back and say where are
all

2734
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,280
all
 

2735
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,309
all
the genetic loci that are associated

2736
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:38,319
the genetic loci that are associated
 

2737
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,230
the genetic loci that are associated
with disease

2738
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,240
with disease
 

2739
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,990
with disease
this is something that my group i think

2740
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,000
this is something that my group i think
 

2741
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,109
this is something that my group i think
was the first to do back in 2010

2742
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:45,119
was the first to do back in 2010
 

2743
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,550
was the first to do back in 2010
in this ernst nature biotech paper

2744
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:48,560
in this ernst nature biotech paper
 

2745
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,309
in this ernst nature biotech paper
but basically we were for the first time

2746
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:50,319
but basically we were for the first time
 

2747
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,990
but basically we were for the first time
able to show that specific

2748
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,000
able to show that specific
 

2749
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,069
able to show that specific
chromatin states specific epigenomic

2750
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:54,079
chromatin states specific epigenomic
 

2751
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,990
chromatin states specific epigenomic
states in that case enhancers

2752
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
states in that case enhancers
 

2753
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,630
states in that case enhancers
were in fact enriched enriched in

2754
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
were in fact enriched enriched in
 

2755
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,550
were in fact enriched enriched in
disease associated variants

2756
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:00,560
disease associated variants
 

2757
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,430
disease associated variants
we pushed that further in the ernst

2758
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:03,440
we pushed that further in the ernst
 

2759
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,430
we pushed that further in the ernst
nature paper a year later

2760
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:05,440
nature paper a year later
 

2761
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,150
nature paper a year later
and then in this roadmap epigenomics

2762
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,160
and then in this roadmap epigenomics
 

2763
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,750
and then in this roadmap epigenomics
paper

2764
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:09,760
paper
 

2765
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,349
paper
you know a few years after that but

2766
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:11,359
you know a few years after that but
 

2767
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,790
you know a few years after that but
basically that

2768
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
basically that
 

2769
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,349
basically that
matrix that you mentioned earlier was in

2770
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:15,359
matrix that you mentioned earlier was in
 

2771
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,270
matrix that you mentioned earlier was in
fact the first time that we could see

2772
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,280
fact the first time that we could see
 

2773
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,549
fact the first time that we could see
what genetic traits have genetic

2774
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:20,559
what genetic traits have genetic
 

2775
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,309
what genetic traits have genetic
variants that are enriched

2776
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:22,319
variants that are enriched
 

2777
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,150
variants that are enriched
in what tissues in the body

2778
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,160
in what tissues in the body
 

2779
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,150
in what tissues in the body
and a lot of that map made complete

2780
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,160
and a lot of that map made complete
 

2781
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,990
and a lot of that map made complete
sense if you looked at

2782
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,000
sense if you looked at
 

2783
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,750
sense if you looked at
a diversity of immune traits like

2784
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:31,760
a diversity of immune traits like
 

2785
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,990
a diversity of immune traits like
allergies and type 1 diabetes and so

2786
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,000
allergies and type 1 diabetes and so
 

2787
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,790
allergies and type 1 diabetes and so
forth

2788
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:34,800
forth
 

2789
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,829
forth
you basically could see that they were

2790
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:36,839
you basically could see that they were
 

2791
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,870
you basically could see that they were
enriching that the genetic variants

2792
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:38,880
enriching that the genetic variants
 

2793
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,150
enriching that the genetic variants
associated with those traits

2794
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
associated with those traits
 

2795
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,430
associated with those traits
were enriched in enhancers in these gene

2796
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
were enriched in enhancers in these gene
 

2797
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,710
were enriched in enhancers in these gene
regulatory elements

2798
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:44,720
regulatory elements
 

2799
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,549
regulatory elements
active in t cells and b cells and

2800
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:46,559
active in t cells and b cells and
 

2801
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,109
active in t cells and b cells and
hematopoietic stem cells and so forth

2802
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:49,119
hematopoietic stem cells and so forth
 

2803
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,790
hematopoietic stem cells and so forth
so that basically gave us a

2804
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:52,800
so that basically gave us a
 

2805
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,870
so that basically gave us a
confirmation in many ways that those

2806
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
confirmation in many ways that those
 

2807
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,150
confirmation in many ways that those
immune traits were instead

2808
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,160
immune traits were instead
 

2809
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,109
immune traits were instead
indeed enriching immune cells if you

2810
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,119
indeed enriching immune cells if you
 

2811
00:47:59,119 --> 00:47:59,829
indeed enriching immune cells if you
look

2812
00:47:59,829 --> 00:47:59,839
look
 

2813
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,470
look
if you if you looked at type 2 diabetes

2814
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:02,480
if you if you looked at type 2 diabetes
 

2815
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,390
if you if you looked at type 2 diabetes
you basically saw an enrichment in only

2816
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:04,400
you basically saw an enrichment in only
 

2817
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,270
you basically saw an enrichment in only
one type of sample and it was pancreatic

2818
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
one type of sample and it was pancreatic
 

2819
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,790
one type of sample and it was pancreatic
eyelids

2820
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:08,800
eyelids
 

2821
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,589
eyelids
and we know that type 2 diabetes in you

2822
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
and we know that type 2 diabetes in you
 

2823
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,790
and we know that type 2 diabetes in you
know sort of stems from the

2824
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:12,800
know sort of stems from the
 

2825
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,710
know sort of stems from the
dysregulation of insulin

2826
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:14,720
dysregulation of insulin
 

2827
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,190
dysregulation of insulin
in the beta cells of pancreatic eyelids

2828
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:17,200
in the beta cells of pancreatic eyelids
 

2829
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,309
in the beta cells of pancreatic eyelids
and that sort of was

2830
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:18,319
and that sort of was
 

2831
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,270
and that sort of was
you know spot on super precise if you

2832
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,280
you know spot on super precise if you
 

2833
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,630
you know spot on super precise if you
looked at blood pressure

2834
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
looked at blood pressure
 

2835
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,630
looked at blood pressure
where would you expect blood pressure to

2836
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,640
where would you expect blood pressure to
 

2837
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,670
where would you expect blood pressure to
occur

2838
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
occur
 

2839
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,950
occur
you know i don't know maybe in your

2840
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960
you know i don't know maybe in your
 

2841
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,030
you know i don't know maybe in your
metabolism in ways that you process

2842
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:29,040
metabolism in ways that you process
 

2843
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,390
metabolism in ways that you process
coffee or something like that maybe in

2844
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:30,400
coffee or something like that maybe in
 

2845
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,230
coffee or something like that maybe in
your brain the way that you stress out

2846
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
your brain the way that you stress out
 

2847
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,069
your brain the way that you stress out
increases your blood pressure etc

2848
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:34,079
increases your blood pressure etc
 

2849
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,430
increases your blood pressure etc
what we found is that blood pressure

2850
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:35,440
what we found is that blood pressure
 

2851
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,190
what we found is that blood pressure
localized specifically

2852
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:37,200
localized specifically
 

2853
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,309
localized specifically
in the left ventricle of the heart so

2854
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:40,319
in the left ventricle of the heart so
 

2855
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,990
in the left ventricle of the heart so
the enhancers of the left technology in

2856
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,000
the enhancers of the left technology in
 

2857
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,630
the enhancers of the left technology in
the heart

2858
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:42,640
the heart
 

2859
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,069
the heart
contain a lot of genetic variants

2860
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:44,079
contain a lot of genetic variants
 

2861
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,549
contain a lot of genetic variants
associated with blood pressure

2862
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:46,559
associated with blood pressure
 

2863
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,790
associated with blood pressure
if you look at height we found an

2864
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:48,800
if you look at height we found an
 

2865
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,390
if you look at height we found an
enrichment specifically

2866
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,400
enrichment specifically
 

2867
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,270
enrichment specifically
in embryonic stem cell enhancers so the

2868
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:53,280
in embryonic stem cell enhancers so the
 

2869
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,030
in embryonic stem cell enhancers so the
genetic variants predisposing you to be

2870
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
genetic variants predisposing you to be
 

2871
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,309
genetic variants predisposing you to be
taller or shorter

2872
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
taller or shorter
 

2873
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,630
taller or shorter
are in fact acting in developmental stem

2874
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:58,640
are in fact acting in developmental stem
 

2875
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,670
are in fact acting in developmental stem
cells makes

2876
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,680
cells makes
 

2877
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,750
cells makes
complete sense if you looked at

2878
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:01,760
complete sense if you looked at
 

2879
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,270
complete sense if you looked at
inflammatory bowel disease

2880
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:03,280
inflammatory bowel disease
 

2881
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,670
inflammatory bowel disease
you basically found inflammatory which

2882
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:05,680
you basically found inflammatory which
 

2883
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,549
you basically found inflammatory which
is immune

2884
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:06,559
is immune
 

2885
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,790
is immune
and also bowel disease which is

2886
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:08,800
and also bowel disease which is
 

2887
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,589
and also bowel disease which is
digestive

2888
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:09,599
digestive
 

2889
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,990
digestive
and indeed we saw a double enrichment

2890
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,000
and indeed we saw a double enrichment
 

2891
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,750
and indeed we saw a double enrichment
both in the immune cells

2892
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,760
both in the immune cells
 

2893
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,910
both in the immune cells
and in the digestive cells so that

2894
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:15,920
and in the digestive cells so that
 

2895
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,109
and in the digestive cells so that
basically told us that

2896
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:17,119
basically told us that
 

2897
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,790
basically told us that
this is acting in both components

2898
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:18,800
this is acting in both components
 

2899
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,990
this is acting in both components
there's an immune component to

2900
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,000
there's an immune component to
 

2901
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,190
there's an immune component to
inflammatory bowel disease

2902
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,200
inflammatory bowel disease
 

2903
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,349
inflammatory bowel disease
and there's a digestive component and

2904
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:23,359
and there's a digestive component and
 

2905
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,750
and there's a digestive component and
the big surprise was for alzheimer's

2906
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:25,760
the big surprise was for alzheimer's
 

2907
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,950
the big surprise was for alzheimer's
we had seven different brain samples

2908
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:28,960
we had seven different brain samples
 

2909
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,150
we had seven different brain samples
we found zero enrichment in the brain

2910
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,160
we found zero enrichment in the brain
 

2911
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,030
we found zero enrichment in the brain
samples

2912
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,040
samples
 

2913
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,549
samples
for genetic variants associated with

2914
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:34,559
for genetic variants associated with
 

2915
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,829
for genetic variants associated with
alzheimer's and this is mind-boggling

2916
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:37,839
alzheimer's and this is mind-boggling
 

2917
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,990
alzheimer's and this is mind-boggling
our brains were literally hurting what

2918
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:40,000
our brains were literally hurting what
 

2919
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,750
our brains were literally hurting what
is going on

2920
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
is going on
 

2921
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,349
is going on
and what is going on is that the brain

2922
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:43,359
and what is going on is that the brain
 

2923
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,829
and what is going on is that the brain
samples are primarily

2924
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:45,839
samples are primarily
 

2925
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:50,630
samples are primarily
neurons oligodendrocytes and astrocytes

2926
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
neurons oligodendrocytes and astrocytes
 

2927
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,910
neurons oligodendrocytes and astrocytes
in terms of the cell types that make

2928
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:51,920
in terms of the cell types that make
 

2929
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,910
in terms of the cell types that make
them up

2930
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:53,920
them up
 

2931
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,150
them up
so that basically indicated that genetic

2932
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
so that basically indicated that genetic
 

2933
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,630
so that basically indicated that genetic
variants associated with alzheimer's

2934
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:58,640
variants associated with alzheimer's
 

2935
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,589
variants associated with alzheimer's
were probably not acting in

2936
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:01,599
were probably not acting in
 

2937
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,390
were probably not acting in
oligodendrocytes astrocytes or neurons

2938
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:04,400
oligodendrocytes astrocytes or neurons
 

2939
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,470
oligodendrocytes astrocytes or neurons
so what could they be acting in well the

2940
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,480
so what could they be acting in well the
 

2941
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,829
so what could they be acting in well the
fourth major cell type is actually

2942
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:07,839
fourth major cell type is actually
 

2943
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,510
fourth major cell type is actually
microglia

2944
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:09,520
microglia
 

2945
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,549
microglia
microglia are resident immune cells in

2946
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:12,559
microglia are resident immune cells in
 

2947
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,510
microglia are resident immune cells in
your brain

2948
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:13,520
your brain
 

2949
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,349
your brain
oh nice the immune oh wow

2950
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:17,359
oh nice the immune oh wow
 

2951
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,470
oh nice the immune oh wow
and they are cd14 plus which is this

2952
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:20,480
and they are cd14 plus which is this
 

2953
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,270
and they are cd14 plus which is this
sort of cell surface markers uh of those

2954
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
sort of cell surface markers uh of those
 

2955
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,910
sort of cell surface markers uh of those
cells

2956
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:23,920
cells
 

2957
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,670
cells
so their cd14 plus cells just like

2958
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:25,680
so their cd14 plus cells just like
 

2959
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,990
so their cd14 plus cells just like
macrophages that are circulating

2960
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,000
macrophages that are circulating
 

2961
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,270
macrophages that are circulating
in your blood the microglia are

2962
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,280
in your blood the microglia are
 

2963
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,390
in your blood the microglia are
resident monocytes that are basically

2964
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:34,400
resident monocytes that are basically
 

2965
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,670
resident monocytes that are basically
sitting in your brain they're

2966
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:35,680
sitting in your brain they're
 

2967
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,430
sitting in your brain they're
tissue-specific

2968
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
tissue-specific
 

2969
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,430
tissue-specific
monocytes and every one of your tissues

2970
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:39,440
monocytes and every one of your tissues
 

2971
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,349
monocytes and every one of your tissues
like your your fat for example

2972
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:41,359
like your your fat for example
 

2973
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,589
like your your fat for example
has a lot of macrophages that are resin

2974
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:43,599
has a lot of macrophages that are resin
 

2975
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,630
has a lot of macrophages that are resin
and the m1 versus m2 macrophage ratio

2976
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:46,640
and the m1 versus m2 macrophage ratio
 

2977
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,589
and the m1 versus m2 macrophage ratio
has a huge role to play in obesity and

2978
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:49,599
has a huge role to play in obesity and
 

2979
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:50,950
has a huge role to play in obesity and
you know so basically again these immune

2980
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960
you know so basically again these immune
 

2981
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,230
you know so basically again these immune
cells are everywhere but basically what

2982
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,240
cells are everywhere but basically what
 

2983
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,430
cells are everywhere but basically what
we found

2984
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:53,440
we found
 

2985
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,470
we found
through this completely unbiased view of

2986
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,480
through this completely unbiased view of
 

2987
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,230
through this completely unbiased view of
what are the tissues that likely

2988
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
what are the tissues that likely
 

2989
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,309
what are the tissues that likely
underlie different disorders

2990
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:00,319
underlie different disorders
 

2991
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,670
underlie different disorders
we found that alzheimer's was

2992
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:03,680
we found that alzheimer's was
 

2993
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,950
we found that alzheimer's was
humongously enriched in microglia but

2994
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:06,960
humongously enriched in microglia but
 

2995
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,270
humongously enriched in microglia but
not at all in the other cell types so

2996
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:09,280
not at all in the other cell types so
 

2997
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,030
not at all in the other cell types so
what what are we supposed to make that

2998
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
what what are we supposed to make that
 

2999
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,910
what what are we supposed to make that
if you

3000
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:11,920
if you
 

3001
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,030
if you
look at the tissues involved is that

3002
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,040
look at the tissues involved is that
 

3003
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,589
look at the tissues involved is that
simply

3004
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
simply
 

3005
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,950
simply
useful for indication of uh

3006
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:18,960
useful for indication of uh
 

3007
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,750
useful for indication of uh
propensity for disease or does it give

3008
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:21,760
propensity for disease or does it give
 

3009
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,390
propensity for disease or does it give
us somehow a pathway of treatment

3010
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:24,400
us somehow a pathway of treatment
 

3011
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,109
us somehow a pathway of treatment
it's very much the second if you look at

3012
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:27,119
it's very much the second if you look at
 

3013
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,190
it's very much the second if you look at
the

3014
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200
the
 

3015
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,549
the
um the way to therapeutics you have to

3016
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:32,559
um the way to therapeutics you have to
 

3017
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,589
um the way to therapeutics you have to
start somewhere

3018
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:33,599
start somewhere
 

3019
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,549
start somewhere
what are you gonna do you're gonna

3020
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:34,559
what are you gonna do you're gonna
 

3021
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,950
what are you gonna do you're gonna
basically make assays

3022
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:36,960
basically make assays
 

3023
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,309
basically make assays
that manipulate those genes

3024
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:40,319
that manipulate those genes
 

3025
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,670
that manipulate those genes
and those pathways in those cell types

3026
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,680
and those pathways in those cell types
 

3027
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,470
and those pathways in those cell types
so before we know the tissue of action

3028
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:46,480
so before we know the tissue of action
 

3029
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,030
so before we know the tissue of action
we don't even know where to start

3030
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:49,040
we don't even know where to start
 

3031
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,190
we don't even know where to start
we basically are at a loss but if you

3032
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
we basically are at a loss but if you
 

3033
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,870
we basically are at a loss but if you
know the tissue of action and even

3034
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:52,880
know the tissue of action and even
 

3035
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,109
know the tissue of action and even
better if you know the pathway of action

3036
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:55,119
better if you know the pathway of action
 

3037
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,630
better if you know the pathway of action
then you can basically screen your small

3038
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:56,640
then you can basically screen your small
 

3039
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,150
then you can basically screen your small
molecules

3040
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:58,160
molecules
 

3041
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,910
molecules
not for the gene you can screen them

3042
00:51:59,910 --> 00:51:59,920
not for the gene you can screen them
 

3043
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,670
not for the gene you can screen them
directly for the pathway

3044
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:01,680
directly for the pathway
 

3045
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,589
directly for the pathway
in that cell type so you can basically

3046
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:03,599
in that cell type so you can basically
 

3047
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,030
in that cell type so you can basically
develop a high throughput multiplexed

3048
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:07,040
develop a high throughput multiplexed
 

3049
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,150
develop a high throughput multiplexed
you know robotic system for testing

3050
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,160
you know robotic system for testing
 

3051
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,790
you know robotic system for testing
the impact of your favorite molecules

3052
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:12,800
the impact of your favorite molecules
 

3053
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,870
the impact of your favorite molecules
that you know are safe efficacious and

3054
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:14,880
that you know are safe efficacious and
 

3055
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,829
that you know are safe efficacious and
you know sort of

3056
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
you know sort of
 

3057
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,710
you know sort of
hit that particular gene and so forth

3058
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:18,720
hit that particular gene and so forth
 

3059
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,670
hit that particular gene and so forth
you can basically screen those molecules

3060
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:21,680
you can basically screen those molecules
 

3061
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,630
you can basically screen those molecules
against either a set of genes that act

3062
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:24,640
against either a set of genes that act
 

3063
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,750
against either a set of genes that act
in that pathway

3064
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:25,760
in that pathway
 

3065
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,829
in that pathway
or on the pathway directly by having a

3066
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:27,839
or on the pathway directly by having a
 

3067
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,589
or on the pathway directly by having a
cellular assay

3068
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:29,599
cellular assay
 

3069
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,510
cellular assay
and then you can basically go into mice

3070
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:31,520
and then you can basically go into mice
 

3071
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,870
and then you can basically go into mice
and do experiments and basically

3072
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:32,880
and do experiments and basically
 

3073
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,870
and do experiments and basically
sort of figure out ways to manipulate

3074
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:34,880
sort of figure out ways to manipulate
 

3075
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,150
sort of figure out ways to manipulate
these processes

3076
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:36,160
these processes
 

3077
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,670
these processes
that allow you to then to go back to

3078
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,680
that allow you to then to go back to
 

3079
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,589
that allow you to then to go back to
humans and do a clinical trial that

3080
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:39,599
humans and do a clinical trial that
 

3081
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:40,870
humans and do a clinical trial that
basically says okay

3082
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:40,880
basically says okay
 

3083
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,710
basically says okay
i was able indeed to reverse these

3084
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
i was able indeed to reverse these
 

3085
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,549
i was able indeed to reverse these
processes in mice can i do the same

3086
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:44,559
processes in mice can i do the same
 

3087
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,069
processes in mice can i do the same
thing in humans

3088
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:46,079
thing in humans
 

3089
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,030
thing in humans
so that the the knowledge of the tissues

3090
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:49,040
so that the the knowledge of the tissues
 

3091
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,230
so that the the knowledge of the tissues
gives you the pathway

3092
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:50,240
gives you the pathway
 

3093
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,069
gives you the pathway
to treatment but that's not the only

3094
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:52,079
to treatment but that's not the only
 

3095
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,430
to treatment but that's not the only
part there are many

3096
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:53,440
part there are many
 

3097
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,430
part there are many
additional steps to figuring out the

3098
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:55,440
additional steps to figuring out the
 

3099
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,790
additional steps to figuring out the
mechanism of disease

3100
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:56,800
mechanism of disease
 

3101
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,109
mechanism of disease
i mean so that's really promising maybe

3102
00:52:59,109 --> 00:52:59,119
i mean so that's really promising maybe
 

3103
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,069
i mean so that's really promising maybe
uh

3104
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
uh
 

3105
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,309
uh
to take a small step back you've you've

3106
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:02,319
to take a small step back you've you've
 

3107
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,750
to take a small step back you've you've
mentioned all these puzzles that were

3108
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:03,760
mentioned all these puzzles that were
 

3109
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,470
mentioned all these puzzles that were
figured out with the nature paper

3110
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
figured out with the nature paper
 

3111
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,670
figured out with the nature paper
for i mean you've mentioned a ton of

3112
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
for i mean you've mentioned a ton of
 

3113
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,510
for i mean you've mentioned a ton of
diseases

3114
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:11,520
diseases
 

3115
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,910
diseases
from obesity to alzheimer's even

3116
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:13,920
from obesity to alzheimer's even
 

3117
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,990
from obesity to alzheimer's even
schizophrenia i think you mentioned

3118
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,000
schizophrenia i think you mentioned
 

3119
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,109
schizophrenia i think you mentioned
and just what is the actual methodology

3120
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:19,119
and just what is the actual methodology
 

3121
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,549
and just what is the actual methodology
of figuring this out

3122
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:20,559
of figuring this out
 

3123
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,790
of figuring this out
so indeed i mentioned a lot of diseases

3124
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,800
so indeed i mentioned a lot of diseases
 

3125
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,549
so indeed i mentioned a lot of diseases
and and my lab works on a lot of

3126
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:24,559
and and my lab works on a lot of
 

3127
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,670
and and my lab works on a lot of
different disorders

3128
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,680
different disorders
 

3129
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,190
different disorders
and the reason for that is that

3130
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:29,200
and the reason for that is that
 

3131
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,589
and the reason for that is that
if you look at the

3132
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:33,599

 

3133
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,109

if you look at biology

3134
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:37,119
if you look at biology
 

3135
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,950
if you look at biology
it used to be you know zoology

3136
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:38,960
it used to be you know zoology
 

3137
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,230
it used to be you know zoology
departments in both technology

3138
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:40,240
departments in both technology
 

3139
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,990
departments in both technology
departments and you know virology

3140
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
departments and you know virology
 

3141
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,910
departments and you know virology
departments and so on so forth and mit

3142
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:43,920
departments and so on so forth and mit
 

3143
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,109
departments and so on so forth and mit
was one of the first schools to

3144
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:45,119
was one of the first schools to
 

3145
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,950
was one of the first schools to
basically create a biology department

3146
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:46,960
basically create a biology department
 

3147
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,230
basically create a biology department
like oh we're going to study

3148
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
like oh we're going to study
 

3149
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,390
like oh we're going to study
all of life suddenly why was that even

3150
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:50,400
all of life suddenly why was that even
 

3151
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,270
all of life suddenly why was that even
the case

3152
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:51,280
the case
 

3153
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,109
the case
because the advent of dna and the genome

3154
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:55,119
because the advent of dna and the genome
 

3155
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,190
because the advent of dna and the genome
and the central dogma of dna makes rna

3156
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:57,200
and the central dogma of dna makes rna
 

3157
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,470
and the central dogma of dna makes rna
mixed protein

3158
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
mixed protein
 

3159
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,750
mixed protein
in many ways unified biology you could

3160
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:01,760
in many ways unified biology you could
 

3161
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,309
in many ways unified biology you could
suddenly

3162
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:02,319
suddenly
 

3163
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,549
suddenly
study the process of transcription in

3164
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:04,559
study the process of transcription in
 

3165
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:05,349
study the process of transcription in
viruses

3166
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:05,359
viruses
 

3167
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,390
viruses
or in bacteria and have a huge impact on

3168
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:08,400
or in bacteria and have a huge impact on
 

3169
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,990
or in bacteria and have a huge impact on
yeast and fly and maybe even mammals

3170
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
yeast and fly and maybe even mammals
 

3171
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,710
yeast and fly and maybe even mammals
because of this realization of these

3172
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:14,720
because of this realization of these
 

3173
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,349
because of this realization of these
common underlying processes

3174
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:17,359
common underlying processes
 

3175
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,710
common underlying processes
and in the same way that dna unified

3176
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:20,720
and in the same way that dna unified
 

3177
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,390
and in the same way that dna unified
biology

3178
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:22,400
biology
 

3179
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,670
biology
genetics is unifying disease

3180
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:25,680
genetics is unifying disease
 

3181
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,109
genetics is unifying disease
studies so you used to have

3182
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:29,119
studies so you used to have
 

3183
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,230
studies so you used to have
um you used to have

3184
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:32,240
um you used to have
 

3185
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,470
um you used to have
uh you know i don't know um

3186
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,480
uh you know i don't know um
 

3187
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,630
uh you know i don't know um
cardiovascular disease department

3188
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,640
cardiovascular disease department
 

3189
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,430
cardiovascular disease department
and uh you know neurological disease

3190
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:39,440
and uh you know neurological disease
 

3191
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,069
and uh you know neurological disease
department

3192
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,079
department
 

3193
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,270
department
and neurodegeneration department and uh

3194
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:43,280
and neurodegeneration department and uh
 

3195
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,270
and neurodegeneration department and uh
you know um basically immune and cancer

3196
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
you know um basically immune and cancer
 

3197
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,150
you know um basically immune and cancer
and so forth

3198
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:48,160
and so forth
 

3199
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,430
and so forth
and all of these were studied in

3200
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
and all of these were studied in
 

3201
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,190
and all of these were studied in
different labs

3202
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,200
different labs
 

3203
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,870
different labs
you know because it made sense because

3204
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:52,880
you know because it made sense because
 

3205
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,309
you know because it made sense because
basically the first step was

3206
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:54,319
basically the first step was
 

3207
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,309
basically the first step was
understanding how the tissue functions

3208
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:56,319
understanding how the tissue functions
 

3209
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,829
understanding how the tissue functions
and we kind of knew the tissues involved

3210
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
and we kind of knew the tissues involved
 

3211
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,390
and we kind of knew the tissues involved
in cardiovascular disease and so forth

3212
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
in cardiovascular disease and so forth
 

3213
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,829
in cardiovascular disease and so forth
but what's happening with human genetics

3214
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:01,839
but what's happening with human genetics
 

3215
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,430
but what's happening with human genetics
is that all of that

3216
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,440
is that all of that
 

3217
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,750
is that all of that
all of these walls and edifices that we

3218
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
all of these walls and edifices that we
 

3219
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,710
all of these walls and edifices that we
had built are

3220
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
had built are
 

3221
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,670
had built are
crumbling and the reason for that is

3222
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:09,680
crumbling and the reason for that is
 

3223
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,069
crumbling and the reason for that is
that

3224
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:10,079
that
 

3225
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,150
that
genetics is in many ways revealing

3226
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
genetics is in many ways revealing
 

3227
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,030
genetics is in many ways revealing
unexpected connections so suddenly we

3228
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,040
unexpected connections so suddenly we
 

3229
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,950
unexpected connections so suddenly we
now have to bring the immunologists

3230
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
now have to bring the immunologists
 

3231
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,910
now have to bring the immunologists
to work on alzheimer's they were never

3232
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:21,920
to work on alzheimer's they were never
 

3233
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,190
to work on alzheimer's they were never
in the room they were in another

3234
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,200
in the room they were in another
 

3235
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,750
in the room they were in another
building altogether

3236
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760
building altogether
 

3237
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,390
building altogether
the same way for schizophrenia we now

3238
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:28,400
the same way for schizophrenia we now
 

3239
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,470
the same way for schizophrenia we now
have to sort of worry about

3240
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:30,480
have to sort of worry about
 

3241
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,109
have to sort of worry about
all these interconnected aspects for

3242
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,119
all these interconnected aspects for
 

3243
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,870
all these interconnected aspects for
metabolic disorders we're finding

3244
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:34,880
metabolic disorders we're finding
 

3245
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,270
metabolic disorders we're finding
contributions from brain

3246
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
contributions from brain
 

3247
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,309
contributions from brain
so suddenly we have to call the

3248
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:38,319
so suddenly we have to call the
 

3249
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:39,990
so suddenly we have to call the
neurologist from the other building and

3250
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,000
neurologist from the other building and
 

3251
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,190
neurologist from the other building and
so forth

3252
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:41,200
so forth
 

3253
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,630
so forth
so in my view it makes no sense

3254
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
so in my view it makes no sense
 

3255
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,349
so in my view it makes no sense
anymore to basically say oh i'm a

3256
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:47,359
anymore to basically say oh i'm a
 

3257
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,470
anymore to basically say oh i'm a
geneticist

3258
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:48,480
geneticist
 

3259
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,030
geneticist
studying immune disorders i mean that's

3260
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,040
studying immune disorders i mean that's
 

3261
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,109
studying immune disorders i mean that's
that's ridiculous because i mean yeah of

3262
00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:53,119
that's ridiculous because i mean yeah of
 

3263
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:54,230
that's ridiculous because i mean yeah of
course in many ways

3264
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
course in many ways
 

3265
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,109
course in many ways
you still need to sort of focus but what

3266
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:57,119
you still need to sort of focus but what
 

3267
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,549
you still need to sort of focus but what
what what we're doing is that we're

3268
00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559
what what we're doing is that we're
 

3269
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,230
what what we're doing is that we're
basically saying we'll go wherever the

3270
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:00,240
basically saying we'll go wherever the
 

3271
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,069
basically saying we'll go wherever the
genetics takes us

3272
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:02,079
genetics takes us
 

3273
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,589
genetics takes us
and by building these massive resources

3274
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:05,599
and by building these massive resources
 

3275
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,190
and by building these massive resources
by working on our latest map is now 833

3276
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,200
by working on our latest map is now 833
 

3277
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,230
by working on our latest map is now 833
tissues

3278
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,240
tissues
 

3279
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,630
tissues
sort of the the next generation of the

3280
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:12,640
sort of the the next generation of the
 

3281
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,069
sort of the the next generation of the
epigenomics roadmap which we're now

3282
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:14,079
epigenomics roadmap which we're now
 

3283
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,349
epigenomics roadmap which we're now
called epimap

3284
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359
called epimap
 

3285
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,030
called epimap
is 833 different tissues and using those

3286
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:19,040
is 833 different tissues and using those
 

3287
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,789
is 833 different tissues and using those
we've basically found enrichments in 540

3288
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:22,799
we've basically found enrichments in 540
 

3289
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,309
we've basically found enrichments in 540
different disorders

3290
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
different disorders
 

3291
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,150
different disorders
those enrichments are not like oh great

3292
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
those enrichments are not like oh great
 

3293
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,589
those enrichments are not like oh great
you guys work on that and we'll work on

3294
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:27,599
you guys work on that and we'll work on
 

3295
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,109
you guys work on that and we'll work on
this

3296
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:29,119
this
 

3297
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,990
this
they're intertwined amazingly so of

3298
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,000
they're intertwined amazingly so of
 

3299
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,390
they're intertwined amazingly so of
course there's a lot of modularity

3300
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:34,400
course there's a lot of modularity
 

3301
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,910
course there's a lot of modularity
but there's these enhancers that are

3302
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:35,920
but there's these enhancers that are
 

3303
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,270
but there's these enhancers that are
sort of broadly active and these

3304
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:37,280
sort of broadly active and these
 

3305
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,349
sort of broadly active and these
disorders that are broadly active

3306
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
disorders that are broadly active
 

3307
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,870
disorders that are broadly active
so basically some enhancers are active

3308
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:40,880
so basically some enhancers are active
 

3309
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,710
so basically some enhancers are active
in on tissues and some disorders are

3310
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
in on tissues and some disorders are
 

3311
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,349
in on tissues and some disorders are
enriching

3312
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:43,359
enriching
 

3313
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,670
enriching
in all tissues so basically there's

3314
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:45,680
in all tissues so basically there's
 

3315
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,589
in all tissues so basically there's
these multifactorial

3316
00:56:47,589 --> 00:56:47,599
these multifactorial
 

3317
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:48,950
these multifactorial
and this other class which i like to

3318
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
and this other class which i like to
 

3319
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,270
and this other class which i like to
call polyfactorial diseases

3320
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
call polyfactorial diseases
 

3321
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,710
call polyfactorial diseases
which are basically lighting up

3322
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
which are basically lighting up
 

3323
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,549
which are basically lighting up
everywhere and

3324
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:54,559
everywhere and
 

3325
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,349
everywhere and
in many ways it's you know sort of

3326
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:57,359
in many ways it's you know sort of
 

3327
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,230
in many ways it's you know sort of
cutting across

3328
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:58,240
cutting across
 

3329
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,910
cutting across
these walls that were previously built

3330
00:56:59,910 --> 00:56:59,920
these walls that were previously built
 

3331
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,510
these walls that were previously built
across these departments

3332
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:01,520
across these departments
 

3333
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,910
across these departments
and the polyfactorial ones were probably

3334
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:03,920
and the polyfactorial ones were probably
 

3335
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,030
and the polyfactorial ones were probably
the previous

3336
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,040
the previous
 

3337
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,109
the previous
structure departments wasn't equipped to

3338
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
structure departments wasn't equipped to
 

3339
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,470
structure departments wasn't equipped to
deal with those

3340
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
deal with those
 

3341
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,230
deal with those
i mean again maybe it's a romanticized

3342
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
i mean again maybe it's a romanticized
 

3343
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,829
i mean again maybe it's a romanticized
question but you know there's

3344
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:13,839
question but you know there's
 

3345
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,270
question but you know there's
in physics there's a theory of

3346
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:15,280
in physics there's a theory of
 

3347
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,349
in physics there's a theory of
everything do you think

3348
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:17,359
everything do you think
 

3349
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,710
everything do you think
it's possible to move towards an almost

3350
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:20,720
it's possible to move towards an almost
 

3351
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,630
it's possible to move towards an almost
theory of everything of disease from a

3352
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:22,640
theory of everything of disease from a
 

3353
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,910
theory of everything of disease from a
genetic perspective

3354
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:23,920
genetic perspective
 

3355
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,950
genetic perspective
so if this unification continues is it

3356
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:26,960
so if this unification continues is it
 

3357
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,990
so if this unification continues is it
possible that

3358
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,000
possible that
 

3359
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,589
possible that
like do you think in those terms like

3360
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:29,599
like do you think in those terms like
 

3361
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,190
like do you think in those terms like
trying to arrive

3362
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:31,200
trying to arrive
 

3363
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,349
trying to arrive
at a fundamental understanding of how

00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:33,359
at a fundamental understanding of how
 

3365
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,430
at a fundamental understanding of how
disease emerges period

that unification is not just

3368
00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:38,559
that unification is not just
 

3369
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,589
that unification is not just
foreseeable it's inevitable

3370
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:41,599
foreseeable it's inevitable
 

3371
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,470
foreseeable it's inevitable
i see it as inevitable we have to go

3372
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
i see it as inevitable we have to go
 

3373
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,030
i see it as inevitable we have to go
there

3374

so basically for us to say oh great you

3422
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:39,760
so basically for us to say oh great you
 

3423
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,670
so basically for us to say oh great you
know you guys in the immune building

3424
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
know you guys in the immune building
 

3425
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,589
know you guys in the immune building
go solve the fundamental circuitry of

3426
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:43,599
go solve the fundamental circuitry of
 

3427
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,109
go solve the fundamental circuitry of
everything and then you guys in the

3428
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:45,119
everything and then you guys in the
 

3429
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,390
everything and then you guys in the
schizophrenia building go solve the

3430
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:46,400
schizophrenia building go solve the
 

3431
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,069
schizophrenia building go solve the
fundamental circuitry of everything

fundamental circuitry of everything
 

3433
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,549
fundamental circuitry of everything
separately is crazy so what we need to

3434
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:50,559
separately is crazy so what we need to
 

3435
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,549
separately is crazy so what we need to
do is come together

3436
00:58:52,549 --> 00:58:52,559
do is come together
 

3437
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,589
do is come together
and sort of have a circuitry group the

3438
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:55,599
and sort of have a circuitry group the
 

3439
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,109
and sort of have a circuitry group the
circuitry building that sort of

3440
00:58:57,109 --> 00:58:57,119
circuitry building that sort of
 

3441
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,309
circuitry building that sort of
tries to solve the circuitry of

3442
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
tries to solve the circuitry of
 

3443
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,150
tries to solve the circuitry of
everything and then

3444
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:00,160
everything and then
 

3445
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,950
everything and then
the immune folks who will apply this

3446
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
the immune folks who will apply this
 

3447

folks
 

3457
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,870
folks
will basically interact with both the

3458
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:12,880
will basically interact with both the
 

3459
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,349
will basically interact with both the
immune folks and with the neuronal folks

3460
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:15,359
immune folks and with the neuronal folks
 

3461
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,710
immune folks and with the neuronal folks
and all of them will be interacting with

3462
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:16,720
and all of them will be interacting with
 

3463
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,870
and all of them will be interacting with
the circuitry folks and so forth so

3464
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:18,880
the circuitry folks and so forth so
 

3465
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,069
the circuitry folks and so forth so
that's sort of the current

3466
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:20,079
that's sort of the current
 

3467
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,230
that's sort of the current
structure of my group if you wish so

3468
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:22,240
structure of my group if you wish so
 

3469
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,510
structure of my group if you wish so
basically what we're doing is

of that basic circuitry

have
 

3677
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,870
have
at the tissue specific level so we're

3678
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:56,880
at the tissue specific level so we're
 

3679
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,150
at the tissue specific level so we're
focusing on that because we're

focusing on that because we're
 

3681
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:58,950

you know the needs from the disease

3684
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:01,280
you know the needs from the disease
 

3685
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,950
you know the needs from the disease
front so you have a sense of the entire

3687

nice question to ask would be

3692
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:10,640
nice question to ask would be
 

3693
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,430
nice question to ask would be
how do you from the scientific

how do you from the scientific

go from knowing nothing about the

01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:15,839
go from knowing nothing about the
 

3699
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,270
go from knowing nothing about the
disease

3700
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:17,280
disease
 

3701
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,309
disease
to going you said uh

3702
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:20,319
to going you said uh
 

3703
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,069
to going you said uh
to go into the entire pipeline and

3704
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
to go into the entire pipeline and
 

3705
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,510
to go into the entire pipeline and
actually have a drug

3706
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:23,520
actually have a drug
 

3707
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,910
actually have a drug
or or a treatment that cures that

3708
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
or or a treatment that cures that
 

3709
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,630
or or a treatment that cures that
disease

01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:26,640
disease
 

3711
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,990
disease
so that's an enormously long path

3712
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,000
so that's an enormously long path
 

3713
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,870
so that's an enormously long path
and an enormously great challenge and

3714
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
and an enormously great challenge and
 

3715
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,829
and an enormously great challenge and
what i'm trying to argue is that

3716
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:35,839
what i'm trying to argue is that
 

3717
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:38,789
what i'm trying to argue is that
it progresses in stages of understanding

3718
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:38,799
it progresses in stages of understanding
 

3719
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,789
it progresses in stages of understanding
rather than one gene at a time

3720
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:40,799
rather than one gene at a time
 

3721
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,789
rather than one gene at a time
the traditional view of biology was you

3722
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:42,799
the traditional view of biology was you
 

3723
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,710
the traditional view of biology was you
have one postdoc working on this gene

3724
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
have one postdoc working on this gene
 

3725
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,230
have one postdoc working on this gene
and another prosthetic working on that

3726
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
and another prosthetic working on that
 

3727
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,829
and another prosthetic working on that
gene and

3728
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:47,839
gene and
 

3729
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,190
gene and
they'll just figure out everything about

3730
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:49,200
they'll just figure out everything about
 

3731
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,829
they'll just figure out everything about
that gene and that's their job

3732
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:51,839
that gene and that's their job
 

3733
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,029
that gene and that's their job
what we've realized is how polygenic the

3734
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:55,039
what we've realized is how polygenic the
 

3735
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,029
what we've realized is how polygenic the
diseases are so we can't have one

3736
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
diseases are so we can't have one
 

3737
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,069
diseases are so we can't have one
postdoctoral gene anymore

3738
01:03:58,069 --> 01:03:58,079
postdoctoral gene anymore
 

3739
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,190
postdoctoral gene anymore
we now have to have these

3740
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,200
we now have to have these
 

3741
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,470
we now have to have these
cross-cutting needs and

3742
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:04,480
cross-cutting needs and
 

3743
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,710
cross-cutting needs and
i'm going to describe the path to

3744
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
i'm going to describe the path to
 

3745
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,549
i'm going to describe the path to
circuitry

3746
01:04:08,549 --> 01:04:08,559
circuitry
 

3747
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,349
circuitry
along those needs and every single one

3748
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:11,359
along those needs and every single one
 

3749
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:12,870
along those needs and every single one
of these paths

3750
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:12,880
of these paths
 

3751
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,029
of these paths
we are now doing in parallel across

3752
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:15,039
we are now doing in parallel across
 

3753
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,789
we are now doing in parallel across
thousands of genes

3754
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:16,799
thousands of genes
 

3755
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:20,069
thousands of genes
so the first step is you have a genetic

3756
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:20,079
so the first step is you have a genetic
 

3757
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,510
so the first step is you have a genetic
association

3758
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
association
 

3759
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,029
association
and we talked a little bit about sort of

3760
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,039
and we talked a little bit about sort of
 

3761
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,630
and we talked a little bit about sort of
the mendelian path

3762
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:24,640
the mendelian path
 

3763
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,630
the mendelian path
and the polygenic path to that

3764
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:26,640
and the polygenic path to that
 

3765
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,710
and the polygenic path to that
association so the mendelian path was

3766
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
association so the mendelian path was
 

3767
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,829
association so the mendelian path was
looking through families

3768
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:29,839
looking through families
 

3769
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,950
looking through families
to basically find gene regions

3770
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960
to basically find gene regions
 

3771
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,270
to basically find gene regions
and ultimately genes that are underlying

3772
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:35,280
and ultimately genes that are underlying
 

3773
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,630
and ultimately genes that are underlying
particular disorders

3774
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
particular disorders
 

3775
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,670
particular disorders
the polygenic path is basically looking

01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:39,680
the polygenic path is basically looking
 

3777
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,549
the polygenic path is basically looking
at

we now have

01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:52,559
we now have

01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,670
we now have

3801
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,270
and that distinction is not understood
by most people

3802
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:03,280
by most people
 

3803
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,029
by most people
so i'm going to explain it a little bit

3804
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:05,039
so i'm going to explain it a little bit
 

3805
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,470
so i'm going to explain it a little bit
more

3806
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
more
 

3807
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,789
more
why do do we not have a connection

3808
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:08,799
why do do we not have a connection
 

3809
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:09,829
why do do we not have a connection
between a gene

3810
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:09,839
between a gene
 

3811
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,190
between a gene
and a disease but we have a connection

3812
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200
and a disease but we have a connection
 

3813
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,349
and a disease but we have a connection
between a genetic region and a disease

3814
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359
between a genetic region and a disease
 

3815
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:17,910
between a genetic region and a disease
the reason for that is that 93

3816
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:17,920
the reason for that is that 93
 

3817
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,549
the reason for that is that 93
of genetic variants that are associated

3818
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:20,559
of genetic variants that are associated
 

3819
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,470
of genetic variants that are associated
with disease don't

3820
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:22,480
with disease don't
 

3821
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,950
with disease don't
impact the protein at all

3822
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:26,960
impact the protein at all
 

3823
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,230
impact the protein at all
so if you look at the human genome

3824
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:28,240
so if you look at the human genome
 

3825
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,109
so if you look at the human genome
there's 20 000 genes there's 3.2 billion

3826
01:05:31,109 --> 01:05:31,119
there's 20 000 genes there's 3.2 billion
 

3827
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,029
there's 20 000 genes there's 3.2 billion
nucleotides

3828
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,039
nucleotides
 

3829
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,870
nucleotides
only 1.5 percent of the genome

3830
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:36,880
only 1.5 percent of the genome
 

3831
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,990
only 1.5 percent of the genome
codes for proteins

3832
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:40,000
codes for proteins
 

3833
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,990
codes for proteins
the other 98.5

3834
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:44,000
the other 98.5
 

3835
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,470
the other 98.5
does not code for proteins if you now

3836
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:46,480
does not code for proteins if you now
 

3837
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,829
does not code for proteins if you now
look at where are the disease variants

3838
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:48,839
look at where are the disease variants
 

3839
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:50,789
look at where are the disease variants
located

3840
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:50,799
located
 

3841
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,910
located
93 percent of them fall in that

3842
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:53,920
93 percent of them fall in that
 

3843
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,990
93 percent of them fall in that
outside the genes portion of course

3844
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:56,000
outside the genes portion of course
 

3845
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,109
outside the genes portion of course
genes are enriched

3846
01:05:57,109 --> 01:05:57,119
genes are enriched
 

3847
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,789
genes are enriched
but they're only enriched by a factor of

3848
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:58,799
but they're only enriched by a factor of
 

3849
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,309
but they're only enriched by a factor of
three

3850
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:00,319
three
 

3851
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,470
three
that means that still 93 of genetic

3852
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:02,480
that means that still 93 of genetic
 

3853
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,510
that means that still 93 of genetic
variants

3854
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
variants
 

3855
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,710
variants
fall outside the proteins

3856
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:06,720
fall outside the proteins
 

3857
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,549
fall outside the proteins
why is that difficult why is that a

3858
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
why is that difficult why is that a
 

3859
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,029
why is that difficult why is that a
problem the problem is that when a

3860
01:06:11,029 --> 01:06:11,039
problem the problem is that when a
 

3861
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,990
problem the problem is that when a
variant falls outside the gene

3862
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:14,000
variant falls outside the gene
 

3863
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,990
variant falls outside the gene
you don't know what gene is impacted by

3864
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:16,000
you don't know what gene is impacted by
 

3865
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,750
you don't know what gene is impacted by
that variant you can't just say oh

3866
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
that variant you can't just say oh
 

3867
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,670
that variant you can't just say oh
it's near this gene let's just connect

3868
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:19,680
it's near this gene let's just connect
 

3869
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,950
it's near this gene let's just connect
that variant to the gene

3870
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:20,960
that variant to the gene
 

3871
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,230
that variant to the gene
and the reason for that is that the

3872
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:22,240
and the reason for that is that the
 

3873
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,230
and the reason for that is that the
genome circuitry

3874
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240
genome circuitry
 

3875
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,670
genome circuitry
is very often long range

3876
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:27,680
is very often long range
 

3877
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,990
is very often long range
so you basically have that genetic

3878
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,000
so you basically have that genetic
 

3879
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,710
so you basically have that genetic
variant that could sit in the intron

3880
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
variant that could sit in the intron
 

3881
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,750
variant that could sit in the intron
of one gene and an intron is sort of

3882
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
of one gene and an intron is sort of
 

3883
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,190
of one gene and an intron is sort of
the place between the axons that code

3884
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:37,200
the place between the axons that code
 

3885
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,589
the place between the axons that code
for proteins so proteins are split up

3886
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
for proteins so proteins are split up
 

3887
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,069
for proteins so proteins are split up
into exons and introns and every exon

3888
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,079
into exons and introns and every exon
 

3889
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,150
into exons and introns and every exon
codes for a particular subset of amino

3890
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:44,160
codes for a particular subset of amino
 

3891
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:44,710
codes for a particular subset of amino
acids

3892
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:44,720
acids
 

3893
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,710
acids
and together they're spliced together

3894
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,720
and together they're spliced together
 

3895
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,950
and together they're spliced together
and then make the final protein

3896
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:48,960
and then make the final protein
 

3897
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,470
and then make the final protein
so that genetic variant might be sitting

3898
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:50,480
so that genetic variant might be sitting
 

3899
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,470
so that genetic variant might be sitting
in an intron of a gene it's transcribed

3900
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
in an intron of a gene it's transcribed
 

3901
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,510
in an intron of a gene it's transcribed
with the gene

3902
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:53,520
with the gene
 

3903
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,589
with the gene
it's processed and then excised but it

3904
01:06:55,589 --> 01:06:55,599
it's processed and then excised but it
 

3905
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,109
it's processed and then excised but it
might not impact this gene at all it

3906
01:06:57,109 --> 01:06:57,119
might not impact this gene at all it
 

3907
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,390
might not impact this gene at all it
might actually impact

3908
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:58,400
might actually impact
 

3909
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,069
might actually impact
another gene that's a million

3910
01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:00,079
another gene that's a million
 

3911
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,750
another gene that's a million
nucleotides away so it's just riding

3912
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:01,760
nucleotides away so it's just riding
 

3913
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,430
nucleotides away so it's just riding
along even though it has nothing to do

3914
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:03,440
along even though it has nothing to do
 

3915
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:03,910
along even though it has nothing to do
with the

3916
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:03,920
with the
 

3917
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,829
with the
with this nearby neighborhood that's

3918
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:05,839
with this nearby neighborhood that's
 

3919
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,430
with this nearby neighborhood that's
exactly right

3920
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,440
exactly right
 

3921
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,150
exactly right
let me give you an example the strongest

3922
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,160
let me give you an example the strongest
 

3923
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,230
let me give you an example the strongest
genetic association with obesity

3924
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:12,240
genetic association with obesity
 

3925
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,670
genetic association with obesity
was discovered in this fto gene

3926
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:15,680
was discovered in this fto gene
 

3927
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,710
was discovered in this fto gene
fat and obesity-associated gene so

3928
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
fat and obesity-associated gene so
 

3929
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,910
fat and obesity-associated gene so
this fto gene was studied

3930
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:21,920
this fto gene was studied
 

3931
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,190
this fto gene was studied
ad nauseum people did tons of

3932
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:25,200
ad nauseum people did tons of
 

3933
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:25,910
ad nauseum people did tons of
experiments on

3934
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
experiments on
 

3935
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,470
experiments on
on it they figured out that fto is in

3936
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:28,480
on it they figured out that fto is in
 

3937
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,109
on it they figured out that fto is in
fact

3938
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
fact
 

3939
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,950
fact
a rna methylation transferase it

3940
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
a rna methylation transferase it
 

3941
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,150
a rna methylation transferase it
basically

3942
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,160
basically
 

3943
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,069
basically
crea it sort of impacts something that

3944
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:36,079
crea it sort of impacts something that
 

3945
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:37,349
crea it sort of impacts something that
we know that we call the

3946
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:37,359
we know that we call the
 

3947
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,510
we know that we call the
epi transcriptome just like the genome

3948
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:39,520
epi transcriptome just like the genome
 

3949
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,630
epi transcriptome just like the genome
can be modified

3950
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:40,640
can be modified
 

3951
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,390
can be modified
the transcriptome the transcript of the

3952
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:42,400
the transcriptome the transcript of the
 

3953
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,549
the transcriptome the transcript of the
genes can be modified

3954
01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:44,559
genes can be modified
 

3955
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,630
genes can be modified
and we basically said oh great that

3956
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:46,640
and we basically said oh great that
 

3957
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,549
and we basically said oh great that
means that that ap transcriptomics is

3958
01:07:48,549 --> 01:07:48,559
means that that ap transcriptomics is
 

3959
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,549
means that that ap transcriptomics is
hugely involved in obesity because that

3960
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559
hugely involved in obesity because that
 

3961
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,589
hugely involved in obesity because that
that gene fto is is you know uh clearly

that gene fto is is you know uh clearly
 

3963
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,950
that gene fto is is you know uh clearly
where the genetic locus

found

3974
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,599
found
 

3975
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,870
found
is that this fto locus even though it

01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:08,880
is that this fto locus even though it
 

3977
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,150
is that this fto locus even though it
is associated with obesity does not

3978
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:12,160
is associated with obesity does not

implicate
the fto gene

3982
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:16,480

 

3983
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,309

the genetic variant sits in the first

3984
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:18,319
the genetic variant sits in the first
 

3985
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,789
the genetic variant sits in the first
intron of the fdo gene

3986
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:20,799
intron of the fdo gene
 

3987
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,470
intron of the fdo gene
but it controls two genes irx3

3988
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:24,480
but it controls two genes irx3
 

3989
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,630
but it controls two genes irx3
and ir x5 that are sitting 1.2

million nucleotides away several genes

3992
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:31,199
million nucleotides away several genes
 

3993
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:32,950

oh boy uh what am i supposed to feel

3996
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:35,279
oh boy uh what am i supposed to feel
 

3997
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,030
oh boy uh what am i supposed to feel
about that because isn't that like super

3998
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,040
about that because isn't that like super
 

3999
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,229
about that because isn't that like super
complicated then

4000
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:38,239
complicated then
 

4001
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,910
complicated then
uh so so the way that i was introduced

4002
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:39,920
uh so so the way that i was introduced
 

4003
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,829
uh so so the way that i was introduced
at a conference a few years ago

4004
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
at a conference a few years ago
 

4005
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,829
at a conference a few years ago
was uh and here's manolis kellys who

4006
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:43,839
was uh and here's manolis kellys who
 

4007
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,749
was uh and here's manolis kellys who
wrote the most depressing paper

4008
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:45,759
wrote the most depressing paper
 

4009
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,590
wrote the most depressing paper
of 2015 and the reason for that is that

4010
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:49,600
of 2015 and the reason for that is that
 

4011
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,030
of 2015 and the reason for that is that
the entire pharmaceutical industry was

4012
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040
the entire pharmaceutical industry was
 

4013
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,149
the entire pharmaceutical industry was
so comfortable

4014
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:52,159
so comfortable
 

4015
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:54,950
so comfortable
that there was a single gene in that

4016
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:54,960
that there was a single gene in that
 

4017
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,829
that there was a single gene in that
locus

4018
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:55,839
locus
 

4019
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,510
locus
because in some loci you basically have

4020
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:57,520
because in some loci you basically have
 

4021
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,110
because in some loci you basically have
three dozen genes that are all sitting

4022
01:08:59,110 --> 01:08:59,120
three dozen genes that are all sitting
 

4023
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,110
three dozen genes that are all sitting
in the same region of association

4024
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:01,120
in the same region of association
 

4025
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,950
in the same region of association
and you're like gosh which ones of those

4026
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:02,960
and you're like gosh which ones of those
 

4027
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,030
and you're like gosh which ones of those
is it but even that question of which

4028
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:05,040
is it but even that question of which
 

4029
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,149
is it but even that question of which
ones of those

4030
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:06,159
ones of those
 

4031
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:07,749
ones of those
is it is making the assumption that it

4032
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:07,759
is it is making the assumption that it
 

4033
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:09,669
is it is making the assumption that it
is one of those

4034
01:09:09,669 --> 01:09:09,679
is one of those
 

4035
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,829
is one of those
as opposed to some random gene just far

4036
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:11,839
as opposed to some random gene just far
 

4037
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:14,550
as opposed to some random gene just far
far away which is what our paper showed

4038
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:14,560
far away which is what our paper showed
 

4039
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,149
far away which is what our paper showed
so basically what our paper showed is

4040
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:16,159
so basically what our paper showed is
 

4041
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,870
so basically what our paper showed is
that you can't ignore the circuitry

4042
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:18,880
that you can't ignore the circuitry
 

4043
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,149
that you can't ignore the circuitry
you have to first figure out the

4044
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:20,159
you have to first figure out the
 

4045
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:22,070
you have to first figure out the
circuitry all of those long-range

4046
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:22,080
circuitry all of those long-range
 

4047
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,110
circuitry all of those long-range
interactions

4048
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:23,120
interactions
 

4049
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,189
interactions
how every genetic variant impacts the

4050
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:25,199
how every genetic variant impacts the
 

4051
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:26,709
how every genetic variant impacts the
expression of every gene

4052
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:26,719
expression of every gene
 

4053
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,870
expression of every gene
in every tissue imaginable across

4054
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:28,880
in every tissue imaginable across
 

4055
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,709
in every tissue imaginable across
hundreds of individuals

4056
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
hundreds of individuals
 

4057
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:33,269
hundreds of individuals
and then you now have one of the

4058
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:33,279
and then you now have one of the
 

4059
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:34,470
and then you now have one of the
building blocks not even all of the

4060
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
building blocks not even all of the
 

4061
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,510
building blocks not even all of the
building blocks

4062
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:35,520
building blocks
 

4063
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,189
building blocks
for them going and understanding disease

4064
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:39,199
for them going and understanding disease
 

4065
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,470
for them going and understanding disease
so okay so so embrace

4066
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,480
so okay so so embrace
 

4067
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,550
so okay so so embrace
the the wholeness of the circuitry

4068
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:44,560
the the wholeness of the circuitry
 

4069
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,510
the the wholeness of the circuitry
correct but what

4070
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:45,520
correct but what
 

4071
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,990
correct but what
so back to the question of starting

4072
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
so back to the question of starting
 

4073
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,709
so back to the question of starting
knowing nothing

4074
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:48,719
knowing nothing
 

4075
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,390
knowing nothing
to the disease and and going to the

4076
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:50,400
to the disease and and going to the
 

4077
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,070
to the disease and and going to the
treatment so

4078
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:52,080
treatment so
 

4079
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,990
treatment so
what are the next steps so you basically

4080
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
what are the next steps so you basically
 

4081
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,910
what are the next steps so you basically
have to first figure out the tissue

4082
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:55,920
have to first figure out the tissue
 

4083
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,430
have to first figure out the tissue
and then describe how you figure out the

4084
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,440
and then describe how you figure out the
 

4085
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,870
and then describe how you figure out the
tissue you figure out the tissue by

4086
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
tissue you figure out the tissue by
 

4087
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,830
tissue you figure out the tissue by
taking all of these

4088
01:09:59,830 --> 01:09:59,840
taking all of these
 

4089
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,830
taking all of these
non-coding variants that are sitting

4090
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:01,840
non-coding variants that are sitting
 

4091
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,030
non-coding variants that are sitting
outside proteins

4092
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,040
outside proteins
 

4093
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,630
outside proteins
and then figuring out what are the

4094
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:04,640
and then figuring out what are the
 

4095
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,630
and then figuring out what are the
epigenomic enrichments

4096
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:06,640
epigenomic enrichments
 

4097
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,110
epigenomic enrichments
and the reason for that you know

4098
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,120
and the reason for that you know
 

4099
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,149
and the reason for that you know
thankfully

4100
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:10,159
thankfully
 

4101
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:13,270
thankfully
is that there is convergence that

4102
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:13,280
is that there is convergence that
 

4103
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,990
is that there is convergence that
the same processes are impacted in

4104
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:16,000
the same processes are impacted in
 

4105
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,870
the same processes are impacted in
different ways

4106
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:16,880
different ways
 

4107
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,990
different ways
by different loci and that's

4108
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:20,000
by different loci and that's
 

4109
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,350
by different loci and that's
a saving grace for our field the fact

4110
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:23,360
a saving grace for our field the fact
 

4111
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:23,830
a saving grace for our field the fact
that

4112
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:23,840
that
 

4113
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,590

can you clarify why that's helpful so

4122
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:34,640
can you clarify why that's helpful so
 

4123
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,790
can you clarify why that's helpful so
like they show up in the same exact way

4124
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:36,800
like they show up in the same exact way
 

4125
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,070
like they show up in the same exact way
in the in the specific set of processes

4126
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,080
in the in the specific set of processes
 

4127
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,310
in the in the specific set of processes
yeah so basically there's a small number

4128
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:42,320
yeah so basically there's a small number
 

4129
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,669
yeah so basically there's a small number
of biological processes

4130
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:43,679
of biological processes
 

4131
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,830
of biological processes
that underlie or at least that play them

4132
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:45,840
that underlie or at least that play them
 

4133
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,790
that underlie or at least that play them
the biggest role

4134
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:46,800
the biggest role
 

4135
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,750
the biggest role
in every disorder so in alzheimer's you

4136
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:49,760
in every disorder so in alzheimer's you
 

4137
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,790
in every disorder so in alzheimer's you
basically have

4138
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800
basically have
 

4139
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,030
basically have
you know maybe 10 different types of

4140
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:53,040
you know maybe 10 different types of
 

4141
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,550
you know maybe 10 different types of
processes one of them is lipid

4142
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,560
processes one of them is lipid
 

4143
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,070
processes one of them is lipid
metabolism

4144
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:56,080
metabolism
 

4145
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,870
metabolism
one of them is immune cell function one

4146
01:10:58,870 --> 01:10:58,880
one of them is immune cell function one
 

4147
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,310
one of them is immune cell function one
of them is

4148
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,320
of them is
 

4149
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,030
of them is
neuronal energetics so these are just a

4150
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:03,040
neuronal energetics so these are just a
 

4151
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,950
neuronal energetics so these are just a
small number of processes but you have

4152
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
small number of processes but you have
 

4153
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,669
small number of processes but you have
multiple lesions multiple genetic

4154
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:07,679
multiple lesions multiple genetic
 

4155
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,430
multiple lesions multiple genetic
perturbations that are associated with

4156
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:09,440
perturbations that are associated with
 

4157
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,790
perturbations that are associated with
those processes

4158
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:10,800
those processes
 

4159
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,950
those processes
so if you look at schizophrenia it's

4160
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:12,960
so if you look at schizophrenia it's
 

4161
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,390
so if you look at schizophrenia it's
excitatory neuron function it's

4162
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
excitatory neuron function it's
 

4163
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,149
excitatory neuron function it's
inhibitory neuron function it's synaptic

4164
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:16,159
inhibitory neuron function it's synaptic
 

4165
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,149
inhibitory neuron function it's synaptic
pruning it's calcium signaling and so

4166
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:18,159
pruning it's calcium signaling and so
 

4167
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:18,790
pruning it's calcium signaling and so
forth

4168
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:18,800
forth
 

4169
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,990
forth
so when you look at disease genetics

4170
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,000
so when you look at disease genetics
 

4171
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,470
so when you look at disease genetics
you have one hit here and one hit there

4172
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:24,480
you have one hit here and one hit there
 

4173
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,229
you have one hit here and one hit there
and one hit there and one hit there

4174
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:26,239
and one hit there and one hit there
 

4175
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,910
and one hit there and one hit there
completely different parts of the genome

4176
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
completely different parts of the genome
 

4177
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,669
completely different parts of the genome
but it turns out all of those he

4178
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:29,679
but it turns out all of those he
 

4179
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,470
but it turns out all of those he
hits are calcium signaling proteins oh

4180
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:32,480
hits are calcium signaling proteins oh
 

4181
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:32,870
hits are calcium signaling proteins oh
cool

4182
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:32,880
cool
 

4183
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,669
cool
you're like aha that means that calcium

4184
01:11:35,669 --> 01:11:35,679
you're like aha that means that calcium
 

4185
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,189
you're like aha that means that calcium
signaling is important

4186
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:37,199
signaling is important
 

4187
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,709
signaling is important
so those people who are focusing on one

4188
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:38,719
so those people who are focusing on one
 

4189
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,030
so those people who are focusing on one
doctors at a time cannot possibly

4190
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
doctors at a time cannot possibly
 

4191
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,669
doctors at a time cannot possibly
see that picture you have to become a

4192
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
see that picture you have to become a
 

4193
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,030
see that picture you have to become a
genomicist you have to

4194
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:45,040
genomicist you have to
 

4195
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,070
genomicist you have to
look at the omics the um the holistic

4196
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:48,080
look at the omics the um the holistic
 

4197
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,030
look at the omics the um the holistic
picture

4198
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040
picture
 

4199
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,750
picture
to understand these enrichments but you

4200
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:51,760
to understand these enrichments but you
 

4201
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,910
to understand these enrichments but you
mentioned the convergence thing so the

4202
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:53,920
mentioned the convergence thing so the
 

4203
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,870
mentioned the convergence thing so the
the whatever the thing associated with

4204
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
the whatever the thing associated with
 

4205
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,510
the whatever the thing associated with
the disease

4206
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:57,520
the disease
 

4207
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,350
the disease
shows up so let me explain convergence

4208
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
shows up so let me explain convergence
 

4209
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,030
shows up so let me explain convergence
yeah convergence is such a beautiful

4210
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:01,040
yeah convergence is such a beautiful
 

4211
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,350
yeah convergence is such a beautiful
concept

4212
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,360
concept
 

4213
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,270
concept
so you basically have these four genes

4214
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,280
so you basically have these four genes
 

4215
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:12,229
so you basically have these four genes
that are converging on calcium signaling

4216
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:12,239
that are converging on calcium signaling
 

4217
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,709
that are converging on calcium signaling
so that basically means that they are

4218
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:14,719
so that basically means that they are
 

4219
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,390
so that basically means that they are
acting each in their own way

4220
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:16,400
acting each in their own way
 

4221
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,590
acting each in their own way
but together in the same process

4222
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:19,600
but together in the same process
 

4223
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,630
but together in the same process
but now in every one of these loci you

4224
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:22,640
but now in every one of these loci you
 

4225
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,430
but now in every one of these loci you
have

4226
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:23,440
have
 

4227
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,390
have
many enhancers controlling each of those

4228
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:26,400
many enhancers controlling each of those
 

4229
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,270
many enhancers controlling each of those
genes

4230
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:27,280
genes
 

4231
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,669
genes
that's another type of convergence where

4232
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:29,679
that's another type of convergence where
 

4233
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,189
that's another type of convergence where
dysregulation of seven different

4234
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
dysregulation of seven different
 

4235
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,070
dysregulation of seven different
enhancers

4236
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,080
enhancers
 

4237
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,630
enhancers
might all converge on this regulation of

4238
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:34,640
might all converge on this regulation of
 

4239
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,830
might all converge on this regulation of
that one gene

4240
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:35,840
that one gene
 

4241
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,910
that one gene
which then converges on calcium

4242
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:37,920
which then converges on calcium
 

4243
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,030
which then converges on calcium
signaling

4244
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:39,040
signaling
 

4245
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,030
signaling
and in each one of those enhancers you

4246
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,040
and in each one of those enhancers you
 

4247
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,430
and in each one of those enhancers you
might have multiple genetic variants

4248
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
might have multiple genetic variants
 

4249
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,390
might have multiple genetic variants
distributed across many different people

4250
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,400
distributed across many different people
 

4251
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,430
distributed across many different people
everyone

4252
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,440
everyone
 

4253
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,910
everyone
has their own different mutation but all

4254
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:49,920
has their own different mutation but all
 

4255
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,590
has their own different mutation but all
of these mutations are impacting that

4256
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:51,600
of these mutations are impacting that
 

4257
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,669
of these mutations are impacting that
enhancer and all of these enhancers are

01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:53,679
enhancer and all of these enhancers are
 

4259

impacting that gene

4260
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:54,880
impacting that gene
 

4261
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,070
impacting that gene
and all of these genes are impacting

01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,080
and all of these genes are impacting
 

4263

and all of these genes are impacting
this pathway and all these pathways are

4264
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:58,320
this pathway and all these pathways are
 

4265
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,750
this pathway and all these pathways are

acting in the same tissue
 

4267
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,750

01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,520
together on the same biological process
 

4271
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,550
together on the same biological process
of schizophrenia

4272
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
of schizophrenia
 

4273
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,669
of schizophrenia
and and you're saying the saving grace

4274
01:13:07,669 --> 01:13:07,679
and and you're saying the saving grace
 

4275
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,510
and and you're saying the saving grace
is that that conversion seems to happen

4276
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:09,520
is that that conversion seems to happen
 

4277
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,870
is that that conversion seems to happen
for a lot of these diseases

4278
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:10,880
for a lot of these diseases
 

4279
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,750
for a lot of these diseases
for all of them basically that for every

4280
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:13,760
for all of them basically that for every
 

4281
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,350
for all of them basically that for every
single disease that we've looked at

4282
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:15,360
single disease that we've looked at
 

4283
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,310
single disease that we've looked at
we have found an epigenomic enrichment

4284
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:18,320
we have found an epigenomic enrichment
 

4285
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,350
we have found an epigenomic enrichment
how do you do that

4286
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:19,360
how do you do that
 

4287
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,990
how do you do that
you basically have all of the genetic

4288
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,000
you basically have all of the genetic
 

4289
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,830
you basically have all of the genetic
variants associated with the disorder

4290
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
variants associated with the disorder
 

4291
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,350
variants associated with the disorder
and then you're asking for all of the

4292
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:25,360
and then you're asking for all of the
 

4293
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,830
and then you're asking for all of the
enhancers active in a particular tissue

4294
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
enhancers active in a particular tissue
 

4295
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,510
enhancers active in a particular tissue
for 540 disorders we've basically found

4296
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:31,520
for 540 disorders we've basically found
 

4297
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,229
for 540 disorders we've basically found
that indeed

4298
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:32,239
that indeed
 

4299
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,070
that indeed
there is an enrichment that basically

4300
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,080
there is an enrichment that basically
 

4301
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,790
there is an enrichment that basically
means that there is commonality

4302
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:36,800
means that there is commonality
 

4303
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,270
means that there is commonality
and from the commonality we can just get

4304
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:39,280
and from the commonality we can just get
 

4305
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,390
and from the commonality we can just get
insights

4306
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
insights
 

4307
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,110
insights
so to explain in mathematical terms

4308
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:43,120
so to explain in mathematical terms
 

4309
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:43,830
so to explain in mathematical terms
we're basically

4310
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:43,840
we're basically
 

4311
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,870
we're basically
building an empirical prior

4312
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:46,880
building an empirical prior
 

4313
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,270
building an empirical prior
we're using a bayesian approach to

4314
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:49,280
we're using a bayesian approach to
 

4315
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,790
we're using a bayesian approach to
basically say great all of these

4316
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:50,800
basically say great all of these
 

4317
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,510
basically say great all of these
variants

4318
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:51,520
variants
 

4319
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,550
variants
are equally likely in a particular locus

4320
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
are equally likely in a particular locus
 

4321
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,910
are equally likely in a particular locus
to be important

4322
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:55,920
to be important
 

4323
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,390
to be important
energy so in a genetic locus you

4324
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:58,400
energy so in a genetic locus you
 

4325
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,590
energy so in a genetic locus you
basically have

4326
01:13:59,590 --> 01:13:59,600
basically have
 

4327
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,470
basically have
a dozen variants that are co-inherited

4328
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:02,480
a dozen variants that are co-inherited
 

4329
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,310
a dozen variants that are co-inherited
because the way that inheritance works

4330
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:04,320
because the way that inheritance works
 

4331
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,950
because the way that inheritance works
in the human genome is through all of

4332
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:06,960
in the human genome is through all of
 

4333
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,550
in the human genome is through all of
these recombination events

4334
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:08,560
these recombination events
 

4335
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,590
these recombination events
during meiosis you basically have

4336
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:11,600
during meiosis you basically have
 

4337
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,430
during meiosis you basically have
you know you you inherit maybe three

4338
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:15,440
you know you you inherit maybe three
 

4339
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,030
you know you you inherit maybe three
chromosome three for example in your in

4340
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:17,040
chromosome three for example in your in
 

4341
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,709
chromosome three for example in your in
your body it's inherited from four

4342
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:18,719
your body it's inherited from four
 

4343
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:19,189
your body it's inherited from four
different

4344
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:19,199
different
 

4345
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:21,669
different
parts one part comes from your dad

4346
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:21,679
parts one part comes from your dad
 

4347
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,270
parts one part comes from your dad
another part comes from your mom another

4348
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,280
another part comes from your mom another
 

4349
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,550
another part comes from your mom another
part comes from your dad and other part

4350
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:24,560
part comes from your dad and other part
 

4351
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,470
part comes from your dad and other part
comes from your mom so basically

4352
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:26,480
comes from your mom so basically
 

4353
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,030
comes from your mom so basically
the way that it i'm sorry from your

4354
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:29,040
the way that it i'm sorry from your
 

4355
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,070
the way that it i'm sorry from your
mom's mom

4356
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:30,080
mom's mom
 

4357
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,310
mom's mom
so you basically have one copy that

4358
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:32,320
so you basically have one copy that
 

4359
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,510
so you basically have one copy that
comes from your dad and one copy that

4360
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:33,520
comes from your dad and one copy that
 

4361
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,310
comes from your dad and one copy that
comes from your mom

4362
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,320
comes from your mom
 

4363
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,470
comes from your mom
but that copy that you got from your mom

4364
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480
but that copy that you got from your mom
 

4365
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,590
but that copy that you got from your mom
is a mixture

4366
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:37,600
is a mixture
 

4367
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,750
is a mixture
of her maternal and her paternal

4368
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,760
of her maternal and her paternal
 

4369
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,790
of her maternal and her paternal
chromosome

4370
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:40,800
chromosome
 

4371
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,070
chromosome
and the copy that you got from your dad

4372
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080
and the copy that you got from your dad
 

4373
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,910
and the copy that you got from your dad
is a mixture of his maternal and his

4374
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:43,920
is a mixture of his maternal and his
 

4375
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,510
is a mixture of his maternal and his
paternal chromosome

4376
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:45,520
paternal chromosome
 

4377
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,310
paternal chromosome
so these break points that happen when

4378
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:48,320
so these break points that happen when
 

4379
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,669
so these break points that happen when
chromosomes are lighting up

4380
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:49,679
chromosomes are lighting up
 

4381
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,270
chromosomes are lighting up
and lining up are basically ensuring

4382
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:53,280
and lining up are basically ensuring
 

4383
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,870
and lining up are basically ensuring
through these crossover events they're

4384
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:54,880
through these crossover events they're
 

4385
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,350
through these crossover events they're
ensuring that every

4386
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:57,360
ensuring that every
 

4387
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,470
ensuring that every
uh child cell

4388
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:00,480
uh child cell
 

4389
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,550
uh child cell
during the process of meiosis where you

4390
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
during the process of meiosis where you
 

4391
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,990
during the process of meiosis where you
basically have

4392
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,000
basically have
 

4393
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,470
basically have
you know one spermatozoid that basically

4394
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:06,480
you know one spermatozoid that basically
 

4395
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,070
you know one spermatozoid that basically
couples with one oval

4396
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,080
couples with one oval
 

4397
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,390
couples with one oval
to basically create one egg to basically

4398
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:10,400
to basically create one egg to basically
 

4399
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,070
to basically create one egg to basically
create the zygote

4400
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:12,080
create the zygote
 

4401
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,030
create the zygote
you basically have half of your genome

4402
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,040
you basically have half of your genome
 

4403
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:15,910
you basically have half of your genome
that comes from that and half of your

4404
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:15,920
that comes from that and half of your
 

4405
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,030

genome that comes from mom
 

4407
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,110
genome that comes from mom
but in order to light up not line them

4408
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:19,120
but in order to light up not line them
 

4409
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,310
but in order to light up not line them
up you basically have these crossover

4410
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,320
up you basically have these crossover
 

4411
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:20,870
up you basically have these crossover
events

4412
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:20,880
events
 

4413
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,110

01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,120
these crossover events are basically
 

4415
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,510
these crossover events are basically
leading to

4416
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:24,520
leading to
 

4417
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,510
leading to
co-inheritance of that entire block

4418
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:27,520
co-inheritance of that entire block
 

4419
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,350
co-inheritance of that entire block
coming from the your maternal

01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,280
these crossover events don't happen
 

4429
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,550
these crossover events don't happen
randomly

4430
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:38,560
randomly
 

4431
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,430
randomly
there's a protein called prdm9 that

01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,440
there's a protein called prdm9 that
 

4433
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:41,990
there's a protein called prdm9 that
basically

4434
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:42,000
basically
 

4435
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,030
basically
guides the double-stranded breaks

4436
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
guides the double-stranded breaks
 

4437
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,070
guides the double-stranded breaks
and then leads to these crossovers

4438
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:48,080
and then leads to these crossovers
 

4439
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,910
and then leads to these crossovers
and that protein has a particular

4440
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:49,920
and that protein has a particular
 

4441
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,229
and that protein has a particular
preference to only a small number of hot

4442
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:52,239
preference to only a small number of hot
 

4443
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:52,870
preference to only a small number of hot
spots

4444
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:52,880
spots
 

4445
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,430
spots
of recombination which then lead to a

4446
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:55,440
of recombination which then lead to a
 

4447
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,310
of recombination which then lead to a
small number

4448
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:56,320
small number
 

4449
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,790
small number
of breaks between these co-inheritance

4450
01:15:58,790 --> 01:15:58,800
of breaks between these co-inheritance
 

4451
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,669
of breaks between these co-inheritance
patterns

4452
01:15:59,669 --> 01:15:59,679
patterns
 

4453
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,030
patterns
so even though there are six million

4454
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:01,040
so even though there are six million
 

4455
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,669
so even though there are six million
variants there are six million loci

4456
01:16:03,669 --> 01:16:03,679
variants there are six million loci
 

4457
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:06,790
variants there are six million loci
there there's you know this variation is

4458
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:06,800
there there's you know this variation is
 

4459
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,430
there there's you know this variation is
inherited in blocks

4460
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:09,440
inherited in blocks
 

4461
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,030
inherited in blocks
and every one of these blocks has like

4462
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:11,040
and every one of these blocks has like
 

4463
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,030
and every one of these blocks has like
two dozen genetic variants that are all

4464
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,040
two dozen genetic variants that are all
 

4465
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:13,990
two dozen genetic variants that are all
associated

4466
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,000
associated
 

4467
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,550
associated
so in the case of fto it wasn't just one

4468
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:16,560
so in the case of fto it wasn't just one
 

4469
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,270
so in the case of fto it wasn't just one
variant

4470
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,280
variant
 

4471
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,470
variant
it was 89 common variants that were all

4472
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480
it was 89 common variants that were all
 

4473
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,070
it was 89 common variants that were all
humongously associated with obesity

4474
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,080
humongously associated with obesity
 

4475
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,630
humongously associated with obesity
which ones of those is the important one

4476
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:26,640
which ones of those is the important one
 

4477
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,229
which ones of those is the important one
well if you look at only one locus you

4478
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
well if you look at only one locus you
 

4479
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,430
well if you look at only one locus you
have no idea

4480
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
have no idea
 

4481
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,070
have no idea
but if you look at many loci you

4482
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:32,080
but if you look at many loci you
 

4483
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,470
but if you look at many loci you
basically say aha

4484
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:34,480
basically say aha
 

4485
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,750
basically say aha
all of them are enriching in the same

4486
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:37,760
all of them are enriching in the same
 

4487
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,950
all of them are enriching in the same
epigenomic map in that particular case

4488
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:40,960
epigenomic map in that particular case
 

4489
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:41,669
epigenomic map in that particular case
it was

4490
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:41,679
it was
 

4491
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:44,550
it was
mesenchymal stem cells so these are the

4492
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
mesenchymal stem cells so these are the
 

4493
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,750
mesenchymal stem cells so these are the
progenitor cells

4494
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
progenitor cells
 

4495
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,790
progenitor cells
that give rise to your brown fat

4496
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:48,800
that give rise to your brown fat
 

4497
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,510
that give rise to your brown fat
and your white fat progenitor is like

4498
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:51,520
and your white fat progenitor is like
 

4499
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,830
and your white fat progenitor is like
the early on developmental substance

4500
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:53,840
the early on developmental substance
 

4501
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,310
the early on developmental substance
so you start from one zygote and that's

4502
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,320
so you start from one zygote and that's
 

4503
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,430
so you start from one zygote and that's
a totipotent

4504
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:57,440
a totipotent
 

4505
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,790
a totipotent
cell type it can do anything you then

4506
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:00,800
cell type it can do anything you then
 

4507
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,709
cell type it can do anything you then
differ you know that cell divides

4508
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:02,719
differ you know that cell divides
 

4509
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,149
differ you know that cell divides
divides divides

4510
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:04,159
divides divides
 

4511
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:07,750
divides divides
and then every cell division is

4512
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:07,760
and then every cell division is
 

4513
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,790
and then every cell division is
leading to specialization where you now

4514
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:10,800
leading to specialization where you now
 

4515
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,350
leading to specialization where you now
have

4516
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:11,360
have
 

4517
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,669
have
a mesodermal lineage and ectodermal

4518
01:17:13,669 --> 01:17:13,679
a mesodermal lineage and ectodermal
 

4519
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,430
a mesodermal lineage and ectodermal
lineage and endodermal lineage

4520
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:15,440
lineage and endodermal lineage
 

4521
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,350
lineage and endodermal lineage
that basically leads to different parts

4522
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:17,360
that basically leads to different parts
 

4523
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,110
that basically leads to different parts
of your day or your body

4524
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:19,120
of your day or your body
 

4525
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,270
of your day or your body
the ectoderm will basically give rise to

4526
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:21,280
the ectoderm will basically give rise to
 

4527
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,149
the ectoderm will basically give rise to
your skin

4528
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:22,159
your skin
 

4529
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:25,669
your skin
ecto means outside derm is skin

4530
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:25,679
ecto means outside derm is skin
 

4531
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,990
ecto means outside derm is skin
so ectoderm but it also gives rise to

4532
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:28,000
so ectoderm but it also gives rise to
 

4533
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,590
so ectoderm but it also gives rise to
your neurons and your whole brain so

4534
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:29,600
your neurons and your whole brain so
 

4535
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:29,990
your neurons and your whole brain so
that's a lot

4536
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:30,000
that's a lot
 

4537
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,790
that's a lot
of ectoderm mesoderm gives rise to your

4538
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
of ectoderm mesoderm gives rise to your
 

4539
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,750
of ectoderm mesoderm gives rise to your
internal organs

4540
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:33,760
internal organs
 

4541
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,630
internal organs
including the vasculature and you know

4542
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:36,640
including the vasculature and you know
 

4543
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,229
including the vasculature and you know
your muscle and stuff like that

4544
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:38,239
your muscle and stuff like that
 

4545
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,510
your muscle and stuff like that
so you basically have this progressive

4546
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:41,520
so you basically have this progressive
 

4547
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,030
so you basically have this progressive
differentiation

4548
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:43,040
differentiation
 

4549
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,790
differentiation
and then if you look further further

4550
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
and then if you look further further
 

4551
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,709
and then if you look further further
down that lineage you basically have one

4552
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:46,719
down that lineage you basically have one
 

4553
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:48,550
down that lineage you basically have one
lineage that will give rise to both your

4554
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
lineage that will give rise to both your
 

4555
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,430
lineage that will give rise to both your
muscle

4556
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:49,440
muscle
 

4557
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,630
muscle
and your bone but also your fat

4558
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:52,640
and your bone but also your fat
 

4559
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,310
and your bone but also your fat
and if you go further down the lineage

4560
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:54,320
and if you go further down the lineage
 

4561
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,669
and if you go further down the lineage
of your fat

4562
01:17:55,669 --> 01:17:55,679
of your fat
 

4563
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,790
of your fat
you basically have your white fat cells

4564
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:58,800
you basically have your white fat cells
 

4565
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,590
you basically have your white fat cells
these are the cells that store energy so

4566
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:01,600
these are the cells that store energy so
 

4567
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,950
these are the cells that store energy so
when you eat a lot but you don't

4568
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:02,960
when you eat a lot but you don't
 

4569
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,110
when you eat a lot but you don't
exercise too much there's an excess

4570
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:05,120
exercise too much there's an excess
 

4571
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,350
exercise too much there's an excess
a set of calories a lot excess energy

4572
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:07,360
a set of calories a lot excess energy
 

4573
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,470
a set of calories a lot excess energy
what you do with those

4574
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:08,480
what you do with those
 

4575
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,630
what you do with those
you basically create you spend a lot of

4576
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:10,640
you basically create you spend a lot of
 

4577
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,390
you basically create you spend a lot of
that energy to create these high-energy

4578
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,400
that energy to create these high-energy
 

4579
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,189
that energy to create these high-energy
molecules

4580
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
molecules
 

4581
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,390
molecules
lipids which you can then

4582
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:16,400
lipids which you can then
 

4583
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,669
lipids which you can then
burn when you need them on a rainy day

4584
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:19,679
burn when you need them on a rainy day
 

4585
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:21,830
burn when you need them on a rainy day
so that leads to obesity if you don't

4586
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:21,840
so that leads to obesity if you don't
 

4587
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,149
so that leads to obesity if you don't
exercise and if you overeat

4588
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
exercise and if you overeat
 

4589
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,870
exercise and if you overeat
because your body is like oh great i

4590
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:26,880
because your body is like oh great i
 

4591
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,910
because your body is like oh great i
have all these calories i'm going to

4592
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:27,920
have all these calories i'm going to
 

4593
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,709
have all these calories i'm going to
store them

4594
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:28,719
store them
 

4595
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:29,910
store them
more calories i'm going to store them

4596
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:29,920
more calories i'm going to store them
 

4597
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,070
more calories i'm going to store them
too oh more calories and

4598
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:32,080
too oh more calories and
 

4599
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,870
too oh more calories and
the you know 42 of european chromosomes

4600
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:36,880
the you know 42 of european chromosomes
 

4601
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,990
the you know 42 of european chromosomes
have a predisposition to storing fat

4602
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:40,000
have a predisposition to storing fat
 

4603
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,669
have a predisposition to storing fat
which was selected probably in

4604
01:18:43,669 --> 01:18:43,679
which was selected probably in
 

4605
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,870
which was selected probably in
the you know food scarcity periods

4606
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:46,880
the you know food scarcity periods
 

4607
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,750
the you know food scarcity periods
like basically as we were exiting africa

4608
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:49,760
like basically as we were exiting africa
 

4609
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,229
like basically as we were exiting africa
you know before and during the ice ages

4610
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
you know before and during the ice ages
 

4611
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:53,590
you know before and during the ice ages
you know there was probably a selection

4612
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:53,600
you know there was probably a selection
 

4613
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,590
you know there was probably a selection
to those individuals who made it north

4614
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:55,600
to those individuals who made it north
 

4615
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,709
to those individuals who made it north
to basically be able to store energy you

4616
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
to basically be able to store energy you
 

4617
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,709
to basically be able to store energy you
know a lot more energy

4618
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
know a lot more energy
 

4619
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,750
know a lot more energy
so you basically now have this lineage

4620
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:03,760
so you basically now have this lineage
 

4621
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,149
so you basically now have this lineage
that is deciding whether you want to

4622
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:06,159
that is deciding whether you want to
 

4623
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,229
that is deciding whether you want to
store energy in your white fat

4624
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:08,239
store energy in your white fat
 

4625
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,350
store energy in your white fat
or burn energy in your base fat

4626
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:11,360
or burn energy in your base fat
 

4627
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,310
or burn energy in your base fat
it turns out that your fat is you know

4628
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:14,320
it turns out that your fat is you know
 

4629
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:14,709
it turns out that your fat is you know
we

4630
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:14,719
we
 

4631
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:18,390
we
like we we have such a bad view of fat

4632
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
like we we have such a bad view of fat
 

4633
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,910
like we we have such a bad view of fat
fat is your best friend

4634
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:19,920
fat is your best friend
 

4635
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,470
fat is your best friend
fat can both store all these excess

4636
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,480
fat can both store all these excess
 

4637
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,750
fat can both store all these excess
lipids that would be otherwise

4638
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:23,760
lipids that would be otherwise
 

4639
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,030
lipids that would be otherwise
circulating through your

4640
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:25,040
circulating through your
 

4641
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,910
circulating through your
you know body and causing damage but it

4642
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:27,920
you know body and causing damage but it
 

4643
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,750
you know body and causing damage but it
can also burn calories directly

4644
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:29,760
can also burn calories directly
 

4645
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,270
can also burn calories directly
if you have too much of energy you can

4646
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:33,280
if you have too much of energy you can
 

4647
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,030
if you have too much of energy you can
just choose to just burn some of that as

4648
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:35,040
just choose to just burn some of that as
 

4649
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:35,990
just choose to just burn some of that as
heat

4650
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,000
heat
 

4651
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,070
heat
so basically when you're cold you're

4652
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:38,080
so basically when you're cold you're
 

4653
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,430
so basically when you're cold you're
burning energy

4654
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:39,440
burning energy
 

4655
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,110
burning energy
to basically warm your body up and

4656
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:41,120
to basically warm your body up and
 

4657
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,229
to basically warm your body up and
you're burning all these lipids and

4658
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:42,239
you're burning all these lipids and
 

4659
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,390
you're burning all these lipids and
you're burning all these scatters

4660
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:44,400
you're burning all these scatters
 

4661
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,110
you're burning all these scatters
so what we basically found is that

4662
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:47,120
so what we basically found is that
 

4663
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,630
so what we basically found is that
across the board

4664
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:48,640
across the board
 

4665
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,390
across the board
genetic variants associated with obesity

4666
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
genetic variants associated with obesity
 

4667
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,310
genetic variants associated with obesity
across many of these regions were all

4668
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:52,320
across many of these regions were all
 

4669
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,110
across many of these regions were all
enriched

4670
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:53,120
enriched
 

4671
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,229

repeatedly in mesenchymal

4672
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
repeatedly in mesenchymal
 

4673
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:59,030
repeatedly in mesenchymal
stem cell enhancers so that gave us a

4674
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
stem cell enhancers so that gave us a
 

4675
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,630
stem cell enhancers so that gave us a
hint as to which of these genetic

4676
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:00,640
hint as to which of these genetic
 

4677
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,910
hint as to which of these genetic
variants

4678
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:01,920

4679
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,550
variants
was likely driving this whole

4680
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:04,560
was likely driving this whole
 

4681
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,750
was likely driving this whole
association

4682
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
association
 

4683
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,310
association
and we ended up with this one genetic

4684
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:08,320
and we ended up with this one genetic
 

4685
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,270
and we ended up with this one genetic
variant

4686
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:09,280
variant
 

4687
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:14,149
variant
called rs1421085

4688
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
called rs1421085
 

4689
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:17,189
called rs1421085
and that genetic variant out of the 89

4690
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:17,199
and that genetic variant out of the 89
 

4691
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,030
and that genetic variant out of the 89
was the one that we predicted to be

4692
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:19,040
was the one that we predicted to be
 

4693
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,270
was the one that we predicted to be
causal for the disease

4694
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:21,280
causal for the disease
 

4695
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,350
causal for the disease
wow so going back to those steps first

4696
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,360
wow so going back to those steps first
 

4697
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,750
wow so going back to those steps first
step is figure out the relevant tissue

4698
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:25,760
step is figure out the relevant tissue
 

4699
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,910
step is figure out the relevant tissue
based on the global enrichment second

01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:27,920
based on the global enrichment second
 

4701
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,709
based on the global enrichment second
step is figure out the causal variant

4702
01:20:30,709 --> 01:20:30,719
step is figure out the causal variant
 

4703
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:33,910
step is figure out the causal variant
among many variants in this linkage

4704
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:33,920
among many variants in this linkage

that's the second step the third step is

4716
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,040
that's the second step the third step is
 

4717
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,510
that's the second step the third step is
once you know that causal variant

4718
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:47,520
once you know that causal variant
 

4719
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,070
once you know that causal variant
try to figure out what is the motif that

4720
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:50,080
try to figure out what is the motif that
 

4721
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,430
try to figure out what is the motif that
is disrupted

4722
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:51,440
is disrupted
 

4723
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,870
is disrupted
by that causal variant basically how

4724
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:52,880
by that causal variant basically how
 

4725
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,270
by that causal variant basically how
does it act variants don't just disrupt

4726
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:55,280
does it act variants don't just disrupt
 

4727
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:55,910
does it act variants don't just disrupt
elements

4728
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:55,920
elements
 

4729
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,229
elements
they disrupt the binding of specific

4730
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:58,239
they disrupt the binding of specific
 

4731
01:20:58,239 --> 01:20:59,270
they disrupt the binding of specific
regulators

4732
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,280
regulators
 

4733
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,870
regulators
so basically the third step there was

4734
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:00,880
so basically the third step there was
 

4735
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,870
so basically the third step there was
how do you find the motif

4736
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
how do you find the motif
 

4737
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,270
how do you find the motif
that is responsible like the gene

4738
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:05,280
that is responsible like the gene
 

4739
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,229
that is responsible like the gene
regulatory

4740
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
regulatory
 

4741
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,910
regulatory
word the building block of gene

4742
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:07,920
word the building block of gene
 

4743
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,310
word the building block of gene
regulation that is responsible

4744
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
regulation that is responsible
 

4745
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,550
regulation that is responsible
for that disregulatory event and the

4746
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:12,560
for that disregulatory event and the
 

4747
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,229
for that disregulatory event and the
fourth step is finding out what

4748
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:14,239
fourth step is finding out what
 

4749
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:17,189
fourth step is finding out what
regulator normally binds that motif and

4750
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:17,199
regulator normally binds that motif and
 

4751
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:17,750
regulator normally binds that motif and
is now

4752
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,760
is now
 

4753
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,390
is now
no longer able to bind and then once you

4754
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
no longer able to bind and then once you
 

4755
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,149
no longer able to bind and then once you
have the regulator can you then try to

4756
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:22,159
have the regulator can you then try to
 

4757
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,669
have the regulator can you then try to
figure out how to

4758
01:21:23,669 --> 01:21:23,679
figure out how to
 

4759
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,950
figure out how to

4760
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:26,960
what uh after it developed how to fix it
 

4761
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,510
what uh after it developed how to fix it
that's exactly right you now know how to

4762
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
that's exactly right you now know how to
 

4763
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,350
that's exactly right you now know how to
intervene you have basically

4764
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:31,360
intervene you have basically
 

4765
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,270
intervene you have basically
a regulator you have a gene that you can

4766
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:33,280
a regulator you have a gene that you can
 

4767
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,110
a regulator you have a gene that you can
then perturb and you say well maybe that

4768
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:35,120
then perturb and you say well maybe that
 

4769
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,070
then perturb and you say well maybe that
regulator

4770
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
regulator
 

4771
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,870

has a global role in obesity i can

4772
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
has a global role in obesity i can
 

4773
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,070
has a global role in obesity i can
perturb the regulator

4774
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:40,080
perturb the regulator
 

4775
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,910
perturb the regulator
just to clarify when we say perturb like

4776
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:43,920
just to clarify when we say perturb like
 

4777
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,790
just to clarify when we say perturb like

01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:50,480
of course of course yeah so i guess her
 

4783
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,189
of course of course yeah so i guess her
understanding is the first step

4784
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:53,199
understanding is the first step
 

4785
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,030
understanding is the first step
no no but perturbed basically means you

4786
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:55,040
no no but perturbed basically means you
 

4787
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,870
no no but perturbed basically means you
now develop therapeutics pharmaceutical

4788
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:56,880
now develop therapeutics pharmaceutical
 

4789
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,030
now develop therapeutics pharmaceutical
therapeutics against that

4790
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
therapeutics against that
 

4791
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,390
therapeutics against that
or you develop other types of

4792
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400
or you develop other types of
 

4793
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,070
or you develop other types of
intervention that affect the expression

4794
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,080
intervention that affect the expression
 

4795
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,590
intervention that affect the expression
of that gene

4796
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:03,600
of that gene
 

4797
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,990
of that gene
what do uh pharmaceutical therapeutics

4798
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:06,000
what do uh pharmaceutical therapeutics
 

4799
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,750
what do uh pharmaceutical therapeutics
look like

4800
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:07,760
look like
 

4801
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,550
look like
when your understandings in a genetic

4802
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,560
when your understandings in a genetic
 

4803
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,189
when your understandings in a genetic
level

4804
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:11,199
level
 

4805
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,110
level
yeah sorry if it's a dumb question no no

4806
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:13,120
yeah sorry if it's a dumb question no no
 

4807
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,629
yeah sorry if it's a dumb question no no
it's a brilliant question but i want to

4808
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:14,639
it's a brilliant question but i want to
 

4809
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:15,990
it's a brilliant question but i want to
save it for a little bit later when we

4810
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
save it for a little bit later when we
 

4811
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,510
save it for a little bit later when we
start talking about therapeutics

4812
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,520
start talking about therapeutics
 

4813
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,870
start talking about therapeutics
perfect we've talked about the first

4814
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:18,880
perfect we've talked about the first
 

4815
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,350
perfect we've talked about the first
four steps there's two more

4816
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:21,360
four steps there's two more
 

4817
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,270
four steps there's two more
so basically the first step is figure

4818
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:23,280
so basically the first step is figure
 

4819
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,270
so basically the first step is figure
out i mean the zeroth step the starting

4820
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:25,280
out i mean the zeroth step the starting
 

4821
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,550
out i mean the zeroth step the starting
point is the genetics

4822
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:26,560
point is the genetics
 

4823
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,189
point is the genetics
the first step after that is figure out

4824
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:29,199
the first step after that is figure out
 

4825
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,870
the first step after that is figure out
the tissue of action

4826
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:30,880
the tissue of action
 

4827
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,270
the tissue of action
the second step is figuring out the

4828
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:33,280
the second step is figuring out the
 

4829
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,070
the second step is figuring out the
nucleotide

4830
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:34,080
nucleotide
 

4831
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,750
nucleotide
that is responsible or set of

4832
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:35,760
that is responsible or set of
 

4833
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,750
that is responsible or set of
nucleotides the third step is figure out

4834
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:37,760
nucleotides the third step is figure out
 

4835
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,550
nucleotides the third step is figure out
the motif

4836
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:38,560
the motif
 

4837
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,629
the motif
and the upstream regulator number four

4838
01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:40,639
and the upstream regulator number four
 

4839
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:41,910
and the upstream regulator number four
number five and six

4840
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:41,920
number five and six
 

4841
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,870
number five and six
is what are the targets so number five

4842
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:44,880
is what are the targets so number five
 

4843
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,590
is what are the targets so number five
is great

4844
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:45,600
is great
 

4845
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,430
is great
now i know the regulator i know the

4846
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:47,440
now i know the regulator i know the
 

4847
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,270
now i know the regulator i know the
motif i know the tissue

4848
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:49,280
motif i know the tissue
 

4849
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,669
motif i know the tissue
and i know the variant what does it

4850
01:22:51,669 --> 01:22:51,679
and i know the variant what does it
 

4851
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,189
and i know the variant what does it
actually do

4852
01:22:53,189 --> 01:22:53,199
actually do
 

4853
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:54,950
actually do
so you have to now trace it to the

4854
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960
so you have to now trace it to the
 

4855
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,790
so you have to now trace it to the
biological process

4856
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:56,800
biological process
 

4857
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,709
biological process
and the genes that mediate that

4858
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:58,719
and the genes that mediate that
 

4859
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,229
and the genes that mediate that
biological process

4860
01:23:00,229 --> 01:23:00,239
biological process
 

4861
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:03,189
biological process
so knowing all of this can now allow you

4862
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
so knowing all of this can now allow you
 

4863
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,270
so knowing all of this can now allow you
to find the target genes

4864
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
to find the target genes
 

4865
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,669
to find the target genes
how by basically doing perturbation

4866
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:07,679
how by basically doing perturbation
 

4867
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:08,790
how by basically doing perturbation
experiments

4868
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
experiments
 

4869
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,910
experiments
or by looking at the folding of the

4870
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:11,920
or by looking at the folding of the
 

4871
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,350
or by looking at the folding of the
epigenome or by looking at the genetic

4872
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:15,360
epigenome or by looking at the genetic
 

4873
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,669
epigenome or by looking at the genetic
impact of that genetic variant on the

4874
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:17,679
impact of that genetic variant on the
 

4875
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,189
impact of that genetic variant on the
expression of genes

4876
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
expression of genes
 

4877
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,910
expression of genes
and we use all three so let me go

4878
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:21,920
and we use all three so let me go
 

4879
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:22,390
and we use all three so let me go
through them

4880
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:22,400
through them
 

4881
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,149
through them
basically one of them is physical links

4882
01:23:26,149 --> 01:23:26,159
basically one of them is physical links
 

4883
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,310
basically one of them is physical links
this is the folding of the genome onto

4884
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:28,320
this is the folding of the genome onto
 

4885
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,669
this is the folding of the genome onto
itself

4886
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:29,679
itself
 

4887
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,910
itself
how do you even figure out the folding

4888
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:31,920
how do you even figure out the folding
 

4889
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,510
how do you even figure out the folding
it's a little bit of a tangent but it's

4890
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:33,520
it's a little bit of a tangent but it's
 

4891
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,470
it's a little bit of a tangent but it's
a super awesome technology

4892
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
a super awesome technology
 

4893
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,350
a super awesome technology
think of the genome as again this

4894
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:39,360
think of the genome as again this
 

4895
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,270
think of the genome as again this
massive packaging that we talked about

4896
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,280
massive packaging that we talked about
 

4897
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,590
massive packaging that we talked about
of taking two meters worth of dna and

4898
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:43,600
of taking two meters worth of dna and
 

4899
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,310
of taking two meters worth of dna and
putting it

4900
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:44,320
putting it
 

4901
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,350
putting it
in something that's a million times

4902
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:47,360
in something that's a million times
 

4903
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,510
in something that's a million times
smaller than 2 meters worth of dna

4904
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:49,520
smaller than 2 meters worth of dna
 

4905
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,510
smaller than 2 meters worth of dna
that's a single cell

4906
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,520
that's a single cell
 

4907
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,790
that's a single cell
you basically have this massive

4908
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:52,800
you basically have this massive
 

4909
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,790
you basically have this massive
packaging and this packaging basically

4910
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:54,800
packaging and this packaging basically
 

4911
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,990
packaging and this packaging basically
leads to

4912
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:56,000
leads to
 

4913
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,790
leads to
the chromosome being wrapped around in

4914
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
the chromosome being wrapped around in
 

4915
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,350
the chromosome being wrapped around in
sort of

4916
01:23:59,350 --> 01:23:59,360
sort of
 

4917
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,629
sort of
tight ways in ways however that are

4918
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
tight ways in ways however that are
 

4919
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:03,430
tight ways in ways however that are
functionally

4920
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:03,440
functionally

capable of being reopened and reclosed
 

4923
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,470
capable of being reopened and reclosed
so i can then go in and figure out that

4924
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:10,480
so i can then go in and figure out that
 

4925
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,350

that means they were interacting even

4948
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,080
that means they were interacting even
 

4949
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,669
that means they were interacting even
though they were far away on the genome

4950
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:31,679
though they were far away on the genome
 

4951
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,350
though they were far away on the genome
itself

4952
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:33,360
itself
 

4953
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,990
itself
so that chopping up sequencing and

4954
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,000
so that chopping up sequencing and
 

4955
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,430
so that chopping up sequencing and
re-gluing

4956
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:37,440
re-gluing
 

4957
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,510
re-gluing
is basically giving you folds

4958
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:41,520
is basically giving you folds
 

4959
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,629
is basically giving you folds
of the genome that we said

4960
01:24:44,629 --> 01:24:44,639
of the genome that we said
 

4961
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:47,910
of the genome that we said
how does cutting it help you figure out

4962
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:47,920
how does cutting it help you figure out
 

4963
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,830
how does cutting it help you figure out
which ones were close in the original

4964
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:49,840
which ones were close in the original
 

4965
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,270
which ones were close in the original
folding so you have a

4966
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:51,280
folding so you have a
 

4967
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,390
folding so you have a
bowl of noodles go on

4968
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:54,400
bowl of noodles go on
 

4969
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,189
bowl of noodles go on
and in that bowl of noodles some some

4970
01:24:57,189 --> 01:24:57,199
and in that bowl of noodles some some
 

4971
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:58,470
and in that bowl of noodles some some
noodles are

4972
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:58,480
noodles are
 

4973
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,870
noodles are
near each other yes so throw in a bunch

4974
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:00,880
near each other yes so throw in a bunch
 

4975
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,629
near each other yes so throw in a bunch
of glue

4976
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:02,639
of glue
 

4977
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,470
of glue
you basically freeze the noodles in

4978
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:04,480
you basically freeze the noodles in
 

4979
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,030
you basically freeze the noodles in
place throw in a cutter that chops up

4980
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,040
place throw in a cutter that chops up
 

4981
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,709
place throw in a cutter that chops up
the noodles into the little pieces

4982
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:10,719

 

4983
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,390

now throw in some ligation enzyme that

4984
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:14,400
now throw in some ligation enzyme that
 

4985
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,189
now throw in some ligation enzyme that
lets those pieces that were free

4986
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:17,199
lets those pieces that were free
 

4987
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:18,950
lets those pieces that were free
re-ligate near each other

4988
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:18,960
re-ligate near each other
 

4989
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,350
re-ligate near each other
in some cases they re-ligate what you

4990
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:21,360
in some cases they re-ligate what you
 

4991
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,470
in some cases they re-ligate what you
had just got

4992
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
had just got
 

4993
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,950
had just got
but that's very rare most of the time

4994
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:24,960
but that's very rare most of the time
 

4995
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,629
but that's very rare most of the time
they will re-ligate

4996
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:26,639
they will re-ligate
 

4997
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,149
they will re-ligate
in whatever was proximal

4998
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
in whatever was proximal
 

4999
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,950
in whatever was proximal
you now have glued the red noodle that

5000
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:32,960
you now have glued the red noodle that
 

5001
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:33,750
you now have glued the red noodle that
was crossing the

5002
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:33,760
was crossing the
 

5003
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,189
was crossing the
blue noodle to each other you then

5004
01:25:37,189 --> 01:25:37,199
blue noodle to each other you then
 

5005
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:40,229
blue noodle to each other you then
reverse the glue the glue goes away and

5006
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:40,239
reverse the glue the glue goes away and
 

5007
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:42,709
reverse the glue the glue goes away and
you just sequence the heck out of it

5008
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
you just sequence the heck out of it
 

5009
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:45,110
you just sequence the heck out of it
most of the time you'll find red segment

5010
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:45,120
most of the time you'll find red segment
 

5011
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,070
most of the time you'll find red segment
with

5012
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,080
with
 

5013
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,070
with
you know red segment but you can

5014
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:48,080
you know red segment but you can
 

5015
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,070
you know red segment but you can
specifically select for ligation events

5016
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:50,080
specifically select for ligation events
 

5017
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:50,950
specifically select for ligation events
that have happened

5018
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:50,960
that have happened
 

5019
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,470
that have happened
that were not from the same segment by

5020
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,480
that were not from the same segment by
 

5021
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,310
that were not from the same segment by
sort of marking a particular way

5022
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:54,320
sort of marking a particular way
 

5023
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,790
sort of marking a particular way
and then selecting those and then your

5024
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:56,800
and then selecting those and then your
 

5025
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,070
and then selecting those and then your
sequencing you look for

5026
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,080
sequencing you look for
 

5027
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,709
sequencing you look for
red with blue matches of sort of things

5028
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:00,719
red with blue matches of sort of things
 

5029
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:01,669
red with blue matches of sort of things
that were glued

5030
01:26:01,669 --> 01:26:01,679
that were glued
 

5031
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,990
that were glued
that were not immediate proximal to each

5032
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,000
that were not immediate proximal to each
 

5033
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,270
that were not immediate proximal to each
other

5034
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
other
 

5035
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,350
other
and that reveals the linking of the blue

5036
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,360
and that reveals the linking of the blue
 

5037
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,390
and that reveals the linking of the blue
noodle and the red noodle

5038
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,400
noodle and the red noodle
 

5039
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,629
noodle and the red noodle
you're with me so far yeah good so we

5040
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:10,639
you're with me so far yeah good so we
 

5041
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:11,669
you're with me so far yeah good so we
you know we've done these experiments

5042
01:26:11,669 --> 01:26:11,679
you know we've done these experiments
 

5043
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,270
you know we've done these experiments
physical

5044
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:13,280
physical
 

5045
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,870

that's the physical that's step one of

5046
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:14,880
that's the physical that's step one of
 

5047
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,629
that's the physical that's step one of
the physical and what what the physical

5048
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:16,639
the physical and what what the physical
 

5049
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,390
the physical and what what the physical
revealed is topologically associated

5050
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:18,400
revealed is topologically associated
 

5051
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,990
revealed is topologically associated
domains basically big blocks of the

5052
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:20,000
domains basically big blocks of the
 

5053
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,629
domains basically big blocks of the
genome

5054
01:26:20,629 --> 01:26:20,639
genome
 

5055
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,870
genome
that are topologically don't you know

5056
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
that are topologically don't you know
 

5057
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,709
that are topologically don't you know
connected together

5058
01:26:24,709 --> 01:26:24,719
connected together
 

5059
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:27,270
connected together
that's the physical the second one is

5060
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:27,280
that's the physical the second one is
 

5061
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:27,750
that's the physical the second one is
the

5062
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:27,760
the
 

5063
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,350
the
genetic links it basically says

5064
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:31,360
genetic links it basically says
 

5065
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,750
genetic links it basically says
across individuals that have different

5066
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:33,760
across individuals that have different
 

5067
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,830
across individuals that have different

5069
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,070
genetic
variants how are their genes expressed

5070
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,080
variants how are their genes expressed
 

5071
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,950
variants how are their genes expressed
differently

5072
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:38,960
differently
 

5073
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,390
differently
remember before i was saying that the

5074
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:40,400
remember before i was saying that the
 

5075
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,910
remember before i was saying that the
path between genetics and disease is

5076
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:41,920
path between genetics and disease is
 

5077
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,790
path between genetics and disease is
enormous

5078
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:42,800
enormous
 

5079
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,229
enormous
but we can break it up to look at the

5080
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:44,239
but we can break it up to look at the
 

5081
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:45,830
but we can break it up to look at the
path between genetics and

5082
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:45,840
path between genetics and
 

5083
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,470
path between genetics and
gene expression so instead of using

5084
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:48,480
gene expression so instead of using
 

5085
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,990
gene expression so instead of using
alzheimer's as a phenotype

5086
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:50,000
alzheimer's as a phenotype
 

5087
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,189
alzheimer's as a phenotype
i can now use expression of irx3 as the

5088
01:26:53,189 --> 01:26:53,199
i can now use expression of irx3 as the
 

5089
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:53,990
i can now use expression of irx3 as the
phenotype

5090
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:54,000
phenotype
 

5091
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,790
phenotype
expression of gene a and i can look at

5092
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:56,800
expression of gene a and i can look at
 

5093
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,510
expression of gene a and i can look at
all of the g

5094
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:57,520
all of the g
 

5095
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,470
all of the g
all of the humans who contain a g at

5096
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:00,480
all of the humans who contain a g at
 

5097
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,830
all of the humans who contain a g at
that location and all the humans will

5098
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:01,840
that location and all the humans will
 

5099
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,550
that location and all the humans will
contain a t

5100
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:02,560
contain a t
 

5101
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,030
contain a t
at that location and basically say wow

5102
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,040
at that location and basically say wow
 

5103
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,149
at that location and basically say wow
turns out that the expression of this

5104
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:06,159
turns out that the expression of this
 

5105
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,270
turns out that the expression of this
gene is higher

5106
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:07,280
gene is higher
 

5107
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,270
gene is higher
for the t humans than for the g humans

5108
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,280
for the t humans than for the g humans
 

5109
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,390
for the t humans than for the g humans
at that location

5110
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:10,400
at that location
 

5111
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,990
at that location
so that basically gives me a genetic

5112
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:12,000
so that basically gives me a genetic
 

5113
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,470
so that basically gives me a genetic
link between a genetic variant

5114
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:14,480
link between a genetic variant
 

5115
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,750
link between a genetic variant
a locus or region and the expression of

5116
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:17,760
a locus or region and the expression of
 

5117
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,870
a locus or region and the expression of
nearby genes good on the genetic link

5118
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:20,880
nearby genes good on the genetic link
 

5119
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,350
nearby genes good on the genetic link
i think so awesome so the third link is

5120
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,360
i think so awesome so the third link is
 

5121
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,110
i think so awesome so the third link is
the activity link

5122
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:25,120
the activity link
 

5123
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,790
the activity link
what's an activity link it basically

5124
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:26,800
what's an activity link it basically
 

5125
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,590
what's an activity link it basically
says if i look across 833 different

5126
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:29,600
says if i look across 833 different
 

5127
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,030
says if i look across 833 different
epigenomes

5128
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:31,040
epigenomes
 

5129
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,070
epigenomes
whenever these enhancer is active

5130
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:34,080
whenever these enhancer is active
 

5131
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,470
whenever these enhancer is active
this gene is active that gives me an

5132
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:36,480
this gene is active that gives me an
 

5133
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,430
this gene is active that gives me an
activity link

5134
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
activity link
 

5135
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,229
activity link
between this region of the dna and that

5136
01:27:40,229 --> 01:27:40,239
between this region of the dna and that
 

5137
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,070
between this region of the dna and that
gene

5138
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:42,080
gene
 

5139
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,750
gene
and then the fourth one is perturbations

5140
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:43,760
and then the fourth one is perturbations
 

5141
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,430
and then the fourth one is perturbations
where i can go in and

5142
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:45,440
where i can go in and
 

5143
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,110
where i can go in and
you know blow up that region and see

5144
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,120
you know blow up that region and see
 

5145
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,310
you know blow up that region and see
what are the genes that change in

5146
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:48,320
what are the genes that change in
 

5147
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,189
what are the genes that change in
expression

5148
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:49,199
expression
 

5149
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,430
expression
or i can go in and over activate that

5150
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:51,440
or i can go in and over activate that
 

5151
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,790
or i can go in and over activate that
region and see what genes

5152
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:52,800
region and see what genes
 

5153
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,350
region and see what genes
change in expression uh so i guess

5154
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,360
change in expression uh so i guess
 

5155
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:55,830
change in expression uh so i guess
that's

5156
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
that's
 

5157
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,030
that's
similar to activity yeah yeah so that's

5158
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,040
similar to activity yeah yeah so that's
 

5159
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,310
similar to activity yeah yeah so that's
basically it's similar to activity i

5160
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:00,320
basically it's similar to activity i
 

5161
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,990
basically it's similar to activity i
agree but it's causal rather than

5162
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:02,000
agree but it's causal rather than
 

5163
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,110
agree but it's causal rather than
correlational

5164
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,120
correlational
 

5165
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,669
correlational
again i'm i'm a little weird like no no

5166
01:28:05,669 --> 01:28:05,679
again i'm i'm a little weird like no no
 

5167
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:06,950
again i'm i'm a little weird like no no
you're 100 on

5168
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
you're 100 on
 

5169
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,149
you're 100 on
it's exactly the same but the

5170
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,159
it's exactly the same but the
 

5171
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:11,110
it's exactly the same but the
perturbation where i go and intervene

5172
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:11,120
perturbation where i go and intervene
 

5173
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,070
perturbation where i go and intervene
yes i basically take a bunch of cells so

5174
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:14,080
yes i basically take a bunch of cells so
 

5175
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,270
yes i basically take a bunch of cells so
you know crispr

5176
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:15,280
you know crispr
 

5177
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,430
you know crispr
right crispr is this genome guidance and

5178
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:19,440
right crispr is this genome guidance and
 

5179
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,070
right crispr is this genome guidance and
cutting

5180
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:20,080
cutting
 

5181
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,870
cutting
mechanism it's what george like likes to

5182
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:22,880

5185
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:25,590
call
genome vandalism so you basically are

5186
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:25,600
genome vandalism so you basically are
 

5187
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,030
genome vandalism so you basically are
able to

5188
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,040
able to
 

5189
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:30,070
able to
one you can basically take a

5190
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:30,080
one you can basically take a
 

5191
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:33,590
one you can basically take a
guide rna that you put into the crispr

5192
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:33,600
guide rna that you put into the crispr
 

5193
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,270
guide rna that you put into the crispr
system and the crispr system will

5194
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:35,280
system and the crispr system will
 

5195
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,110
system and the crispr system will
basically use this guide rna scan the

5196
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:37,120
basically use this guide rna scan the
 

5197
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,830
basically use this guide rna scan the
genome

5198
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:37,840
genome
 

5199
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,229
genome
find wherever there's a match and then

5200
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:40,239
find wherever there's a match and then
 

5201
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,390
find wherever there's a match and then
cut the genome

5202
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:42,400
cut the genome
 

5203
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,790
cut the genome
so you know i digress but it's a

5204
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
so you know i digress but it's a
 

5205
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,750
so you know i digress but it's a
bacterial

5206
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:45,760
bacterial
 

5207
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,229
bacterial
immune defense system so basically

5208
01:28:48,229 --> 01:28:48,239
immune defense system so basically
 

5209
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,070
immune defense system so basically
bacteria are constantly attacked by

5210
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,080
bacteria are constantly attacked by
 

5211
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,750
bacteria are constantly attacked by
viruses

5212
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:51,760
viruses
 

5213
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,310
viruses
but sometimes they win against the

5214
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:54,320
but sometimes they win against the
 

5215
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,189
but sometimes they win against the
viruses

5216
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:55,199
viruses
 

5217
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,030
viruses
and they chop up these viruses and

5218
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:57,040
and they chop up these viruses and
 

5219
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,870
and they chop up these viruses and
remember as a trophy

5220
01:28:58,870 --> 01:28:58,880
remember as a trophy
 

5221
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,790
remember as a trophy
inside their genome they have this loci

5222
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:00,800
inside their genome they have this loci
 

5223
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,550
inside their genome they have this loci
this crispr loci

5224
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:02,560
this crispr loci
 

5225
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,390
this crispr loci
that basically stands for clustered

5226
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:04,400
that basically stands for clustered
 

5227
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,830
that basically stands for clustered
repeats interspersed

5228
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:05,840
repeats interspersed
 

5229
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,270
repeats interspersed
et cetera so basically it's it's an

5230
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:07,280
et cetera so basically it's it's an
 

5231
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,270
et cetera so basically it's it's an
interspersed repeats

5232
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:09,280
interspersed repeats
 

5233
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,750
interspersed repeats
structure where basically you have a set

5234
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:11,760
structure where basically you have a set
 

5235
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,189
structure where basically you have a set
of repetitive regions

5236
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:13,199
of repetitive regions
 

5237
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,189
of repetitive regions
and then interspersed were these

5238
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:15,199
and then interspersed were these
 

5239
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,550
and then interspersed were these
variable segments

5240
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:16,560
variable segments
 

5241
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,510
variable segments
that were basically matching viruses so

5242
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,520
that were basically matching viruses so
 

5243
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,669
that were basically matching viruses so
when this was first discovered

5244
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:21,679
when this was first discovered
 

5245
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,510
when this was first discovered
it was basically hypothesized that this

5246
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:23,520
it was basically hypothesized that this
 

5247
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,430
it was basically hypothesized that this
is probably a bacterial immune system

5248
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:25,440
is probably a bacterial immune system
 

5249
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,550
is probably a bacterial immune system
that remembers

5250
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:26,560
that remembers
 

5251
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,310
that remembers
the trophies of the viruses that manage

5252
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:28,320
the trophies of the viruses that manage
 

5253
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,149
the trophies of the viruses that manage
to kill

5254
01:29:30,149 --> 01:29:30,159
to kill
 

5255
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,229
to kill
and then the bacteria pass on you know

5256
01:29:32,229 --> 01:29:32,239
and then the bacteria pass on you know
 

5257
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:34,470
and then the bacteria pass on you know
they sort of do lateral transfer of dna

5258
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:34,480
they sort of do lateral transfer of dna
 

5259
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,470
they sort of do lateral transfer of dna
and they pass on these memories so that

5260
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:36,480
and they pass on these memories so that
 

5261
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,229
and they pass on these memories so that
the next bacterium says oh you killed

5262
01:29:38,229 --> 01:29:38,239
the next bacterium says oh you killed
 

5263
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:38,870
the next bacterium says oh you killed
that guy

5264
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:38,880
that guy
 

5265
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,149
that guy
when that guy shows up again i will

5266
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:40,159
when that guy shows up again i will
 

5267
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:42,790
when that guy shows up again i will
recognize him and the crispr system was

5268
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:42,800
recognize him and the crispr system was
 

5269
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,910
recognize him and the crispr system was
basically evolved

5270
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:43,920
basically evolved
 

5271
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,189
basically evolved
as a bacterial adaptive immune response

5272
01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:47,199
as a bacterial adaptive immune response
 

5273
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:50,149
as a bacterial adaptive immune response
to sense foreigners that should not

01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,030
belong
and to just go and cut their genome so

5278
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:53,040
and to just go and cut their genome so
 

5279
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,950
and to just go and cut their genome so
it's an rna guided

5280
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:54,960
it's an rna guided
 

5281
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,870
it's an rna guided
rna cutting enzyme or an rna guided dna

5282
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:58,880
rna cutting enzyme or an rna guided dna
 

5283
01:29:58,880 --> 01:29:59,430
rna cutting enzyme or an rna guided dna
cutting

5284
01:29:59,430 --> 01:29:59,440
cutting
 

5285
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,149
cutting
enzyme so there's different systems some

5286
01:30:02,149 --> 01:30:02,159
enzyme so there's different systems some
 

5287
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:03,430
enzyme so there's different systems some
of them called dna some of them called

5309
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,510
cut genomes
you basically have this

5310
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:29,520
you basically have this
 

5311
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,990
you basically have this
guiding system that allows you to use an

5312
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
guiding system that allows you to use an
 

5313
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,270
guiding system that allows you to use an
rna guide

5314

to bring enzymes to cut dna at a

5316
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,480
to bring enzymes to cut dna at a
 

5317
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,510
to bring enzymes to cut dna at a
particular locus

5318
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:37,520
particular locus
 

5319
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,510
particular locus
that's so fascinating just so this is

5320
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:39,520
that's so fascinating just so this is
 

5321
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,750
that's so fascinating just so this is
like already a natural mechanism

5322
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:41,760
like already a natural mechanism
 

5323
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,470
like already a natural mechanism
a natural tool for cutting that was

5324
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:44,480
a natural tool for cutting that was
 

5325
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,430
a natural tool for cutting that was
useful

5326
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:45,440
useful
 

5327
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,430
useful
this particular context yeah and we're

5328
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:47,440
this particular context yeah and we're
 

5329
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,270
this particular context yeah and we're
like well we can use that thing to

5330
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:49,280
like well we can use that thing to
 

5331
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:49,830
like well we can use that thing to
actually

5332
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:49,840
actually
 

5333
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,350
actually
it's a nice tool that's already in the

5334
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
it's a nice tool that's already in the
 

5335
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,590
it's a nice tool that's already in the
body yeah yeah it's not in our body it's

5336
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:53,600
body yeah yeah it's not in our body it's
 

5337
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,189
body yeah yeah it's not in our body it's
a bacterial body

5338
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:55,199
a bacterial body
 

5339
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,590
a bacterial body
it was discovered by the by the yogurt

5340
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:57,600
it was discovered by the by the yogurt
 

5341
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,110
it was discovered by the by the yogurt
industry

5342
01:30:59,110 --> 01:30:59,120
industry
 

5343
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,510
industry
they were trying to make better yogurts

5344
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,520
they were trying to make better yogurts
 

5345
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,550
they were trying to make better yogurts
and they were trying to make their

5346
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:02,560
and they were trying to make their
 

5347
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,430
and they were trying to make their
bacteria

5348
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:03,440
bacteria
 

5349
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,910
bacteria
in their yogurt cultures more resilient

5350
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:05,920
in their yogurt cultures more resilient
 

5351
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,070
in their yogurt cultures more resilient
to viruses

5352
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,080
to viruses
 

5353
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,229
to viruses
and they were studying bacteria and they

5354
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:10,239
and they were studying bacteria and they
 

5355
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:11,910
and they were studying bacteria and they
found that wow this crispr system is

5356
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:11,920
found that wow this crispr system is
 

5357
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:12,310
found that wow this crispr system is
awesome

5358
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:12,320
awesome
 

5359
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,629
awesome
it allows you to defend against that and

5360
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
it allows you to defend against that and
 

5361
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,310
it allows you to defend against that and
then it was co-opted in mammalian

5362
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:16,320
then it was co-opted in mammalian
 

5363
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,910
then it was co-opted in mammalian
systems that don't use anything like

5364
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:17,920
systems that don't use anything like
 

5365
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,629
systems that don't use anything like
that

5366
01:31:18,629 --> 01:31:18,639
that
 

5367
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,350
that
as a as a as a targeting way to

5368
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:21,360
as a as a as a targeting way to
 

5369
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,950
as a as a as a targeting way to
basically bring these dna cutting

5370
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:22,960
basically bring these dna cutting
 

5371
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:23,830
basically bring these dna cutting
enzymes

5372
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:23,840
enzymes
 

5373
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,149
enzymes
to any locus in the genome why would you

5374
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
to any locus in the genome why would you
 

5375
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,310
to any locus in the genome why would you
want to cut dna

5376
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:28,320
want to cut dna
 

5377
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,790
want to cut dna
to do anything the reason is that our

5378
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:30,800
to do anything the reason is that our
 

5379
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,750
to do anything the reason is that our
dna has a dna repair mechanism

5380
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:33,760
dna has a dna repair mechanism
 

5381
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,189
dna has a dna repair mechanism
where if a region of the genome gets

5382
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:35,199
where if a region of the genome gets
 

5383
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,510
where if a region of the genome gets
randomly cut you will basically scan the

5384
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:37,520
randomly cut you will basically scan the
 

5385
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,990
randomly cut you will basically scan the
genome for anything that matches

5386
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:40,000
genome for anything that matches
 

5387
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,270
genome for anything that matches
and sort of use it by homology

5388
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,280
and sort of use it by homology
 

5389
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,110
and sort of use it by homology
so the reason why we're deployed is

5390
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:45,120
so the reason why we're deployed is
 

5391
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,030
so the reason why we're deployed is
because we now have a spare copy

5392
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:47,040
because we now have a spare copy
 

5393
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,030
because we now have a spare copy
as soon as my mom's copy is deactivated

5394
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,040
as soon as my mom's copy is deactivated
 

5395
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,390
as soon as my mom's copy is deactivated
i can use my dad's copy

5396
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:50,400
i can use my dad's copy
 

5397
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,830
i can use my dad's copy
and somewhere else if my dad's copy is

5398
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:51,840
and somewhere else if my dad's copy is
 

5399
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,590
and somewhere else if my dad's copy is
deactivated i can use my mom's copy

5400
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:53,600
deactivated i can use my mom's copy
 

5401
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,910
deactivated i can use my mom's copy
to repair it so this is called

5402
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:55,920
to repair it so this is called
 

5403
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,430
to repair it so this is called
homologous

5404
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
homologous
 

5405
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,470
homologous
based repair so all you have to do is

5406
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:00,480
based repair so all you have to do is
 

5407
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,030
based repair so all you have to do is
the

5408
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,040
the
 

5409
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,030
the
the cutting and that's it you don't have

5410
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,040
the cutting and that's it you don't have
 

5411
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,629
the cutting and that's it you don't have
to do the fixing that's exactly right

5412
01:32:04,629 --> 01:32:04,639
to do the fixing that's exactly right
 

5413
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:05,910
to do the fixing that's exactly right
you don't have to do the fixing

5414
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:05,920
you don't have to do the fixing
 

5415
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,270
you don't have to do the fixing
because it's already built in that's

5416
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:07,280
because it's already built in that's
 

5417
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,270
because it's already built in that's
exactly right but the fixing

5418
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:09,280
exactly right but the fixing
 

5419
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,830
exactly right but the fixing
can be co-opted by throwing in a bunch

5420
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:11,840
can be co-opted by throwing in a bunch
 

5421
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,270
can be co-opted by throwing in a bunch
of homologous

5422
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:13,280
of homologous
 

5423
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,189
of homologous
segments that instead of having your

5424
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:15,199
segments that instead of having your
 

5425
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,709
segments that instead of having your
dad's version

5426
01:32:16,709 --> 01:32:16,719
dad's version
 

5427
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:18,070
dad's version
have whatever other version you'd like

5428
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:18,080
have whatever other version you'd like
 

5429
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,750
have whatever other version you'd like
to use

5430
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:19,760
to use
 

5431
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,910
to use
so the thing so you you then control the

5432
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:21,920
so the thing so you you then control the
 

5433
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,590
so the thing so you you then control the
fixing by throwing in a bunch of other

5434
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:23,600
fixing by throwing in a bunch of other
 

5435
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,790
fixing by throwing in a bunch of other
stuff exactly right

5436
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:24,800
stuff exactly right
 

5437
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,390
stuff exactly right
that's how you do genome editing so

5438
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:26,400
that's how you do genome editing so
 

5439
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,990
that's how you do genome editing so
that's what crispr is that's what's

5440
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:28,000
that's what crispr is that's what's
 

5441
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,910
that's what crispr is that's what's
wonderful in popular culture people use

5442
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:29,920
wonderful in popular culture people use
 

5443
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,990
wonderful in popular culture people use
the term i've never well that's

5444
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000
the term i've never well that's
 

5445
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,790
the term i've never well that's
brilliant that's

5446
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:32,800
brilliant that's
 

5447
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,709
brilliant that's
a crispr regional explanation genome

5448
01:32:34,709 --> 01:32:34,719
a crispr regional explanation genome
 

5449
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:35,830

vandalism

5450
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:35,840
vandalism
 

5451
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,470
vandalism
followed by a bunch of band-aids that

5452
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:38,480
followed by a bunch of band-aids that
 

5453
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,830
followed by a bunch of band-aids that
have the sequence that you'd like and

5454
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:39,840
have the sequence that you'd like and
 

5455
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,950
have the sequence that you'd like and
you can control the

5456
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:40,960
you can control the
 

5457
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,510
you can control the
the choices of band-aids correct yeah

5458
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:43,520
the choices of band-aids correct yeah
 

5459
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,669
the choices of band-aids correct yeah
and of course there's new generations of

5460
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:45,679
and of course there's new generations of
 

5461
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,270
and of course there's new generations of
crispr there's something that's called

5462
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:47,280
crispr there's something that's called
 

5463
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,030
crispr there's something that's called
prime editing that was

5464
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,040
prime editing that was
 

5465
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,950
prime editing that was
sort of very very much in the press

5466
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:50,960
sort of very very much in the press
 

5467
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,709
sort of very very much in the press
recently that basically instead of sort

5468
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:52,719
recently that basically instead of sort
 

5469
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:54,470
recently that basically instead of sort
of making a double stranded break

5470
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
of making a double stranded break
 

5471
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,270
of making a double stranded break
which again is genome vandalism you

5472
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:57,280
which again is genome vandalism you
 

5473
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,430
which again is genome vandalism you
basically make a single

5474
01:32:59,430 --> 01:32:59,440
basically make a single
 

5475
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,229
basically make a single
stranded break you basically just nick

5476
01:33:02,229 --> 01:33:02,239
stranded break you basically just nick
 

5477
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,310
stranded break you basically just nick
one of the two strands

5478
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:04,320
one of the two strands
 

5479
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,390
one of the two strands
enabling you to sort of peel off without

5480
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:06,400
enabling you to sort of peel off without
 

5481
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,629
enabling you to sort of peel off without
sort of completely breaking it up

5482
01:33:08,629 --> 01:33:08,639
sort of completely breaking it up
 

5483
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:11,669
sort of completely breaking it up
and then repair it locally using a guide

5484
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:11,679
and then repair it locally using a guide
 

5485
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:15,830
and then repair it locally using a guide
that is coupled to your initial rna

5486
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:15,840
that is coupled to your initial rna
 

5487
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,790
that is coupled to your initial rna
that took you to that location dumb

5488
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:18,800
that took you to that location dumb
 

5489
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:19,590
that took you to that location dumb
question but

5490
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:19,600
question but
 

5491
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,030
question but
is crispr as awesome and cool as it

5492
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:23,040
is crispr as awesome and cool as it
 

5493
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,550
is crispr as awesome and cool as it
sounds

5494
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,560
sounds
 

5495
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,110
sounds
i mean technically speaking in terms of

5496
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:27,120
i mean technically speaking in terms of
 

5497
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:27,669
i mean technically speaking in terms of
like

5498
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:27,679
like
 

5499
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:31,750
like
as a tool for manipulating our genetics

5500
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:31,760
as a tool for manipulating our genetics
 

5501
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,550

manipulating
 

5505
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,870
manipulating
or is there downsides drawbacks in this

5506
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:38,880
or is there downsides drawbacks in this
 

5507
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,550
or is there downsides drawbacks in this
whole context of therapeutics that we're

5508
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:40,560
whole context of therapeutics that we're
 

5509
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,910
whole context of therapeutics that we're
talking about yeah or understanding and

talking about yeah or understanding and
 

5511
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:42,390
talking about yeah or understanding and
so

5512
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400
so
 

5513
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,669
so
so so um when i teach my students about

5514
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:45,679
so so um when i teach my students about
 

5515
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:46,470
so so um when i teach my students about
crispr

and then i show them the date of these
 

5525
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:57,110

two of these articles and they're 2004
 

5527
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,550
two of these articles and they're 2004
like five years before crispr was

5528
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:58,560
like five years before crispr was
 

5529
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,709
like five years before crispr was
invented and the reason is that

5530
01:34:00,709 --> 01:34:00,719
invented and the reason is that
 

5531
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,310
invented and the reason is that
they're not talking about crispr they're

5532
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:02,320
they're not talking about crispr they're
 

5533
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,550
they're not talking about crispr they're
talking about zinc finger enzymes

5534
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:04,560
talking about zinc finger enzymes
 

5535
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,709
talking about zinc finger enzymes
that are another way to bring these

5536
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:06,719
that are another way to bring these
 

5537
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,790
that are another way to bring these
cutters to the genome

5538

cutters to the genome
 

5539
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,350
cutters to the genome
it's a very difficult way of sort of

5540
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,360
it's a very difficult way of sort of
 

5541
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,270
it's a very difficult way of sort of
designing the right set of zinc finger

5542
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:13,280
designing the right set of zinc finger
 

5543
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,550
designing the right set of zinc finger
proteins the right set of

the reason why crispr is amazingly

5586
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:53,679
the reason why crispr is amazingly
 

5587
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,669
the reason why crispr is amazingly
awesomely revolutionary

5588

awesomely revolutionary
 

5589
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,590
awesomely revolutionary
is because instead of having this team

5590
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:57,600
is because instead of having this team
 

5591
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,709
is because instead of having this team
of engineers

5592

you just type it in your computer and

5598
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,560
you just type it in your computer and
 

5599
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,510
you just type it in your computer and
you just synthesize an rna guide

5600
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:07,520
you just synthesize an rna guide
 

5601
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,910
you just synthesize an rna guide
the beauty of crispr is not the cutting

5602
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:09,920
the beauty of crispr is not the cutting
 

5603
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:10,950
the beauty of crispr is not the cutting
it's not the fixing

5604
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:10,960
it's not the fixing
 

5605
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,030
it's not the fixing
all of that was there before it's the

5606
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:13,040
all of that was there before it's the
 

5607
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,390
all of that was there before it's the
guiding

5608
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:14,400
guiding
 

5609
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,990
guiding
and the only thing that changes that it

5610
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:16,000
and the only thing that changes that it
 

5611
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,830
and the only thing that changes that it
makes the guiding easier

5612
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:17,840
makes the guiding easier
 

5613
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,709
makes the guiding easier
by sort of you know just typing in the

5614
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:20,719
by sort of you know just typing in the
 

5615
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:21,830
by sort of you know just typing in the
rna sequence

5616
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:21,840
rna sequence
 

5617
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,590
rna sequence
which then allows the system to sort of

5618
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:23,600
which then allows the system to sort of
 

5619
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,750
which then allows the system to sort of
scan the dna to find that

5620
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:25,760
scan the dna to find that
 

5621
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,310
scan the dna to find that
so the coding the the engineering of the

5622
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:28,320
so the coding the the engineering of the
 

5623
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,030
so the coding the the engineering of the
cutter is

5624
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,040
cutter is
 

5625
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,070
cutter is
easier on the uh in terms of

5626
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,080
easier on the uh in terms of
 

5627
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,590
easier on the uh in terms of
that's kind of similar to the story of

5628
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:33,600
that's kind of similar to the story of
 

5629
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,430
that's kind of similar to the story of
deep learning versus uh

5630
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,440
deep learning versus uh
 

5631
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,590
deep learning versus uh
old school machine learning some of the

5632
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:37,600
old school machine learning some of the
 

5633
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,870
old school machine learning some of the
some of the challenging parts are

5634
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:38,880
some of the challenging parts are
 

5635
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,430
some of the challenging parts are
automated

5636
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:39,440
automated
 

5637
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,550
automated
okay so uh but crispr is just one

5638
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:42,560
okay so uh but crispr is just one
 

5639
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,709
okay so uh but crispr is just one
cutting exact technology exactly and

5640
01:35:44,709 --> 01:35:44,719
cutting exact technology exactly and
 

5641
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:45,990
cutting exact technology exactly and
then there's that's part of the

5642
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:46,000
then there's that's part of the
 

5643
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,030
then there's that's part of the
challenges

5644
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:47,040
challenges
 

5645
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,510
challenges
and exciting opportunities of the field

5646
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:49,520
and exciting opportunities of the field
 

5647
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,629
and exciting opportunities of the field
is to design

5648
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:50,639
is to design
 

5649
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,870
is to design
different cutting technologies yeah yeah

5650
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:52,880
different cutting technologies yeah yeah
 

5651
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,149
different cutting technologies yeah yeah
so now um we

5652
01:35:54,149 --> 01:35:54,159
so now um we
 

5653
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:55,430
so now um we
you know this was a big parenthesis on

5654
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
you know this was a big parenthesis on
 

5655
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,830
you know this was a big parenthesis on
crispr but now

5656
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:57,840
crispr but now
 

5657
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,189
crispr but now
you you know when we were talking about

5658
01:35:59,189 --> 01:35:59,199
you you know when we were talking about
 

5659
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,830
you you know when we were talking about
perturbations you basically now have the

5660
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:01,840
perturbations you basically now have the
 

5661
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,750
perturbations you basically now have the
ability to not just look at correlation

5662
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:03,760
ability to not just look at correlation
 

5663
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:04,870
ability to not just look at correlation
between enhancers

5664
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:04,880
between enhancers
 

5665
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,310
between enhancers
and genes but actually go and either

5666
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,320
and genes but actually go and either
 

5667
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,229
and genes but actually go and either
destroy that enhancer and see if the

5668
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:10,239
destroy that enhancer and see if the
 

5669
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:11,750
destroy that enhancer and see if the
gene changes in expression

5670
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:11,760
gene changes in expression
 

5671
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,550
gene changes in expression
or you can use the crispr targeting

5672
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:14,560
or you can use the crispr targeting
 

5673
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,070
or you can use the crispr targeting
system

5674
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:16,080
system
 

5675
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,750
system
to bring in not vandalism and cutting

5676
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:19,760
to bring in not vandalism and cutting
 

5677
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,189
to bring in not vandalism and cutting
but you can couple the crispr system

5678
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:23,199
but you can couple the crispr system
 

5679
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,990
but you can couple the crispr system
with and the crispr system is called

5680
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,000
with and the crispr system is called
 

5681
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,310
with and the crispr system is called
usually crispr cas9 because cast 9 is

5682
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:28,320
usually crispr cas9 because cast 9 is
 

5683
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,629
usually crispr cas9 because cast 9 is
the protein that will then come and cut

5684
01:36:30,629 --> 01:36:30,639
the protein that will then come and cut
 

5685
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:33,189
the protein that will then come and cut
but there's a version of that protein

5686
01:36:33,189 --> 01:36:33,199
but there's a version of that protein
 

5687
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,109
but there's a version of that protein
called dead cast 9 where the cutting

5688
01:36:35,109 --> 01:36:35,119
called dead cast 9 where the cutting
 

5689
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,550
called dead cast 9 where the cutting
part is deactivated

5690
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:36,560
part is deactivated
 

5691
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,590
part is deactivated
so you basically use d cas9 dead cas9

5692
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:39,600
so you basically use d cas9 dead cas9
 

5693
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,430
so you basically use d cas9 dead cas9
to bring in an activator or to bring in

5694
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:43,440
to bring in an activator or to bring in
 

5695
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,229
to bring in an activator or to bring in
a repressor so you can now ask is this

5696
01:36:46,229 --> 01:36:46,239
a repressor so you can now ask is this
 

5697
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,550
a repressor so you can now ask is this
enhancer changing that gene

5698
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:48,560
enhancer changing that gene
 

5699
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,750
enhancer changing that gene
by taking this modified crispr

5700
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:51,760
by taking this modified crispr
 

5701
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,109
by taking this modified crispr
which is already modified from the

5702
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
which is already modified from the
 

5703
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,870
which is already modified from the
bacteria to be used in humans that you

5704
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:54,880
bacteria to be used in humans that you
 

5705
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,870
bacteria to be used in humans that you
can now modify the cast 9 to be dead

5706
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:56,880
can now modify the cast 9 to be dead
 

5707
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,790
can now modify the cast 9 to be dead
cas9 and you can now further modify it

5708
01:36:58,790 --> 01:36:58,800
cas9 and you can now further modify it
 

5709
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,790
cas9 and you can now further modify it
to bring in a regulator

5710
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:00,800
to bring in a regulator
 

5711
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,629
to bring in a regulator
and you can basically turn on or turn

5712
01:37:02,629 --> 01:37:02,639
and you can basically turn on or turn
 

5713
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:04,550
and you can basically turn on or turn
off that enhancer and then see what is

5714
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:04,560
off that enhancer and then see what is
 

5715
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,390
off that enhancer and then see what is
the impact on that gene

5716
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:06,400
the impact on that gene
 

5717
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,870
the impact on that gene
so these are the four ways of linking

5718
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:08,880
so these are the four ways of linking
 

5719
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,910
so these are the four ways of linking
the locus

5720
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:09,920
the locus
 

5721
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,910
the locus
to the target gene and that's step

5722
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:11,920
to the target gene and that's step
 

5723
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,350
to the target gene and that's step
number five

5724
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:13,360
number five
 

5725
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,590
number five
okay step number five is find the target

5726
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600
okay step number five is find the target
 

5727
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,350
okay step number five is find the target
gene and step number six is

5728
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:17,360
gene and step number six is
 

5729
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,510
gene and step number six is
what the heck does that gene do you

5730
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:19,520
what the heck does that gene do you
 

5731
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,430
what the heck does that gene do you
basically now go and manipulate that

5732
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:21,440
basically now go and manipulate that
 

5733
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,350
basically now go and manipulate that
gene

5734
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:23,360
gene
 

5735
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,669
gene
to basically see what are the processes

5736
01:37:25,669 --> 01:37:25,679
to basically see what are the processes
 

5737
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,510
to basically see what are the processes
that change

5738
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:27,520
that change
 

5739
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,070
that change
and you can basically ask well you know

5740
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:30,080
and you can basically ask well you know
 

5741
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,229
and you can basically ask well you know
in this particular case in the fto locus

5742
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,239
in this particular case in the fto locus
 

5743
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,709
in this particular case in the fto locus
we found mesenchymal stem cells that are

5744
01:37:34,709 --> 01:37:34,719
we found mesenchymal stem cells that are
 

5745
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,310
we found mesenchymal stem cells that are
the progenitors of white fat

5746
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:36,320
the progenitors of white fat
 

5747
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,430
the progenitors of white fat
and brown fat or beige fat

5748
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:39,440
and brown fat or beige fat
 

5749
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,550
and brown fat or beige fat
we found the rs-1421085 nucleotide

5750
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:42,560
we found the rs-1421085 nucleotide
 

5751
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,510
we found the rs-1421085 nucleotide
variant as the

5752
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:43,520
variant as the
 

5753
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:47,030
variant as the
causal variant we found this

5754
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,040
causal variant we found this
 

5755
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,990
causal variant we found this
large enhancer this master regulator i

5756
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,000
large enhancer this master regulator i
 

5757
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,669
large enhancer this master regulator i
like to call it ob1

5758
01:37:51,669 --> 01:37:51,679
like to call it ob1
 

5759
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:53,910
like to call it ob1
for uh obesity one like the strongest

5760
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:53,920
for uh obesity one like the strongest
 

5761
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,430
for uh obesity one like the strongest
enhancer associated with whatever

5762
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:55,440
enhancer associated with whatever
 

5763
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,030

5807
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,510
nucleotides away
so those are what's the effect of

5808
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:39,520
so those are what's the effect of
 

5809
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,510
so those are what's the effect of
turning them off that's exactly

5810
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:41,520
turning them off that's exactly
 

5811
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,669
turning them off that's exactly
the next question so step six is what do

5812
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:43,679
the next question so step six is what do
 

5813
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,270
the next question so step six is what do
these genes actually do

5814
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:45,280
these genes actually do
 

5815
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:48,470
these genes actually do
so we then ask what does rx3 and rx5 do

5816
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:48,480
so we then ask what does rx3 and rx5 do
 

5817
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,070
so we then ask what does rx3 and rx5 do
the first thing we did is look across

5818
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:50,080
the first thing we did is look across
 

5819
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,229
the first thing we did is look across
individuals for individuals that had

5820
01:38:52,229 --> 01:38:52,239
individuals for individuals that had
 

5821
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,070
individuals for individuals that had
higher expression of rx3 or lower

5822
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
higher expression of rx3 or lower
 

5823
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,270
higher expression of rx3 or lower
expression rx3

5824
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:55,280
expression rx3
 

5825
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,950
expression rx3
and then we looked at the expression of

5826
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:56,960
and then we looked at the expression of
 

5827
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,709
and then we looked at the expression of
all of the other genes in the genome

5828
01:38:58,709 --> 01:38:58,719
all of the other genes in the genome
 

5829
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:01,510
all of the other genes in the genome
and we look for simply correlation and

5830
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
and we look for simply correlation and
 

5831
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,830
and we look for simply correlation and
we found that iric 3 and rx-5 were both

5832
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:03,840
we found that iric 3 and rx-5 were both
 

5833
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,189
we found that iric 3 and rx-5 were both
correlated

5834
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:05,199
correlated
 

5835
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:08,229
correlated
positively with lipid metabolism

positively with lipid metabolism
and negatively with mitochondrial

5838
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:11,440
and negatively with mitochondrial
 

5839
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,629
and negatively with mitochondrial
biogenesis you're like what the heck

biogenesis you're like what the heck
does that mean

5842
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:16,080
does that mean
 

5843
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,070
does that mean
it doesn't sound related to obesity not

5844
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:18,080
it doesn't sound related to obesity not
 

5845
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,229
it doesn't sound related to obesity not
at all superficially

5846
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239
at all superficially
 

5847
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:23,030
at all superficially
but lipid metabolism should because

01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:56,950
endosymbiosis means you live together
holding the other one inside you so

5928
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:56,960
holding the other one inside you so
 

5929
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,870
holding the other one inside you so
the pre-eukaryotes engulfed

5930
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:00,880
the pre-eukaryotes engulfed
 

5931
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,790
the pre-eukaryotes engulfed
an organism that was very good at energy

5932
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:04,800
an organism that was very good at energy
 

5933
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,629
an organism that was very good at energy
production

5934
01:41:06,629 --> 01:41:06,639
production
 

5935
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:09,430
production
and that organism eventually shed most

5936
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440
and that organism eventually shed most
 

5937
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:10,950
and that organism eventually shed most
of its genome

5938
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:10,960
of its genome
 

5939
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,510
of its genome
to now have only 13 genes in the

5940
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:13,520
to now have only 13 genes in the
 

5941
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,390
to now have only 13 genes in the
mitochondrial genome

5942
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:16,400
mitochondrial genome
 

5943
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:19,189
mitochondrial genome
and those 13 genes are all involved in

5944
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:19,199
and those 13 genes are all involved in
 

5945
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:20,950
and those 13 genes are all involved in
energy production

5946
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:20,960
energy production
 

5947
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,350
energy production
the electron transport chain so

5948
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:23,360
the electron transport chain so
 

5949
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,070
the electron transport chain so
basically

5950
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:24,080
basically
 

5951
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,149
basically
electrons are these massive super energy

5952
01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:26,159
electrons are these massive super energy
 

5953
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:28,310
electrons are these massive super energy
rich molecules

5954
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
rich molecules
 

5955
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,430
rich molecules
we basically have these organelles that

5956
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,440
we basically have these organelles that
 

5957
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:31,990
we basically have these organelles that
produce

5958
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:32,000
produce
 

5959
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,510
produce
energy and when your muscle exercises

5960
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:35,520
energy and when your muscle exercises
 

5961
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,590
energy and when your muscle exercises
you basically multiply your mitochondria

5962
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:37,600
you basically multiply your mitochondria
 

5963
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,709
you basically multiply your mitochondria
you basically sort of

5964
01:41:38,709 --> 01:41:38,719
you basically sort of
 

5965
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:41,750
you basically sort of
you know use more and more mitochondria

5966
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:41,760
you know use more and more mitochondria
 

5967
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,669
you know use more and more mitochondria
and that's how you get beefed up so

5968
01:41:43,669 --> 01:41:43,679
and that's how you get beefed up so
 

5969
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,270
and that's how you get beefed up so
basically the m the muscle sort of

5970
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:45,280
basically the m the muscle sort of
 

5971
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,590
basically the m the muscle sort of
learns how to generate more energy

5972
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:47,600
learns how to generate more energy
 

5973
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,189
learns how to generate more energy
so basically every single time your

5974
01:41:49,189 --> 01:41:49,199
so basically every single time your
 

5975
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:50,790
so basically every single time your
muscles will you know overnight

5976
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:50,800
muscles will you know overnight
 

5977
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,310
muscles will you know overnight
regenerate and sort of become stronger

5978
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:52,320
regenerate and sort of become stronger
 

5979
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,910
regenerate and sort of become stronger
and amplify their mitochondrions and so

5980
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:53,920
and amplify their mitochondrions and so
 

5981
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:54,950
and amplify their mitochondrions and so
forth

5982
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:54,960
forth
 

5983
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,390
forth
so what does mitochondria do the

5984
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:56,400
so what does mitochondria do the
 

5985
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,070
so what does mitochondria do the
mitochondria

5986
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:58,080
mitochondria
 

5987
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:01,109
mitochondria
use energy to sort of do any kind of

5988
01:42:01,109 --> 01:42:01,119
use energy to sort of do any kind of
 

5989
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:01,990
use energy to sort of do any kind of
task

5990
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:02,000
task
 

5991
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,709
task
when you're thinking you're using energy

5992
01:42:04,709 --> 01:42:04,719
when you're thinking you're using energy
 

5993
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,709
when you're thinking you're using energy
this energy comes from mitochondria

5994
01:42:06,709 --> 01:42:06,719
this energy comes from mitochondria
 

5995
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:08,709
this energy comes from mitochondria
your neurons have mitochondria all over

5996
01:42:08,709 --> 01:42:08,719
your neurons have mitochondria all over
 

5997
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:10,709
your neurons have mitochondria all over
the place basically this mitochondria

5998
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:10,719
the place basically this mitochondria
 

5999
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:12,390
the place basically this mitochondria
can multiply as organelles and they can

6000
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:12,400
can multiply as organelles and they can
 

6001
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,790
can multiply as organelles and they can
be spread along the body of your muscle

6002
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:14,800
be spread along the body of your muscle
 

6003
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,149
be spread along the body of your muscle
some of your muscle cells have actually

6004
01:42:16,149 --> 01:42:16,159
some of your muscle cells have actually
 

6005
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:18,310
some of your muscle cells have actually
multiple nuclei they're polynucleated

6006
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:18,320
multiple nuclei they're polynucleated
 

6007
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,229
multiple nuclei they're polynucleated
but they also have multiple mitochondria

6008
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:20,239
but they also have multiple mitochondria
 

6009
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:21,750
but they also have multiple mitochondria
to basically uh

6010
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:21,760
to basically uh
 

6011
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,350
to basically uh
deal with the fact that your muscle is

6012
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:23,360
deal with the fact that your muscle is
 

6013
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,510
deal with the fact that your muscle is
enormous you can sort of span this super

6014
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:25,520
enormous you can sort of span this super
 

6015
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,629
enormous you can sort of span this super
super long length

6016
01:42:26,629 --> 01:42:26,639
super long length
 

6017
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:27,990
super long length
and you need energy throughout the

6018
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:28,000
and you need energy throughout the
 

6019
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,669
and you need energy throughout the
length of your muscle so that's why you

6020
01:42:29,669 --> 01:42:29,679
length of your muscle so that's why you
 

6021
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:31,270
length of your muscle so that's why you
have mitochondria throughout the length

6022
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:31,280
have mitochondria throughout the length
 

6023
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,390
have mitochondria throughout the length
and you also need transcription through

6024
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:32,400
and you also need transcription through
 

6025
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,750
and you also need transcription through
the length so you have multiple nuclei

6026
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:33,760
the length so you have multiple nuclei
 

6027
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,870
the length so you have multiple nuclei
as well

6028
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:34,880
as well
 

6029
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,470
as well
so these two processes

6030
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
so these two processes
 

6031
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:41,189
so these two processes
lipids store energy what do mitochondria

6032
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:41,199
lipids store energy what do mitochondria
 

6033
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:43,950
lipids store energy what do mitochondria
do so there's a process known as

6034
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:43,960
do so there's a process known as
 

6035
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,629
do so there's a process known as
thermogenesis thermoheat

6036
01:42:46,629 --> 01:42:46,639
thermogenesis thermoheat
 

6037
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:48,629
thermogenesis thermoheat
genesis generation thermogenesis is

6038
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:48,639
genesis generation thermogenesis is
 

6039
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:50,229
genesis generation thermogenesis is
generation of heat

6040
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:50,239
generation of heat
 

6041
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:53,270
generation of heat
remember that bathtub with

6042
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:53,280
remember that bathtub with
 

6043
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,750
remember that bathtub with
in and out that's the equation that

6044
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:55,760
in and out that's the equation that
 

6045
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,870
in and out that's the equation that
everybody's focused on

6046
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:56,880
everybody's focused on
 

6047
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,790
everybody's focused on
so how much energy do you consume how

6048
01:42:58,790 --> 01:42:58,800
so how much energy do you consume how
 

6049
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,709
so how much energy do you consume how
much energy you burn

6050
01:43:00,709 --> 01:43:00,719
much energy you burn
 

6051
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,189
much energy you burn
but in every thermodynamic system

6052
01:43:03,189 --> 01:43:03,199
but in every thermodynamic system
 

6053
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:03,750
but in every thermodynamic system
there's

6054
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:03,760
there's
 

6055
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,070
there's
three parts to the equation there's

6056
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:06,080
three parts to the equation there's
 

6057
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,350
three parts to the equation there's
energy in

6058
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:07,360
energy in
 

6059
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,629
energy in
energy out and energy lost

6060
01:43:10,629 --> 01:43:10,639
energy out and energy lost
 

6061
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:13,830
energy out and energy lost
any machine has loss

6062
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:13,840
any machine has loss
 

6063
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,669
any machine has loss
of energy how do you lose energy you

6064
01:43:15,669 --> 01:43:15,679
of energy how do you lose energy you
 

6065
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:17,350
of energy how do you lose energy you
emanate heat

6066
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:17,360
emanate heat
 

6067
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:20,709
emanate heat
so heat is energy loss so

6068
01:43:20,709 --> 01:43:20,719
so heat is energy loss so
 

6069
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:23,750
so heat is energy loss so
um

6070
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:23,760

 

6071
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,990

there's which is where the thermogenesis

6072
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,000
there's which is where the thermogenesis
 

6073
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,590
there's which is where the thermogenesis
comes in thermogenesis

6074
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:27,600
comes in thermogenesis
 

6075
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,310
comes in thermogenesis
is actually a regulatory process that

6076
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:30,320
is actually a regulatory process that
 

6077
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,149
is actually a regulatory process that
modulates the third component of the

6078
01:43:32,149 --> 01:43:32,159
modulates the third component of the
 

6079
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,830
modulates the third component of the
thermodynamic equation

6080
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:33,840
thermodynamic equation
 

6081
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,990
thermodynamic equation
you can basically control thermogenesis

6082
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:36,000
you can basically control thermogenesis
 

6083
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,030
you can basically control thermogenesis
explicitly

6084
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:37,040
explicitly
 

6085
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:38,390
explicitly
you can turn on and turn off

6086
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,400
you can turn on and turn off
 

6087
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,669
you can turn on and turn off
thermogenesis and that's where the

6088
01:43:39,669 --> 01:43:39,679
thermogenesis and that's where the
 

6089
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:41,510
thermogenesis and that's where the
mitochondria comes into exactly

6090
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:41,520
mitochondria comes into exactly
 

6091
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,470
mitochondria comes into exactly
so irix 3 and rx5 turn out to be the

6092

but doesn't that mean that you're able

6148
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:49,440
but doesn't that mean that you're able
 

6149
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,990
but doesn't that mean that you're able

you're not generating heat or is it that
 

6153
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:55,270
you're not generating heat or is it that
means that i can eat less

01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,629
means that i can eat less
and get around just fine yes yeah so

6156
01:44:58,629 --> 01:44:58,639
and get around just fine yes yeah so
 

6157
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:00,629
and get around just fine yes yeah so
that's a feature actually it's a feature

yeah but if we're all starving i'm doing

6162
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:04,000
yeah but if we're all starving i'm doing
 

6163
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,229
yeah but if we're all starving i'm doing
great if we all have access to massive

then the lipids are both

6174
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:17,040
then the lipids are both
 

6175
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,030
then the lipids are both
no distant or somehow different size of

01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,310
the same coin
and you basically choose to store energy

6180
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,320
and you basically choose to store energy
 

6181
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:23,750
and you basically choose to store energy
or you can choose to burn energy

6182
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:23,760
or you can choose to burn energy
 

6183
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,590
or you can choose to burn energy
and then all of that is involved in the

6184
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:25,600
and then all of that is involved in the
 

6185
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,510
and then all of that is involved in the
puzzle of obesity

6186

puzzle of obesity
 

6187
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,669
puzzle of obesity
and that's what's fascinating right here

6188
01:45:29,669 --> 01:45:29,679
and that's what's fascinating right here
 

6189
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,430
and that's what's fascinating right here
we are in 2007

and knowing nothing about how it works

6196
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:36,639
and knowing nothing about how it works
 

6197
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:39,270
and knowing nothing about how it works
for almost 10 years

for almost 10 years
 

6199
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,950
for almost 10 years
for 10 years everybody focused on this

6200
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:40,960
for 10 years everybody focused on this
 

6201
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,550
for 10 years everybody focused on this
fto gene

fto gene
 

6203
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,229
fto gene
and they were like oh it must have to do

6204
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:44,239
and they were like oh it must have to do
 

6205
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:45,990
and they were like oh it must have to do
something with you know

6206
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:46,000
something with you know
 

6207
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,790
something with you know
rna modification and it's like no it has

6208
01:45:48,790 --> 01:45:48,800
rna modification and it's like no it has
 

6209
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,550
rna modification and it's like no it has
nothing to do with the function of fto

6210
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:50,560
nothing to do with the function of fto
 

6211
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,790
nothing to do with the function of fto
it has everything to do with all of this

6212
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:52,800
it has everything to do with all of this
 

6213
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,590
it has everything to do with all of this
other process

6214
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:53,600
other process
 

6215
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,590
other process
and suddenly the moment you solve that

6216
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:55,600
and suddenly the moment you solve that
 

6217
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,990
and suddenly the moment you solve that
puzzle which is a multi-year effort by

6218
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,000
puzzle which is a multi-year effort by
 

6219
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,149
puzzle which is a multi-year effort by
the way and tremendous effort by melina

6220
01:46:00,149 --> 01:46:00,159
the way and tremendous effort by melina
 

6221
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:01,669
the way and tremendous effort by melina
and many many others

6222
01:46:01,669 --> 01:46:01,679
and many many others
 

6223
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,750
and many many others
so this tremendous effort basically led

6224
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:03,760
so this tremendous effort basically led
 

6225
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,430
so this tremendous effort basically led
us to recognize

01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:05,440
us to recognize
 

6227
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,870
us to recognize

01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,590
snip level you can start intervening at
iraq 3 and rx5

6252
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:33,600
iraq 3 and rx5
 

6253
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,669
iraq 3 and rx5
directly there you can start intervening

6254
01:46:35,669 --> 01:46:35,679
directly there you can start intervening
 

6255
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,109
directly there you can start intervening
at the thermogenesis level because you

6256
01:46:37,109 --> 01:46:37,119
at the thermogenesis level because you
 

6257
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:38,149
at the thermogenesis level because you
know the pathway

6258
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:38,159
know the pathway
 

6259
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:39,990
know the pathway
you can start interviewing at the at the

6260
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:40,000
you can start interviewing at the at the
 

6261
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,430
you can start interviewing at the at the
differentiation level

6262
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:41,440
differentiation level
 

6263
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:44,629
differentiation level
where these the decision to make

6264
01:46:44,629 --> 01:46:44,639
where these the decision to make
 

6265
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,870
where these the decision to make
either white fat or beige fat the energy

6266
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:46,880
either white fat or beige fat the energy
 

6267
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,189
either white fat or beige fat the energy
burning base fat

6268
01:46:49,189 --> 01:46:49,199
burning base fat
 

6269
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:51,270
burning base fat
is made developmentally in the first

6270
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:51,280
is made developmentally in the first
 

6271
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,790
is made developmentally in the first
three days of differentiation of your

6272
01:46:52,790 --> 01:46:52,800
three days of differentiation of your
 

6273
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,990
three days of differentiation of your
adipocytes so

6274
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:54,000
adipocytes so
 

6275
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,669
adipocytes so
as they're differentiating you basically

6276
01:46:55,669 --> 01:46:55,679
as they're differentiating you basically
 

6277
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:57,510
as they're differentiating you basically
can choose to make fat burning machines

6278
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:57,520
can choose to make fat burning machines
 

6279
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,590
can choose to make fat burning machines
or fat storing machines and sort of

6280
01:46:59,590 --> 01:46:59,600
or fat storing machines and sort of
 

6281
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,070
or fat storing machines and sort of
that's how you populate your your fat

6282
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:02,080
that's how you populate your your fat
 

6283
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,669
that's how you populate your your fat
you basically can now go in

6284
01:47:03,669 --> 01:47:03,679
you basically can now go in
 

6285
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:05,510
you basically can now go in
pharmaceutically and do all of that

6286
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:05,520
pharmaceutically and do all of that
 

6287
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,709
pharmaceutically and do all of that
and in our paper we actually did all of

6288
01:47:08,709 --> 01:47:08,719
and in our paper we actually did all of
 

6289
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:09,189
and in our paper we actually did all of
that

6290
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:09,199
that
 

6291
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:11,030
that
we went in and manipulated every single

6292
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:11,040
we went in and manipulated every single
 

6293
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,510
we went in and manipulated every single
aspect at the nucleotide level

6294
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:13,520
aspect at the nucleotide level
 

6295
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:16,149
aspect at the nucleotide level
we used crispr cast 9 genome editing to

6296
01:47:16,149 --> 01:47:16,159
we used crispr cast 9 genome editing to
 

6297
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:16,870
we used crispr cast 9 genome editing to
basically take

6298
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:16,880
basically take
 

6299
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,109
basically take
primary adipocytes from risk and

6300
01:47:19,109 --> 01:47:19,119
primary adipocytes from risk and
 

6301
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:20,550
primary adipocytes from risk and
non-risk individuals

6302
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:20,560
non-risk individuals
 

6303
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:23,030
non-risk individuals
and show that by editing that one

6304
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:23,040
and show that by editing that one
 

6305
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,790
and show that by editing that one
nucleotide out of 3.2 billion

6306
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:24,800
nucleotide out of 3.2 billion
 

6307
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,550
nucleotide out of 3.2 billion
nucleotides in the human genome

6308
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:26,560
nucleotides in the human genome
 

6309
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,109
nucleotides in the human genome
you could then flip between an obese

6310
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:29,119
you could then flip between an obese
 

6311
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:30,470
you could then flip between an obese
phenotype and a lean phenotype like a

6312
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:30,480
phenotype and a lean phenotype like a
 

6313
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,270
phenotype and a lean phenotype like a
switch

6314
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:31,280
switch
 

6315
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:33,430

you can basically take a micelles that

6316
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:33,440
you can basically take a micelles that
 

6317
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,790
you can basically take a micelles that
are non-thermogenizing

6318
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:34,800
are non-thermogenizing
 

6319
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,229
are non-thermogenizing
and just flipping to thermogenizing

6320
01:47:36,229 --> 01:47:36,239
and just flipping to thermogenizing
 

6321
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:38,390
and just flipping to thermogenizing
cells by changing one nucleotide

6322
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:38,400

diseases what are
 

6335
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,870
diseases what are
so 2007 you mentioned 2000 what are the

6336
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:54,880
so 2007 you mentioned 2000 what are the
 

6337
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:55,830
so 2007 you mentioned 2000 what are the
technologies

6338
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:55,840
technologies
 

6339
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:59,189
technologies
the tools that came along that made this

6340
01:47:59,189 --> 01:47:59,199
the tools that came along that made this
 

6341
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:00,229
the tools that came along that made this
possible like what

6342
01:48:00,229 --> 01:48:00,239
possible like what
 

6343
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,149
possible like what
what are you excited about maybe if we

6344
01:48:02,149 --> 01:48:02,159
what are you excited about maybe if we
 

6345
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:04,310
what are you excited about maybe if we
just look at the buffet of things that

6346
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:04,320
just look at the buffet of things that
 

6347
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:05,830
just look at the buffet of things that
you've kind of mentioned is there is

6348
01:48:05,830 --> 01:48:05,840
you've kind of mentioned is there is
 

6349
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,830
you've kind of mentioned is there is
this what's involved

6350
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:07,840
this what's involved
 

6351
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,590
this what's involved
what should we be excited about what are

6352
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:09,600
what should we be excited about what are
 

6353
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,430
what should we be excited about what are
you excited about

6354
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:11,440
you excited about
 

6355
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,030

i love that question because there's so
 

6357
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,470
i love that question because there's so
much ahead of us there's so

6358
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:14,480
much ahead of us there's so
 

6359
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:17,750
much ahead of us there's so
so much um there's

6360
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:17,760
so much um there's
 

6361
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,990
so much um there's
uh so so basically solving that one

6362

01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,870
know everything
you're referring to i'm sorry this one

6416
01:49:08,870 --> 01:49:08,880
you're referring to i'm sorry this one
 

6417
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,390
you're referring to i'm sorry this one
basically yeah this one piece

6418
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:10,400
basically yeah this one piece
 

6419
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,750
basically yeah this one piece
this one single paper at least one

6420
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:11,760
this one single paper at least one
 

6421
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,589
this one single paper at least one
single locus i like to say that this is

6422
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:13,599
single locus i like to say that this is
 

6423
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:15,669
single locus i like to say that this is
a paper about one nucleotide in the

6424
01:49:15,669 --> 01:49:15,679
a paper about one nucleotide in the
 

6425
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,189
a paper about one nucleotide in the
human genome about one bit of

6426
01:49:17,189 --> 01:49:17,199
human genome about one bit of
 

6427
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:17,910
human genome about one bit of
information

6428
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:17,920
information
 

6429
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,550
information
c versus t in the human genome that's

6430
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:20,560
c versus t in the human genome that's
 

6431
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,709
c versus t in the human genome that's
one bit of information and we have 3.2

6432
01:49:22,709 --> 01:49:22,719
one bit of information and we have 3.2
 

6433
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:23,350
one bit of information and we have 3.2
billion

6434
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:23,360
billion
 

6435
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:25,589
billion
nucleotides to go through so how do you

6436
01:49:25,589 --> 01:49:25,599
nucleotides to go through so how do you
 

6437
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:29,109
nucleotides to go through so how do you
do that systematically

6438
01:49:29,109 --> 01:49:29,119
do that systematically
 

6439
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:31,430
do that systematically
i am so excited about the next phase of

6440
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:31,440
i am so excited about the next phase of
 

6441
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,310
i am so excited about the next phase of
research

6442
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:32,320
research
 

6443
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,870
research
because the technologies that my group

6444
01:49:34,870 --> 01:49:34,880
because the technologies that my group
 

6445
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,470
because the technologies that my group
and many other groups have developed

6446
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:36,480
and many other groups have developed
 

6447
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,950
and many other groups have developed
allows us to now do this systematically

6448
01:49:38,950 --> 01:49:38,960
allows us to now do this systematically
 

6449
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,070
allows us to now do this systematically
not just one

6450
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,080
not just one
 

6451
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:43,510
not just one
locus at a time but thousands of loci

6452
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:43,520
locus at a time but thousands of loci
 

6453
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:45,990
locus at a time but thousands of loci
at a time so let me describe some of

6454
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:46,000
at a time so let me describe some of
 

6455
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,830
at a time so let me describe some of
these technologies

6456
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:47,840
these technologies
 

6457
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,229
these technologies
the first one is automation and robotics

6458
01:49:52,229 --> 01:49:52,239
the first one is automation and robotics
 

6459
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:54,629
the first one is automation and robotics
so basically you know we talked about

6460
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:54,639
so basically you know we talked about
 

6461
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:56,310
so basically you know we talked about
how you can take

6462
01:49:56,310 --> 01:49:56,320
how you can take
 

6463
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,390
how you can take
all of these molecules and see which of

6464
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:58,400
all of these molecules and see which of
 

6465
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,070
all of these molecules and see which of
these molecules are targeting each of

6466
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:00,080
these molecules are targeting each of
 

6467
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,910
these molecules are targeting each of
these genes and what do they do

6468
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:01,920
these genes and what do they do
 

6469
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,149
these genes and what do they do
so you can basically now screen through

6470
01:50:04,149 --> 01:50:04,159
so you can basically now screen through
 

6471
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:06,310
so you can basically now screen through
millions of molecules

6472
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:06,320
millions of molecules
 

6473
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,750
millions of molecules
through thousands and thousands and

6474
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:07,760
through thousands and thousands and
 

6475
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,830
through thousands and thousands and
thousands of plates each of which has

6476
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:09,840
thousands of plates each of which has
 

6477
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,350
thousands of plates each of which has
thousands and thousands and thousands of

6478
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:11,360
thousands and thousands and thousands of
 

6479
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,629
thousands and thousands and thousands of
molecules

6480
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:12,639
molecules
 

6481
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:16,229
molecules
every single time testing um you know

6482
01:50:16,229 --> 01:50:16,239
every single time testing um you know
 

6483
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:19,750
every single time testing um you know
all of these genes and asking

6484
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:19,760
all of these genes and asking
 

6485
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,109
all of these genes and asking
which of these molecules perturb these

6486
01:50:21,109 --> 01:50:21,119
which of these molecules perturb these
 

6487
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,109
which of these molecules perturb these
genes so that's technology number one

6488
01:50:23,109 --> 01:50:23,119
genes so that's technology number one
 

6489
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,910
genes so that's technology number one
automation and robotics technology

6490
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:25,920
automation and robotics technology
 

6491
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:26,629
automation and robotics technology
number two

6492
01:50:26,629 --> 01:50:26,639
number two
 

6493
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:29,589
number two
is parallel readouts so instead of

6494
01:50:29,589 --> 01:50:29,599
is parallel readouts so instead of
 

6495
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:32,149
is parallel readouts so instead of
perturbing one locus

6496
01:50:32,149 --> 01:50:32,159
perturbing one locus
 

6497
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:34,310
perturbing one locus
and then asking if i use crispr cast 9

6498
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:34,320
and then asking if i use crispr cast 9
 

6499
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,830
and then asking if i use crispr cast 9
on this enhancer

6500
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:35,840
on this enhancer
 

6501
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,390
on this enhancer
to basically use dcas9 to turn on or

6502
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:38,400
to basically use dcas9 to turn on or
 

6503
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,510
to basically use dcas9 to turn on or
turn off the enhancer

6504
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:39,520
turn off the enhancer
 

6505
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,990
turn off the enhancer
or if i use crystal cast 9 on the snip

6506
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,000
or if i use crystal cast 9 on the snip
 

6507
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,430
or if i use crystal cast 9 on the snip
to basically change

6508
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440
to basically change
 

6509
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,030
to basically change
that one snip at a time then what

6510
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:45,040
that one snip at a time then what
 

6511
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,629
that one snip at a time then what
happens but we have

6512
01:50:47,629 --> 01:50:47,639
happens but we have
 

6513
01:50:47,639 --> 01:50:51,270
happens but we have
120 000 disease associated snips that we

6514
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,280
120 000 disease associated snips that we
 

6515
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,149
120 000 disease associated snips that we
want to test

6516
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:52,159
want to test
 

6517
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:54,229
want to test
we want we don't want to spend 120 000

6518
01:50:54,229 --> 01:50:54,239
we want we don't want to spend 120 000
 

6519
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:57,030
we want we don't want to spend 120 000
years doing it

6520
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:57,040
years doing it
 

6521
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,270
years doing it
so what do we do we've basically

6522
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,280
so what do we do we've basically
 

6523
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,270
so what do we do we've basically
developed this technology

6524
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:01,280
developed this technology
 

6525
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:04,310
developed this technology
for massively parallel reporter

6526
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:04,320
for massively parallel reporter
 

6527
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,830
for massively parallel reporter
assays mpra so in collaboration with

6528
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:07,840

6531
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:11,669
tarzan mickelson mary flanders i mean
jason dura's group has done a lot of

6532
01:51:11,669 --> 01:51:11,679
jason dura's group has done a lot of
 

6533
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:12,550
jason dura's group has done a lot of
that so there's

6534
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:12,560
that so there's
 

6535
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,910
that so there's
there's a lot of groups that basically

6536
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:13,920
there's a lot of groups that basically
 

6537
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,990
there's a lot of groups that basically
have developed technologies

6538
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:16,000
have developed technologies
 

6539
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,149
have developed technologies
for testing 10 000 genetic variants at a

6540
01:51:20,149 --> 01:51:20,159
for testing 10 000 genetic variants at a
 

6541
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:21,189
for testing 10 000 genetic variants at a
time

6542
01:51:21,189 --> 01:51:21,199
time
 

6543
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:23,750
time
how do you do that you you know we

6544
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:23,760
how do you do that you you know we
 

6545
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24,310
how do you do that you you know we
talked about

6546
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:24,320
talked about
 

6547
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,629
talked about
micro array technology the ability to

6548
01:51:26,629 --> 01:51:26,639
micro array technology the ability to
 

6549

6551
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:29,669
synthesize
these huge microarrays that allow you to

6552
01:51:29,669 --> 01:51:29,679
these huge microarrays that allow you to
 

6553
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:31,350
these huge microarrays that allow you to
do all kinds of things like measure gene

6554
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:31,360
do all kinds of things like measure gene
 

6555
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,669
do all kinds of things like measure gene
expression by hybridization

6556
01:51:33,669 --> 01:51:33,679
expression by hybridization
 

6557
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:36,310
expression by hybridization
by measuring the genotype of a person by

6558
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:36,320
by measuring the genotype of a person by
 

6559
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:37,750
by measuring the genotype of a person by
looking at hybridization with one

6560
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:37,760
looking at hybridization with one
 

6561
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,189
looking at hybridization with one
version with a t versus the other

6562
01:51:39,189 --> 01:51:39,199
version with a t versus the other
 

6563
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:40,070
version with a t versus the other
version with the t

6564
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:40,080
version with the t
 

6565
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,070
version with the t
with an with a c and then sort of

6566
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:42,080
with an with a c and then sort of
 

6567
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,270
with an with a c and then sort of
figuring out that i am

6568
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:43,280
figuring out that i am
 

6569
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,830
figuring out that i am

differential hybridization in my genome
 

6575
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,629
differential hybridization in my genome
that says oh you seem to only have this

6576
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
that says oh you seem to only have this
 

6577
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,709
that says oh you seem to only have this
allele or you seem to have that allele

6578
01:51:52,709 --> 01:51:52,719
allele or you seem to have that allele

6591
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,629
across 450 000 spots at a time
you can now take the result of that

6592
01:52:12,629 --> 01:52:12,639
you can now take the result of that
 

6593
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:14,070

same start piece
 

6625
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:49,589
same start piece
for all of them and you can now use

6626
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:49,599
for all of them and you can now use
 

6627
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:52,149
for all of them and you can now use
plasmids which are these extra

6628
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:52,159

small dna circular segments
 

6633
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:59,669
small dna circular segments
that are basically inhabiting all our

6634
01:52:59,669 --> 01:52:59,679
that are basically inhabiting all our
 

6635
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:01,350

all our genomes we basically have

6636
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:01,360
all our genomes we basically have
 

6637
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,109
all our genomes we basically have
you know plasmids floating around i mean

6638
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:03,119
you know plasmids floating around i mean
 

6639
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:05,189
you know plasmids floating around i mean
bacteria use plasmids

6640
01:53:05,189 --> 01:53:05,199
bacteria use plasmids
 

6641
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:07,270
bacteria use plasmids
for transferring dna and that's where

6642
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:07,280
for transferring dna and that's where
 

6643
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,510
for transferring dna and that's where
they put a lot of antibiotic resistance

6644
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:09,520
they put a lot of antibiotic resistance
 

6645
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,910
they put a lot of antibiotic resistance
genes so they can easily transfer them

6646
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:11,920
genes so they can easily transfer them
 

6647
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,910
genes so they can easily transfer them
from one but one bacterium to the other

6648
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:13,920
from one but one bacterium to the other
 

6649
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,310
from one but one bacterium to the other
so one bacterium involves a gene to be

6650
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:16,320
so one bacterium involves a gene to be
 

6651
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,270
so one bacterium involves a gene to be
resistant to

6652
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:17,280
resistant to
 

6653
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:19,990
resistant to
a particular antibiotic it basically

6654
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:20,000
a particular antibiotic it basically
 

6655
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,510
a particular antibiotic it basically
says to all its friends hey

6656
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:21,520
says to all its friends hey
 

6657
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:25,030
says to all its friends hey
here's that sort of dna piece we can now

6658
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:25,040
here's that sort of dna piece we can now
 

6659
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:25,589
here's that sort of dna piece we can now
co-opt

6660
01:53:25,589 --> 01:53:25,599
co-opt
 

6661
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:28,470
co-opt
these plasmids into human cells you can

6662
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:28,480
these plasmids into human cells you can
 

6663
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:28,950
these plasmids into human cells you can
basically

6664
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:28,960
basically
 

6665
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,350
basically
make a human cell culture and add

6666
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:31,360
make a human cell culture and add
 

6667
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,149
make a human cell culture and add
plasmids

6668
01:53:32,149 --> 01:53:32,159
plasmids
 

6669
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:35,830
plasmids
to that human cell culture that contain

01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:35,840
to that human cell culture that contain
 

6671
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,229
to that human cell culture that contain
the things that you want to test you now

6672
01:53:38,229 --> 01:53:38,239
the things that you want to test you now
 

6673
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:41,109
the things that you want to test you now
have this library of 450 000 elements

6674
01:53:41,109 --> 01:53:41,119
have this library of 450 000 elements
 

6675
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:43,589
have this library of 450 000 elements
you can insert them each into the common

6676
01:53:43,589 --> 01:53:43,599
you can insert them each into the common
 

6677
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:45,109
you can insert them each into the common
plasmid yeah

6678
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:45,119
plasmid yeah
 

6679
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:47,510
plasmid yeah
and then test them in millions of cells

6680
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:47,520
and then test them in millions of cells
 

6681
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,149
and then test them in millions of cells
in parallel

6682
01:53:48,149 --> 01:53:48,159
in parallel
 

6683
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:50,070
in parallel
and the common plasmid is all the same

6684
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:50,080
and the common plasmid is all the same
 

6685
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,750
and the common plasmid is all the same
before you add it exactly the rest of

6686
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:51,760
before you add it exactly the rest of
 

6687
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,109
before you add it exactly the rest of
the plasmid is the same

6688
01:53:53,109 --> 01:53:53,119
the plasmid is the same
 

6689
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:56,149
the plasmid is the same
so it's it's called an episomal reporter

6690
01:53:56,149 --> 01:53:56,159
so it's it's called an episomal reporter
 

6691
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:57,109
so it's it's called an episomal reporter
assay

6692
01:53:57,109 --> 01:53:57,119
assay
 

6693
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:59,589
assay
episome means not inside the genome it's

6694
01:53:59,589 --> 01:53:59,599
episome means not inside the genome it's
 

6695
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:00,629
episome means not inside the genome it's
sort of outside

6696
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:00,639
sort of outside
 

6697
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:03,109
sort of outside
the chromosomes so it's an episomal

6698
01:54:03,109 --> 01:54:03,119
the chromosomes so it's an episomal
 

6699
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:03,669
the chromosomes so it's an episomal
assay

6700
01:54:03,669 --> 01:54:03,679
assay
 

6701
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:05,030
assay
that allows you to have a variable

6702
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:05,040
that allows you to have a variable
 

6703
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,109
that allows you to have a variable
region where you basically test

6704
01:54:07,109 --> 01:54:07,119

10 000 different enhancers and you have

6706
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:09,840
10 000 different enhancers and you have
 

6707
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,430
10 000 different enhancers and you have
a common region which basically has the

6708
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:11,440
a common region which basically has the
 

6709
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,430
a common region which basically has the
same reporter gene

the 450 000
 

6717
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:21,030
the 450 000
elements that you've generated and and

6718
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:21,040
elements that you've generated and and
 

6719
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,550
elements that you've generated and and
you have a piece of the puzzle here a

6720
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:22,560
you have a piece of the puzzle here a
 

6721
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:23,669
you have a piece of the puzzle here a
piece of the puzzle here which is

6722
01:54:23,669 --> 01:54:23,679
piece of the puzzle here which is
 

6723
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:24,870
piece of the puzzle here which is
identical so they're

6724
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:24,880
identical so they're
 

6725
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:27,109
identical so they're
compatible with that plasmid you can

6726
01:54:27,109 --> 01:54:27,119
compatible with that plasmid you can
 

6727
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:28,550
compatible with that plasmid you can
chop them up in the middle

6728
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:28,560
chop them up in the middle
 

6729
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:31,589
chop them up in the middle
to separate a barcode reporter from the

6769
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,910
how how hard is it to generate those
ten thousand uh trivial trivial but it's

6770
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:13,920
ten thousand uh trivial trivial but it's
 

6771

no no generating the ten thousand is

6774
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:16,480
no no generating the ten thousand is
 

6775
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,070
no no generating the ten thousand is
trivial because you basically

6776
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:18,080
trivial because you basically
 

6777
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,350
trivial because you basically
add it by technology you basically have

6778
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:21,360
add it by technology you basically have
 

6779
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:22,629

these arrays
 

6781
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,790
these arrays
that that add one nucleotide at a time

6782
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:24,800
that that add one nucleotide at a time
 

6783
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,669
that that add one nucleotide at a time
at every spot

01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,840
oh and yeah so it's printing in it so
 

6787
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:28,709
oh and yeah so it's printing in it so
you're able to

6788
01:55:28,709 --> 01:55:28,719
you're able to
 

6789
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:31,750
you're able to
you're able to control yeah uh super

is it ten thousand bucks so this isn't

6794
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,040
is it ten thousand bucks so this isn't
 

6795
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:35,750
is it ten thousand bucks so this isn't
millions

experiments sounds like the right you

6800
01:55:38,709 --> 01:55:38,719
experiments sounds like the right you
 

6801
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:39,510
experiments sounds like the right you
know

6802
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:39,520
know
 

6803
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,910
know
i mean so that's super that's exciting

6804
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:41,920
i mean so that's super that's exciting
 

6805
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:42,950
i mean so that's super that's exciting
because you don't have to do one thing

6806
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:42,960
because you don't have to do one thing
 

6807
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:43,910
because you don't have to do one thing
at a time yeah

6808
01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:43,920
at a time yeah
 

6809
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:45,589
at a time yeah
you can now use that technology these

6810
01:55:45,589 --> 01:55:45,599
you can now use that technology these
 

6811
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:47,430
you can now use that technology these
massively parallel reporter assays to

6812
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:47,440
massively parallel reporter assays to
 

6813
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,149
massively parallel reporter assays to
test

6814
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:48,159
test
 

6815
01:55:48,159 --> 01:55:52,149
test
10 000 locations at a time we've

6816
01:55:52,149 --> 01:55:52,159
10 000 locations at a time we've
 

6817
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:53,830
10 000 locations at a time we've
made multiple modifications of that

6818
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:53,840
made multiple modifications of that
 

6819
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,750
made multiple modifications of that
technology one was

6820
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:55,760
technology one was
 

6821
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:59,030
technology one was
sharper mpra which stands for

6822
01:55:59,030 --> 01:55:59,040
sharper mpra which stands for
 

6823
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:02,709
sharper mpra which stands for
you know basically getting

6824
01:56:02,709 --> 01:56:02,719
you know basically getting
 

6825
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:06,310
you know basically getting
a higher resolution view by tiling

6826
01:56:06,310 --> 01:56:06,320
a higher resolution view by tiling
 

6827
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:09,350
a higher resolution view by tiling
these um these elements

6828
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:09,360
these um these elements
 

6829
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,390
these um these elements
so you can see where along the

6830
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:12,400
so you can see where along the
 

6831
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,830
so you can see where along the
region of control are they acting

6832
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:15,840
region of control are they acting
 

6833
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,589
region of control are they acting
and we made another modification called

6834
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:17,599
and we made another modification called
 

6835
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:19,109
and we made another modification called
hydra for

6836
01:56:19,109 --> 01:56:19,119
hydra for
 

6837
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:23,750
hydra for
high you know definition regulatory

6838
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:23,760
high you know definition regulatory
 

6839
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,510
high you know definition regulatory
annotation or something like that which

6840
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:25,520
annotation or something like that which
 

6841
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,589
annotation or something like that which
basically allows you to

6842
01:56:27,589 --> 01:56:27,599
basically allows you to
 

6843
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:30,550
basically allows you to
test seven million of these at a time by

6844
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:30,560
test seven million of these at a time by
 

6845
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:31,990
test seven million of these at a time by
sort of cutting them directly from the

6846
01:56:31,990 --> 01:56:32,000
sort of cutting them directly from the
 

6847
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:32,709
sort of cutting them directly from the
dna

6848
01:56:32,709 --> 01:56:32,719
dna
 

6849
01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:34,390
dna
so instead of synthesizing which

6850
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:34,400
so instead of synthesizing which
 

6851
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,790
so instead of synthesizing which
basically has the limit of 450 000 that

6852
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:36,800
basically has the limit of 450 000 that
 

6853
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,070
basically has the limit of 450 000 that
you can synthesize at a time

6854
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:38,080
you can synthesize at a time
 

6855
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,149
you can synthesize at a time
we basically said hey if we want to test

6856
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:40,159
we basically said hey if we want to test
 

6857
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:42,310
we basically said hey if we want to test
all accessible regions of the genome

6858
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:42,320
all accessible regions of the genome
 

6859
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,070
all accessible regions of the genome
let's just do an experiment that cuts

6860
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:44,080
let's just do an experiment that cuts
 

6861
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,350
let's just do an experiment that cuts
accessible regions

6862
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:45,360
accessible regions
 

6863
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,750
accessible regions
let's take those accessible regions put

6864
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:47,760
let's take those accessible regions put
 

6865
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,830
let's take those accessible regions put
them all with the same end

6866
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:49,840
them all with the same end
 

6867
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:52,149
them all with the same end
joints of the puzzles and then now use

6868
01:56:52,149 --> 01:56:52,159
joints of the puzzles and then now use
 

6869
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:53,589
joints of the puzzles and then now use
those to create

6870
01:56:53,589 --> 01:56:53,599
those to create
 

6871
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:56,629
those to create
a much much larger much much larger

6872
01:56:56,629 --> 01:56:56,639
a much much larger much much larger
 

6873
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:59,589
a much much larger much much larger
uh array of things that you can test and

6874
01:56:59,589 --> 01:56:59,599
uh array of things that you can test and
 

6875
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:01,430
uh array of things that you can test and
then tiling all of these regions you can

6876
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:01,440
then tiling all of these regions you can
 

6877
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,790
then tiling all of these regions you can
then pinpoint what are the driver

6878
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:02,800
then pinpoint what are the driver
 

6879
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:03,910
then pinpoint what are the driver
nucleotides

6880
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:03,920
nucleotides
 

6881
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,430
nucleotides
what are the elements how are they

6882
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:05,440
what are the elements how are they
 

6883
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:06,950
what are the elements how are they
acting across seven million experiments

6884
01:57:06,950 --> 01:57:06,960
acting across seven million experiments
 

6885
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:07,990
acting across seven million experiments
at a time so basically

6886
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:08,000
at a time so basically
 

6887
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,149
at a time so basically
this is all the same family of

6888
01:57:10,149 --> 01:57:10,159
this is all the same family of
 

6889
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:12,149
this is all the same family of
technology where you're basically using

6890
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:12,159
technology where you're basically using
 

6891
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:12,550
technology where you're basically using
these

6892
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:12,560
these
 

6893
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,669
these
parallel readouts of the barcodes

6894
01:57:15,669 --> 01:57:15,679
parallel readouts of the barcodes
 

6895
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:18,870
parallel readouts of the barcodes
and then you know to do this we used a

6896
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:18,880
and then you know to do this we used a
 

6897
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,910
and then you know to do this we used a
technology called starseek for

6898
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:20,920
technology called starseek for
 

6899
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:23,510
technology called starseek for
self-transcribing uh reporter asses a

6900
01:57:23,510 --> 01:57:23,520

technology developed by alex stark

6902
01:57:25,510 --> 01:57:25,520
technology developed by alex stark
 

6903
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:28,709
technology developed by alex stark
my my former postdoc who's now api over

6904
01:57:28,709 --> 01:57:28,719
my my former postdoc who's now api over
 

6905
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:32,070
my my former postdoc who's now api over
in vienna so we basically coupled the

6906
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:32,080
in vienna so we basically coupled the
 

6907
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,990
in vienna so we basically coupled the
starsig the self-transcribing

6908
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:34,000
starsig the self-transcribing
 

6909
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,109
starsig the self-transcribing
uh reporters where the enhancer

6910
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119
uh reporters where the enhancer
 

6911
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:39,270
uh reporters where the enhancer
can be part of the the gene itself so

6912
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:39,280
can be part of the the gene itself so
 

6913
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:40,870
can be part of the the gene itself so
instead of having a separate barcode

6914
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:40,880
instead of having a separate barcode
 

6915
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:42,950
instead of having a separate barcode
that enhancer basically acts to turn on

6916
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:42,960
that enhancer basically acts to turn on
 

6917
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:45,030
that enhancer basically acts to turn on
the gene and it's transcribed

6918
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:45,040
the gene and it's transcribed
 

6919
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,310
the gene and it's transcribed
as part of the gene so you don't have to

6920
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:46,320
as part of the gene so you don't have to
 

6921
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:47,910
as part of the gene so you don't have to
have the two separate parts exactly so

6922
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:47,920
have the two separate parts exactly so
 

6923
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:48,950
have the two separate parts exactly so
you can just read them

6924
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:48,960
you can just read them
 

6925
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,350
you can just read them
so there's a constant improvements in

6926
01:57:51,350 --> 01:57:51,360
so there's a constant improvements in
 

6927
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,470
so there's a constant improvements in
this whole process yes

6928
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:52,480
this whole process yes
 

6929
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,629
this whole process yes
by the way generating all these options

6930
01:57:54,629 --> 01:57:54,639
by the way generating all these options
 

6931
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:56,550
by the way generating all these options
are is it basically brute force

6932
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:56,560
are is it basically brute force
 

6933
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:59,189
are is it basically brute force
uh how much human intuition is oh gosh

6934
01:57:59,189 --> 01:57:59,199
uh how much human intuition is oh gosh
 

6935
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:01,030
uh how much human intuition is oh gosh
of course it's human intuition

6936
01:58:01,030 --> 01:58:01,040
of course it's human intuition
 

6937
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,350
of course it's human intuition

3.2 billion you don't want to test that
 

6947
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,149
3.2 billion you don't want to test that
instead you basically use all of these

10 000 hypothesis and then you go and

6956
01:58:18,709 --> 01:58:18,719
10 000 hypothesis and then you go and
 

6957
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:20,470
10 000 hypothesis and then you go and
test all ten thousand and then from what

6958
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:20,480
test all ten thousand and then from what
 

6959
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,070
test all ten thousand and then from what
what comes out you can then go go to the

6960
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:22,080
what comes out you can then go go to the
 

6961
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,830

so that's technology number two so

6964
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:25,840
so that's technology number two so
 

6965
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,830
so that's technology number two so
technology one number one is robotics

sequencing so basically before

7006
01:59:11,189 --> 01:59:11,199
sequencing so basically before
 

7007
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:13,189
sequencing so basically before
rna expression profiling was based on

7008
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:13,199
rna expression profiling was based on
 

7009
01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:14,470
rna expression profiling was based on
this microarrays

7010
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:14,480
this microarrays
 

7011
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:16,390
this microarrays
the next technology after that was based

7012
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:16,400
the next technology after that was based
 

7013
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,870
the next technology after that was based
on sequencing so you chop up your rna

7014
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:18,880
on sequencing so you chop up your rna
 

7015
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,350
on sequencing so you chop up your rna
and you just sequence small molecules

7016
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:21,360
and you just sequence small molecules
 

7017
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:22,229
and you just sequence small molecules
just like you

7018
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:22,239
just like you
 

7019
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:24,070
just like you
would sequence the genome basically

7020
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:24,080
would sequence the genome basically
 

7021
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,910
would sequence the genome basically
reverse transcribe the small rnas

7022
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:25,920
reverse transcribe the small rnas
 

7023
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:28,950
reverse transcribe the small rnas
into dna and you sequence that dna

7024
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:28,960
into dna and you sequence that dna
 

7025
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,229
into dna and you sequence that dna
in order to get the number of sequencing

7026
01:59:32,229 --> 01:59:32,239
in order to get the number of sequencing

you now have rna sequencing how do you

7034
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:39,760
you now have rna sequencing how do you
 

7035
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:42,229
you now have rna sequencing how do you
go to single cell rna sequencing

7036
01:59:42,229 --> 01:59:42,239
go to single cell rna sequencing
 

7037
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:44,310
go to single cell rna sequencing
that technology also went through stages

7038
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:44,320
that technology also went through stages
 

7039
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,750
that technology also went through stages
of evolution

7040
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:45,760

7041
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,149
of evolution
the first was microfluidics you

7042
01:59:48,149 --> 01:59:48,159
the first was microfluidics you
 

7043
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:49,350
the first was microfluidics you
basically had

7044
01:59:49,350 --> 01:59:49,360
basically had
 

7045
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:51,350
basically had
these or even even chambers you

7046
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:51,360
these or even even chambers you
 

7047
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:52,950
these or even even chambers you
basically had these ways of isolating

7048
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:52,960
basically had these ways of isolating
 

7049
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,070
basically had these ways of isolating
individual cells

7050
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:54,080
individual cells
 

7051
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:56,229
individual cells
putting them into a well for every one

7052
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:56,239
putting them into a well for every one
 

7053
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:57,109
putting them into a well for every one
of these cells

7054
01:59:57,109 --> 01:59:57,119
of these cells
 

7055
01:59:57,119 --> 01:59:59,750
of these cells
so you have 384 well plates and you know

7056
01:59:59,750 --> 01:59:59,760
so you have 384 well plates and you know
 

7057
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:00,870
so you have 384 well plates and you know
do 384

7058
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:00,880
do 384
 

7059
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,870
do 384
parallel reactions to measure the

7060
02:00:02,870 --> 02:00:02,880
parallel reactions to measure the
 

7061
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:05,430
parallel reactions to measure the
expression of 384 cells

7062
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:05,440
expression of 384 cells
 

7063
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:08,070
expression of 384 cells
that sounds amazing and it was amazing

7064
02:00:08,070 --> 02:00:08,080
that sounds amazing and it was amazing
 

7065
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:09,589
that sounds amazing and it was amazing
but we want to do

7066
02:00:09,589 --> 02:00:09,599
but we want to do
 

7067
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:12,550
but we want to do
a million cells how do you go from you

7068
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,560
a million cells how do you go from you
 

7069
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:14,149
a million cells how do you go from you
know these wells to a million cells you

7070
02:00:14,149 --> 02:00:14,159
know these wells to a million cells you
 

7071
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:15,430
know these wells to a million cells you
can't

7072
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:15,440
can't
 

7073
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,430
can't
so what what what the next technology

7074
02:00:17,430 --> 02:00:17,440
so what what what the next technology
 

7075
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:18,550
so what what what the next technology
was after that

7076
02:00:18,550 --> 02:00:18,560
was after that
 

7077
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:20,629
was after that
is instead of using a well for every

7078
02:00:20,629 --> 02:00:20,639
is instead of using a well for every
 

7079
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:22,070
is instead of using a well for every
reaction you now

7080
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:22,080
reaction you now
 

7081
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:26,149
reaction you now
use a lipid droplet for every reaction

7082
02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:26,159
use a lipid droplet for every reaction
 

7083
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:29,270
use a lipid droplet for every reaction
so you use micro droplets as reaction

7084
02:00:29,270 --> 02:00:29,280
so you use micro droplets as reaction
 

7085
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:30,229
so you use micro droplets as reaction
chambers

7086
02:00:30,229 --> 02:00:30,239
chambers
 

7087
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:33,430
chambers
to basically amplify rna

7088
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:33,440
to basically amplify rna
 

7089
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,589
to basically amplify rna
so here's the idea you basically have

7090
02:00:35,589 --> 02:00:35,599
so here's the idea you basically have
 

7091
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:37,350
so here's the idea you basically have
microfluidics where you basically have

7092
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:37,360
microfluidics where you basically have
 

7093
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,629
microfluidics where you basically have
every single cell

7094
02:00:38,629 --> 02:00:38,639
every single cell
 

7095
02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:40,149
every single cell
coming down one tube in your

7096
02:00:40,149 --> 02:00:40,159
coming down one tube in your
 

7097
02:00:40,159 --> 02:00:42,310
coming down one tube in your
microfluidics and you have little

7098
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:42,320
microfluidics and you have little
 

7099
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:44,550
microfluidics and you have little
bubbles getting created in the other way

7100
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:44,560
bubbles getting created in the other way
 

7101
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,950
bubbles getting created in the other way
with specific primers that mark every

7102
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:46,960
with specific primers that mark every
 

7103
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,109
with specific primers that mark every
cell with its own barcode

7104
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:49,119
cell with its own barcode
 

7105
02:00:49,119 --> 02:00:51,109
cell with its own barcode
you basically couple the two and you end

7106
02:00:51,109 --> 02:00:51,119
you basically couple the two and you end
 

7107
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:53,270
you basically couple the two and you end
up with little bubbles that have

7108
02:00:53,270 --> 02:00:53,280
up with little bubbles that have
 

7109
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:57,189
up with little bubbles that have
a cell and tons of markers for that cell

7110
02:00:57,189 --> 02:00:57,199
a cell and tons of markers for that cell
 

7111
02:00:57,199 --> 02:00:59,350
a cell and tons of markers for that cell
you now mark up all of the rna for that

7112
02:00:59,350 --> 02:00:59,360
you now mark up all of the rna for that
 

7113
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:02,629
you now mark up all of the rna for that
one cell with the same exact barcode

7114
02:01:02,629 --> 02:01:02,639
one cell with the same exact barcode
 

7115
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:06,149
one cell with the same exact barcode
and you then lice all of the droplets

7116
02:01:06,149 --> 02:01:06,159
and you then lice all of the droplets
 

7117
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:08,070
and you then lice all of the droplets
and you sequence the heck out of that

7118
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:08,080
and you sequence the heck out of that
 

7119
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:10,229
and you sequence the heck out of that
and you have for every rna molecule

7120
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:10,239
and you have for every rna molecule
 

7121
02:01:10,239 --> 02:01:11,830
and you have for every rna molecule
a unique identifier that tells you what

7122
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:11,840
a unique identifier that tells you what
 

7123
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,510
a unique identifier that tells you what
cell was it on that is such good

7124
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:13,520
cell was it on that is such good
 

7125
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:14,589
cell was it on that is such good
engineering

7126
02:01:14,589 --> 02:01:14,599
engineering
 

7127
02:01:14,599 --> 02:01:18,229
engineering
microfluidics and uh

7128
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:18,239
microfluidics and uh
 

7129
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:20,070
microfluidics and uh
using some kind of primer to put it put

7130
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:20,080
using some kind of primer to put it put
 

7131
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:22,070
using some kind of primer to put it put
up put a label on the thing

7132
02:01:22,070 --> 02:01:22,080
up put a label on the thing
 

7133
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:23,669
up put a label on the thing
i mean i don't you're making it sound

7134
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:23,679
i mean i don't you're making it sound
 

7135
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:25,750
i mean i don't you're making it sound
easy i assume it's it's beautiful right

7136
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:25,760
easy i assume it's it's beautiful right
 

7137
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,189
easy i assume it's it's beautiful right
challenging but it's gorgeous yeah

7138
02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:27,199
challenging but it's gorgeous yeah
 

7139
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:28,390
challenging but it's gorgeous yeah
so there's the next generation

7140
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:28,400
so there's the next generation
 

7141
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,149
so there's the next generation
engineering yeah so that's the second

7142
02:01:30,149 --> 02:01:30,159
engineering yeah so that's the second
 

7143
02:01:30,159 --> 02:01:30,790
engineering yeah so that's the second
generation

7144
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:30,800
generation
 

7145
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,470
generation
next generation is forget the

7146
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:32,480
next generation is forget the
 

7147
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,390
next generation is forget the
microfluidics all together just use big

7148
02:01:34,390 --> 02:01:34,400
microfluidics all together just use big
 

7149
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:35,510
microfluidics all together just use big
bottles

7150
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:35,520
bottles
 

7151
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,950
bottles
how can you possibly do that with big

7152
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:36,960
how can you possibly do that with big
 

7153
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:39,189
how can you possibly do that with big
bottles so here's the idea

7154
02:01:39,189 --> 02:01:39,199
bottles so here's the idea
 

7155
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:41,350
bottles so here's the idea
you dissociate all of your cells or all

7156
02:01:41,350 --> 02:01:41,360
you dissociate all of your cells or all
 

7157
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:42,390
you dissociate all of your cells or all
of your nuclei

7158
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:42,400
of your nuclei
 

7159
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,629
of your nuclei
from complex cells like brain cells that

7160
02:01:44,629 --> 02:01:44,639
from complex cells like brain cells that
 

7161
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:46,390
from complex cells like brain cells that
you know are very long and sticky so you

7162
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:46,400
you know are very long and sticky so you
 

7163
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:47,510
you know are very long and sticky so you
can't do that

7164
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:47,520
can't do that
 

7165
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,030
can't do that
so you know if you have blood cells or

7166
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:49,040
so you know if you have blood cells or
 

7167
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:50,950
so you know if you have blood cells or
if you have you know neuronal nuclei or

7168
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:50,960
if you have you know neuronal nuclei or
 

7169
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:51,830
if you have you know neuronal nuclei or
brain nuclei

7170
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:51,840
brain nuclei
 

7171
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:54,550
brain nuclei
you can basically dissociate let's say a

7172
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:54,560
you can basically dissociate let's say a
 

7173
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:55,910
you can basically dissociate let's say a
million cells

7174
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:55,920
million cells
 

7175
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,870
million cells
you now want to add a unique barcode a

7176
02:01:58,870 --> 02:01:58,880
you now want to add a unique barcode a
 

7177
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,790
you now want to add a unique barcode a
unique barcode in each one of a million

7178
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:00,800
unique barcode in each one of a million
 

7179
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:01,430
unique barcode in each one of a million
cells

7180
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:01,440
cells
 

7181
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,830
cells
using only big bottles i can't possibly

7182
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:03,840
using only big bottles i can't possibly
 

7183
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:05,030
using only big bottles i can't possibly
do that sounds crazy

7184
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:05,040
do that sounds crazy
 

7185
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:07,910
do that sounds crazy
but here's the idea you use a hundred of

7186
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:07,920
but here's the idea you use a hundred of
 

7187
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,229
but here's the idea you use a hundred of
these bottles

7188
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:10,239
these bottles
 

7189
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:12,470
these bottles
you randomly shuffle all your million

7190
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:12,480
you randomly shuffle all your million
 

7191
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:13,350
you randomly shuffle all your million
cells

7192
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:13,360
cells
 

7193
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:14,470
cells
and you throw them into the hundred

7194
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:14,480
and you throw them into the hundred
 

7195
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:16,950
and you throw them into the hundred
bottles randomly completely random

7196
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:16,960
bottles randomly completely random
 

7197
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,070
bottles randomly completely random
you add one barcode out of 100 to every

7198
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:20,080
you add one barcode out of 100 to every
 

7199
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,350
you add one barcode out of 100 to every
one of those cells

7200
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:21,360
one of those cells
 

7201
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:23,510
one of those cells
you then you now take them all out you

7202
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:23,520
you then you now take them all out you
 

7203
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:24,629
you then you now take them all out you
shuffle them again

7204
02:02:24,629 --> 02:02:24,639
shuffle them again
 

7205
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:25,830
shuffle them again
and you throw them again into the same

7206
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:25,840
and you throw them again into the same
 

7207
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:28,229
and you throw them again into the same
hundred bottles

7208
02:02:28,229 --> 02:02:28,239
hundred bottles
 

7209
02:02:28,239 --> 02:02:31,510
hundred bottles
but now in a different randomization

7210
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:31,520
but now in a different randomization
 

7211
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,070
but now in a different randomization
and you add a second barcode so every

7212
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:34,080
and you add a second barcode so every
 

7213
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:34,870
and you add a second barcode so every
cell now has

7214
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:34,880
cell now has
 

7215
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:37,910
cell now has
two barcodes you take them out again

7216
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:37,920
two barcodes you take them out again
 

7217
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:39,589
two barcodes you take them out again
you shuffle them and you throw them back

7218
02:02:39,589 --> 02:02:39,599
you shuffle them and you throw them back
 

7219
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:41,589
you shuffle them and you throw them back
in another

7220
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
in another
 

7221
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,070
in another
third barcode is adding randomly from

7222
02:02:44,070 --> 02:02:44,080
third barcode is adding randomly from
 

7223
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:47,189
third barcode is adding randomly from
the same hundred barcodes

7224
02:02:47,189 --> 02:02:47,199
the same hundred barcodes
 

7225
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:50,149
the same hundred barcodes

how is the variance changing you can't
 

7327
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:25,109
how is the variance changing you can't
just

7328
02:04:25,109 --> 02:04:25,119
just
 

7329
02:04:25,119 --> 02:04:27,350
just
you know with a brain sample you can

7330
02:04:27,350 --> 02:04:27,360
you know with a brain sample you can
 

7331
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:28,709
you know with a brain sample you can
just ask about the mean

7332

02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,350
of which i have i don't know 300 cells
what is the variance

7348
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:45,360
what is the variance
 

7349
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:48,310
what is the variance
that this genetic variant has so

7350
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,320
that this genetic variant has so
 

7351
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:48,870
that this genetic variant has so
suddenly

7352
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:48,880
suddenly
 

7353
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,109
suddenly
it's amazingly more powerful i can

7354
02:04:51,109 --> 02:04:51,119
it's amazingly more powerful i can
 

7355
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:51,990
it's amazingly more powerful i can
basically start asking

7356
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:52,000
basically start asking
 

7357
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,189
basically start asking
about this middle layer of gene

7358
02:04:53,189 --> 02:04:53,199
about this middle layer of gene
 

7359
02:04:53,199 --> 02:04:55,990
about this middle layer of gene
expression at unprecedented levels

7360
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:56,000
expression at unprecedented levels
 

7361
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,109
expression at unprecedented levels
and when you look at the average it

7362
02:04:57,109 --> 02:04:57,119
and when you look at the average it
 

7363
02:04:57,119 --> 02:04:59,990
and when you look at the average it
washes out some potentially

7364
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:00,000
washes out some potentially
 

7365
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,629
washes out some potentially
important signal that corresponds to

7366
02:05:02,629 --> 02:05:02,639
important signal that corresponds to
 

7367
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:04,470
important signal that corresponds to
ultimately the disease completely

7368
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:04,480
ultimately the disease completely
 

7369
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:07,109
ultimately the disease completely
yeah so that i can do that at the rna

7370
02:05:07,109 --> 02:05:07,119
yeah so that i can do that at the rna
 

7371
02:05:07,119 --> 02:05:07,589
yeah so that i can do that at the rna
level

7372
02:05:07,589 --> 02:05:07,599
level
 

7373
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:09,910
level
but i can also do that at the dna level

7374
02:05:09,910 --> 02:05:09,920
but i can also do that at the dna level
 

7375
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:11,430
but i can also do that at the dna level
for the epigenome

7376
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:11,440
for the epigenome
 

7377
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:13,109
for the epigenome
so remember how before i was telling you

7378
02:05:13,109 --> 02:05:13,119
so remember how before i was telling you
 

7379
02:05:13,119 --> 02:05:14,310
so remember how before i was telling you
about all these technologies we're using

7380
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:14,320
about all these technologies we're using
 

7381
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:15,669
about all these technologies we're using
to probe the epigenome

7382
02:05:15,669 --> 02:05:15,679
to probe the epigenome
 

7383
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:18,229
to probe the epigenome
one of them is dna accessibility so what

7384
02:05:18,229 --> 02:05:18,239
one of them is dna accessibility so what
 

7385
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:19,750
one of them is dna accessibility so what
we're doing in my lab is that from the

7386
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:19,760
we're doing in my lab is that from the
 

7387
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:20,470
we're doing in my lab is that from the
same

7388
02:05:20,470 --> 02:05:20,480
same
 

7389
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:23,350
same
dissociation of say a brain sample where

7390
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:23,360
dissociation of say a brain sample where
 

7391
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:24,870
dissociation of say a brain sample where
you now have all these tens of thousands

7392
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:24,880
you now have all these tens of thousands
 

7393
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,470
you now have all these tens of thousands
of cells floating around

7394
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:26,480
of cells floating around
 

7395
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:28,709
of cells floating around
you basically take half of them to do

7396
02:05:28,709 --> 02:05:28,719
you basically take half of them to do
 

7397
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:29,990
you basically take half of them to do
rna profiling

7398
02:05:29,990 --> 02:05:30,000
rna profiling
 

7399
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,270
rna profiling
and the other have to do epigenome

7400
02:05:31,270 --> 02:05:31,280
and the other have to do epigenome
 

7401
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:33,910
and the other have to do epigenome
profiling both at the single cell level

7402
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:33,920
profiling both at the single cell level
 

7403
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:35,430
profiling both at the single cell level
so that allows you to now figure out

7404
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:35,440
so that allows you to now figure out
 

7405
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:36,069
so that allows you to now figure out
what are

7406
02:05:36,069 --> 02:05:36,079
what are
 

7407
02:05:36,079 --> 02:05:39,750
what are
the millions of dna enhancers

7408
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:39,760
the millions of dna enhancers
 

7409
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:42,550
the millions of dna enhancers
that are accessible in every one of tens

7410
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:42,560
that are accessible in every one of tens
 

7411
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,629
that are accessible in every one of tens
of thousands of cells

7412
02:05:44,629 --> 02:05:44,639
of thousands of cells
 

7413
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:46,790
of thousands of cells
and computationally we can now take the

7414
02:05:46,790 --> 02:05:46,800
and computationally we can now take the
 

7415
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:47,990
and computationally we can now take the
rna and the dna

7416
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:48,000
rna and the dna
 

7417
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,629
rna and the dna
readout and group them together to

7418
02:05:50,629 --> 02:05:50,639
readout and group them together to
 

7419
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:51,830
readout and group them together to
basically figure out

7420
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:51,840
basically figure out
 

7421
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,270
basically figure out
how is every enhancer

7422
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:55,280
how is every enhancer
 

7423
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:57,990
how is every enhancer
related to every gene and remember these

7424
02:05:57,990 --> 02:05:58,000
related to every gene and remember these
 

7425
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,589
related to every gene and remember these
sort of enhancer gene linking that we

7426
02:05:59,589 --> 02:05:59,599
sort of enhancer gene linking that we
 

7427
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:02,229
sort of enhancer gene linking that we
were doing across 833 samples

7428
02:06:02,229 --> 02:06:02,239
were doing across 833 samples
 

7429
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:05,669
were doing across 833 samples
833 is awesome don't get me wrong but

7430
02:06:05,669 --> 02:06:05,679
833 is awesome don't get me wrong but
 

7431
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:08,390
833 is awesome don't get me wrong but
10 million is way more awesome so we can

7432
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:08,400
10 million is way more awesome so we can
 

7433
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:10,149
10 million is way more awesome so we can
now look at correlated activity

7434
02:06:10,149 --> 02:06:10,159
now look at correlated activity
 

7435
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:13,750
now look at correlated activity
across 2.3 million enhancers and 20 000

7436
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:13,760
across 2.3 million enhancers and 20 000

02:06:16,629 --> 02:06:16,639
in each of millions of cells to
 

7441
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:18,149
in each of millions of cells to
basically start piecing together the

7442
02:06:18,149 --> 02:06:18,159
basically start piecing together the
 

7443
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:19,830
basically start piecing together the
regulatory circuitry

7444
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:19,840
regulatory circuitry
 

7445
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:22,709

microglial cell inside the brains of

7452
02:06:28,109 --> 02:06:28,119
microglial cell inside the brains of
 

7453
02:06:28,119 --> 02:06:31,510
microglial cell inside the brains of
1500 individuals that we've sampled

7454
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:31,520
1500 individuals that we've sampled
 

7455
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:33,430
1500 individuals that we've sampled
across multiple different brain regions

7456
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:33,440
across multiple different brain regions
 

7457
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:35,990
across multiple different brain regions
across both dna and rna

7458
02:06:35,990 --> 02:06:36,000
across both dna and rna
 

7459
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,069
across both dna and rna
so that's the data set that my team

7460
02:06:38,069 --> 02:06:38,079
so that's the data set that my team
 

7461
02:06:38,079 --> 02:06:40,229
so that's the data set that my team
generated last year alone

7462
02:06:40,229 --> 02:06:40,239
generated last year alone
 

7463
02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:42,629
generated last year alone
so in one year we basically generated 10

7464
02:06:42,629 --> 02:06:42,639
so in one year we basically generated 10
 

7465
02:06:42,639 --> 02:06:43,589
so in one year we basically generated 10
million cells

7466
02:06:43,589 --> 02:06:43,599

02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:05,350
like you know bipolar disorder
healthy aging etc so it's possible that

7482
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:05,360
healthy aging etc so it's possible that
 

7483
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:06,790
healthy aging etc so it's possible that
even just within that

7484
02:07:06,790 --> 02:07:06,800
even just within that
 

7485
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,830
even just within that
data set lie a lot of keys

7486
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:10,840
data set lie a lot of keys
 

7487
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:13,990
data set lie a lot of keys
to understanding these diseases

7488
02:07:13,990 --> 02:07:14,000
to understanding these diseases
 

7489
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,950
to understanding these diseases
and then be able to like directly leads

7490
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:16,960
and then be able to like directly leads
 

7491
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:18,229
and then be able to like directly leads
to then treatment

7492
02:07:18,229 --> 02:07:18,239
to then treatment
 

7493
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:21,270
to then treatment
correct correct so basically we are now

7494
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:21,280
correct correct so basically we are now
 

7495
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,109
correct correct so basically we are now
motivating yeah so our computational

7496
02:07:23,109 --> 02:07:23,119
motivating yeah so our computational
 

7497
02:07:23,119 --> 02:07:24,950
motivating yeah so our computational
team is in heaven right now and we're

7498
02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:24,960
team is in heaven right now and we're
 

7499
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,229
team is in heaven right now and we're
looking for people i mean if

7500
02:07:26,229 --> 02:07:26,239
looking for people i mean if
 

7501
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:28,629
looking for people i mean if
you have super how much does this

7502
02:07:28,629 --> 02:07:28,639
you have super how much does this
 

7503
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:29,510
you have super how much does this
decision

7504
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:29,520
decision
 

7505
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:31,510
decision
so this is a very interesting kind of

7506
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:31,520
so this is a very interesting kind of
 

7507
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:32,870
so this is a very interesting kind of
side question

7508
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:32,880
side question
 

7509
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:34,950
side question
how much of this is biology how much of

7510
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:34,960
how much of this is biology how much of
 

7511
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:36,149
how much of this is biology how much of
this is computation

7512
02:07:36,149 --> 02:07:36,159
this is computation
 

7513
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:38,310
this is computation
so you have the computational biology

7514
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:38,320
so you have the computational biology
 

7515
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:39,270
so you have the computational biology
group but

7516
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:39,280
group but
 

7517
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:43,109
group but
how much of are you should

7518
02:07:43,109 --> 02:07:43,119
how much of are you should
 

7519
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:45,510
how much of are you should
should you be comfortable with biology

7520
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:45,520
should you be comfortable with biology
 

7521
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:47,109
should you be comfortable with biology
to be able to solve some of these

7522
02:07:47,109 --> 02:07:47,119
to be able to solve some of these
 

7523
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:48,470
to be able to solve some of these
problems

generation of experiments
because many of these experiments no one

02:09:26,709 --> 02:09:26,719
because many of these experiments no one
 

7629
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:28,229
because many of these experiments no one
in the right mind would design them

02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:28,239
in the right mind would design them
 

7631
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:29,750
in the right mind would design them
without thinking of the analytical

7632
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:29,760
without thinking of the analytical
 

7633
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:30,709
without thinking of the analytical
approach that you would use to

7634
02:09:30,709 --> 02:09:30,719
approach that you would use to
 

7635
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:32,310
approach that you would use to
deconvolve the data afterwards

7636
02:09:32,310 --> 02:09:32,320
deconvolve the data afterwards
 

7637
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,990
deconvolve the data afterwards
right because it's massive amounts of

7638
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:34,000
right because it's massive amounts of
 

7639
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,390
right because it's massive amounts of
ridiculously noisy data

ridiculously noisy data
 

7641
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,629
ridiculously noisy data
and if you don't have the computational

7642
02:09:38,629 --> 02:09:38,639
and if you don't have the computational
 

7643
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:39,589
and if you don't have the computational
pipeline

7644
02:09:39,589 --> 02:09:39,599
pipeline
 

7645
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:41,669
pipeline
in your head before you even design the

7646
02:09:41,669 --> 02:09:41,679
in your head before you even design the
 

7647
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:43,510
in your head before you even design the
experiment you would never design the

7648
02:09:43,510 --> 02:09:43,520
experiment you would never design the
 

7649
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:44,470
experiment you would never design the
experiment that way

7650
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:44,480
experiment that way
 

7651
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,470
experiment that way
that's brilliant so you in designing the

7652
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:46,480
that's brilliant so you in designing the
 

7653
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:48,470
that's brilliant so you in designing the
experiment you have to see the entirety

7654
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:48,480
experiment you have to see the entirety
 

7655
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:50,149
experiment you have to see the entirety
of the computational pipeline that

7656
02:09:50,149 --> 02:09:50,159
of the computational pipeline that
 

7657
02:09:50,159 --> 02:09:52,069
of the computational pipeline that
drives the design

7658
02:09:52,069 --> 02:09:52,079
drives the design
 

7659
02:09:52,079 --> 02:09:54,229
drives the design
that that even drives the necessity for

7660
02:09:54,229 --> 02:09:54,239
that that even drives the necessity for
 

7661
02:09:54,239 --> 02:09:55,510
that that even drives the necessity for
that design

7662
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:55,520
that design
 

7663
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:57,910
that design
basically you know if you didn't have a

7664
02:09:57,910 --> 02:09:57,920
basically you know if you didn't have a
 

7665
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:59,990
basically you know if you didn't have a
computer scientist way of thinking

7666
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:00,000
computer scientist way of thinking
 

7667
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,390
computer scientist way of thinking
you would never design these hugely

7668
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:02,400
you would never design these hugely
 

7669
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,589
you would never design these hugely
combinatorial

so that's why you need interdisciplinary

7674
02:10:08,790 --> 02:10:08,800
so that's why you need interdisciplinary
 

7675
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,149
so that's why you need interdisciplinary
teams you need teams

7679
02:10:11,599 --> 02:10:12,790

7683
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,709
computational biology group
the focus is not on computational the

7684
02:10:16,709 --> 02:10:16,719
the focus is not on computational the
 

7685
02:10:16,719 --> 02:10:18,709
the focus is not on computational the
focus is on the biology

7686

focus is on the biology
 

7687
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:21,189
focus is on the biology
so we are a biology group what type of

02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,790
is a big transformation
yeah yeah you can think of the name as

7716
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:48,800
yeah yeah you can think of the name as
 

7717
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:49,910
yeah yeah you can think of the name as
what do we do

7718
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:49,920
what do we do
 

7719
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:52,229
what do we do
only computation that's not true but how

7720
02:10:52,229 --> 02:10:52,239
only computation that's not true but how
 

7721
02:10:52,239 --> 02:10:53,589
only computation that's not true but how
do we study it

7722
02:10:53,589 --> 02:10:53,599
do we study it
 

7723
02:10:53,599 --> 02:10:56,709
do we study it
only computationally that is true so all

7724
02:10:56,709 --> 02:10:56,719
only computationally that is true so all
 

7725
02:10:56,719 --> 02:10:58,470
only computationally that is true so all
of these single cell sequencing

7726
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:58,480
of these single cell sequencing
 

7727
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,310
of these single cell sequencing
can now be coupled with the technologies

7728
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:00,320
can now be coupled with the technologies
 

7729
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,270
can now be coupled with the technologies
that we talked about earlier for

7730
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:01,280
that we talked about earlier for
 

7731
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:02,709
that we talked about earlier for
perturbation

7732
02:11:02,709 --> 02:11:02,719
perturbation
 

7733
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:05,589
perturbation
so here's a crazy thing instead of using

7734
02:11:05,589 --> 02:11:05,599
so here's a crazy thing instead of using
 

7735
02:11:05,599 --> 02:11:06,470
so here's a crazy thing instead of using
these wells

7736
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:06,480
these wells
 

7737
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:09,030
these wells
and these robotic systems for doing one

7738
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:09,040
and these robotic systems for doing one
 

7739
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:10,390
and these robotic systems for doing one
drug at a time

7740
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:10,400
drug at a time
 

7741
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:13,109
drug at a time
or for perturbing one gene at a time in

7742
02:11:13,109 --> 02:11:13,119
or for perturbing one gene at a time in
 

7743
02:11:13,119 --> 02:11:14,550
or for perturbing one gene at a time in
thousands of wells

7744
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:14,560
thousands of wells
 

7745
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,109
thousands of wells
you can now do this using a pool of

7746
02:11:17,109 --> 02:11:17,119
you can now do this using a pool of
 

7747
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:18,069
you can now do this using a pool of
cells

7748
02:11:18,069 --> 02:11:18,079
cells
 

7749
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:20,709
cells
and single cell or any sequencing how

7750
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:20,719
and single cell or any sequencing how
 

7751
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:22,310
and single cell or any sequencing how
you basically can take

7752
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:22,320
you basically can take
 

7753
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:26,550
you basically can take
these perturbations using crispr

7754
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:26,560
these perturbations using crispr
 

7755
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:29,109
these perturbations using crispr
and instead of using a single guide rna

7756
02:11:29,109 --> 02:11:29,119
and instead of using a single guide rna
 

7757
02:11:29,119 --> 02:11:31,189
and instead of using a single guide rna
you can use a library of guide rnas

7758
02:11:31,189 --> 02:11:31,199
you can use a library of guide rnas
 

7759
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:32,870
you can use a library of guide rnas
generated exactly the same way using

7760
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:32,880
generated exactly the same way using
 

7761
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:34,229
generated exactly the same way using
this array technology

7762
02:11:34,229 --> 02:11:34,239
this array technology
 

7763
02:11:34,239 --> 02:11:36,550
this array technology
so you synthesize a thousand different

7764
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:36,560
so you synthesize a thousand different
 

7765
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:38,310
so you synthesize a thousand different
guide rnas

7766
02:11:38,310 --> 02:11:38,320
guide rnas
 

7767
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:42,149
guide rnas
you now take each of these guide rnas

7768
02:11:42,149 --> 02:11:42,159
you now take each of these guide rnas
 

7769
02:11:42,159 --> 02:11:45,270
you now take each of these guide rnas
and you insert them in a pool of cells

7770
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:45,280
and you insert them in a pool of cells
 

7771
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:47,990
and you insert them in a pool of cells
where every cell gets one perturbation

7772
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:48,000
where every cell gets one perturbation
 

7773
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,990
where every cell gets one perturbation
and you use crispr editing

7774
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,000
and you use crispr editing
 

7775
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:54,790
and you use crispr editing
or crispr uh so with either crispr cas9

7776
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:54,800
or crispr uh so with either crispr cas9
 

7777
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:56,950
or crispr uh so with either crispr cas9
to edit the gina with these thousand

7778
02:11:56,950 --> 02:11:56,960
to edit the gina with these thousand
 

7779
02:11:56,960 --> 02:11:58,149
to edit the gina with these thousand
perturbations or the

7780
02:11:58,149 --> 02:11:58,159
perturbations or the
 

7781
02:11:58,159 --> 02:12:00,149
perturbations or the
or with the activation or with the

7782
02:12:00,149 --> 02:12:00,159
or with the activation or with the
 

7783
02:12:00,159 --> 02:12:01,189
or with the activation or with the
repression

7784
02:12:01,189 --> 02:12:01,199
repression
 

7785
02:12:01,199 --> 02:12:03,430
repression
and you now can have a single cell

7786
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:03,440
and you now can have a single cell
 

7787
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:04,229
and you now can have a single cell
readout

7788
02:12:04,229 --> 02:12:04,239
readout
 

7789
02:12:04,239 --> 02:12:07,350
readout
where every single cell has received one

7790
02:12:07,350 --> 02:12:07,360
where every single cell has received one
 

7791
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:10,149
where every single cell has received one
of these modifications and you can now

7792
02:12:10,149 --> 02:12:10,159
of these modifications and you can now
 

7793
02:12:10,159 --> 02:12:11,990
of these modifications and you can now
in massively parallel ways

7794
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:12,000
in massively parallel ways
 

7795
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,750
in massively parallel ways
couple the perturbation and

7796
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:15,760
couple the perturbation and
 

7797
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:18,470
couple the perturbation and
the readout in a single experiment how

7798
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:18,480
the readout in a single experiment how
 

7799
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:20,149
the readout in a single experiment how
are you tracking which perturbations

7800
02:12:20,149 --> 02:12:20,159
are you tracking which perturbations
 

7801
02:12:20,159 --> 02:12:22,310
are you tracking which perturbations
each cell received so there's there's

7802
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:22,320
each cell received so there's there's
 

7803
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:23,350
each cell received so there's there's
ways of doing that

7804
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:23,360
ways of doing that
 

7805
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:25,350
ways of doing that
but basically one way is to make that

7806
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:25,360
but basically one way is to make that
 

7807
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:27,350
but basically one way is to make that
perturbation an expressible

7808
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:27,360
perturbation an expressible
 

7809
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:30,069
perturbation an expressible
vector so that part of your rna reading

7810
02:12:30,069 --> 02:12:30,079
vector so that part of your rna reading
 

7811
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:31,109
vector so that part of your rna reading
is actually

7812
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:31,119
is actually
 

7813
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:33,270
is actually
that perturbation itself so you can

7814
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:33,280
that perturbation itself so you can
 

7815
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:34,550
that perturbation itself so you can
basically put it in a

7816
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:34,560
basically put it in a
 

7817
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:37,109
basically put it in a
expressible part so you can self-drive

7818
02:12:37,109 --> 02:12:37,119
expressible part so you can self-drive
 

7819
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:37,589
expressible part so you can self-drive
it

7820
02:12:37,589 --> 02:12:37,599
it
 

7821
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:39,750
it
so the the point that i want to get

7822
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:39,760
so the the point that i want to get
 

7823
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:41,910
so the the point that i want to get
across is that the sky is the limit

7824
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:41,920
across is that the sky is the limit
 

7825
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:43,669
across is that the sky is the limit
you basically have these tools these

7826
02:12:43,669 --> 02:12:43,679
you basically have these tools these
 

7827
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:46,229

02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:05,760
and then you end up with a series of
 

7847
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:08,950

and you know every other level
this there is no better or more exciting

7880
02:13:43,589 --> 02:13:43,599
this there is no better or more exciting
 

7881
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:44,950
this there is no better or more exciting
field in my view

7882
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:44,960
field in my view
 

7883
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:47,189
field in my view
to be a computer scientist then or to be

7884
02:13:47,189 --> 02:13:47,199
to be a computer scientist then or to be
 

7885
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:48,709
to be a computer scientist then or to be
a scientist in period

7886
02:13:48,709 --> 02:13:48,719
a scientist in period
 

7887
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:50,149
a scientist in period
basically this confluence of

7888
02:13:50,149 --> 02:13:50,159
basically this confluence of
 

7889
02:13:50,159 --> 02:13:52,149
basically this confluence of
technologies of computation

7890
02:13:52,149 --> 02:13:52,159
technologies of computation
 

7891
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:54,629
technologies of computation
of data of insight and of tools for

7892
02:13:54,629 --> 02:13:54,639
of data of insight and of tools for
 

7893
02:13:54,639 --> 02:13:56,149
of data of insight and of tools for
manipulation

7894
02:13:56,149 --> 02:13:56,159
manipulation
 

7895
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:58,870
manipulation
is unprecedented in human history and i

7896
02:13:58,870 --> 02:13:58,880
is unprecedented in human history and i
 

7897
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:00,709
is unprecedented in human history and i
think this is what's shaping

7898
02:14:00,709 --> 02:14:00,719
think this is what's shaping
 

7899
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:03,510
think this is what's shaping
the next century to really be a

7900
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:03,520
the next century to really be a
 

7901
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:06,149
the next century to really be a
transformative century for our species

7902
02:14:06,149 --> 02:14:06,159
transformative century for our species
 

7903
02:14:06,159 --> 02:14:09,189
transformative century for our species
and for our planet

7904
02:14:09,189 --> 02:14:09,199
and for our planet
 

7905
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:10,870
and for our planet
so you think the 21st century will be

7906
02:14:10,870 --> 02:14:10,880
so you think the 21st century will be
 

7907
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:12,709
so you think the 21st century will be
remembered for

7908
02:14:12,709 --> 02:14:12,719
remembered for
 

7909
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:14,790
remembered for
the big leaps in biology and

7910
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:14,800
the big leaps in biology and
 

7911
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,390
the big leaps in biology and
understanding and

7912
02:14:16,390 --> 02:14:16,400
understanding and
 

7913
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:19,189
understanding and
alleviation of biology if you look at

7914
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:19,199
alleviation of biology if you look at
 

7915
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:20,069
alleviation of biology if you look at
the path

7916
02:14:20,069 --> 02:14:20,079
the path
 

7917
02:14:20,079 --> 02:14:22,790
the path
between discovery and therapeutics it's

7918
02:14:22,790 --> 02:14:22,800
between discovery and therapeutics it's
 

7919
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,629
between discovery and therapeutics it's
been on the order of 50 years

7920
02:14:24,629 --> 02:14:24,639
been on the order of 50 years
 

7921
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:27,350
been on the order of 50 years
it's been shortened to 40 30 20 and now

7922
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:27,360
it's been shortened to 40 30 20 and now
 

7923
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,350
it's been shortened to 40 30 20 and now
it's on the order of 10 years

7924
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:29,360
it's on the order of 10 years
 

7925
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:32,069
it's on the order of 10 years
but the huge number of technologies that

7926
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:32,079
but the huge number of technologies that
 

7927
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:32,390
but the huge number of technologies that
are

7928
02:14:32,390 --> 02:14:32,400
are
 

7929
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:35,430
are
going on right now for discovery

7930
02:14:35,430 --> 02:14:35,440
going on right now for discovery
 

7931
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:38,870
going on right now for discovery
will result undoubtedly in the most

7932
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:38,880
will result undoubtedly in the most
 

7933
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:41,030
will result undoubtedly in the most
dramatic manipulation of human biology

7934
02:14:41,030 --> 02:14:41,040
dramatic manipulation of human biology
 

7935
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:42,310
dramatic manipulation of human biology
that we've ever seen

7936
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:42,320
that we've ever seen
 

7937
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:44,310
that we've ever seen
in the history of humanity in the next

7938

in the history of humanity in the next
 

7939
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:46,069
in the history of humanity in the next
few years do you think we might be able

7940
02:14:46,069 --> 02:14:46,079
few years do you think we might be able
 

7941
02:14:46,079 --> 02:14:47,910
few years do you think we might be able
to cure some of the diseases we started

7942
02:14:47,910 --> 02:14:47,920
to cure some of the diseases we started
 

7943
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:49,589
to cure some of the diseases we started

is enormous and i don't want to
 

7951
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:58,229
is enormous and i don't want to
underestimate the complexity

underestimate the complexity
 

7953
02:14:58,239 --> 02:14:59,990
underestimate the complexity
but the number of insides is

non-traditional medicine perturbations
 

7965
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:13,109
non-traditional medicine perturbations
there's a lot of sort of new gen there's

7966
02:15:13,109 --> 02:15:13,119
there's a lot of sort of new gen there's
 

7967

a new generation
 

7969
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,310
a new generation
of perturbations that you can use at the

that can basically sense when you are in

7986
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,000
that can basically sense when you are in
 

7987
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,510
that can basically sense when you are in
the right cell based on the specific

the right cell based on the specific
 

7989
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:34,550
the right cell based on the specific
combination and then

7990
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:34,560
combination and then
 

7991
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:37,270
combination and then
turn on that intervention for that cell

7992
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:37,280
turn on that intervention for that cell
 

7993
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,870
turn on that intervention for that cell
you can now think of combinatorial

7994
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:38,880
you can now think of combinatorial
 

7995
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:39,830
you can now think of combinatorial
interventions

7996
02:15:39,830 --> 02:15:39,840
interventions
 

7997
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:42,069
interventions
where you can basically sort of feed a

7998
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:42,079
where you can basically sort of feed a
 

7999
02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:44,229

synthetic biology construct to someone
 

8001
02:15:44,239 --> 02:15:46,310
synthetic biology construct to someone
that will basically do different things

8002
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:46,320
that will basically do different things
 

8003
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:47,430
that will basically do different things
in different cells

8004
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:47,440
in different cells
 

8005
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:49,350
in different cells
so basically for cancer this is one of

8006
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:49,360
so basically for cancer this is one of
 

8007
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:50,950
so basically for cancer this is one of
the therapeutics that our collaborator

8008
02:15:50,950 --> 02:15:50,960
the therapeutics that our collaborator
 

8009

ron weiss is using
 

8011
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:54,149
ron weiss is using
to basically start sort of engineering

8012
02:15:54,149 --> 02:15:54,159
to basically start sort of engineering
 

8013
02:15:54,159 --> 02:15:55,830
to basically start sort of engineering
these circuits that will use microrna

8014
02:15:55,830 --> 02:15:55,840
these circuits that will use microrna
 

8015
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:57,350
these circuits that will use microrna
sensors of the environment to sort of

8016
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:57,360
sensors of the environment to sort of
 

8017
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:58,950
sensors of the environment to sort of
know if you're in a tumor cell

8018
02:15:58,950 --> 02:15:58,960
know if you're in a tumor cell
 

8019
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:00,310
know if you're in a tumor cell
or if you're in an immune cell or if

8020
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:00,320
or if you're in an immune cell or if
 

8021
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:02,069
or if you're in an immune cell or if
you're in stromal cells and so forth

you're in stromal cells and so forth
 

8023
02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:03,350
you're in stromal cells and so forth
and basically turn on particular

8024
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:03,360
and basically turn on particular
 

8025
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:05,669
and basically turn on particular
interventions there you can sort of

8026
02:16:05,669 --> 02:16:05,679
interventions there you can sort of
 

8027
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:09,350
interventions there you can sort of
create constructs that are tuned to only

8028
02:16:09,350 --> 02:16:09,360
create constructs that are tuned to only
 

8029
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:11,589
create constructs that are tuned to only
the liver cells or only the heart cells

you know uh you know brain cells and
 

8035
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:16,149
you know uh you know brain cells and
then

8036
02:16:16,149 --> 02:16:16,159
then
 

8037
02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:17,990
then
have these new generations of

8038
02:16:17,990 --> 02:16:18,000
have these new generations of
 

8039
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,830
have these new generations of
therapeutics coupled with this immense

02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:28,629
processes to measure
and how to intervene my view is that

8050
02:16:28,629 --> 02:16:28,639
and how to intervene my view is that
 

8051
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:29,430
and how to intervene my view is that
disease

8052

disease
 

8053
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:31,910
disease
is going to be fundamentally altered and

02:16:31,910 --> 02:16:31,920
is going to be fundamentally altered and
 

8055
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:33,030
is going to be fundamentally altered and
alleviated

8059
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:38,070

next time we talk we'll talk about the

8060
02:16:38,070 --> 02:16:38,080
next time we talk we'll talk about the
 

8061
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:39,990
next time we talk we'll talk about the
philosophical implications that the

8062
02:16:39,990 --> 02:16:40,000
philosophical implications that the
 

8063
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,750
philosophical implications that the
effect of life but let's stick to

for just a little longer we did pretty

8068
02:16:44,549 --> 02:16:44,559
for just a little longer we did pretty
 

8069
02:16:44,559 --> 02:16:47,270
for just a little longer we did pretty
good today we still stuck to the science

8070
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:47,280
good today we still stuck to the science
 

8071
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:50,709
good today we still stuck to the science

02:17:37,429 --> 02:17:37,439
that is basically using the single cell
 

8117
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:38,950
that is basically using the single cell
profiling technologies using this

02:17:48,790 --> 02:17:48,800
that are sort of found in in
 

8129
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:50,629
that are sort of found in in
schizophrenia are in fact

8130
02:17:50,629 --> 02:17:50,639
schizophrenia are in fact
 

8131
02:17:50,639 --> 02:17:52,309
schizophrenia are in fact
affecting excitatory neurons and

8132
02:17:52,309 --> 02:17:52,319
affecting excitatory neurons and
 

8133
02:17:52,319 --> 02:17:54,469
affecting excitatory neurons and
inhibitory neurons in pathways

inhibitory neurons in pathways
 

8135
02:17:54,479 --> 02:17:57,669
inhibitory neurons in pathways
that are active both in synaptic pruning

8136
02:17:57,669 --> 02:17:57,679
that are active both in synaptic pruning
 

8137
02:17:57,679 --> 02:17:59,270
that are active both in synaptic pruning
but also in early development we've

8138
02:17:59,270 --> 02:17:59,280
but also in early development we've
 

8139
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,589
but also in early development we've
basically found a set of four regulators

8140
02:18:01,589 --> 02:18:01,599
basically found a set of four regulators
 

8141
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:03,110
basically found a set of four regulators
that are connecting these two processes

8142
02:18:03,110 --> 02:18:03,120
that are connecting these two processes
 

8143
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:04,790
that are connecting these two processes
that were previously separate

8144
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:04,800
that were previously separate
 

8145
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:07,990
that were previously separate
in schizophrenia in sort of having

8146
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:08,000
in schizophrenia in sort of having
 

8147
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,870
in schizophrenia in sort of having
a sort of more unified view across those

8148
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:10,880
a sort of more unified view across those
 

8149
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:11,190
a sort of more unified view across those
two

8150
02:18:11,190 --> 02:18:11,200
two
 

8151
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:13,750
two
those two sides the second one is in the

8152
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:13,760
those two sides the second one is in the
 

8153

in the
 

8155
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:16,230
in the
area of metabolism we basically now have

8156
02:18:16,230 --> 02:18:16,240
area of metabolism we basically now have
 

8157
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:17,750
area of metabolism we basically now have
a beautiful collaboration with the

8158
02:18:17,750 --> 02:18:17,760
a beautiful collaboration with the
 

8159
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:20,230
a beautiful collaboration with the
goodyear lab that's basically looking at

8160
02:18:20,230 --> 02:18:20,240
goodyear lab that's basically looking at
 

8161
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:24,230
goodyear lab that's basically looking at
um multi-tissue perturbations

8162
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:24,240
um multi-tissue perturbations
 

8163
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:27,190
um multi-tissue perturbations
in six or seven different tissues across

8164
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:27,200
in six or seven different tissues across
 

8165

interventions using both mouse and human
 

8173
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:38,309
interventions using both mouse and human
where we can basically see what are the

8174
02:18:38,309 --> 02:18:38,319
where we can basically see what are the
 

8175
02:18:38,319 --> 02:18:39,910
where we can basically see what are the
cell to cell communications

8176
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:39,920
cell to cell communications
 

8177
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:42,230
cell to cell communications
that are that are changing across them

8178
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:42,240
that are that are changing across them
 

8179
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:43,910
that are that are changing across them
and what we're finding is this

8180
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:43,920
and what we're finding is this
 

8181
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:46,709
and what we're finding is this
immense role of both immune cells as

8182
02:18:46,709 --> 02:18:46,719
immense role of both immune cells as
 

8183
02:18:46,719 --> 02:18:47,270
immense role of both immune cells as
well as

8184
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:47,280
well as
 

8185
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,589
well as
adipocyte stem cells in sort of

8186
02:18:49,589 --> 02:18:49,599
adipocyte stem cells in sort of
 

8187
02:18:49,599 --> 02:18:51,589
adipocyte stem cells in sort of
reshaping that circuitry of all of these

8188
02:18:51,589 --> 02:18:51,599
reshaping that circuitry of all of these
 

8189
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:52,629
reshaping that circuitry of all of these
different tissues

8190
02:18:52,629 --> 02:18:52,639
different tissues
 

8191
02:18:52,639 --> 02:18:54,389
different tissues
and that sort of painting to a new path

8192
02:18:54,389 --> 02:18:54,399
and that sort of painting to a new path
 

8193
02:18:54,399 --> 02:18:56,709
and that sort of painting to a new path
for therapeutical interventions there

8194
02:18:56,709 --> 02:18:56,719
for therapeutical interventions there
 

8195
02:18:56,719 --> 02:18:59,830
for therapeutical interventions there
in alzheimer's it's this huge focus on

8196
02:18:59,830 --> 02:18:59,840
in alzheimer's it's this huge focus on
 

8197
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:00,709
in alzheimer's it's this huge focus on
microglia

8198
02:19:00,709 --> 02:19:00,719
microglia
 

8199
02:19:00,719 --> 02:19:02,070
microglia
and now we're discovering different

8200
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:02,080
and now we're discovering different
 

8201
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:04,150
and now we're discovering different
classes of microglial cells

8202
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:04,160
classes of microglial cells
 

8203
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:07,990
classes of microglial cells
that are basically either synaptic or

8204
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:08,000
that are basically either synaptic or
 

8205
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,509
that are basically either synaptic or
um immune and these are

8206
02:19:11,509 --> 02:19:11,519
um immune and these are
 

8207
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:13,429
um immune and these are
playing vastly different roles in

8208
02:19:13,429 --> 02:19:13,439
playing vastly different roles in
 

8209
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:15,830
playing vastly different roles in
alzheimer's versus in schizophrenia

8210
02:19:15,830 --> 02:19:15,840
alzheimer's versus in schizophrenia
 

8211
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:18,070
alzheimer's versus in schizophrenia
and what we're finding is this immense

8212
02:19:18,070 --> 02:19:18,080
and what we're finding is this immense
 

8213
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:19,030
and what we're finding is this immense
complexity

8214
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:19,040
complexity
 

8215
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:22,230
complexity
as you go further and further down of

8216
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:22,240
as you go further and further down of
 

8217
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:24,629
as you go further and further down of
how in fact there's 10 different types

8218
02:19:24,629 --> 02:19:24,639
how in fact there's 10 different types
 

8219
02:19:24,639 --> 02:19:26,309
how in fact there's 10 different types
of microglia each with

8220
02:19:26,309 --> 02:19:26,319
of microglia each with
 

8221
02:19:26,319 --> 02:19:28,389
of microglia each with
their own sort of expression programs we

8222
02:19:28,389 --> 02:19:28,399
their own sort of expression programs we
 

8223
02:19:28,399 --> 02:19:29,910
their own sort of expression programs we
used to think of them as oh yeah they're

8224
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:29,920
used to think of them as oh yeah they're
 

8225
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:30,790
used to think of them as oh yeah they're

microglia
 

8227
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:32,790
microglia
but in fact now we're realizing just

8228
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:32,800
but in fact now we're realizing just
 

8229
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:34,150
but in fact now we're realizing just
even in that sort of

8230
02:19:34,150 --> 02:19:34,160
even in that sort of
 

8231
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:36,309
even in that sort of
least abundant of cell types there's

8232
02:19:36,309 --> 02:19:36,319
least abundant of cell types there's
 

8233
02:19:36,319 --> 02:19:39,429
least abundant of cell types there's
this incredible diversity there

8234
02:19:39,429 --> 02:19:39,439
this incredible diversity there
 

8235
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:41,750
this incredible diversity there
the differences between brain regions is

8236
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:41,760
the differences between brain regions is
 

8237
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:42,469
the differences between brain regions is
is another

02:19:42,479 --> 02:19:44,629
is another
sort of major major insight again you

8240
02:19:44,629 --> 02:19:44,639
sort of major major insight again you
 

8241
02:19:44,639 --> 02:19:45,990
sort of major major insight again you
know one would think that

8242
02:19:45,990 --> 02:19:46,000
know one would think that
 

8243
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,910
know one would think that
oh astrocytes are astrocytes no matter

8244
02:19:47,910 --> 02:19:47,920
oh astrocytes are astrocytes no matter
 

8245
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:49,270
oh astrocytes are astrocytes no matter
where they are but no

02:19:49,270 --> 02:19:49,280
where they are but no
 

8247
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:51,590
where they are but no
there's incredible region-specific

8248
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:51,600
there's incredible region-specific
 

8249
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:52,389
there's incredible region-specific
differences

8250
02:19:52,389 --> 02:19:52,399
differences
 

8251
02:19:52,399 --> 02:19:54,710
differences
in the expression patterns of all of the

8252
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:54,720
in the expression patterns of all of the
 

8253
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:56,070

major brain cell types

8254
02:19:56,070 --> 02:19:56,080
major brain cell types
 

8255
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:57,750
major brain cell types
across different brain regions so

8256
02:19:57,750 --> 02:19:57,760
across different brain regions so
 

8257
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:58,950
across different brain regions so
basically there's the neocortical

8258
02:19:58,950 --> 02:19:58,960
basically there's the neocortical
 

8259
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:00,150
basically there's the neocortical
regions that are sort of the recent

8260
02:20:00,150 --> 02:20:00,160
regions that are sort of the recent
 

8261
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:00,870

that makes us so different from all

8264
02:20:02,389 --> 02:20:02,399
that makes us so different from all
 

8265
02:20:02,399 --> 02:20:04,389
that makes us so different from all
other species there's the sort of

02:20:04,389 --> 02:20:04,399
other species there's the sort of
 

8267
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:06,389
other species there's the sort of
you know reptilian brain sort of regions

8268
02:20:06,389 --> 02:20:06,399
you know reptilian brain sort of regions
 

8269
02:20:06,399 --> 02:20:08,309
you know reptilian brain sort of regions
that are sort of much more

8270
02:20:08,309 --> 02:20:08,319
that are sort of much more
 

8271
02:20:08,319 --> 02:20:10,389
that are sort of much more
uh you know very extremely distinct

8272
02:20:10,389 --> 02:20:10,399
uh you know very extremely distinct
 

8273
02:20:10,399 --> 02:20:11,510
uh you know very extremely distinct
there's a cerebellum

8274
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:11,520
there's a cerebellum
 

8275
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:14,389
there's a cerebellum
there's um each of those basically is

8276
02:20:14,389 --> 02:20:14,399
there's um each of those basically is
 

8277
02:20:14,399 --> 02:20:16,309
there's um each of those basically is
associated in a different way

8278
02:20:16,309 --> 02:20:16,319
associated in a different way
 

8279
02:20:16,319 --> 02:20:18,389
associated in a different way
with disease and what we're doing now is

8280
02:20:18,389 --> 02:20:18,399
with disease and what we're doing now is
 

8281
02:20:18,399 --> 02:20:19,349
with disease and what we're doing now is
looking into

8282
02:20:19,349 --> 02:20:19,359
looking into
 

8283
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:22,630
looking into
pseudotemporal models for how disease

8284
02:20:22,630 --> 02:20:22,640
pseudotemporal models for how disease
 

8285
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:23,670
pseudotemporal models for how disease
progresses

8286
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:23,680
progresses
 

8287
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,830
progresses
across different regions of the brain if

8288
02:20:25,830 --> 02:20:25,840
across different regions of the brain if
 

8289
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,510
across different regions of the brain if
you look at alzheimer's it basically

8290
02:20:27,510 --> 02:20:27,520
you look at alzheimer's it basically
 

8291
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,550
you look at alzheimer's it basically
starts in this

8292
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:28,560
starts in this
 

8293
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:29,990
starts in this
small region called the enter rhino

8294
02:20:29,990 --> 02:20:30,000
small region called the enter rhino
 

8295
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,670
small region called the enter rhino
cortex and then it spreads

8296
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:31,680
cortex and then it spreads
 

8297
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:34,469
cortex and then it spreads
through the brain and uh you know

8298
02:20:34,469 --> 02:20:34,479
through the brain and uh you know
 

8299
02:20:34,479 --> 02:20:35,750
through the brain and uh you know
through the hippocampus and

8300
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:35,760
through the hippocampus and
 

8301
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:38,870
through the hippocampus and
you know the uh ultimately affecting the

8302
02:20:38,870 --> 02:20:38,880
you know the uh ultimately affecting the
 

8303
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:40,710
you know the uh ultimately affecting the
neocortex and with every brain region

8304
02:20:40,710 --> 02:20:40,720
neocortex and with every brain region
 

8305
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:41,750
neocortex and with every brain region
that it hits

8306
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:41,760
that it hits
 

8307
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:44,150
that it hits
it basically has a different impact on

8308
02:20:44,150 --> 02:20:44,160
it basically has a different impact on
 

8309
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,830
it basically has a different impact on
the

8310
02:20:45,830 --> 02:20:45,840
the
 

8311
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:49,190
the
cognitive and you know memory aspects

8312
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:49,200
cognitive and you know memory aspects
 

8313
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:50,469
cognitive and you know memory aspects
orientation

8314
02:20:50,469 --> 02:20:50,479

8315
02:20:50,479 --> 02:20:52,790

short-term memory long-term memory etc

8316
02:20:52,790 --> 02:20:52,800
short-term memory long-term memory etc
 

8317
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:53,590
short-term memory long-term memory etc
which is

8318
02:20:53,590 --> 02:20:53,600
which is
 

8319
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:55,510
which is
you know dramatically affecting the

8320
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:55,520
you know dramatically affecting the
 

8321
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:57,429
you know dramatically affecting the
cognitive path that the individuals go

8322
02:20:57,429 --> 02:20:57,439
cognitive path that the individuals go
 

8323
02:20:57,439 --> 02:20:58,070
cognitive path that the individuals go
through

8324
02:20:58,070 --> 02:20:58,080
through
 

8325
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,870
through
so what we're doing now is creating

8326
02:21:00,870 --> 02:21:00,880
so what we're doing now is creating
 

8327
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:03,510
so what we're doing now is creating
these computational models for ordering

8328
02:21:03,510 --> 02:21:03,520
these computational models for ordering
 

8329
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,990
these computational models for ordering
the cells and the regions and the

8330
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:06,000
the cells and the regions and the
 

8331
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,030
the cells and the regions and the
individuals

8332
02:21:07,030 --> 02:21:07,040
individuals
 

8333
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:09,110
individuals
according to their ability to predict

8334
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:09,120
according to their ability to predict
 

8335
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:10,309
according to their ability to predict
alzheimer's disease

8336
02:21:10,309 --> 02:21:10,319
alzheimer's disease
 

8337
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:13,349
alzheimer's disease
so we can have a cell level predictor

8338
02:21:13,349 --> 02:21:13,359
so we can have a cell level predictor
 

8339
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:15,990
so we can have a cell level predictor
of pathology that allows us to now

8340
02:21:15,990 --> 02:21:16,000
of pathology that allows us to now
 

8341
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:16,950
of pathology that allows us to now
create

8342
02:21:16,950 --> 02:21:16,960
create
 

8343
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:18,469
create
a temporal time course that tells us

8344
02:21:18,469 --> 02:21:18,479
a temporal time course that tells us
 

8345
02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:20,790
a temporal time course that tells us
when every gene turns on along this

8346
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:20,800
when every gene turns on along this
 

8347
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:23,270
when every gene turns on along this
pathology progression and then trace

8348
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:23,280
pathology progression and then trace
 

8349
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:24,150
pathology progression and then trace
that across

8350
02:21:24,150 --> 02:21:24,160
that across
 

8351
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:26,550
that across
regions and pathological measures that

8352
02:21:26,550 --> 02:21:26,560
regions and pathological measures that
 

8353
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:27,590
regions and pathological measures that
are region-specific

8354
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:27,600
are region-specific
 

8355
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:29,510
are region-specific
but also cognitive measures and so so

8356
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:29,520
but also cognitive measures and so so
 

8357
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:30,790
but also cognitive measures and so so
forth so

8358
02:21:30,790 --> 02:21:30,800
forth so
 

8359
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:32,469
forth so
that allows us to now sort of for the

8360
02:21:32,469 --> 02:21:32,479
that allows us to now sort of for the
 

8361
02:21:32,479 --> 02:21:34,550
that allows us to now sort of for the
first time look at can we actually do

8362
02:21:34,550 --> 02:21:34,560
first time look at can we actually do
 

8363
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:36,630
first time look at can we actually do
early intervention for alzheimer's

8364
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:36,640
early intervention for alzheimer's
 

8365
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,389
early intervention for alzheimer's
where we know that the disease starts

8366
02:21:38,389 --> 02:21:38,399
where we know that the disease starts
 

8367
02:21:38,399 --> 02:21:40,710
where we know that the disease starts
manifesting for 10 years before

8368
02:21:40,710 --> 02:21:40,720
manifesting for 10 years before
 

8369
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:42,550
manifesting for 10 years before
you actually have your first cognitive

8370
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:42,560
you actually have your first cognitive
 

8371
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:43,990

8538
02:24:27,510 --> 02:24:27,520
correct you individual i mean it's a
 

8539
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:28,469
correct you individual i mean it's a
dumb question but

8540
02:24:28,469 --> 02:24:28,479
dumb question but
 

8541
02:24:28,479 --> 02:24:30,790
dumb question but
there's there's mutation and variation i

8542
02:24:30,790 --> 02:24:30,800
there's there's mutation and variation i
 

8543
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:32,389
there's there's mutation and variation i
guess that happens there

8544
02:24:32,389 --> 02:24:32,399
guess that happens there
 

8545
02:24:32,399 --> 02:24:34,150
guess that happens there
and you're saying that they're through

8546
02:24:34,150 --> 02:24:34,160
and you're saying that they're through
 

8547
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:36,230
and you're saying that they're through
this if we focus in on

8548
02:24:36,230 --> 02:24:36,240
this if we focus in on
 

8549
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:38,070
this if we focus in on
individual cells we're able to detect a

8550
02:24:38,070 --> 02:24:38,080
individual cells we're able to detect a
 

8551
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:39,990
individual cells we're able to detect a
story that's interesting there

8552
02:24:39,990 --> 02:24:40,000
story that's interesting there
 

8553
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:43,030
story that's interesting there
and that might be a very unique kind of

8554
02:24:43,030 --> 02:24:43,040
and that might be a very unique kind of
 

8555
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:46,469
and that might be a very unique kind of
important variability that arises for

8556
02:24:46,469 --> 02:24:46,479
important variability that arises for
 

8557
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:49,510
important variability that arises for
you said neuronal or something

8558
02:24:49,510 --> 02:24:49,520
you said neuronal or something
 

8559
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:51,590
you said neuronal or something

i mean the metabolism of humans is

8564
02:24:55,190 --> 02:24:55,200
i mean the metabolism of humans is
 

8565
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:57,270
i mean the metabolism of humans is
dramatically altered from that of

02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:57,280
dramatically altered from that of
 

8567
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:59,830
dramatically altered from that of
nearby species you know we talked about

8568
02:24:59,830 --> 02:24:59,840
nearby species you know we talked about
 

8569
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:01,510
nearby species you know we talked about
that last time that basically we are

8570
02:25:01,510 --> 02:25:01,520
that last time that basically we are
 

8571
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:03,190
that last time that basically we are
able to consume meat

8572
02:25:03,190 --> 02:25:03,200
able to consume meat
 

8573
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:06,630
able to consume meat
that is incredibly energy rich and that

8574
02:25:06,630 --> 02:25:06,640
that is incredibly energy rich and that
 

8575
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:09,750
that is incredibly energy rich and that
allows us to sort of have functions

8576
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:09,760
allows us to sort of have functions
 

8577
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:13,349
allows us to sort of have functions
that are you know meeting this humongous

8578
02:25:13,349 --> 02:25:13,359
that are you know meeting this humongous
 

8579
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:14,469
that are you know meeting this humongous
brain that we have

8580
02:25:14,469 --> 02:25:14,479
brain that we have
 

8581
02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:16,230
brain that we have
it's basically on one hand every one of

8582
02:25:16,230 --> 02:25:16,240
it's basically on one hand every one of
 

8583
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:17,670
it's basically on one hand every one of
our brain cells is much more energy

8584
02:25:17,670 --> 02:25:17,680
our brain cells is much more energy
 

8585
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:19,030
our brain cells is much more energy
efficient than our neighbors

8586
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:19,040
efficient than our neighbors
 

8587
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:21,110
efficient than our neighbors
than our relatives number two we have

8588
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:21,120
than our relatives number two we have
 

8589
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:23,030
than our relatives number two we have
way more of these cells

8590
02:25:23,030 --> 02:25:23,040
way more of these cells
 

8591
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:26,389
way more of these cells
and number three we have you know

8592
02:25:26,389 --> 02:25:26,399
and number three we have you know
 

8593
02:25:26,399 --> 02:25:28,790
and number three we have you know
this new diet that allows us to now feed

8594
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:28,800
this new diet that allows us to now feed
 

8595
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:29,990
this new diet that allows us to now feed
all these needs

all these needs
 

8597
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,150
all these needs
that basically creates a massive amount

8598
02:25:32,150 --> 02:25:32,160
that basically creates a massive amount
 

8599
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,270
that basically creates a massive amount
of damage

that factory has energetic needs
 

8609
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:47,030
that factory has energetic needs
and there's a lot of sort of biological

8610
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:47,040
and there's a lot of sort of biological
 

8611
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:48,630
and there's a lot of sort of biological
processes underlying that

8612
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:48,640
processes underlying that
 

8613
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:51,190
processes underlying that
that we are finding are altered in the

02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:51,200
that we are finding are altered in the
 

8615
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:52,710
that we are finding are altered in the

02:25:52,710 --> 02:25:52,720
context of alzheimer's disease
 

8617
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:54,710
context of alzheimer's disease
that's fascinating that so you have to

8618
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:54,720
that's fascinating that so you have to
 

8619
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,110
that's fascinating that so you have to
consider all of these systems

8620
02:25:57,110 --> 02:25:57,120
consider all of these systems
 

8621
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:59,270
consider all of these systems
if you want to understand even something

8622
02:25:59,270 --> 02:25:59,280
if you want to understand even something
 

8623
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:01,030
if you want to understand even something
like diseases that you would

8624
02:26:01,030 --> 02:26:01,040
like diseases that you would
 

8625
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:03,349
like diseases that you would
maybe traditionally associate with just

8626
02:26:03,349 --> 02:26:03,359
maybe traditionally associate with just
 

8627
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:05,190
maybe traditionally associate with just
the particular cells of the brain

02:26:05,190 --> 02:26:05,200
the particular cells of the brain
 

8629
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:08,550
the particular cells of the brain
yeah the immune system

8630
02:26:08,550 --> 02:26:08,560
yeah the immune system
 

8631
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:10,309
yeah the immune system
the metabolic system the metabolic

8632
02:26:10,309 --> 02:26:10,319
the metabolic system the metabolic
 

8633
02:26:10,319 --> 02:26:12,070
the metabolic system the metabolic

8634
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:12,080
system and these are all the things that
 

8635
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:13,990
system and these are all the things that
makes us uniquely human so our immune

8636
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:14,000
makes us uniquely human so our immune
 

8637
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:14,469
makes us uniquely human so our immune
system

8638
02:26:14,469 --> 02:26:14,479
system
 

8639
02:26:14,479 --> 02:26:16,150

our neighbors our societies are
 

8643
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:20,150
our neighbors our societies are
so much more clustered the history of

02:26:20,150 --> 02:26:20,160
so much more clustered the history of
 

8645
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:21,590
so much more clustered the history of

infections that have plagued
 

8647
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:23,990
infections that have plagued
the human population is you know

8648
02:26:23,990 --> 02:26:24,000
the human population is you know
 

8649
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,429
the human population is you know
dramatically different from every other

8650
02:26:25,429 --> 02:26:25,439
dramatically different from every other

8653
02:26:26,240 --> 02:26:27,510

02:26:29,110 --> 02:26:29,120
society in our population has sort of
 

8657
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:30,150
society in our population has sort of
exploded

8658
02:26:30,150 --> 02:26:30,160
exploded
 

8659
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:31,910
exploded
has basically put unique pressures on

8660
02:26:31,910 --> 02:26:31,920
has basically put unique pressures on
 

8661
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:33,990
has basically put unique pressures on
our immune system and our immune system

8662
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:34,000
our immune system and our immune system
 

8663
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,510
our immune system and our immune system
has both coped with that density and

8664
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:35,520
has both coped with that density and
 

8665
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:37,190
has both coped with that density and
also been shaped by

8666
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:37,200
also been shaped by
 

8667
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:39,110
also been shaped by
as i mentioned the you know vast amount

8668
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:39,120
as i mentioned the you know vast amount
 

8669
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,349
as i mentioned the you know vast amount
of death that has happened in the black

8670
02:26:41,349 --> 02:26:41,359
of death that has happened in the black
 

8671
02:26:41,359 --> 02:26:42,790
of death that has happened in the black
plague and other sort of selective

8672
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:42,800
plague and other sort of selective
 

8673
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:43,590
plague and other sort of selective
events

8674
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:43,600
events
 

8675
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:46,389
events
in human history famines ice ages and so

8676
02:26:46,389 --> 02:26:46,399
in human history famines ice ages and so
 

8677
02:26:46,399 --> 02:26:46,870
in human history famines ice ages and so
forth

8678
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:46,880
forth
 

8679
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:48,710
forth
so that's number one then on on the sort

8680
02:26:48,710 --> 02:26:48,720
so that's number one then on on the sort
 

8681
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:51,670
so that's number one then on on the sort
of immune side on the metabolic side

8682
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:51,680
of immune side on the metabolic side
 

8683
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:53,510
of immune side on the metabolic side
you know again we are able to sort of

8684
02:26:53,510 --> 02:26:53,520
you know again we are able to sort of
 

8685
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:54,710
you know again we are able to sort of
run marathons

8686
02:26:54,710 --> 02:26:54,720
run marathons
 

8687
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:55,910
run marathons
you know you know i don't know if you

8688
02:26:55,910 --> 02:26:55,920
you know you know i don't know if you
 

8689
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:57,429
you know you know i don't know if you
remember the sort of human versus horse

8690
02:26:57,429 --> 02:26:57,439
remember the sort of human versus horse
 

8691
02:26:57,439 --> 02:26:58,230
remember the sort of human versus horse
experiment

8692
02:26:58,230 --> 02:26:58,240
experiment
 

8693
02:26:58,240 --> 02:26:59,590
experiment
where the horse actually tires out

8694
02:26:59,590 --> 02:26:59,600
where the horse actually tires out
 

8695
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:01,190
where the horse actually tires out
faster than the human and the human

8696
02:27:01,190 --> 02:27:01,200
faster than the human and the human
 

8697
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:03,030
faster than the human and the human
actually wins

8698
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:03,040
actually wins
 

8699
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,389
actually wins
so so on the metabolic side we're

8700
02:27:04,389 --> 02:27:04,399
so so on the metabolic side we're
 

8701
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:06,309
so so on the metabolic side we're
dramatically different on the immune

8702
02:27:06,309 --> 02:27:06,319
dramatically different on the immune
 

8703
02:27:06,319 --> 02:27:07,590
dramatically different on the immune
side we're dramatically different on the

8704
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:07,600
side we're dramatically different on the
 

8705
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:08,469
side we're dramatically different on the
brain side

8706
02:27:08,469 --> 02:27:08,479
brain side
 

8707
02:27:08,479 --> 02:27:11,510
brain side
again you know no need to sort of you

8708
02:27:11,510 --> 02:27:11,520
again you know no need to sort of you
 

8709
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:12,790
again you know no need to sort of you
know it's a no-brainer how

8710
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:12,800
know it's a no-brainer how
 

8711
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:15,670
know it's a no-brainer how
our brain is like just enormously more

8712
02:27:15,670 --> 02:27:15,680
our brain is like just enormously more
 

8713
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:16,630
our brain is like just enormously more
capable

8714
02:27:16,630 --> 02:27:16,640
capable
 

8715
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:18,870
capable
and then uh in you know in the side of

8716
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:18,880
and then uh in you know in the side of
 

8717
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:20,389
and then uh in you know in the side of
cancer so basically the cancers that

8718
02:27:20,389 --> 02:27:20,399
cancer so basically the cancers that
 

8719
02:27:20,399 --> 02:27:21,030
cancer so basically the cancers that
humans

8720
02:27:21,030 --> 02:27:21,040
humans
 

8721
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:22,309
humans
are having the exposure the

8722
02:27:22,309 --> 02:27:22,319
are having the exposure the
 

8723
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:24,630
are having the exposure the
environmental exposures is again

8724
02:27:24,630 --> 02:27:24,640
environmental exposures is again
 

8725
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:25,670
environmental exposures is again
dramatically different

8726
02:27:25,670 --> 02:27:25,680
dramatically different
 

8727
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:27,910
dramatically different
and the lifespan the expansion of human

8728
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:27,920
and the lifespan the expansion of human
 

8729
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:29,110
and the lifespan the expansion of human
lifespan

8730
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:29,120
lifespan
 

8731
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:32,309
lifespan
is unseen in any other species in

8732
02:27:32,309 --> 02:27:32,319
is unseen in any other species in
 

8733
02:27:32,319 --> 02:27:35,429
is unseen in any other species in
you know recent evolutionary history

8734
02:27:35,429 --> 02:27:35,439
you know recent evolutionary history
 

8735
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:37,990
you know recent evolutionary history
and that now leads to a lot of new

8736
02:27:37,990 --> 02:27:38,000
and that now leads to a lot of new
 

8737
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,030
and that now leads to a lot of new
disorders

8738
02:27:39,030 --> 02:27:39,040
disorders
 

8739
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:42,070
disorders
that are starting to you know manifest

8740
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:42,080
that are starting to you know manifest
 

8741
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:45,270
that are starting to you know manifest
late in life so uh you know alzheimer's

8742
02:27:45,270 --> 02:27:45,280
late in life so uh you know alzheimer's
 

8743
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,950
late in life so uh you know alzheimer's
is one example where basically

8744
02:27:46,950 --> 02:27:46,960
is one example where basically
 

8745
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:49,270
is one example where basically
you know these vast energetic needs over

8746
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:49,280
you know these vast energetic needs over
 

8747
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:50,230
you know these vast energetic needs over
a lifetime

8748
02:27:50,230 --> 02:27:50,240
a lifetime
 

8749
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:53,270
a lifetime
of thinking can basically lead to all of

8750
02:27:53,270 --> 02:27:53,280
of thinking can basically lead to all of
 

8751
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:54,150
of thinking can basically lead to all of
these debris

8752
02:27:54,150 --> 02:27:54,160
these debris
 

8753
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:56,550
these debris
and eventually saturate the system and

8754
02:27:56,550 --> 02:27:56,560
and eventually saturate the system and
 

8755
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:57,270
and eventually saturate the system and
lead to

8756
02:27:57,270 --> 02:27:57,280
lead to
 

8757
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:00,550
lead to
you know alzheimer's in in the late life

8758
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:00,560
you know alzheimer's in in the late life
 

8759
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:03,030
you know alzheimer's in in the late life
but there's you know there's just such a

8760
02:28:03,030 --> 02:28:03,040
but there's you know there's just such a
 

8761
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:04,230
but there's you know there's just such a
such a dramatic

8762
02:28:04,230 --> 02:28:04,240
such a dramatic
 

8763
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:07,349
such a dramatic
uh set of frontiers when it comes to

8764
02:28:07,349 --> 02:28:07,359
uh set of frontiers when it comes to
 

8765
02:28:07,359 --> 02:28:08,710
uh set of frontiers when it comes to
aging research

8766
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:08,720
aging research
 

8767
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:11,349
aging research
that you know will so what i often like

8768
02:28:11,349 --> 02:28:11,359
that you know will so what i often like
 

8769
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:12,230
that you know will so what i often like
to say is that

8770
02:28:12,230 --> 02:28:12,240
to say is that
 

8771
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:14,630
to say is that
if you want to re to to engineer a car

8772
02:28:14,630 --> 02:28:14,640
if you want to re to to engineer a car
 

8773
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:16,870
if you want to re to to engineer a car
to go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles

8774
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:16,880
to go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles
 

8775
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:17,990
to go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles
an hour that's fine

8776
02:28:17,990 --> 02:28:18,000
an hour that's fine
 

8777
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,510
an hour that's fine
you can basically you know fix a few

8778
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:19,520
you can basically you know fix a few
 

8779
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:21,270
you can basically you know fix a few
components if you wanted to now go out

8780
02:28:21,270 --> 02:28:21,280
components if you wanted to now go out
 

8781
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:22,550
components if you wanted to now go out
400 miles an hour

8782
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:22,560
400 miles an hour
 

8783
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:23,990
400 miles an hour
you have to completely redesign the

8784
02:28:23,990 --> 02:28:24,000
you have to completely redesign the
 

8785
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,590
you have to completely redesign the
entire car

8786
02:28:25,590 --> 02:28:25,600
entire car
 

8787
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:28,790
entire car
because the system has just not evolved

8788
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:28,800
because the system has just not evolved
 

8789
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:32,630
because the system has just not evolved
to go that far basically our human body

8790
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:32,640
to go that far basically our human body
 

8791
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:34,710
to go that far basically our human body
has only evolved to live to i don't know

changes
but if you know as we start pushing

8800
02:28:40,630 --> 02:28:40,640
but if you know as we start pushing
 

8801
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:42,070
but if you know as we start pushing
these frontiers for not just

these frontiers for not just
 

8803
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:45,910
these frontiers for not just
living but well living the f

zine that we talked about last time so
 

8807
02:28:48,319 --> 02:28:49,990
zine that we talked about last time so
to to basically push f zine

8808
02:28:49,990 --> 02:28:50,000
to to basically push f zine
 

8809
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,389
to to basically push f zine
into the 80s and 90s and 100s and you

02:28:52,389 --> 02:28:52,399
into the 80s and 90s and 100s and you
 

8811

know much further than that
 

8813
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:57,590
know much further than that
we will face new challenges

8814
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:57,600
we will face new challenges
 

8815
02:28:57,600 --> 02:28:59,349
we will face new challenges
that have you know never been faced

there's just so many different frontiers

8828
02:29:09,830 --> 02:29:09,840
there's just so many different frontiers
 

8829
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:11,349
there's just so many different frontiers
ahead of us so

8830
02:29:11,349 --> 02:29:11,359
ahead of us so
 

8831
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:14,070
ahead of us so
i am thrilled about where we're heading

8832
02:29:14,070 --> 02:29:14,080
i am thrilled about where we're heading
 

8833
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:15,830
i am thrilled about where we're heading
so basically i see this confluence

8834
02:29:15,830 --> 02:29:15,840
so basically i see this confluence
 

8835
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:19,349
so basically i see this confluence
in my lab and many other labs of ai
