the philosophy of it it's a very
 

167
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,990
the philosophy of it it's a very
interesting question I must say at one

168
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
interesting question I must say at one
 

169
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,949
interesting question I must say at one
level

170
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
level
 

171
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,490
level
it's not a conscious thing I can say a

172
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:28,500
it's not a conscious thing I can say a
 

173
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,490
it's not a conscious thing I can say a
lot about why as an adult I find biology

174
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,500
lot about why as an adult I find biology
 

175
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,210
lot about why as an adult I find biology
compelling but as a kid I was completely

176
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,220
compelling but as a kid I was completely
 

177
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,970
compelling but as a kid I was completely
fascinated with animals I loved to watch

178
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:37,980
fascinated with animals I loved to watch
 

179
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,670
fascinated with animals I loved to watch
them and think about why they did what

180
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:40,680
them and think about why they did what
 

181
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,089
them and think about why they did what
they did and that developed into a very

182
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:44,099
they did and that developed into a very
 

183
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,030
they did and that developed into a very
conscious passion as an adult but I

184
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
conscious passion as an adult but I
 

185
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,750
conscious passion as an adult but I
think

186
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
think
 

187
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,350
think
uh in the same way that one is drawn to

188
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
uh in the same way that one is drawn to
 

189
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,110
uh in the same way that one is drawn to
a person I was drawn to the never-ending

190
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
a person I was drawn to the never-ending
 

191
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,170
a person I was drawn to the never-ending
series of near Miracles that exists

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,180
series of near Miracles that exists
 

193
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,990
series of near Miracles that exists
across biological nature when you see a

194
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,000
across biological nature when you see a
 

195
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,869
across biological nature when you see a
living organism do you see it from an

196
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:05,879
living organism do you see it from an
 

197
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,570
living organism do you see it from an
evolutionary biology perspective of like

198
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:08,580
evolutionary biology perspective of like
 

199
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,309
evolutionary biology perspective of like
this entire thing that moves around in

200
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
this entire thing that moves around in
 

201
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,170
this entire thing that moves around in
this world or do you see like from an

202
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,180
this world or do you see like from an
 

203
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,710
this world or do you see like from an
engineering perspective that like uh

204
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:15,720
engineering perspective that like uh
 

205
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,749
engineering perspective that like uh
first principles almost down to the

00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
first principles almost down to the
 

207
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,370
first principles almost down to the
physics like the little components that

208
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:19,380
physics like the little components that
 

209
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,490
physics like the little components that
build up hierarchies they have cells if

210
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:22,500
build up hierarchies they have cells if
 

211
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,330
build up hierarchies they have cells if
the first proteins and cells and organs

212

the first proteins and cells and organs
 

213
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,890
the first proteins and cells and organs
and all that kind of stuff so you see

214
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:27,900
and all that kind of stuff so you see
 

215
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,650
and all that kind of stuff so you see
low level or do you see high level

216
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:30,660
low level or do you see high level
 

217
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,689
low level or do you see high level
well the human mind is a strange thing

218
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:32,699
well the human mind is a strange thing
 

219
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,990
well the human mind is a strange thing
and I think it's probably a bit like a

220
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
and I think it's probably a bit like a
 

221
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,230
and I think it's probably a bit like a
time sharing machine in which I have

222
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,240
time sharing machine in which I have
 

223
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,090
time sharing machine in which I have
different modules we don't know enough

224
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,100
different modules we don't know enough
 

225
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,310
different modules we don't know enough
about biology for them to connect right

226
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,320
about biology for them to connect right
 

227
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,409
about biology for them to connect right
so they exist in isolation and I'm

228
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:45,419
so they exist in isolation and I'm
 

229
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,749
so they exist in isolation and I'm
always aware that they do connect but I

230
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
always aware that they do connect but I
 

231
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,990
always aware that they do connect but I
basically have to step into a module in

232
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,000
basically have to step into a module in
 

233
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,510
basically have to step into a module in
order to see The evolutionary dynamics

234
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
order to see The evolutionary dynamics
 

235
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,909
order to see The evolutionary dynamics
of the creature and the lineage that it

236
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
of the creature and the lineage that it
 

237
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,070
of the creature and the lineage that it
belongs to I have to step into a

238
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
belongs to I have to step into a
 

239
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,749
belongs to I have to step into a
different module to think of that

240
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
different module to think of that
 

241
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,510
different module to think of that
lineage over a very long time scale a

242
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,520
lineage over a very long time scale a
 

243
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,070
lineage over a very long time scale a
different module still to understand

244
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
different module still to understand
 

245
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,590
different module still to understand
what the mechanisms inside would have to

246
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:06,600
what the mechanisms inside would have to
 

247
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,770
what the mechanisms inside would have to
look like to account for what we can see

248
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:08,780
look like to account for what we can see
 

249
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,170
look like to account for what we can see
from the outside and

250
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:12,180
from the outside and
 

251
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,290
from the outside and
I think that probably sounds really

252
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,300
I think that probably sounds really
 

253
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,510
I think that probably sounds really
complicated but

254
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
complicated but
 

255
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,909
complicated but
one of the things about being

256
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
one of the things about being
 

257
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,029
one of the things about being
involved in a topic like biology and

258
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
involved in a topic like biology and
 

259
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,610
involved in a topic like biology and
doing so for one you know really not

260
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:25,620
doing so for one you know really not
 

261
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,110
doing so for one you know really not
even just my adult life for my whole

262
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
even just my adult life for my whole
 

263
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,210
even just my adult life for my whole
life is that it becomes second nature

264
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,220
life is that it becomes second nature
 

265
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,570
life is that it becomes second nature
and you know when when we see somebody

266
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:31,580
and you know when when we see somebody
 

267
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,029
and you know when when we see somebody
do an amazing Parkour routine or

268
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
do an amazing Parkour routine or
 

269
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,830
do an amazing Parkour routine or
something like that

270
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
something like that
 

271
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,529
something like that
we think about what they must be doing

272
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:39,539
we think about what they must be doing
 

273
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,810
we think about what they must be doing
in order to accomplish that but of

274
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:41,820
in order to accomplish that but of
 

275
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,790
in order to accomplish that but of
course what they are doing is tapping

276
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:43,800
course what they are doing is tapping
 

277
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,570
course what they are doing is tapping
into some kind of zone right they are in

278
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:47,580
into some kind of zone right they are in
 

279
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,409
into some kind of zone right they are in
a Zone in which they are in such

280
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:50,419
a Zone in which they are in such
 

281
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:52,969
a Zone in which they are in such
command of their center of gravity for

282
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:52,979
command of their center of gravity for
 

283
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,909
command of their center of gravity for
example that they know how to hurl it

284
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
example that they know how to hurl it
 

285
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,710
example that they know how to hurl it
around a landscape so that they always

286
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:57,720
around a landscape so that they always
 

287
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,350
around a landscape so that they always
land on their feet

288
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,360
land on their feet
 

289
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,050
land on their feet
um and I would just say

290
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,060
um and I would just say
 

291
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,390
um and I would just say
for anyone who hasn't found a topic on

292
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,400
for anyone who hasn't found a topic on
 

293
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,210
for anyone who hasn't found a topic on
which they can develop that kind of

294
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,220
which they can develop that kind of
 

295
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,450
which they can develop that kind of
facility it is absolutely worthwhile

296
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:11,460
facility it is absolutely worthwhile
 

297
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,129
facility it is absolutely worthwhile
it's really something that human beings

298
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:13,139
it's really something that human beings
 

299
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,469
it's really something that human beings
are capable of doing across a wide range

300
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:15,479
are capable of doing across a wide range
 

301
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,629
are capable of doing across a wide range
of topics many things our ancestors

302
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:17,639
of topics many things our ancestors
 

303
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,689
of topics many things our ancestors
didn't even have access to and that

304
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:20,699
didn't even have access to and that
 

305
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,270
didn't even have access to and that
flexibility of humans that ability to

306
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
flexibility of humans that ability to
 

307
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,529
flexibility of humans that ability to
repurpose our machinery for topics that

308
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:27,539
repurpose our machinery for topics that
 

309
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,710
repurpose our machinery for topics that
are novel means really the world is your

310
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
are novel means really the world is your
 

311
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,390
are novel means really the world is your
oyster you can you can figure out what

312
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
oyster you can you can figure out what
 

313
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,189
oyster you can you can figure out what
your passion is and then figure out all

314
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:34,199
your passion is and then figure out all
 

315
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,689
your passion is and then figure out all
of the angles that one would have to

316
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:35,699
of the angles that one would have to
 

317
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,909
of the angles that one would have to
pursue to really deeply understand it

318
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
pursue to really deeply understand it
 

319
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,210
pursue to really deeply understand it
and it is uh it is well worth having at

320
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:41,220
and it is uh it is well worth having at
 

321
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,490
and it is uh it is well worth having at
least one topic like that you mean

322
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:43,500
least one topic like that you mean
 

323
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,550
least one topic like that you mean
embracing the full adaptability of the

324
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
embracing the full adaptability of the
 

325
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,909
embracing the full adaptability of the
both the the body and the mind so like

326
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919

technological machines but
 

359
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,270

creatures that will look very different
 

377
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,490
creatures that will look very different
from it and if a creature is very very

going forward then that lineage will not
 

385
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,730
going forward then that lineage will not
last very long into the future because

last very long into the future because
 

387

the thing about humans is we are a

392
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:11,699
the thing about humans is we are a
 

393
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,430
the thing about humans is we are a
generalist platform

394
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
generalist platform
 

395
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,550
generalist platform
and we have the ability to swap out our

396
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
and we have the ability to swap out our
 

397
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,029
and we have the ability to swap out our
software to exist in many many different

398
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:20,039
software to exist in many many different
 

399
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,330
software to exist in many many different
niches and I was once watching a an

400
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:23,340
niches and I was once watching a an
 

401
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,550
niches and I was once watching a an
interview with with this uh British

402
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:25,560
interview with with this uh British
 

403
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,430
interview with with this uh British
group of Parkour experts who were being

404
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440
group of Parkour experts who were being
 

405
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,469
group of Parkour experts who were being
you know just they were discussing what

406
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
you know just they were discussing what
 

407
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,149
you know just they were discussing what
it is they do and how it works and what

408
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
it is they do and how it works and what
 

409
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,610
it is they do and how it works and what
they essentially said is look you're

410
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:34,620
they essentially said is look you're
 

411
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,269
they essentially said is look you're
tapping into deep monkey stuff

412
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:38,279
tapping into deep monkey stuff
 

413
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,850
tapping into deep monkey stuff
right and I thought yeah that's about

414
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:40,860
right and I thought yeah that's about
 

415
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,750
right and I thought yeah that's about
right and you know anybody who

416
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:44,760
right and you know anybody who
 

417
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,389
right and you know anybody who
is proficient at something like skiing

418
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:47,399
is proficient at something like skiing
 

419
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,570
is proficient at something like skiing
or skateboarding you know has the

420
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:50,580
or skateboarding you know has the
 

421
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,210
or skateboarding you know has the
experience of

422
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:53,220
experience of
 

423
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,990
experience of
flying down the hill on skis for example

424
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
flying down the hill on skis for example
 

425
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,150
flying down the hill on skis for example
bouncing from the top of one Mogul to

426
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,160
bouncing from the top of one Mogul to
 

427
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,090
bouncing from the top of one Mogul to
the next and if you really pay attention

428
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,100
the next and if you really pay attention
 

429
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,190
the next and if you really pay attention
you will discover that your conscious

430
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:04,200
you will discover that your conscious
 

431
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,230
you will discover that your conscious
mind is actually a spectator it's there

432
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
mind is actually a spectator it's there
 

433
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,509
mind is actually a spectator it's there
it's involved in the experience but it's

434
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:08,519
it's involved in the experience but it's
 

435
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,190
it's involved in the experience but it's
not driving some part of you knows how

436
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,200
not driving some part of you knows how
 

437
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,449
not driving some part of you knows how
to ski and it's not the part of you that

438
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:11,459
to ski and it's not the part of you that
 

439
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,210
to ski and it's not the part of you that
knows how to think and

440
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:14,220
knows how to think and
 

441
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,389
knows how to think and
I would just say that the what accounts

442
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:17,399
I would just say that the what accounts
 

443
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,449
I would just say that the what accounts
for this flexibility in humans is the

444
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:20,459
for this flexibility in humans is the
 

445
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,610
for this flexibility in humans is the
ability to bootstrap a new software

446
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:22,620
ability to bootstrap a new software
 

447
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,870
ability to bootstrap a new software
program

448
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:23,880
program
 

449
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,750
program
and then drive it into the unconscious

450
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
and then drive it into the unconscious
 

451
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,550
and then drive it into the unconscious
layer where it can be applied very

452
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
layer where it can be applied very
 

453
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,870
layer where it can be applied very
rapidly

454
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:29,880
rapidly
 

455
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,870
rapidly
and you know I will be shocked if the

456
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
and you know I will be shocked if the
 

457
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,110
and you know I will be shocked if the
exact thing doesn't exist in robotics

458
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,120
exact thing doesn't exist in robotics
 

459
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,610
exact thing doesn't exist in robotics
you know if you if you programmed a

460
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:37,620
you know if you if you programmed a
 

461
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,530
you know if you if you programmed a
robot to deal with circumstances that

462
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:39,540
robot to deal with circumstances that
 

463
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,210
robot to deal with circumstances that
were novel to it how would you do it it

464
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,220
were novel to it how would you do it it
 

465
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,590
were novel to it how would you do it it
would have to look something like this

466
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:42,600
would have to look something like this
 

467
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,990
would have to look something like this
this is a certain kind of magic

468
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,000
this is a certain kind of magic
 

469
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,150
this is a certain kind of magic
you're right well the Consciousness

470
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,160
you're right well the Consciousness
 

471
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,310
you're right well the Consciousness

00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
know what the heck is responsible for
 

479
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,470
know what the heck is responsible for
the flow of the music the kind of the

the flow of the music the kind of the
 

481
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,389
the flow of the music the kind of the
loudness of the music going up and down

seem to be the conscious mind

488
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:09,899
seem to be the conscious mind
 

489
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,470
seem to be the conscious mind
uh it's it is just observing and yet

490
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
uh it's it is just observing and yet
 

491
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,050
uh it's it is just observing and yet
it's somehow intricately involved more

492
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,060
it's somehow intricately involved more
 

493
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,329
it's somehow intricately involved more
like because you mentioned parkour the

494
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:17,339
like because you mentioned parkour the
 

495
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,370
like because you mentioned parkour the
dance is like that too when you start

496
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:19,380
dance is like that too when you start
 

497
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,069
dance is like that too when you start
I've been Tango dancing if when you

498
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
I've been Tango dancing if when you
 

499
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,009
I've been Tango dancing if when you
truly lose yourself in it

500
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:24,019
truly lose yourself in it
 

501
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,990
truly lose yourself in it
then it's just like you're an observer

502
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,000
then it's just like you're an observer
 

503
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,790
then it's just like you're an observer
and how the hell is the body able to do

504
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
and how the hell is the body able to do
 

505
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,710
and how the hell is the body able to do
that and not only that it's the physical

506
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
that and not only that it's the physical
 

507
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,810
that and not only that it's the physical
motion is also creating the emotion the

508
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:35,820
motion is also creating the emotion the
 

509
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,870
motion is also creating the emotion the
like that damn was good to be alive

510
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
like that damn was good to be alive
 

511
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,050
like that damn was good to be alive
feeling

512
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,060
feeling
 

513
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,030
feeling
so but then that's also intricately

514
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,040
so but then that's also intricately
 

515
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,790
so but then that's also intricately
connected to the full biology stack that

516
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
connected to the full biology stack that
 

517
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,470
connected to the full biology stack that
we're operating in I don't know how

518
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
we're operating in I don't know how
 

519
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,389
we're operating in I don't know how
difficult it is to replicate that we're

520
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
difficult it is to replicate that we're
 

521
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,850
difficult it is to replicate that we're
talking offline about Boston Dynamics

522
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:52,860
talking offline about Boston Dynamics

robots

524
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
robots
 

525
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,810
robots
um they've recently been they did both

526
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:56,820
um they've recently been they did both
 

527
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,290
um they've recently been they did both
parkour they did flips they've also done

528
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:00,300
parkour they did flips they've also done
 

529
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,970

some dancing

530
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:01,980
some dancing
 

531
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,410
some dancing
and something I think a lot about

532
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:03,420
and something I think a lot about
 

533
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,790
and something I think a lot about
because what most people don't realize

534
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:07,800
because what most people don't realize
 

535
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,829
because what most people don't realize
because they don't look deep enough as

536
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
because they don't look deep enough as
 

537
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,889
because they don't look deep enough as
those robots are hard-coded to do those

538
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:12,899
those robots are hard-coded to do those
 

539
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:13,850
those robots are hard-coded to do those
things

540
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:13,860
things
 

541
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,829
things
the the robots didn't figure it out by

542
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
the the robots didn't figure it out by
 

543
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,650
the the robots didn't figure it out by
themselves and yet the the fundamental

544
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:18,660
themselves and yet the the fundamental
 

545
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,050
themselves and yet the the fundamental
aspect of what it means to be human is

546
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,060
aspect of what it means to be human is
 

547
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,090
aspect of what it means to be human is
that process of figuring out of making

548
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,100
that process of figuring out of making
 

549
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,949
that process of figuring out of making
mistakes and then there's something

550
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
mistakes and then there's something
 

551
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,290
mistakes and then there's something
about overcoming those challenges and

552
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:27,300
about overcoming those challenges and
 

553
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,449
about overcoming those challenges and
the mistakes and like figuring out how

554
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:29,459
the mistakes and like figuring out how
 

555
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:30,949
the mistakes and like figuring out how
to lose yourself in the magic of the

00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
uh or just movement is what it means to
 

561
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,970
uh or just movement is what it means to
be human that learning process so that's

562
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:37,980
be human that learning process so that's
 

563
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,310

what I want to do with the with the uh
 

565
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,130
what I want to do with the with the uh

Boston Dynamics robots is to have them

568
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:45,899
Boston Dynamics robots is to have them
 

569
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,230
Boston Dynamics robots is to have them
learn and see what they figure out

570
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
learn and see what they figure out
 

571
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,230
learn and see what they figure out
even if it even if they make mistakes I

572
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,240
even if it even if they make mistakes I
 

573
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,790
even if it even if they make mistakes I
want to let

574
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
want to let
 

575
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,449
want to let
spot make mistakes and and so doing

576
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:56,459
spot make mistakes and and so doing
 

577
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:00,110
spot make mistakes and and so doing
discover what it means to be alive

the essential aspect of mistakes
Boston Dynamics folks want spot to be

584
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:08,220
Boston Dynamics folks want spot to be
 

585
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,610
Boston Dynamics folks want spot to be
perfect because they don't want spot to

586
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:10,620
perfect because they don't want spot to
 

587
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,650
perfect because they don't want spot to
ever make mistakes because it wants to

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:12,660
ever make mistakes because it wants to
 

589
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,210
ever make mistakes because it wants to
operate in the factories it wants to be

you know very safe and so on for me if

592
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:17,339
you know very safe and so on for me if
 

593
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,490
you know very safe and so on for me if
you construct the environment if you

594
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:19,500
you construct the environment if you
 

595
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,730
you construct the environment if you
construct a safe space for robots and

596
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:22,740
construct a safe space for robots and
 

597
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,769

Beautiful might be discovered but that

600
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:27,540
Beautiful might be discovered but that
 

601
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,590
Beautiful might be discovered but that
requires a lot of brain power so spot is

602
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:30,600
requires a lot of brain power so spot is
 

603
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,910
requires a lot of brain power so spot is
currently very dumb

604
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
currently very dumb
 

605
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,889
currently very dumb
and I'm going to add it give it a brain

606
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:33,899
and I'm going to add it give it a brain
 

607
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,710
and I'm going to add it give it a brain
so first make it C currently can't see

608
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
so first make it C currently can't see
 

609
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,750
so first make it C currently can't see
meaning computer vision has to

610

meaning computer vision has to
 

611
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,370
meaning computer vision has to
understand this environment has to see

612
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:40,380
understand this environment has to see
 

613
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,710
understand this environment has to see
all the humans but then also has to be

614
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
all the humans but then also has to be
 

615
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,110
all the humans but then also has to be
able to learn learn about its movement

616
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
able to learn learn about its movement
 

617

623
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,790
the dogs know how to do well humans know
how to do somewhat well I think that's a

624
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:55,800
how to do somewhat well I think that's a
 

625
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,350
how to do somewhat well I think that's a
beautiful challenge but first you have

626
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
beautiful challenge but first you have
 

627
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,829
beautiful challenge but first you have
to allow the robot to make mistakes well

628
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:00,839
to allow the robot to make mistakes well
 

629
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:01,970
to allow the robot to make mistakes well
I think

630
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:01,980
I think
 

631
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,250
I think
um your objective is laudable but you're

632
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,260
um your objective is laudable but you're
 

633
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,590
um your objective is laudable but you're
going to realize that the Boston

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
going to realize that the Boston

um so let me step back into what you
 

647
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,769
um so let me step back into what you
said in a couple of different places one

648
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:21,779
said in a couple of different places one
 

649
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,230
said in a couple of different places one
I have always believed that the missing

650
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
I have always believed that the missing
 

651
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,290
I have always believed that the missing
element in robotics and artificial

652
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:27,300
element in robotics and artificial
 

653
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,990
element in robotics and artificial
intelligence is a proper development

654
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
intelligence is a proper development
 

655
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,690
intelligence is a proper development
right it is no accident it is no mere

656
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:32,700
right it is no accident it is no mere
 

657
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,569
right it is no accident it is no mere
coincidence that human beings are the

658
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:35,579
coincidence that human beings are the
 

659
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,190
coincidence that human beings are the
most dominant species on planet Earth

660
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
most dominant species on planet Earth
 

661
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,990
most dominant species on planet Earth
and that we have the longest childhoods

662
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,000
and that we have the longest childhoods
 

663
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,930
and that we have the longest childhoods
of any creature on Earth by far right

664
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:41,940
of any creature on Earth by far right
 

665
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,970
of any creature on Earth by far right
the development is the key to the

666
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:43,980
the development is the key to the
 

667
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,250
the development is the key to the
flexibility and so uh the capability of

668
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:49,260
flexibility and so uh the capability of
 

669
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,150
flexibility and so uh the capability of
a human at adulthood is the mirror image

670
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,160
a human at adulthood is the mirror image
 

671
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,509
a human at adulthood is the mirror image
it's the flip side of our helplessness

672
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:56,519
it's the flip side of our helplessness
 

673
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,290
it's the flip side of our helplessness
at Birth so I'll be very interested to

674
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:00,300
at Birth so I'll be very interested to
 

675
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,810
at Birth so I'll be very interested to
see what happens in your uh robot

676
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:02,820
see what happens in your uh robot
 

677
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,150
see what happens in your uh robot
project if you do not end up Reinventing

678
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,160
project if you do not end up Reinventing
 

679
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,129
project if you do not end up Reinventing
childhood for robots which of course is

680
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:07,139
childhood for robots which of course is
 

681
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,110
childhood for robots which of course is
foreshadowed in 2001 quite brilliantly

682
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
foreshadowed in 2001 quite brilliantly
 

683
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,629
foreshadowed in 2001 quite brilliantly
but I also want to point out you can you

684
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
but I also want to point out you can you
 

685
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,449
but I also want to point out you can you
can see this issue of your conscious

686
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:17,459
can see this issue of your conscious
 

687
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,030
can see this issue of your conscious
mind becoming a spectator very well if

688
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,040
mind becoming a spectator very well if
 

689
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,829
mind becoming a spectator very well if
you compare tennis to table tennis

690
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
you compare tennis to table tennis
 

691
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,930
you compare tennis to table tennis
right if you watch a tennis game

692
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:26,940
right if you watch a tennis game
 

693
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,629
right if you watch a tennis game
you could imagine that the players are

694
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:29,639
you could imagine that the players are
 

695
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,269
you could imagine that the players are
highly conscious as they play

696
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:32,279
highly conscious as they play
 

697
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,370
highly conscious as they play
you cannot imagine that if you've ever

698
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:34,380
you cannot imagine that if you've ever
 

699
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,550
you cannot imagine that if you've ever
played ping pong decently a volley in

700
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:37,560
played ping pong decently a volley in
 

701
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,129
played ping pong decently a volley in
ping pong is so fast that your conscious

702
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:40,139
ping pong is so fast that your conscious
 

703
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,590
ping pong is so fast that your conscious
mind if it had if your reactions had to

704
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:42,600
mind if it had if your reactions had to
 

705
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,970
mind if it had if your reactions had to
go through your conscious mind you

706
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:43,980
go through your conscious mind you
 

707
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,530
go through your conscious mind you
wouldn't be able to play so you can

708
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:45,540
wouldn't be able to play so you can
 

709
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,509
wouldn't be able to play so you can
detect that your conscious mind while

710
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
detect that your conscious mind while
 

711
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,509
detect that your conscious mind while
very much present isn't there and you

712
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:50,519
very much present isn't there and you
 

713
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,550
very much present isn't there and you
can also detect where Consciousness does

714
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
can also detect where Consciousness does
 

715
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,150
can also detect where Consciousness does
usefully intrude if you go up against an

716
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
usefully intrude if you go up against an
 

717
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,490
usefully intrude if you go up against an
opponent in table tennis that knows a

718
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:58,500
opponent in table tennis that knows a
 

719
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,769
opponent in table tennis that knows a
trick that you don't know how to respond

720
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:00,779
trick that you don't know how to respond
 

721
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,170
trick that you don't know how to respond
to you will suddenly detect that

722
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,180
to you will suddenly detect that
 

723
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,329
to you will suddenly detect that
something about your game is not

724
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:05,339
something about your game is not
 

725
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,310
something about your game is not
effective and you will start thinking

726
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:07,320
effective and you will start thinking
 

727
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,930
effective and you will start thinking
about what might be how do you position

728
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:08,940
about what might be how do you position
 

729
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,910
about what might be how do you position
yourself so that move that puts the ball

730
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:10,920
yourself so that move that puts the ball
 

731
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,769
yourself so that move that puts the ball
just in that corner of the table or

732
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:12,779
just in that corner of the table or
 

733
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,449
just in that corner of the table or
something like that doesn't catch you

734
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:14,459
something like that doesn't catch you
 

735
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,730
something like that doesn't catch you
off guard and

736
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:16,740
off guard and
 

737
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,730
off guard and
this I believe is

738
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:19,740
this I believe is
 

739
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,670
this I believe is
we highly conscious folks those of us

740
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:22,680
we highly conscious folks those of us
 

741
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,230
we highly conscious folks those of us
who try to think through things very

742
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
who try to think through things very
 

743
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,870
who try to think through things very
deliberately and carefully

744
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:25,880
deliberately and carefully
 

745
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,550
deliberately and carefully
mistake Consciousness for like the

746
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
mistake Consciousness for like the
 

747
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,610
mistake Consciousness for like the
highest kind of thinking and I really

748
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:31,620
highest kind of thinking and I really
 

749
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,930
highest kind of thinking and I really
think that this is an error

750
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:32,940
think that this is an error
 

751
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,449
think that this is an error
Consciousness is an intermediate level

752
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:35,459
Consciousness is an intermediate level
 

753
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,550
Consciousness is an intermediate level
of thinking what it does is it allows

754
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:37,560
of thinking what it does is it allows
 

755
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,710
of thinking what it does is it allows
you it's basically like uncompiled code

756
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:39,720
you it's basically like uncompiled code
 

757
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,949
you it's basically like uncompiled code
and it doesn't run very fast it is

758
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
and it doesn't run very fast it is
 

759
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,749
and it doesn't run very fast it is
capable of being adapted to new

760
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:44,759
capable of being adapted to new
 

761
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,970
capable of being adapted to new
circumstances but once the code is

762
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:46,980
circumstances but once the code is
 

763
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,670
circumstances but once the code is
roughed in right it gets driven into the

764
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
roughed in right it gets driven into the
 

765
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,530
roughed in right it gets driven into the
unconscious layer and you become highly

766
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:51,540
unconscious layer and you become highly
 

767
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,389
unconscious layer and you become highly
effective at whatever it is and that

768
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:53,399
effective at whatever it is and that
 

769
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,829
effective at whatever it is and that
from that point your conscious mind

770
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:54,839
from that point your conscious mind
 

771
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,290
from that point your conscious mind
basically remains there to detect things

772
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:57,300
basically remains there to detect things
 

773
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,970
basically remains there to detect things
that aren't anticipated by the code

774
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:58,980
that aren't anticipated by the code
 

775
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,490
that aren't anticipated by the code
you've already written and so

776
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:01,500
you've already written and so
 

777
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,710
you've already written and so
I don't exactly know how

778
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:03,720
I don't exactly know how
 

779
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,050
I don't exactly know how
one would establish this how one would

780
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,060
one would establish this how one would
 

781
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,389
one would establish this how one would
demonstrate it but it must be the case

782
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
demonstrate it but it must be the case
 

783
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,069
demonstrate it but it must be the case
that the human mind contains

784
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
that the human mind contains
 

785
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,569
that the human mind contains
sandboxes in which things are tested

786
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:14,579
sandboxes in which things are tested
 

787
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,550
sandboxes in which things are tested
right maybe you can build a piece of

788
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
right maybe you can build a piece of
 

789
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,249
right maybe you can build a piece of
code and run it in parallel next to your

790
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:19,259
code and run it in parallel next to your
 

791
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:20,930
code and run it in parallel next to your
active code so you can see how it would

792
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:20,940
active code so you can see how it would
 

793
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,230
active code so you can see how it would
have done comparatively but there's got

794
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
have done comparatively but there's got
 

795
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,810
have done comparatively but there's got
to be some way of writing new code and

796
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:26,820
to be some way of writing new code and
 

797
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,910
to be some way of writing new code and
then swapping it in and frankly I think

798
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:28,920
then swapping it in and frankly I think
 

799
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,410
then swapping it in and frankly I think
this has a lot to do with things like

800
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:30,420
this has a lot to do with things like
 

801
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,990
this has a lot to do with things like
sleep cycles very often you know when I

802
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,000
sleep cycles very often you know when I
 

803
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,269
sleep cycles very often you know when I
get good at something I often don't get

804
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
get good at something I often don't get
 

805
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,189
get good at something I often don't get
better at it while I'm doing it I get

806
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
better at it while I'm doing it I get
 

807
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,749
better at it while I'm doing it I get
better at it when I'm not doing it

808
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:38,759
better at it when I'm not doing it
 

809
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,610
better at it when I'm not doing it
especially if there's time to sleep and

810
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:40,620
especially if there's time to sleep and
 

811
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,610
especially if there's time to sleep and
think on it so there's some sort of you

812
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:43,620
think on it so there's some sort of you
 

813
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,650
think on it so there's some sort of you
know new program swapping in for old

814
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:45,660
know new program swapping in for old
 

815
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,050
know new program swapping in for old
program phenomenon which

816
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:48,060
program phenomenon which
 

817
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,650
program phenomenon which
um

818
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:48,660
um
 

819
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,269
um
you know will be a lot easier to see in

820
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:50,279
you know will be a lot easier to see in
 

821
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,189
you know will be a lot easier to see in
machines it's going to be hard with the

822
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:52,199
machines it's going to be hard with the
 

823
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,430
machines it's going to be hard with the
the wet wear I like I mean it is true

824
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
the wet wear I like I mean it is true
 

825
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,170
the wet wear I like I mean it is true
because somebody that played I played

826
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,180
because somebody that played I played
 

827
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,610
because somebody that played I played
tennis for many years

828
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:58,620
tennis for many years
 

829
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,590
tennis for many years
I do still think the highest form of

830
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:00,600
I do still think the highest form of
 

831
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,110
I do still think the highest form of
excellence in tennis is when the

832
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
excellence in tennis is when the
 

833
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,529
excellence in tennis is when the
conscious mind is a spectator so it's

834
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:06,539
conscious mind is a spectator so it's
 

835
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:09,230
conscious mind is a spectator so it's
the compiled code is the

836
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,240
the compiled code is the
 

837
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,169
the compiled code is the
highest form of Being Human and then

838
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:12,179
highest form of Being Human and then
 

839
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,409
highest form of Being Human and then
Consciousness is just some like specific

840
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:15,419
Consciousness is just some like specific
 

841
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,230
Consciousness is just some like specific
compiler you just have like Borland C

842
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
compiler you just have like Borland C
 

843
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,750
compiler you just have like Borland C
plus plus compiler you could just have

844
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:20,760
plus plus compiler you could just have
 

845
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,730
plus plus compiler you could just have
different kind of compilers ultimately

846
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:22,740
different kind of compilers ultimately
 

847
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,809
different kind of compilers ultimately
the the thing that by which we measure

848
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:26,819
the the thing that by which we measure
 

849
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,429
the the thing that by which we measure
the

850
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:28,439
the
 

851
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,529
the
the power of Life the intelligence of

852
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:30,539
the power of Life the intelligence of
 

853
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,330
the power of Life the intelligence of
life is the compiled code and you can

854
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:32,340
life is the compiled code and you can
 

855
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,890
life is the compiled code and you can
probably do that compilation all kinds

856
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:33,900
probably do that compilation all kinds
 

857
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,350
probably do that compilation all kinds
of ways yeah yeah I'm not saying that

858
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:36,360
of ways yeah yeah I'm not saying that
 

859
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,270
of ways yeah yeah I'm not saying that
tennis is played consciously and table

860
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,280
tennis is played consciously and table
 

861
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,950
tennis is played consciously and table
tennis isn't I'm saying that because

862
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:39,960
tennis isn't I'm saying that because
 

863
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,590
tennis isn't I'm saying that because
tennis is slowed down by the just the

864
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:42,600
tennis is slowed down by the just the
 

865
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,049
tennis is slowed down by the just the
space on the court you could you could

866
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:45,059
space on the court you could you could
 

867
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,490
space on the court you could you could
imagine that it was your conscious mind

868
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:46,500
imagine that it was your conscious mind
 

869
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,409
imagine that it was your conscious mind
playing but when you shrink the court

870
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:48,419
playing but when you shrink the court
 

871
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,510
playing but when you shrink the court
down that was obvious it becomes obvious

872
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:50,520
down that was obvious it becomes obvious
 

873
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,490
down that was obvious it becomes obvious
that your conscious mind is just present

874
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:52,500
that your conscious mind is just present
 

875
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,350
that your conscious mind is just present
rather than knowing where to put the

876
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:54,360
rather than knowing where to put the
 

877
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,890
rather than knowing where to put the
paddle and weirdly for me

878
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:57,900
paddle and weirdly for me
 

879
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,870
paddle and weirdly for me
um I would say this probably isn't true

880
00:17:59,870 --> 00:17:59,880
um I would say this probably isn't true
 

881
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,610
um I would say this probably isn't true
in a podcast situation

882
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:01,620
in a podcast situation
 

883
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,430
in a podcast situation
but if I have to give a presentation uh

884
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,440
but if I have to give a presentation uh
 

885
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,529
but if I have to give a presentation uh
especially if I have not overly prepared

886
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:06,539
especially if I have not overly prepared
 

887
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,930
especially if I have not overly prepared
I often find the same phenomenon when

888
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:08,940
I often find the same phenomenon when
 

889
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,610
I often find the same phenomenon when
I'm giving the presentation my conscious

890
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:10,620
I'm giving the presentation my conscious
 

891
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,230
I'm giving the presentation my conscious
mind is there watching some other part

892
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
mind is there watching some other part
 

893
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,230
mind is there watching some other part
of me present which uh is a little

894
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:15,240
of me present which uh is a little
 

895
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,270
of me present which uh is a little
jarring I have to say

896
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
jarring I have to say
 

897
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,669
jarring I have to say
well that means you've you've gotten

898
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
well that means you've you've gotten
 

899
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,770
well that means you've you've gotten
good at it not let the conscious mind

900
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:21,780
good at it not let the conscious mind
 

901
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,070
good at it not let the conscious mind
get in the way of the flow of words

902
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
get in the way of the flow of words
 

903
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,870
get in the way of the flow of words
yeah that's that's the sensation to be

904
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
yeah that's that's the sensation to be
 

905
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,190
yeah that's that's the sensation to be
sure and that's the highest form of

906
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,200
sure and that's the highest form of
 

907
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,830
sure and that's the highest form of
podcasting too I mean that's why I have

908
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:30,840
podcasting too I mean that's why I have
 

909
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,690
podcasting too I mean that's why I have
that that's what it looks like when a

910
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:32,700
that that's what it looks like when a
 

911
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,610
that that's what it looks like when a
podcast is really in the pocket like

912
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:34,620
podcast is really in the pocket like
 

913
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,350
podcast is really in the pocket like
like Joe

914
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:36,360
like Joe
 

915
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,450
like Joe

918
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,260
and just losing themselves and that's
 

919
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,870
and just losing themselves and that's
that's something I aspire to as well

920
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:41,880
that's something I aspire to as well
 

921
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,310
that's something I aspire to as well
just losing yourself in conversation

922
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,320
just losing yourself in conversation
 

923
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,289
just losing yourself in conversation
somebody that has a lot of anxiety with

924
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:45,299
somebody that has a lot of anxiety with
 

925
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,510
somebody that has a lot of anxiety with
people like I'm such an introvert I'm

926
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
people like I'm such an introvert I'm
 

927
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,250
people like I'm such an introvert I'm
scared I'm scared before you showed up

928
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:49,260
scared I'm scared before you showed up
 

929
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,930
scared I'm scared before you showed up
I'm scared right now

930
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:50,940
I'm scared right now
 

931
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,669
I'm scared right now
um there's just anxiety there's just

932
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:52,679
um there's just anxiety there's just
 

933
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,150
um there's just anxiety there's just
it's a giant mess uh it's hard to Lose

934
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
it's a giant mess uh it's hard to Lose
 

935
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,250
it's a giant mess uh it's hard to Lose
Yourself it's hard to just

936
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:58,260
Yourself it's hard to just
 

937
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,010
Yourself it's hard to just
get out of the way of your own mind yeah

938
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,020
get out of the way of your own mind yeah
 

939
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,850
get out of the way of your own mind yeah
actually uh trust is a big component of

940
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:04,860
actually uh trust is a big component of
 

941
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,669
actually uh trust is a big component of
that your your conscious mind retains

942
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
that your your conscious mind retains
 

943
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,210
that your your conscious mind retains
control if you are very uncertain

944
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:11,220
control if you are very uncertain
 

945
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,470
control if you are very uncertain
um but when you do when you do get into

946
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
um but when you do when you do get into
 

947
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,810
um but when you do when you do get into
that zone when you're speaking I realize

948
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:14,820
that zone when you're speaking I realize
 

949
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,310
that zone when you're speaking I realize
it's different for you with English as a

950
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
it's different for you with English as a
 

951
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,450
it's different for you with English as a
second language although maybe you

952
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:17,460
second language although maybe you
 

953
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,909
second language although maybe you
present in Russian and and you know and

954
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:19,919
present in Russian and and you know and
 

955
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,890
present in Russian and and you know and
it happens but do you ever hear yourself

956
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:21,900
it happens but do you ever hear yourself
 

957
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,630
it happens but do you ever hear yourself
say something and you think oh that's

958
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:23,640
say something and you think oh that's
 

959
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,650
say something and you think oh that's
really good

960
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:24,660
really good
 

961
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,930
really good
right like like you didn't come up with

962
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:26,940
right like like you didn't come up with
 

963
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,610
right like like you didn't come up with
it some other part of you that you don't

964
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:28,620

you know I think that's you have to find
the balance

1074
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:35,340
the balance
 

1075
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,789
the balance
because if you if you allow the

1076
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:37,799
because if you if you allow the
 

1077
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,669
because if you if you allow the

self-critical voice to become too heavy
 

1079
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,230
self-critical voice to become too heavy
the burden of the world the pressure

1080
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
the burden of the world the pressure
 

1081
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,750
the burden of the world the pressure
that the world puts on you to be the

1082
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:44,760
that the world puts on you to be the
 

1083
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,310
that the world puts on you to be the
best version of yourself and so on to

1084
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,320
best version of yourself and so on to
 

1085
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,270
best version of yourself and so on to
strive

1086
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,280
strive
 

1087
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,649
strive
then

1088
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:48,659
then
 

1089
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,690
then
you become a bug and that's a big

1090
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:50,700
you become a bug and that's a big
 

1091
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,630
you become a bug and that's a big
problem and then uh and then and then

1092
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:53,640
problem and then uh and then and then
 

1093
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,190
problem and then uh and then and then
the World Turns against you

1094
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
the World Turns against you
 

1095
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,710
the World Turns against you
because you're a bug you become some

1096
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:57,720
because you're a bug you become some
 

1097
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,110
because you're a bug you become some
kind of caricature of yourself uh I

1098
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,120
kind of caricature of yourself uh I
 

1099
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,630
kind of caricature of yourself uh I
don't know

1100
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:01,640
don't know
 

1101
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,370
don't know
become the worst version of yourself and

1102
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:04,380
become the worst version of yourself and
 

1103
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,430
become the worst version of yourself and
then thereby end up destroying yourself

1104
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
then thereby end up destroying yourself
 

1105
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,130
then thereby end up destroying yourself
and then the world moves on that's the

1106
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,140
and then the world moves on that's the
 

1107
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,830
and then the world moves on that's the
story that's a lovely story

1108
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
story that's a lovely story
 

1109
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,510
story that's a lovely story
I do think this is one of these places

1110
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:14,520
I do think this is one of these places
 

1111
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,169
I do think this is one of these places
and frankly you could map this onto all

1112
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:18,179
and frankly you could map this onto all
 

1113
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,210
and frankly you could map this onto all
of modern Human Experience but this is

1114
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:20,220
of modern Human Experience but this is
 

1115
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,430
of modern Human Experience but this is
one of these places where our ancestral

1116
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:22,440
one of these places where our ancestral
 

1117
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,710
one of these places where our ancestral
programming does not serve our modern

1118
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
programming does not serve our modern
 

1119
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,750
programming does not serve our modern
selves yeah so I used to talk to

1120
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:26,760
selves yeah so I used to talk to
 

1121
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,570
selves yeah so I used to talk to
students about the question of dwelling

1122
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:29,580
students about the question of dwelling
 

1123
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,850
students about the question of dwelling
on things you know dwelling on things is

1124
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:31,860
on things you know dwelling on things is
 

1125
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,090
on things you know dwelling on things is
famously understood to be bad

1126
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,100
famously understood to be bad
 

1127
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,070
famously understood to be bad
and it can't possibly be that it

1128
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,080
and it can't possibly be that it
 

1129
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,390
and it can't possibly be that it
wouldn't exist a tendency toward it

1130
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
wouldn't exist a tendency toward it
 

1131
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,250
wouldn't exist a tendency toward it
wouldn't exist if it was bad

1132
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:40,260
wouldn't exist if it was bad
 

1133
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,710
wouldn't exist if it was bad
so what is bad is dwelling on things

1134
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
so what is bad is dwelling on things
 

1135
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,169
so what is bad is dwelling on things

you know that's obviously easier to say

00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:48,419
you know that's obviously easier to say

that is that's what you're looking for

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:17,940
that is that's what you're looking for
 

1169

that is that's what you're looking for

some part of you feels like it you know
is punishing you rather than searching

00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:30,299
happened or you could think well what is
 

1281
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,850
happened or you could think well what is
the difference between what did happen

1282
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:31,860
the difference between what did happen
 

1283
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,409
the difference between what did happen
and my death

1284
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:33,419
and my death
 

1285
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,230
and my death
the difference is luck I never want that

1286
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
the difference is luck I never want that
 

1287
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,330
the difference is luck I never want that
to be true right I never want the

1288
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:38,340
to be true right I never want the
 

1289
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,370
to be true right I never want the
difference between what did happen and

1290
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:40,380
difference between what did happen and
 

1291
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,470
difference between what did happen and
my death to be luck therefore I should

1292
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
my death to be luck therefore I should
 

1293
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,110
my death to be luck therefore I should
count this as very close to death

1294
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
count this as very close to death
 

1295
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,110
count this as very close to death
and I should prioritize coding so it

1296
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,120
and I should prioritize coding so it
 

1297
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,549
and I should prioritize coding so it
doesn't happen again at a very high

1298
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:49,559
doesn't happen again at a very high
 

1299
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,330
doesn't happen again at a very high
level

1300
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:50,340
level
 

1301
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,750
level
so anyway my my basic point is

1302
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
so anyway my my basic point is
 

1303
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,210
so anyway my my basic point is
the

1304
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:55,220
the
 

1305
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,690
the
accidents and disasters and Misfortune

1306
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:58,700
accidents and disasters and Misfortune
 

1307
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,850
accidents and disasters and Misfortune
describe a distribution that tells you

1308
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:01,860
describe a distribution that tells you
 

1309
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,190
describe a distribution that tells you
what's really likely to get you in the

1310
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:04,200
what's really likely to get you in the
 

1311
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,230
what's really likely to get you in the
end and so

1312
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
end and so
 

1313
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,669

um personally

take great risks because you have a
 

1321
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,990
take great risks because you have a
really good sense of how they're going

1322
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,000
really good sense of how they're going
 

1323
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,730
really good sense of how they're going
to go wrong but I would also point out

1324
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:16,740
to go wrong but I would also point out
 

1325
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,950
to go wrong but I would also point out
civilization has this problem

1331
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,470

they're not existential scale yet right

1332
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:27,480
they're not existential scale yet right
 

1333
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,450
they're not existential scale yet right
they're very serious errors that we can

they're very serious errors that we can
 

1335
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,370
they're very serious errors that we can
see and I would argue that the pattern

1336
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:31,380
see and I would argue that the pattern
 

1337
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,769
see and I would argue that the pattern
is you discover that we are involved in

1338
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:33,779
is you discover that we are involved in
 

1339
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,870
is you discover that we are involved in
some industrial process at the point it

some industrial process at the point it
 

1341
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,990
some industrial process at the point it
has gone wrong right so I'm now always

1342
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,000
has gone wrong right so I'm now always
 

1343
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,610
has gone wrong right so I'm now always
asking the question

well this is sort of my point about the

well this is sort of my point about the
close calls is that there's a there's a

close calls is that there's a there's a

the triple meltdown at Fukushima was

1440
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:33,779
the triple meltdown at Fukushima was
 

1441
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,230
the triple meltdown at Fukushima was
awful but every one of the seven fuel

1442
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,240
awful but every one of the seven fuel
 

1443
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,510
awful but every one of the seven fuel
pools held there wasn't a major fire

1444
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:38,520
pools held there wasn't a major fire
 

1445
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,310
pools held there wasn't a major fire
that made it impossible to manage the

1446
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
that made it impossible to manage the
 

1447
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,549
that made it impossible to manage the
disaster going forward we got lucky

1448
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:43,559
disaster going forward we got lucky
 

1449
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,470
disaster going forward we got lucky
um you know we could say the same thing

1450
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:45,480
um you know we could say the same thing
 

1451
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,289
um you know we could say the same thing
about the uh the blowout at the

1452
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:48,299
about the uh the blowout at the
 

1453
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,350
about the uh the blowout at the
Deepwater Horizon where a hole in the

1454
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:51,360
Deepwater Horizon where a hole in the
 

1455
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,789
Deepwater Horizon where a hole in the
ocean floor large enough that we

1456
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
ocean floor large enough that we
 

1457
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,870
ocean floor large enough that we
couldn't have plugged it could have

1458
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:53,880
couldn't have plugged it could have
 

1459
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,789
couldn't have plugged it could have
opened up all of these things could have

1460
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:55,799
opened up all of these things could have
 

1461
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,889
opened up all of these things could have
been much much worse right and I think

1462
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:57,899
been much much worse right and I think
 

1463
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:59,389
been much much worse right and I think
we can say the same thing about covet as

1464
00:28:59,389 --> 00:28:59,399
we can say the same thing about covet as
 

1465
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:00,769
we can say the same thing about covet as
terrible as it is

1466
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:00,779
terrible as it is
 

1467
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,110
terrible as it is
and I you know we cannot say for sure

1468
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,120
and I you know we cannot say for sure
 

1469
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,029
and I you know we cannot say for sure
that it came from the Wuhan lab but

1470
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
that it came from the Wuhan lab but
 

1471
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,610
that it came from the Wuhan lab but
there's a strong likelihood that it did

1472
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:06,620
there's a strong likelihood that it did
 

1473
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,730
there's a strong likelihood that it did
and it also could be much much worse so

1474
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:10,740
and it also could be much much worse so
 

1475
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,889
and it also could be much much worse so
in each of these cases something is

1476
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:12,899
in each of these cases something is
 

1477
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:15,470
in each of these cases something is
telling us we have a process that is

1478
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,480
telling us we have a process that is
 

1479
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,870
telling us we have a process that is
unfolding that keeps creating risks

1480
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:17,880
unfolding that keeps creating risks
 

1481
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,190
unfolding that keeps creating risks
where it is luck that is the difference

1482
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
where it is luck that is the difference
 

1483
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,110
where it is luck that is the difference
between us and some scale of disaster

1484
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
between us and some scale of disaster
 

1485
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,490
between us and some scale of disaster
that is unimaginable and that wisdom you

1486
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:25,500
that is unimaginable and that wisdom you
 

1487
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,990
that is unimaginable and that wisdom you
know you can be highly intelligent and

1488
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,000
know you can be highly intelligent and
 

1489
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,789
know you can be highly intelligent and
cause these disasters

1490
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
cause these disasters
 

1491
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,789
cause these disasters
to be wise is to stop causing them right

1492
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:31,799
to be wise is to stop causing them right
 

1493
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,850
to be wise is to stop causing them right
and that would require a process of

1494
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:34,860
and that would require a process of
 

1495
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,409
and that would require a process of
restraint

1496
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:36,419
restraint
 

1497
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,149
restraint
a process that I don't see a lot of

1498
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:38,159
a process that I don't see a lot of
 

1499
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,250
a process that I don't see a lot of
evidence of yet so

1500
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:40,260
evidence of yet so
 

1501
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,470
evidence of yet so
I think we have to generate it and

1502
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,480
I think we have to generate it and
 

1503
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,149
I think we have to generate it and
somehow

1504
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159
somehow
 

1505
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,070
somehow
we you know at the moment we don't have

1506
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,080
we you know at the moment we don't have
 

1507
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,350
we you know at the moment we don't have
a political structure that would be

1508
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,360
a political structure that would be
 

1509
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,510
a political structure that would be
capable of

1510
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:50,520
capable of
 

1511
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,350
capable of
taking a protective algorithm and

1512
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,360
taking a protective algorithm and
 

1513
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,090
taking a protective algorithm and
actually deploying it right because it

1514
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,100
actually deploying it right because it
 

1515
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,169
actually deploying it right because it
would have important Economic

1516
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:57,179
would have important Economic
 

1517
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,549
would have important Economic
Consequences and so it would almost

1518
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
Consequences and so it would almost
 

1519
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,289
Consequences and so it would almost
certainly be shot down

1520
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:00,299
certainly be shot down
 

1521
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,870
certainly be shot down
but we can obviously also say you know

1522
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:02,880
but we can obviously also say you know
 

1523
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,350
but we can obviously also say you know
we paid a huge price for all of the

1524
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,360
we paid a huge price for all of the
 

1525
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,130
we paid a huge price for all of the
disasters that I've mentioned and we

1526
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,140
disasters that I've mentioned and we
 

1527
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,630
disasters that I've mentioned and we
have to factor that into the equation

1528
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:11,640
have to factor that into the equation
 

1529
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,549
have to factor that into the equation
something can be very productive short

1530
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:13,559
something can be very productive short
 

1531
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,570
something can be very productive short
term and very destructive long term and

1532
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:16,580
term and very destructive long term and
 

1533
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,730
term and very destructive long term and
also the question is how many disasters

1534
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:19,740
also the question is how many disasters
 

1535
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,210
also the question is how many disasters
we avoided because of the Ingenuity of

1536
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,220
we avoided because of the Ingenuity of
 

1537
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,669
we avoided because of the Ingenuity of
humans or just the integrity and

1538
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
humans or just the integrity and
 

1539
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,950
humans or just the integrity and
character of humans

1540
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:27,960
character of humans
 

1541
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,950
character of humans
that's sort of an open question we may

1542
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
that's sort of an open question we may
 

1543
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,250
that's sort of an open question we may
be more

1544
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:33,260
be more
 

1545
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,590
be more
intelligent than lucky that's the Hope

1546
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:36,600
intelligent than lucky that's the Hope
 

1547
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,110
intelligent than lucky that's the Hope
because the optimistic message here that

1548
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
because the optimistic message here that
 

1549
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,090
because the optimistic message here that
you're getting at is

1550
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,100
you're getting at is
 

1551
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,870
you're getting at is
maybe the process that we should be

1552
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
maybe the process that we should be
 

1553
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,450
maybe the process that we should be
that maybe we can overcome luck with

1554
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:47,460
that maybe we can overcome luck with
 

1555
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,029
that maybe we can overcome luck with
Ingenuity meaning

1556
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:50,039
Ingenuity meaning
 

1557
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,950
Ingenuity meaning
I guess you're suggesting the process is

1558
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:51,960
I guess you're suggesting the process is
 

1559
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,990
I guess you're suggesting the process is
we should be listing all the ways that

1560
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,000
we should be listing all the ways that
 

1561
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,130
we should be listing all the ways that
human civilization can destroy itself

1562
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:57,140
human civilization can destroy itself
 

1563
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,810
human civilization can destroy itself
assigning likelihood to it

1564
00:30:59,810 --> 00:30:59,820
assigning likelihood to it
 

1565
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,389
assigning likelihood to it
and thinking through how can we avoid

1566
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:02,399
and thinking through how can we avoid
 

1567
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,169
and thinking through how can we avoid
that

1568
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:03,179
that
 

1569
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:06,289
that
and being very honest that with the data

1570
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:06,299
and being very honest that with the data
 

1571
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,870
and being very honest that with the data
out there about the close calls and

1572
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:08,880
out there about the close calls and
 

1573
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,470
out there about the close calls and
using those close calls to uh to then

1574
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,480
using those close calls to uh to then
 

1575
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,750
using those close calls to uh to then
create sort of mechanism by which we

1576
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:14,760
create sort of mechanism by which we
 

1577
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,789
create sort of mechanism by which we
minimize the probability of those close

1578
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:16,799
minimize the probability of those close
 

1579
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,610
minimize the probability of those close
calls and just being honest and

1580
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:19,620
calls and just being honest and
 

1581
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,430
calls and just being honest and
transparent uh with the data that's out

1582
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:22,440
transparent uh with the data that's out
 

1583
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,590
transparent uh with the data that's out
there well I think we need to do a

1584
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:24,600
there well I think we need to do a
 

1585
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,409
there well I think we need to do a
couple things for it to work

1586
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:27,419
couple things for it to work
 

1587
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,169
couple things for it to work
um so I've been an advocate for the idea

1588
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:30,179
um so I've been an advocate for the idea
 

1589
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,389
um so I've been an advocate for the idea
that sustainability is actually it's

1590
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
that sustainability is actually it's
 

1591
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,250
that sustainability is actually it's
difficult to operationalize but it is an

1592
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,260
difficult to operationalize but it is an
 

1593
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,289
difficult to operationalize but it is an
objective that we have to meet if we're

1594
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:36,299
objective that we have to meet if we're
 

1595
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,409
objective that we have to meet if we're
to be around long term and I realize

1596
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:39,419
to be around long term and I realize
 

1597
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,389
to be around long term and I realize
that we also need to have reversibility

1598
00:31:41,389 --> 00:31:41,399
that we also need to have reversibility
 

1599
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,049
that we also need to have reversibility
of all of our processes because

1600
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:44,059
of all of our processes because
 

1601
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:46,070
of all of our processes because
processes very frequently when they

1602
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
processes very frequently when they
 

1603
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,590
processes very frequently when they
start do not appear dangerous and then

1604
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:48,600
start do not appear dangerous and then
 

1605
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,990
start do not appear dangerous and then
they when they scale they become very

1606
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,000
they when they scale they become very
 

1607
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,110
they when they scale they become very
dangerous so for example if you imagine

1608
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,120
dangerous so for example if you imagine
 

1609
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,169
dangerous so for example if you imagine
and the first internal combustion engine

1610
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:57,179
and the first internal combustion engine
 

1611
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,990
and the first internal combustion engine
in a vehicle driving down the street and

1612
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,000
in a vehicle driving down the street and
 

1613
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,549
in a vehicle driving down the street and
you imagine somebody running after them

1614
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:01,559
you imagine somebody running after them
 

1615
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,990
you imagine somebody running after them
saying hey if you do enough of that

1616
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,000
saying hey if you do enough of that
 

1617
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,490
saying hey if you do enough of that
you're going to alter the atmosphere and

1618
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:04,500
you're going to alter the atmosphere and
 

1619
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,630
you're going to alter the atmosphere and
it's going to change the temperature of

1620
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:05,640
it's going to change the temperature of
 

1621
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,730
it's going to change the temperature of
the planet it's Preposterous right why

1622
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:07,740
the planet it's Preposterous right why
 

1623
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,230
the planet it's Preposterous right why
would you stop the person who's invented

1624
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:09,240
would you stop the person who's invented
 

1625
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,330
would you stop the person who's invented
this marvelous new Contraption but of

1626
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:11,340
this marvelous new Contraption but of
 

1627
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,009
this marvelous new Contraption but of
course eventually you do get to the

1628
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:13,019
course eventually you do get to the
 

1629
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:14,330
course eventually you do get to the
place where you're doing enough of this

1630
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:14,340
place where you're doing enough of this
 

1631
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,250
place where you're doing enough of this
that you do start changing the

1632
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,260
that you do start changing the
 

1633
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,049
that you do start changing the
temperature of the planet so

1634
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:18,059
temperature of the planet so
 

1635
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:21,110
temperature of the planet so
if we built the capacity if we basically

1636
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,120
if we built the capacity if we basically
 

1637
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,669
if we built the capacity if we basically
said look you can't

1638
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:22,679
said look you can't
 

1639
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,310
said look you can't
involve yourself in any process that you

1640
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,320
involve yourself in any process that you
 

1641
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,549
involve yourself in any process that you
couldn't reverse if you had to then

1642
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:28,559
couldn't reverse if you had to then
 

1643
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,070
couldn't reverse if you had to then
progress would be slowed but our safety

1644
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,080
progress would be slowed but our safety
 

1645
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,389
progress would be slowed but our safety
would go up dramatically and I think

1646
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:35,399
would go up dramatically and I think
 

1647
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,490
would go up dramatically and I think
I think in some sense if we are to be

1648
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:37,500
I think in some sense if we are to be
 

1649
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,950
I think in some sense if we are to be
around long term we have to begin

1650
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
around long term we have to begin
 

1651
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,269
around long term we have to begin
thinking that way we're just involved in

1652
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
thinking that way we're just involved in
 

1653
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,730
thinking that way we're just involved in
too many very dangerous processes

1654
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:43,740
too many very dangerous processes
 

1655
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,850
too many very dangerous processes
so let's talk about one of the things

1656
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:46,860
so let's talk about one of the things
 

1657
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,610
so let's talk about one of the things
that if not threatened human

1658
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:49,620
that if not threatened human
 

1659
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,389
that if not threatened human
civilization certainly hurt it at a deep

1660
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:53,399
civilization certainly hurt it at a deep
 

1661
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,509
civilization certainly hurt it at a deep
level which is covet 19.

1662
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:56,519
level which is covet 19.
 

1663
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,549
level which is covet 19.
what percent probability would you

on the hypothesis that covid-19 leaked
 

1669
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,169
on the hypothesis that covid-19 leaked

from the Wuhan Institute of virology
 

1671
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:09,230
from the Wuhan Institute of virology
so I maintain a flow chart of all the

1672
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:09,240
so I maintain a flow chart of all the
 

1673
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,289
so I maintain a flow chart of all the
possible explanations and it doesn't

possible explanations and it doesn't
 

1675
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,169
possible explanations and it doesn't
break down exactly that way

1676
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:15,179
break down exactly that way
 

1677
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,330
break down exactly that way

right it's a placeholder for whatever
 

1757
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:54,829
right it's a placeholder for whatever
may actually have happened and so it

1758
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:54,839
may actually have happened and so it
 

1759
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,869
may actually have happened and so it
doesn't have to have been an attack on

doesn't have to have been an attack on

China that's certainly one possibility
 

1763
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,550
China that's certainly one possibility
but I would point out

1764
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:01,560
but I would point out
 

1765
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,250
but I would point out
if you can predict the future

1766

fascinating possibilities one question I
 

1879
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,950
fascinating possibilities one question I
want to ask is um what would evidence

1880
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:18,960
want to ask is um what would evidence
 

1881
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,849
want to ask is um what would evidence
for natural Origins look like so

1882
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:21,859
for natural Origins look like so
 

1883
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:24,530
for natural Origins look like so
one piece of evidence for natural

1884
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:24,540
one piece of evidence for natural
 

1885
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,190
one piece of evidence for natural
Origins is um that it has happened in

1886
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,200
Origins is um that it has happened in
 

1887
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,930
Origins is um that it has happened in
the past

1888
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:29,940
the past
 

1889
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,250
the past
that

1890
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,260
that
 

1891
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,310
that
that viruses have jumped oh they do jump

1892
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,320
that viruses have jumped oh they do jump
 

1893
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,010
that viruses have jumped oh they do jump
they so like that's one like that's

1894
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,020
they so like that's one like that's
 

1895
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,190
they so like that's one like that's
possible to have happened you know so

1896
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,200
possible to have happened you know so
 

1897
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,870
possible to have happened you know so
that that's a sort of like a historical

1898
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:41,880
that that's a sort of like a historical
 

1899
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,329
that that's a sort of like a historical
evidence like okay well it's possible

1900
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:44,339
evidence like okay well it's possible
 

1901
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:47,030
evidence like okay well it's possible
that it hap it's not it's not evidence

1902
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
that it hap it's not it's not evidence
 

1903
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,010
that it hap it's not it's not evidence
of the kind you think it is it's a

00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,020
of the kind you think it is it's a
 

1905

justification for a presumption right
 

1907
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,750
justification for a presumption right
right so the presumption upon

1908
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
right so the presumption upon
 

1909
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,490
right so the presumption upon
discovering a new virus circulating is

1910
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:55,500
discovering a new virus circulating is
 

1911
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,310
discovering a new virus circulating is
certainly that it came from nature right

1912
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:57,320
certainly that it came from nature right
 

1913
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,990
certainly that it came from nature right
the problem is the presumption

1914
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,000
the problem is the presumption
 

1915
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,450
the problem is the presumption
evaporates in the face of evidence or at

1916
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:02,460
evaporates in the face of evidence or at
 

1917
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,970
evaporates in the face of evidence or at
least it logically should and it didn't

1918
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:04,980
least it logically should and it didn't
 

1919
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,370
least it logically should and it didn't
in this case it was maintained by people

1920
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:07,380
in this case it was maintained by people
 

1921
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,050
in this case it was maintained by people
who privately in their emails

1922
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,060
who privately in their emails
 

1923
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,930
who privately in their emails
acknowledge that they had grave doubts

1924
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:11,940
acknowledge that they had grave doubts
 

1925
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,730
acknowledge that they had grave doubts
about the natural origin of of this

1926
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:13,740
about the natural origin of of this
 

1927
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,190
about the natural origin of of this
virus is there some other piece of

1928
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,200
virus is there some other piece of
 

1929
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,150
virus is there some other piece of
evidence that we could look for and see

1930
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
evidence that we could look for and see
 

1931
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,790
evidence that we could look for and see
that would say this increases the

1932
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
that would say this increases the
 

1933
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,470
that would say this increases the
probability that it's natural Origins

1934
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,480
probability that it's natural Origins
 

1935
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,650
probability that it's natural Origins
yeah in fact there is evidence you know

1936
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:27,660
yeah in fact there is evidence you know
 

1937
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,589
yeah in fact there is evidence you know
I always worry that somebody is going to

1938
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:30,599
I always worry that somebody is going to
 

1939
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,530
I always worry that somebody is going to
make up some evidence in order to

1940
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:33,540
make up some evidence in order to
 

1941
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,589
make up some evidence in order to
reverse the flow well let's say I am

1942
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:36,599
reverse the flow well let's say I am
 

1943
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,790
reverse the flow well let's say I am
it's a lot of incentive for that

1944
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:37,800
it's a lot of incentive for that
 

1945
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,170
it's a lot of incentive for that
actually there's a huge amount of

1946
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,180
actually there's a huge amount of
 

1947
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,930
actually there's a huge amount of
incentive on the other hand why

1948
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:41,940
incentive on the other hand why
 

1949
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,910
incentive on the other hand why
didn't the powers that be the powers

1950
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:43,920
didn't the powers that be the powers
 

1951
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,589
didn't the powers that be the powers
that lied to us about weapons of mass

1952
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
that lied to us about weapons of mass
 

1953
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,210
that lied to us about weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq why didn't they ever

1954
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:47,220
destruction in Iraq why didn't they ever
 

1955
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,890
destruction in Iraq why didn't they ever
fake weapons of mass destruction

1956
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:48,900
fake weapons of mass destruction
 

1957
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,589
fake weapons of mass destruction
interact whatever force it is I hope

1958
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:51,599
interact whatever force it is I hope
 

1959
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,329
interact whatever force it is I hope
that force is here too and so whatever

1960
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:53,339
that force is here too and so whatever
 

1961
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,670
that force is here too and so whatever
evidence we find is real it's the

1962
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:55,680
evidence we find is real it's the
 

1963
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,050
evidence we find is real it's the
confidence thing I'm talking about but

1964
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,060
confidence thing I'm talking about but
 

1965
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,870
confidence thing I'm talking about but
okay go ahead sorry well we can get back

1966
00:38:59,870 --> 00:38:59,880
okay go ahead sorry well we can get back
 

1967
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,990
okay go ahead sorry well we can get back
to that but I would say yeah the the the

1968
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,000
to that but I would say yeah the the the
 

1969
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,609
to that but I would say yeah the the the
giant piece of evidence that will shift

1970
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:04,619
giant piece of evidence that will shift
 

1971
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,530
giant piece of evidence that will shift
the probabilities in the other direction

1972
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:06,540
the probabilities in the other direction
 

1973
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,650
the probabilities in the other direction
is the discovery of either a human

1974
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:09,660
is the discovery of either a human
 

1975
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,050
is the discovery of either a human
population in which the virus circulated

1976
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,060
population in which the virus circulated
 

1977
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,750
population in which the virus circulated
prior to showing up in Wuhan that would

1978
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:14,760
prior to showing up in Wuhan that would
 

1979
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,609
prior to showing up in Wuhan that would
explain where the virus learned all of

1980
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:16,619
explain where the virus learned all of
 

1981
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:18,710
explain where the virus learned all of
the tricks that it knew instantly upon

1982
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:18,720
the tricks that it knew instantly upon
 

1983
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,890
the tricks that it knew instantly upon
spreading from Wuhan so that would do it

1984
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:21,900
spreading from Wuhan so that would do it
 

1985
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,950
spreading from Wuhan so that would do it
or an animal population in which an

1986
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:24,960
or an animal population in which an
 

1987
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,370
or an animal population in which an
ancestor epidemic can be found in which

1988
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:28,380
ancestor epidemic can be found in which
 

1989
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,410
ancestor epidemic can be found in which
the virus learned this before jumping to

1990
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:30,420
the virus learned this before jumping to
 

1991
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,210
the virus learned this before jumping to
humans but I point out in that second

1992
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:32,220
humans but I point out in that second
 

1993
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,349
humans but I point out in that second
case

1994
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:33,359
case
 

1995
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,510
case
you would certainly expect to see a

1996
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:35,520
you would certainly expect to see a
 

1997
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,430
you would certainly expect to see a
great deal of evolution in the early

1998
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
great deal of evolution in the early
 

1999
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,150
great deal of evolution in the early
epidemic which we don't see so there

2000
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,160
epidemic which we don't see so there
 

2001
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,589
epidemic which we don't see so there
almost has to be a human population

2002
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:42,599
almost has to be a human population
 

2003
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,630
almost has to be a human population
somewhere else that had the virus

2004
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:44,640
somewhere else that had the virus
 

2005
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,970
somewhere else that had the virus
circulating or an ancestor of the virus

2006
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:46,980
circulating or an ancestor of the virus
 

2007
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,650
circulating or an ancestor of the virus
that we first saw in Wuhan circulating

2008
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:48,660
that we first saw in Wuhan circulating
 

2009
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,270
that we first saw in Wuhan circulating
and it has to have gotten very

2010
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:50,280
and it has to have gotten very
 

2011
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,550
and it has to have gotten very
sophisticated in that prior epidemic

2012
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
sophisticated in that prior epidemic
 

2013
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,829
sophisticated in that prior epidemic
before hitting Wuhan in order to explain

2014
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:54,839
before hitting Wuhan in order to explain
 

2015
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,990
before hitting Wuhan in order to explain
the total lack of evolution and

2016
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:57,000
the total lack of evolution and
 

2017
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,569
the total lack of evolution and
extremely effective virus that emerged

2018
00:39:59,569 --> 00:39:59,579
extremely effective virus that emerged
 

2019
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,390
extremely effective virus that emerged
at the end of 2019 so you don't believe

2020
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
at the end of 2019 so you don't believe
 

2021
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,430
at the end of 2019 so you don't believe
in the magic of evolution to spring up

2022
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:04,440
in the magic of evolution to spring up
 

2023
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,990
in the magic of evolution to spring up
with all the tricks already there like

2024
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,000
with all the tricks already there like
 

2025
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,550
with all the tricks already there like
everybody who doesn't have the tricks

2026
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:07,560
everybody who doesn't have the tricks
 

2027
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,490
everybody who doesn't have the tricks
they die quickly and then you just have

2028
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:10,500
they die quickly and then you just have
 

2029
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,589
they die quickly and then you just have
this beautiful virus that comes in with

2030
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:12,599
this beautiful virus that comes in with
 

2031
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,870
this beautiful virus that comes in with
a spike protein and the and the through

2032
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:14,880
a spike protein and the and the through
 

2033
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,089
a spike protein and the and the through
mutation and selection just do like the

2034
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:20,099
mutation and selection just do like the
 

2035
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:21,770
mutation and selection just do like the
ones that succeed

2036
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:21,780
ones that succeed
 

2037
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,530
ones that succeed
and succeed big are the ones that are

2038
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:24,540
and succeed big are the ones that are
 

2039
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,210
and succeed big are the ones that are
going to just spring into life with the

2040
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:26,220
going to just spring into life with the
 

2041
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,609
going to just spring into life with the
tricks well no

2042
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:28,619
tricks well no
 

2043
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,349
tricks well no
that's that's called a hopeful monster

2044
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:30,359
that's that's called a hopeful monster
 

2045
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,230
that's that's called a hopeful monster
and hopeful monsters don't work it's to

2046
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:33,240
and hopeful monsters don't work it's to
 

2047
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,530
and hopeful monsters don't work it's to
the job of becoming a new pandemic virus

2048
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:36,540
the job of becoming a new pandemic virus
 

2049
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,690
the job of becoming a new pandemic virus
is too difficult it involves two very

2050
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:38,700
is too difficult it involves two very
 

2051
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,190
is too difficult it involves two very
difficult steps and they both have to

2052
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,200
difficult steps and they both have to
 

2053
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,349
difficult steps and they both have to
work one is the ability to infect a

2054
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:42,359
work one is the ability to infect a
 

2055
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,230
work one is the ability to infect a
person and spread in their tissues uh

2056
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,240
person and spread in their tissues uh
 

2057
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,150
person and spread in their tissues uh
sufficient to make an infection and the

2058
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,160
sufficient to make an infection and the
 

2059
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,430
sufficient to make an infection and the
other is to jump between individuals at

2060
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440
other is to jump between individuals at
 

2061
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,990
other is to jump between individuals at
a sufficient rate that it doesn't go

2062
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,000
a sufficient rate that it doesn't go
 

2063
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,150
a sufficient rate that it doesn't go
extinct for one reason or another

2064
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,160
extinct for one reason or another
 

2065
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,490
extinct for one reason or another
those are both very difficult jobs they

2066
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:55,500
those are both very difficult jobs they
 

2067
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,309
those are both very difficult jobs they
require as you describe selection and

2068
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:58,319
require as you describe selection and
 

2069
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,530
require as you describe selection and
the point is selection would leave a

2070
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:00,540
the point is selection would leave a
 

2071
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,450
the point is selection would leave a
mark we would see evidence that in

2072
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:02,460
mark we would see evidence that in
 

2073
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,349
mark we would see evidence that in
animals or humans both right and we see

2074
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:06,359
animals or humans both right and we see
 

2075
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,750
animals or humans both right and we see
this evolutionary choice of uh of the

2076
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:08,760
this evolutionary choice of uh of the
 

2077
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,150
this evolutionary choice of uh of the
virus Gathering the tricks up yeah you

2078
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,160
virus Gathering the tricks up yeah you
 

2079
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,770
virus Gathering the tricks up yeah you
would see the virus you would see the

2080
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:12,780
would see the virus you would see the
 

2081
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,390
would see the virus you would see the
clumsy virus get better and better and

2082
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
clumsy virus get better and better and
 

2083
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,490
clumsy virus get better and better and
yes I am a full believer in the power of

2084
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:16,500
yes I am a full believer in the power of
 

2085
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,130
yes I am a full believer in the power of
that process in fact I believe it uh

2086
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,140
that process in fact I believe it uh
 

2087
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,670
that process in fact I believe it uh
what I know from studying the process is

2088
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:22,680
what I know from studying the process is
 

2089
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,589
what I know from studying the process is
that it is much more powerful than most

2090
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:24,599
that it is much more powerful than most
 

2091
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,109
that it is much more powerful than most
people imagine that what we teach in the

people imagine that what we teach in the
 

2093
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,109
people imagine that what we teach in the
evolution 101 textbook is too clumsy a

2094
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:30,119
evolution 101 textbook is too clumsy a
 

2095
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,329
evolution 101 textbook is too clumsy a
process to do what we see it doing and

2096
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:32,339
process to do what we see it doing and
 

2097
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:33,770
process to do what we see it doing and
that actually people should increase

2098
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:33,780
that actually people should increase

2107
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,770
that said we just don't see evidence
that it happened here which doesn't mean

2108
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:45,780
that it happened here which doesn't mean
 

2109
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,870
that it happened here which doesn't mean
it doesn't exist but it means

2110
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:47,880
it doesn't exist but it means
 

2111
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,970
it doesn't exist but it means
in spite of immense pressure to find it

2112
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:49,980
in spite of immense pressure to find it
 

2113

00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:52,380
somewhere there's been no hint which
 

2115
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,710
somewhere there's been no hint which
probably means it took place inside of a

probably means it took place inside of a
 

2117
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,609
probably means it took place inside of a
laboratory so inside the laboratory gain

2118
00:41:58,609 --> 00:41:58,619
laboratory so inside the laboratory gain

00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:04,440
and I believe most of that kind of
 

2123
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,349
and I believe most of that kind of
research is doing this exact thing that

it does so for example the fern cleavage
 

2175
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,390
it does so for example the fern cleavage
site looks very much like it was added

2176
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:14,400
site looks very much like it was added
 

2177
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,550
site looks very much like it was added
in to the virus and it was known that

2178
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,560
in to the virus and it was known that
 

2179
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,190
in to the virus and it was known that
that would increase its infectivity in

2180
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
that would increase its infectivity in
 

2181
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,089
that would increase its infectivity in
humans and increase its tropism

2182

ferrets now minks and ferrets are very

2190
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:33,960
ferrets now minks and ferrets are very
 

2191
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,210
ferrets now minks and ferrets are very
closely related to each other and

00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:35,220
closely related to each other and
 

2193
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,950
closely related to each other and
ferrets are very likely to have been

00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:36,960
ferrets are very likely to have been
 

2195
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,410
ferrets are very likely to have been
used in a Serial passage experiment the

2196
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:39,420
used in a Serial passage experiment the
 

2197
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,510
used in a Serial passage experiment the
reason being that they have an ace2

2198
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
reason being that they have an ace2
 

2199
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,190
reason being that they have an ace2
receptor that looks very much like the

2200
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200
receptor that looks very much like the
 

2201
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,950
receptor that looks very much like the
human acet receptor and so were you

2202
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:45,960
human acet receptor and so were you
 

2203
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,809
human acet receptor and so were you
going to passage the virus or it's

2204
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:47,819
going to passage the virus or it's
 

2205
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:50,450
going to passage the virus or it's
ancestor through an animal in order to

2206
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:50,460
ancestor through an animal in order to
 

2207
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,430
ancestor through an animal in order to
increase its infectivity in humans which

2208
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:52,440
increase its infectivity in humans which
 

2209
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,109
increase its infectivity in humans which
would have been necessary

2210
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:54,119
would have been necessary
 

2211
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:55,910
would have been necessary
uh ferrets would have been very likely

2212
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
uh ferrets would have been very likely
 

2213
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,370
uh ferrets would have been very likely
it is also quite likely that humanized

2214
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:58,380
it is also quite likely that humanized
 

2215
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,569
it is also quite likely that humanized
mice were utilized and it is possible

2216
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:02,579
mice were utilized and it is possible
 

2217
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:05,870
mice were utilized and it is possible
that human Airway tissue was utilized I

2218
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:05,880
that human Airway tissue was utilized I
 

2219
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,270
that human Airway tissue was utilized I
think it is vital that we find out what

2220
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:08,280
think it is vital that we find out what
 

2221
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,890
think it is vital that we find out what
the protocols were if this came from the

00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:09,900
the protocols were if this came from the
 

2223
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,290
the protocols were if this came from the
Wuhan Institute we need to know it and

2224
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:12,300
Wuhan Institute we need to know it and
 

2225
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,910
Wuhan Institute we need to know it and
we need to know what the protocols were

2226
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:13,920
we need to know what the protocols were
 

2227
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,430
we need to know what the protocols were
exactly because they will actually give

2228
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:16,440
exactly because they will actually give
 

2229
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,770
exactly because they will actually give
us some tools that would be useful in

2230
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:18,780
us some tools that would be useful in
 

2231
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,589
us some tools that would be useful in
fighting as far as Kobe 2 and hopefully

2232
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
fighting as far as Kobe 2 and hopefully
 

2233
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,150
fighting as far as Kobe 2 and hopefully
driving into Extinction which ought to

2234
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:23,160
driving into Extinction which ought to
 

2235
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,790
driving into Extinction which ought to
be our priority it is a priority that

2236
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:25,800
be our priority it is a priority that
 

2237
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,410
be our priority it is a priority that
does not it is not Apparent from our

2238
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:27,420
does not it is not Apparent from our
 

2239
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,710
does not it is not Apparent from our
Behavior but it really is uh it should

2240
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:30,720
Behavior but it really is uh it should
 

2241
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,390
Behavior but it really is uh it should
be our objective if we understood where

2242
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
be our objective if we understood where
 

2243
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,609
be our objective if we understood where
our interests lie we would be much more

2244
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:34,619
our interests lie we would be much more
 

2245
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:38,150
our interests lie we would be much more
focused on it but those protocols would

2246
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
focused on it but those protocols would
 

2247
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,010
focused on it but those protocols would
tell us a great deal if it wasn't the

2248
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,020
tell us a great deal if it wasn't the
 

2249
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,349
tell us a great deal if it wasn't the
Wuhan Institute we need to know that if

2250
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:42,359
Wuhan Institute we need to know that if
 

2251
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,569
Wuhan Institute we need to know that if
it was nature we need to know that and

2252
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:44,579
it was nature we need to know that and
 

2253
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,190
it was nature we need to know that and
if it was some other laboratory we need

2254
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:46,200
if it was some other laboratory we need
 

2255
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,890
if it was some other laboratory we need
to figure out who what and where so that

2256
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:48,900
to figure out who what and where so that
 

2257
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,990
to figure out who what and where so that
we can determine what is what we can

2258
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:51,000
we can determine what is what we can
 

2259
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,609
we can determine what is what we can
determine about about what was done

2260
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:52,619
determine about about what was done
 

2261
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:55,490
determine about about what was done
you're opening up my mind about why we

2262
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:55,500
you're opening up my mind about why we
 

2263
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,410
you're opening up my mind about why we
should

2264
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:56,420
should
 

2265
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,730
should
investigate why we should know the truth

2266
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:58,740
investigate why we should know the truth
 

2267
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,329
investigate why we should know the truth
of the origins of this virus so for me

2268
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:02,339
of the origins of this virus so for me
 

2269
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,730
of the origins of this virus so for me
personally let me just tell the story of

2270
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:04,740
personally let me just tell the story of
 

2271
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,849
personally let me just tell the story of
my own kind of Journey

2272
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:06,859
my own kind of Journey
 

2273
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:09,829
my own kind of Journey
when I first started looking into the

2274
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:09,839
when I first started looking into the
 

2275
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,710
when I first started looking into the
lab leak hypothesis

2276
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,720
lab leak hypothesis
 

2277
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,410
lab leak hypothesis
what became terrifying to me and

2278
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:15,420
what became terrifying to me and
 

2279
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,950
what became terrifying to me and
important to under understand an obvious

2280
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
important to under understand an obvious
 

2281
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,650
important to under understand an obvious
is the sort of like Sam Harris way of

2282
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:21,660
is the sort of like Sam Harris way of
 

2283
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,569
is the sort of like Sam Harris way of
thinking which is

2284
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:23,579
thinking which is
 

2285
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:26,750
thinking which is
it's obvious that a lab leak of a deadly

2286
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:26,760
it's obvious that a lab leak of a deadly
 

2287
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,390
it's obvious that a lab leak of a deadly
virus will eventually happen

2288
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:29,400
virus will eventually happen
 

2289
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,109
virus will eventually happen
my mind was it doesn't even matter if it

2290
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:33,119
my mind was it doesn't even matter if it
 

2291
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,329
my mind was it doesn't even matter if it
happened in this case it's obvious

2292
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:35,339
happened in this case it's obvious
 

2293
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,970
happened in this case it's obvious
there's going to happen in the future so

2294
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:37,980
there's going to happen in the future so
 

2295
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,829
there's going to happen in the future so
why the hell are we not freaking out

2296
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:39,839
why the hell are we not freaking out
 

2297
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,290
why the hell are we not freaking out
about this and covid-19 is not even that

2298
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:42,300
about this and covid-19 is not even that
 

2299
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,910
about this and covid-19 is not even that
deadly relative to the possible future

2300
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:43,920
deadly relative to the possible future
 

2301
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,210
deadly relative to the possible future
viruses it's this the way I disagree

2302
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:47,220
viruses it's this the way I disagree
 

2303
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,530
viruses it's this the way I disagree
with Sam on this but he thinks about

2304
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:48,540
with Sam on this but he thinks about
 

2305
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,349
with Sam on this but he thinks about
this way about AGI as well I bought a

2306
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359
this way about AGI as well I bought a
 

2307
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,089
this way about AGI as well I bought a
artificial intelligence it's a different

2308
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:53,099
artificial intelligence it's a different
 

2309
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:55,309
artificial intelligence it's a different
discussion I think but with viruses it

2310
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:55,319
discussion I think but with viruses it
 

2311
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,510
discussion I think but with viruses it
seems like something that could happen

2312
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:56,520
seems like something that could happen
 

2313
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,809
seems like something that could happen
on a scale of years maybe a few decades

2314
00:45:59,809 --> 00:45:59,819
on a scale of years maybe a few decades
 

2315
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:02,210
on a scale of years maybe a few decades
AGI is a little bit farther out for me

2316
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:02,220
AGI is a little bit farther out for me
 

2317
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,430
AGI is a little bit farther out for me
but it seemed the terrifying thing it

2318
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:04,440
but it seemed the terrifying thing it
 

2319
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,250
but it seemed the terrifying thing it
seemed obvious that this will happen

2320
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:07,260
seemed obvious that this will happen
 

2321
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,309
seemed obvious that this will happen
very soon for a much deadlier virus as

2322
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,319
very soon for a much deadlier virus as
 

2323
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,230
very soon for a much deadlier virus as
we get better and better at both

2324
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,240
we get better and better at both
 

2325
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,750
we get better and better at both
engineering viruses and doing this kind

2326
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:14,760
engineering viruses and doing this kind

of evolutionary driven research gain

2328
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,040
of evolutionary driven research gain
 

2329
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,410
of evolutionary driven research gain
function research

2330
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:18,420
function research
 

2331
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,370
function research
okay but then you started speaking out

2332
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:22,380
okay but then you started speaking out
 

2333
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,589
okay but then you started speaking out
about this as well but also started to

2334
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:24,599
about this as well but also started to
 

2335
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:26,450
about this as well but also started to
say no no we should hurry up and figure

2336
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:26,460
say no no we should hurry up and figure
 

2337
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,790
say no no we should hurry up and figure
out the origins now because it will help

2338
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:28,800
out the origins now because it will help
 

2339
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,430
out the origins now because it will help
us figure out how to actually

2340
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
us figure out how to actually
 

2341
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,870
us figure out how to actually
respond uh to this particular virus how

2342
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:35,880
respond uh to this particular virus how
 

2343
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,150
respond uh to this particular virus how
to treat this particular virus what is

2344
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
to treat this particular virus what is
 

2345
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,650
to treat this particular virus what is
in terms of vaccines in terms of

in terms of vaccines in terms of
 

2347
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,069
in terms of vaccines in terms of

antiviral drugs in terms of just uh all
 

2349
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,069
antiviral drugs in terms of just uh all
the the the the number of responses we

2350
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:46,079
the the the the number of responses we
 

2351
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,349
the the the the number of responses we
should have okay

2352
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:48,359
should have okay
 

2353
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:49,609
should have okay
I

2354
00:46:49,609 --> 00:46:49,619
I
 

2355
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:52,069
I
still I'm much more freaking out about

2356
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:52,079
still I'm much more freaking out about
 

2357
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,809
still I'm much more freaking out about
the future

2358
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:53,819
the future
 

2359
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:55,970
the future
maybe you can

2360
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:55,980
maybe you can
 

2361
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,370
maybe you can
break that apart a little bit which are

2362
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:58,380
break that apart a little bit which are
 

2363
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,109
break that apart a little bit which are
you

2364
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
you
 

2365
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,550
you
most um

2366
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:01,560
most um
 

2367
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,829
most um
focused on now

2368
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:03,839
focused on now
 

2369
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,349
focused on now
which are you most freaking out about

2370
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:06,359
which are you most freaking out about
 

2371
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,089
which are you most freaking out about
now in terms of the importance of

2372
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:08,099
now in terms of the importance of
 

2373
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,490
now in terms of the importance of
figuring out the origins of this virus

2374
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:10,500
figuring out the origins of this virus
 

2375
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,890
figuring out the origins of this virus
I am most freaking out about both of

2376
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:12,900
I am most freaking out about both of
 

2377
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,809
I am most freaking out about both of
them because they're both really

2378
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:14,819
them because they're both really
 

2379
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:17,390
them because they're both really
important and you know we can put bounds

2380
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:17,400
important and you know we can put bounds
 

2381
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,550
important and you know we can put bounds
on this let me say first this is a

2382
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:19,560
on this let me say first this is a
 

2383
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,829
on this let me say first this is a
perfect test case for the theory of

2384
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:21,839
perfect test case for the theory of
 

2385
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,349
perfect test case for the theory of
close calls because as much as covet is

2386
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:24,359
close calls because as much as covet is
 

2387
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:26,990
close calls because as much as covet is
a disaster it is also a close call from

a disaster it is also a close call from
 

2389
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,089
a disaster it is also a close call from
which we can learn much you are

2390
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:29,099
which we can learn much you are
 

2391
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,650
which we can learn much you are
absolutely right if we keep playing this

2392
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:30,660
absolutely right if we keep playing this
 

2393
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,609
absolutely right if we keep playing this
game in the lab if we are not if we are

2394
00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:34,619
game in the lab if we are not if we are
 

2395
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,290
game in the lab if we are not if we are
especially if we do it under pressure

2396
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:36,300
especially if we do it under pressure
 

2397
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,089
especially if we do it under pressure
and when we are told that a virus is

2398
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:38,099
and when we are told that a virus is
 

2399
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,430
and when we are told that a virus is
going to LEAP from nature any day and

2400
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:40,440
going to LEAP from nature any day and
 

2401
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,870
going to LEAP from nature any day and
that the more we know the better we'll

2402
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:41,880
that the more we know the better we'll
 

2403
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,010
that the more we know the better we'll
be able to fight it we're going to

2404
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:43,020
be able to fight it we're going to
 

2405
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,430
be able to fight it we're going to
create the disaster all the sooner

2406
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:46,440
create the disaster all the sooner
 

2407
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,309
create the disaster all the sooner
so yes that should be an absolute Focus

2408
00:47:49,309 --> 00:47:49,319
so yes that should be an absolute Focus
 

2409
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:50,990
so yes that should be an absolute Focus
the fact that there were people saying

2410
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:51,000
the fact that there were people saying
 

2411
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,650
the fact that there were people saying
that this was dangerous back in 2015 uh

2412
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:54,660
that this was dangerous back in 2015 uh
 

2413
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,910
that this was dangerous back in 2015 uh
ought to tell us something the fact that

2414
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:55,920
ought to tell us something the fact that
 

2415
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,030
ought to tell us something the fact that
the system bypassed a ban and offshored

2416
00:47:59,030 --> 00:47:59,040
the system bypassed a ban and offshored
 

2417
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,349
the system bypassed a ban and offshored
the work to China

2418
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:00,359
the work to China
 

2419
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:01,609
the work to China
ought to tell us this is not a Chinese

2420
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:01,619
ought to tell us this is not a Chinese
 

2421
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,549
ought to tell us this is not a Chinese
failure this is a failure of something

2422
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:03,559
failure this is a failure of something
 

2423
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,130
failure this is a failure of something
larger and harder to see

2424
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:07,140
larger and harder to see
 

2425
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,329
larger and harder to see
um but

2426
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:08,339
um but
 

2427
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,549
um but
I also think that there's a there's a

2428
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:10,559
I also think that there's a there's a
 

2429
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,030
I also think that there's a there's a
clock ticking with respect to SARS cov2

2430
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:14,040
clock ticking with respect to SARS cov2
 

2431
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,790
clock ticking with respect to SARS cov2
and covid the disease that it creates

2432
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:16,800
and covid the disease that it creates
 

2433
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,410
and covid the disease that it creates
and that has to do with whether or not

2434
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:18,420
and that has to do with whether or not
 

2435
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,809
and that has to do with whether or not
we are stuck with it permanently

2436
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:20,819
we are stuck with it permanently
 

2437
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,490
we are stuck with it permanently
so if you think about the cost to

2438
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:22,500
so if you think about the cost to
 

2439
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,530
so if you think about the cost to
humanity of being stuck with influenza

2440
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:24,540
humanity of being stuck with influenza
 

2441
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,410
humanity of being stuck with influenza
it's an immense cost year after year and

2442
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:27,420
it's an immense cost year after year and
 

2443
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,670
it's an immense cost year after year and
we just stopped thinking about it

2444
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:28,680
we just stopped thinking about it
 

2445
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,190
we just stopped thinking about it
because it's there some years you get to

2446
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
because it's there some years you get to
 

2447
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,049
because it's there some years you get to
flu most years you don't maybe you get

2448
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:33,059
flu most years you don't maybe you get
 

2449
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:34,670
flu most years you don't maybe you get
the vaccine to prevent it maybe the

2450
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:34,680
the vaccine to prevent it maybe the
 

2451
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,609
the vaccine to prevent it maybe the
vaccine isn't particularly well targeted

2452
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:36,619
vaccine isn't particularly well targeted
 

2453
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:39,770
vaccine isn't particularly well targeted
but imagine just simply doubling that

2454
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:39,780
but imagine just simply doubling that
 

2455
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,970
but imagine just simply doubling that
cost

2456
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:40,980
cost
 

2457
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,390
cost
imagine we get stuck with SARS cov2 and

2458
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
imagine we get stuck with SARS cov2 and
 

2459
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,150
imagine we get stuck with SARS cov2 and
its descendants going forward and then

00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,670
its descendants going forward and then
it just settles in and becomes a fact of

it just settles in and becomes a fact of

modern human life that would be a

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,870
modern human life that would be a
disaster right the number of people we

disaster right the number of people we
 

2467

disaster right the number of people we
will ultimately lose is incalculable the

the ability to drive it extinct goes

up saying things about competing
therapies that work better and much more

2546
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:31,800
therapies that work better and much more
 

2547
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,309
therapies that work better and much more
safely than the ones you're selling that

2548
00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:34,319
safely than the ones you're selling that
 

2549
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,290

aren't true and do cause people to die

2550
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:36,300
aren't true and do cause people to die
 

2551
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,809
aren't true and do cause people to die
in large numbers

2552
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:38,819
in large numbers
 

2553
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:40,849
in large numbers
um but it you know it's some kind of

2554
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:40,859
um but it you know it's some kind of
 

2555
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:43,069
um but it you know it's some kind of
autopilot at least part of it is

2556
00:50:43,069 --> 00:50:43,079
autopilot at least part of it is
 

2557
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:46,309
autopilot at least part of it is
so the there's a complicated coupling of

2558
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
so the there's a complicated coupling of
 

2559
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,950
so the there's a complicated coupling of
the autopilot of uh

2560
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:48,960
the autopilot of uh
 

2561
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,109
the autopilot of uh
institutions

2562
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:51,119

2565
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,730
companies governments
and then there's also the geopolitical

2566
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:55,740
and then there's also the geopolitical
 

2567
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,910
and then there's also the geopolitical
game theory thing going on where you

2568
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:58,920
game theory thing going on where you
 

2569
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,609
game theory thing going on where you
want to keep secrets it's the Chernobyl

2570
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:01,619
want to keep secrets it's the Chernobyl
 

2571
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:04,670
want to keep secrets it's the Chernobyl
thing where if you messed up

2572
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:04,680
thing where if you messed up
 

2573
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,450
thing where if you messed up
there's a big incentive I think to hide

2574
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:08,460
there's a big incentive I think to hide
 

2575
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,670
there's a big incentive I think to hide
the fact that you messed up

2576
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:10,680
the fact that you messed up
 

2577
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,490
the fact that you messed up
so how do we fix this and what's more

2578
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:13,500
so how do we fix this and what's more
 

2579
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,569
so how do we fix this and what's more
important to fix the autopilot which is

2580
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:16,579
important to fix the autopilot which is
 

2581
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:19,609
important to fix the autopilot which is

Heather and I have been talking from the
 

2603
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,329
Heather and I have been talking from the

yes what happens began in China it very

00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,069
yes what happens began in China it very
much looks like a failure of the

much looks like a failure of the

00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,470

and that's frightening but it's also
 

2613
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,510
and that's frightening but it's also

for something that has been

for something that has been
terribly costly to all of us so

terribly costly to all of us so

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,549

that's not a very
 

2629
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,190
that's not a very
happy process but as you point out

2630
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:19,200
happy process but as you point out
 

2631
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,410
happy process but as you point out
what's at stake is in large measure at

00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:21,420
what's at stake is in large measure at
 

2633
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,690
what's at stake is in large measure at

the very least the strong possibility
 

2635
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,670
the very least the strong possibility
this will happen again and that at some

this will happen again and that at some
 

2637
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,490
this will happen again and that at some

00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:28,500
point it will be far worse so you know

there sure is a lot of evidence that

2648
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:43,440
there sure is a lot of evidence that
 

2649
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,170
there sure is a lot of evidence that
suggests that this is a self-inflicted

2650
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:45,180
suggests that this is a self-inflicted
 

2651
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:45,950
suggests that this is a self-inflicted
wound

2652
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:45,960
wound
 

2653
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,290
wound
when you have done something that has

2654
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:48,300
when you have done something that has
 

2655
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,130
when you have done something that has
caused a massive self-inflicted wound

2656
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:51,140
caused a massive self-inflicted wound
 

2657
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,470
caused a massive self-inflicted wound
self-inflicted wound it makes sense to

2658
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
self-inflicted wound it makes sense to
 

2659
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,690
self-inflicted wound it makes sense to
dwell on it exactly to the point that

2660
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:56,700
dwell on it exactly to the point that
 

2661
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,130
dwell on it exactly to the point that
you have learned the lesson that makes

2662
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:58,140
you have learned the lesson that makes
 

2663
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,349
you have learned the lesson that makes
it very very unlikely that something

2664
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:00,359
it very very unlikely that something
 

2665
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:02,329
it very very unlikely that something
similar will happen again I think this

2666
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:02,339
similar will happen again I think this
 

2667
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:04,730
similar will happen again I think this
is a good place to kind of ask you to do

2668
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:04,740
is a good place to kind of ask you to do
 

2669
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,309
is a good place to kind of ask you to do
almost like a thought experiment

2670
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:07,319
almost like a thought experiment
 

2671
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:10,130
almost like a thought experiment
or um

2672
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:10,140
or um
 

2673
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,609
or um
to Steel Man the argument against the

2674
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:13,619
to Steel Man the argument against the
 

2675
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,470
to Steel Man the argument against the
lab leak hypothesis

2676
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:15,480
lab leak hypothesis
 

2677
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,150
lab leak hypothesis
so

2678
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:17,160
so
 

2679
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,130
so
if you were to

2680
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:19,140
if you were to
 

2681
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,750
if you were to
argue you know you said 95 chance that

2682
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:23,760
argue you know you said 95 chance that
 

2683
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,390
argue you know you said 95 chance that
it the virus leave from a lab

2684
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:26,400
it the virus leave from a lab
 

2685
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,490
it the virus leave from a lab
there's a bunch of ways I think you can

2686
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:28,500
there's a bunch of ways I think you can
 

2687
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,809
there's a bunch of ways I think you can
argue

2688
00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:29,819
argue
 

2689
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:33,349
argue
that even talking about it

2690
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359
that even talking about it
 

2691
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,530
that even talking about it
is uh bad for the world

2692
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:36,540
is uh bad for the world
 

2693
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,410
is uh bad for the world
so I if I just put something on the

2694
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:39,420
so I if I just put something on the
 

2695
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,290
so I if I just put something on the
table is to say that

2696
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:42,300
table is to say that
 

2697
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,370
table is to say that
um

2698
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:43,380
um
 

2699
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,190
um
so one it would be racism versus Chinese

2700
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:46,200
so one it would be racism versus Chinese
 

2701
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,890
so one it would be racism versus Chinese
people

2702
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:47,900
people
 

2703
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,170
people
that talking about that it leak from a

2704
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:51,180
that talking about that it leak from a
 

2705
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,150
that talking about that it leak from a
lab there's a kind of immediate kind of

2706
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:53,160
lab there's a kind of immediate kind of
 

2707
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,970
lab there's a kind of immediate kind of
blame and it can spiral down into this

2708
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:55,980
blame and it can spiral down into this
 

2709
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,250
blame and it can spiral down into this
idea that's somehow the people are

2710
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:58,260
idea that's somehow the people are
 

2711
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,829
idea that's somehow the people are
responsible for the virus and this kind

2712
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:00,839
responsible for the virus and this kind
 

2713
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:01,910
responsible for the virus and this kind
of thing

2714
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
of thing
 

2715
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,530
of thing
is it possible for you to come up with

2716
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:03,540
is it possible for you to come up with
 

2717
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,890
is it possible for you to come up with
other Steel Man arguments

2718
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:06,900
other Steel Man arguments
 

2719
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,650
other Steel Man arguments
against talking or against the

2720
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:09,660
against talking or against the
 

2721
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,490
against talking or against the
possibility of the lab League hypothesis

2722
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:13,500
possibility of the lab League hypothesis
 

2723
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,670
possibility of the lab League hypothesis
well so I think steel Manning is a tool

2724
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:16,680
well so I think steel Manning is a tool
 

2725
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,030
well so I think steel Manning is a tool
that is extremely valuable but it's also

2726
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:20,040
that is extremely valuable but it's also
 

2727
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,569
that is extremely valuable but it's also
possible to abuse it I think that you

2728
00:54:23,569 --> 00:54:23,579
possible to abuse it I think that you
 

2729
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:26,270
possible to abuse it I think that you
can only steal man a good faith argument

2730
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:26,280
can only steal man a good faith argument
 

2731
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,030
can only steal man a good faith argument
and the problem is we now know that we

2732
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
and the problem is we now know that we
 

2733
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,490
and the problem is we now know that we
have not been engaged in opponents who

2734
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:31,500
have not been engaged in opponents who
 

2735
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,809
have not been engaged in opponents who
are wielding good faith arguments

2736
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:32,819
are wielding good faith arguments
 

2737
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:34,970
are wielding good faith arguments
because privately their emails reflect

2738
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:34,980
because privately their emails reflect
 

2739
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,950
because privately their emails reflect
their own doubts and what they were

2740
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:36,960
their own doubts and what they were
 

2741
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,650
their own doubts and what they were
doing publicly was actually a punishment

2742
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:39,660
doing publicly was actually a punishment
 

2743
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,870
doing publicly was actually a punishment
a public punishment for those of us who

2744
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:41,880
a public punishment for those of us who
 

2745
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,950
a public punishment for those of us who
spoke up

2746
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
spoke up
 

2747
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,710
spoke up
with I think the purpose of

2748
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:45,720
with I think the purpose of
 

2749
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,809
with I think the purpose of
either backing us down or more likely

2750
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:47,819
either backing us down or more likely
 

2751
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:50,450
either backing us down or more likely
warning others not to engage in the same

2752
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:50,460
warning others not to engage in the same
 

2753
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,549
warning others not to engage in the same
kind of behavior and obviously for

2754
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:52,559
kind of behavior and obviously for
 

2755
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,069
kind of behavior and obviously for
people like you and me who regard

2756
00:54:55,069 --> 00:54:55,079
people like you and me who regard
 

2757
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:58,970
people like you and me who regard
science as our likely best hope for

2758
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:58,980
science as our likely best hope for
 

2759
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,370
science as our likely best hope for
navigating difficult Waters

2760
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:01,380
navigating difficult Waters
 

2761
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,770
navigating difficult Waters
shutting down people who are using those

2762
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:03,780
shutting down people who are using those
 

2763
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,430
shutting down people who are using those
tools honorably is itself dishonorable

2764
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:07,440
tools honorably is itself dishonorable
 

2765
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,069
tools honorably is itself dishonorable
so I I don't really I don't feel that it

2766
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:10,079
so I I don't really I don't feel that it
 

2767
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,450
so I I don't really I don't feel that it
is

2768
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:11,460
is
 

2769
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,250
is
I don't feel that there's anything to

2770
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:13,260
I don't feel that there's anything to
 

2771
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,130
I don't feel that there's anything to
steal man and I also think

2772
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:16,140
steal man and I also think
 

2773
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,809
steal man and I also think
that you know immediately at the point

2774
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:17,819
that you know immediately at the point
 

2775
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:19,849
that you know immediately at the point
that the world suddenly with no new

2776
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:19,859
that the world suddenly with no new
 

2777
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,430
that the world suddenly with no new
evidence on the table switched gears

2778
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:22,440
evidence on the table switched gears
 

2779
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,289
evidence on the table switched gears
with respect to the lab leak you know at

2780
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:24,299
with respect to the lab leak you know at
 

2781
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:25,490
with respect to the lab leak you know at
the point that Nicholas Wade had

2782
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:25,500
the point that Nicholas Wade had
 

2783
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,230
the point that Nicholas Wade had
published his article and suddenly the

2784
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:27,240
published his article and suddenly the
 

2785
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,089
published his article and suddenly the
world was going to admit that this was

2786
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:29,099
world was going to admit that this was
 

2787
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:31,250
world was going to admit that this was
at least a possibility if not a

2788
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:31,260
at least a possibility if not a
 

2789
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,589
at least a possibility if not a
likelihood

2790
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:32,599
likelihood
 

2791
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:35,270
likelihood
we got to see something of the

2792
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,280
we got to see something of the
 

2793
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,250
we got to see something of the
rationalization process that had taken

2794
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:37,260
rationalization process that had taken
 

2795
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,589
rationalization process that had taken
place inside the institutional world and

2796
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:39,599
place inside the institutional world and
 

2797
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,390
place inside the institutional world and
it very definitely involved the claim

2798
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:41,400
it very definitely involved the claim
 

2799
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,510
it very definitely involved the claim
that what was being avoided was the

2800
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:44,520
that what was being avoided was the
 

2801
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,890
that what was being avoided was the
targeting of uh Chinese scientists

2802
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:48,900
targeting of uh Chinese scientists
 

2803
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,230
targeting of uh Chinese scientists
and my point would be I don't want to

2804
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:51,240
and my point would be I don't want to
 

2805
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,230
and my point would be I don't want to
see the targeting of anyone I don't want

2806
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
see the targeting of anyone I don't want
 

2807
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,329
see the targeting of anyone I don't want
to see racism of any kind on the other

2808
00:55:56,329 --> 00:55:56,339
to see racism of any kind on the other
 

2809
00:55:56,339 --> 00:56:01,069
to see racism of any kind on the other
hand once you create license to lie in

2810
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:01,079
hand once you create license to lie in
 

2811
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:05,030
hand once you create license to lie in
order to protect individuals when the

2812
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,040
order to protect individuals when the
 

2813
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,710
order to protect individuals when the
world has a stake in knowing what

2814
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:06,720
world has a stake in knowing what
 

2815
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,470
world has a stake in knowing what
happened then it is inevitable that that

2816
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:09,480
happened then it is inevitable that that
 

2817
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,349
happened then it is inevitable that that
process that license to lie will be used

2818
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:12,359
process that license to lie will be used
 

2819
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:14,210
process that license to lie will be used
by the thing that captures institutions

2820
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:14,220
by the thing that captures institutions
 

2821
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,750
by the thing that captures institutions
for its own purposes so my sense is

2822
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760
for its own purposes so my sense is
 

2823
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,930
for its own purposes so my sense is
it may be very unfortunate if the story

2824
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:20,940
it may be very unfortunate if the story
 

2825
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,630
it may be very unfortunate if the story
of what happened here can be used

2826
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:23,640
of what happened here can be used
 

2827
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,410
of what happened here can be used
against uh Chinese people that would be

2828
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:27,420
against uh Chinese people that would be
 

2829
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,049
against uh Chinese people that would be
very unfortunate and as I think I

2830
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:30,059
very unfortunate and as I think I
 

2831
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:31,010
very unfortunate and as I think I
mentioned

2832
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:31,020
mentioned
 

2833
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,289
mentioned
Heather and I have taken great pains to

2834
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:33,299
Heather and I have taken great pains to
 

2835
00:56:33,299 --> 00:56:35,210
Heather and I have taken great pains to
point out that this doesn't look like a

2836
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:35,220
point out that this doesn't look like a
 

2837
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,650
point out that this doesn't look like a
Chinese failure it looks like a failure

2838
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:36,660
Chinese failure it looks like a failure
 

2839
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,849
Chinese failure it looks like a failure
of the international scientific

2840
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:37,859
of the international scientific
 

2841
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:40,069
of the international scientific
community so I think it is important to

2842
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:40,079
community so I think it is important to
 

2843
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,349
community so I think it is important to
broadcast that message along with the

2844
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:42,359
broadcast that message along with the
 

2845
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:44,390
broadcast that message along with the
analysis of the evidence but no matter

2846
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
analysis of the evidence but no matter
 

2847
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,010
analysis of the evidence but no matter
what happened we have a right to know

2848
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:46,020
what happened we have a right to know
 

2849
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,109
what happened we have a right to know
and

2850
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:48,119
and
 

2851
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:49,910
and
um I frankly do not take the

2852
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
um I frankly do not take the
 

2853
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,250
um I frankly do not take the
institutional layer at its word that its

2854
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:52,260
institutional layer at its word that its
 

2855
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,930
institutional layer at its word that its
motivations are honorable and that it

2856
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:53,940
motivations are honorable and that it
 

2857
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,150
motivations are honorable and that it
was protecting you know good-hearted

2858
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
was protecting you know good-hearted
 

2859
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,829
was protecting you know good-hearted
scientists at the expense of the world

2860
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:57,839
scientists at the expense of the world
 

2861
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:01,370
scientists at the expense of the world
that explanation does not add up well

2862
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:01,380
that explanation does not add up well
 

2863
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,230
that explanation does not add up well
this is a very interesting question

2864
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:03,240
this is a very interesting question
 

2865
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,710
this is a very interesting question
about whether it's ever okay to lie at

2866
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
about whether it's ever okay to lie at
 

2867
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,710
about whether it's ever okay to lie at
the institutional layer to

2868
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:09,720
the institutional layer to
 

2869
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,770
the institutional layer to
protect the populace

2870
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:12,780
protect the populace
 

2871
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,650
protect the populace
I think both you and I are probably on

2872
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:15,660
I think both you and I are probably on
 

2873
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,289
I think both you and I are probably on
the same

2874
00:57:18,289 --> 00:57:18,299

 

2875
00:57:18,299 --> 00:57:20,930

have the same sense that it's a slippery

2876
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:20,940
have the same sense that it's a slippery
 

2877
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,210
have the same sense that it's a slippery
slope even if it's an effective

2878
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:23,220
slope even if it's an effective
 

2879
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,789
slope even if it's an effective
mechanism in the short term in the long

2880
00:57:25,789 --> 00:57:25,799
mechanism in the short term in the long
 

2881
00:57:25,799 --> 00:57:28,549
mechanism in the short term in the long
term it's going to be destructive

2882
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
term it's going to be destructive
 

2883
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,710
term it's going to be destructive
this happened with masks

2884
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:30,720
this happened with masks
 

2885
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,809
this happened with masks
this happened with with other things if

2886
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:32,819
this happened with with other things if
 

2887
00:57:32,819 --> 00:57:35,510
this happened with with other things if
you look at just history pandemics

2888
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:35,520
you look at just history pandemics
 

2889
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,470
you look at just history pandemics
there's a there's an idea that Panic is

2890
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:39,480
there's a there's an idea that Panic is
 

2891
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,870
there's a there's an idea that Panic is
destructive amongst the populists so you

2892
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:41,880
destructive amongst the populists so you
 

2893
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,970
destructive amongst the populists so you
you want to construct a narrative

2894
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:43,980
you want to construct a narrative
 

2895
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,809
you want to construct a narrative
whether it's a lie or not to minimize

2896
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:47,819
whether it's a lie or not to minimize
 

2897
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:49,370
whether it's a lie or not to minimize
panic

2898
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:49,380
panic
 

2899
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,250
panic
but you're suggesting that almost in all

2900
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:52,260
but you're suggesting that almost in all
 

2901
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,890
but you're suggesting that almost in all
cases and I think that was the lesson

2902
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:54,900
cases and I think that was the lesson
 

2903
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,150
cases and I think that was the lesson
from

2904
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:56,160
from
 

2905
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,490
from
the the pandemic in the early 20th

2906
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:58,500
the the pandemic in the early 20th
 

2907
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,910
the the pandemic in the early 20th
century that

2908
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:00,920
century that
 

2909
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,510
century that
lying creates distrust and distrust in

2910
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:05,520
lying creates distrust and distrust in
 

2911
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,950
lying creates distrust and distrust in
the institutions is ultimately

2912
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:06,960
the institutions is ultimately
 

2913
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,950
the institutions is ultimately
destructive that's your sense that lying

2914
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:09,960
destructive that's your sense that lying
 

2915
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,190
destructive that's your sense that lying
is not okay well okay you know there are

2916
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
is not okay well okay you know there are
 

2917
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,230
is not okay well okay you know there are
obviously places where complete

2918
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:15,240
obviously places where complete
 

2919
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,569
obviously places where complete
transparency is not a good idea right to

2920
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:17,579
transparency is not a good idea right to
 

2921
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:19,609
transparency is not a good idea right to
the extent that you broadcast a

2922
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:19,619
the extent that you broadcast a
 

2923
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:22,549
the extent that you broadcast a
technology that allows one individual to

2924
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
technology that allows one individual to
 

2925
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,829
technology that allows one individual to
hold the world hostage right obviously

2926
00:58:24,829 --> 00:58:24,839
hold the world hostage right obviously
 

2927
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:27,650
hold the world hostage right obviously
you've got a something to be navigated

2928
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:27,660
you've got a something to be navigated
 

2929
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,789
you've got a something to be navigated
but in general I don't believe that the

2930
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:31,799
but in general I don't believe that the
 

2931
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,069
but in general I don't believe that the
scientific system should be

2932
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:34,079
scientific system should be
 

2933
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,930
scientific system should be
lying to us

2934
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:35,940
lying to us
 

2935
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,710
lying to us
in the case of this particular lie

2936
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:39,720
in the case of this particular lie
 

2937
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,750
in the case of this particular lie
the idea that the well-being of Chinese

2938
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:43,760
the idea that the well-being of Chinese
 

2939
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,270
the idea that the well-being of Chinese
scientists outweighs the well-being of

2940
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
scientists outweighs the well-being of
 

2941
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,410
scientists outweighs the well-being of
the world

2942
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:48,420
the world
 

2943
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,170
the world
is preposterous yeah right as you as you

2944
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:51,180
is preposterous yeah right as you as you
 

2945
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,150
is preposterous yeah right as you as you
point out one thing that rests on this

2946
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:53,160
point out one thing that rests on this
 

2947
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,710
point out one thing that rests on this
question is whether we continue to do

2948
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:54,720
question is whether we continue to do
 

2949
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,990
question is whether we continue to do
this kind of research going forward and

2950
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:57,000
this kind of research going forward and
 

2951
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,849
this kind of research going forward and
the scientists in question all of them

2952
00:58:58,849 --> 00:58:58,859
the scientists in question all of them
 

2953
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:01,970
the scientists in question all of them
American Chinese all of them were

2954
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:01,980
American Chinese all of them were
 

2955
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,670
American Chinese all of them were
pushing the idea that the risk of a

2956
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:04,680
pushing the idea that the risk of a
 

2957
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,250
pushing the idea that the risk of a
zoonotic spillover event causing a major

2958
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:07,260
zoonotic spillover event causing a major
 

2959
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,410
zoonotic spillover event causing a major
and highly destructive pandemic was so

2960
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:09,420
and highly destructive pandemic was so
 

2961
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,049
and highly destructive pandemic was so
great that we had to risk this

2962
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:12,059
great that we had to risk this
 

2963
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:14,210
great that we had to risk this
now if they themselves have caused it

2964
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:14,220
now if they themselves have caused it
 

2965
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,609
now if they themselves have caused it
and if they are wrong as I believe they

2966
00:59:16,609 --> 00:59:16,619
and if they are wrong as I believe they
 

2967
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,470
and if they are wrong as I believe they
are about the likelihood of a major

2968
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
are about the likelihood of a major
 

2969
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,990
are about the likelihood of a major
world pandemic spilling out of nature in

2970
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,000
world pandemic spilling out of nature in
 

2971
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,150
world pandemic spilling out of nature in
the way that they uh wrote into their

2972
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:23,160
the way that they uh wrote into their
 

2973
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,970
the way that they uh wrote into their
Grant applications then the danger is

2974
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:25,980
Grant applications then the danger is
 

2975
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,289
Grant applications then the danger is
you know the call is coming from inside

2976
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:27,299
you know the call is coming from inside
 

2977
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:31,069
you know the call is coming from inside
the house and uh we have to look at that

2978
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:31,079
the house and uh we have to look at that
 

2979
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:34,309
the house and uh we have to look at that
and yes whatever we have to do to

00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:34,319
and yes whatever we have to do to
 

2981
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,730
and yes whatever we have to do to
protect scientists from retribution we

2982
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:37,740
protect scientists from retribution we
 

2983
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,789
protect scientists from retribution we
should do but we cannot

2984
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
should do but we cannot
 

2985
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,829
should do but we cannot

your license to lie is it doesn't extend

01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:25,200
to that yeah I've seen the the attacks
 

3017
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,530
to that yeah I've seen the the attacks
on you the pressure on you has a very

01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:27,540
on you the pressure on you has a very
 

3019
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,390
on you the pressure on you has a very
important effect

3020

important effect
 

3021
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,569

01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:34,980
thousands of world-class biologists
 

3025
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,510
thousands of world-class biologists
actually so at MIT colleagues of mine

3026
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:38,520
actually so at MIT colleagues of mine
 

3027
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,730
actually so at MIT colleagues of mine
people I know there's a there's a slight

3028
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:40,740
people I know there's a there's a slight
 

3029
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,049
people I know there's a there's a slight
pressure

3030
01:00:42,049 --> 01:00:42,059
pressure
 

3031
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:46,190
pressure
to not be allowed to uh one speak

3032
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:46,200
to not be allowed to uh one speak
 

3033
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,950
to not be allowed to uh one speak
publicly and two actually think

3034
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:50,960
publicly and two actually think
 

3035
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,510
publicly and two actually think
like do you even think about these ideas

3036
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
like do you even think about these ideas
 

3037
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,730
like do you even think about these ideas
it sounds kind of ridiculous but just

3038
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:55,740
it sounds kind of ridiculous but just
 

3039
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,010
it sounds kind of ridiculous but just

many people many world-class biologists

3044
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:05,280
many people many world-class biologists
 

3045
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,530
many people many world-class biologists
that I know will just avoid looking at

3046
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:09,540
that I know will just avoid looking at
 

3047
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,930
that I know will just avoid looking at
the data there's not even that many

3048
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:11,940
the data there's not even that many
 

3049
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,789
the data there's not even that many
people that are publicly opposing gain a

3050
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:13,799
people that are publicly opposing gain a
 

3051
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,950
people that are publicly opposing gain a
function research they they're they're

3052
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:15,960
function research they they're they're
 

3053
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,190
function research they they're they're
also like it's not worth it it's not

3054
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:19,200
also like it's not worth it it's not
 

3055
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,990
also like it's not worth it it's not
worth the battle and there's many people

3056
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:21,000
worth the battle and there's many people
 

3057
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,150
worth the battle and there's many people
that kind of argue that those battles

3058
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:23,160
that kind of argue that those battles
 

3059
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,309
that kind of argue that those battles
should be fought in private

3060
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:25,319
should be fought in private
 

3061
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:28,490
should be fought in private
in uh I'm uh you know with colleagues in

01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:38,700
deal with the the complexities of this
 

3071
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,730
deal with the the complexities of this
kind of discussion I don't know but the

3072
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:40,740
kind of discussion I don't know but the
 

3073
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,829
kind of discussion I don't know but the
final result is combined with the

final result is combined with the
 

3075
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:46,549
final result is combined with the

pressures in the academic institutions
 

3079
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,349
pressures in the academic institutions
is that it's just people are

3080
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:50,359
is that it's just people are
 

3081
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:52,809
is that it's just people are
self-censoring and silencing themselves

3082
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:52,819
self-censoring and silencing themselves
 

3083
01:01:52,819 --> 01:01:55,190
self-censoring and silencing themselves
and silencing the most important thing

3084
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
and silencing the most important thing
 

3085
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,069
and silencing the most important thing
which is the power of their brains

3086
01:01:58,069 --> 01:01:58,079
which is the power of their brains
 

3087
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,150
which is the power of their brains
like these people are brilliant and the

3088
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:02,160
like these people are brilliant and the
 

3089
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,589
like these people are brilliant and the
fact that they're not utilizing their

01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:03,599
fact that they're not utilizing their
 

3091
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,950
fact that they're not utilizing their

outside of the conformist line of

3094
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:09,119
outside of the conformist line of
 

3095
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,329
outside of the conformist line of
thinking it's tragic

3096
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:11,339
thinking it's tragic
 

3097
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:15,289
thinking it's tragic
well it is I also think that it we have

3098
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:15,299
well it is I also think that it we have
 

3099
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:16,970
well it is I also think that it we have
to look at it and understand it for what

3100
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:16,980
to look at it and understand it for what
 

3101
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,190
to look at it and understand it for what
it is for one thing it's kind of a

3102
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,200
it is for one thing it's kind of a
 

3103
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,430
it is for one thing it's kind of a
cryptic totalitarianism somehow people's

3104
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:22,440
cryptic totalitarianism somehow people's
 

3105
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,809
cryptic totalitarianism somehow people's
sense of what they're allowed to think

3106
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:23,819
sense of what they're allowed to think
 

3107
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:26,569
sense of what they're allowed to think
about talk about discuss is causing them

3108
01:02:26,569 --> 01:02:26,579
about talk about discuss is causing them
 

3109
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:28,670
about talk about discuss is causing them
to self-censor and I can tell you it's

3110
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:28,680
to self-censor and I can tell you it's
 

3111
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,289
to self-censor and I can tell you it's
causing many of them to rationalize

3112
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:30,299
causing many of them to rationalize
 

3113
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:32,029
causing many of them to rationalize
which is even worse they're blinding

3114
01:02:32,029 --> 01:02:32,039
which is even worse they're blinding
 

3115
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,730
which is even worse they're blinding
themselves to what they can see

3116
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:34,740
themselves to what they can see
 

3117
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,789
themselves to what they can see
um but it is also the case I believe

3118
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:37,799
um but it is also the case I believe
 

3119
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:39,589
um but it is also the case I believe
that what you're describing about what

3120
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
that what you're describing about what
 

3121
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,010
that what you're describing about what
people said and a great many people

3122
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:42,020
people said and a great many people
 

3123
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,109
people said and a great many people
understood that the lab leak hypothesis

3124
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:45,119
understood that the lab leak hypothesis
 

3125
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,270
understood that the lab leak hypothesis
could not be taken off the table but

3126
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:47,280
could not be taken off the table but
 

3127
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,210
could not be taken off the table but
they didn't say so publicly and I think

3128
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:50,220
they didn't say so publicly and I think
 

3129
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,609
they didn't say so publicly and I think
that their discussions with each other

3130
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:52,619
that their discussions with each other
 

3131
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:54,650
that their discussions with each other
about why they did not say what they

3132
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:54,660
about why they did not say what they
 

3133
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,049
about why they did not say what they
understood that's what capture sounds

3134
01:02:57,049 --> 01:02:57,059
understood that's what capture sounds
 

3135
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:00,170
understood that's what capture sounds
like on the inside I don't know exactly

3136
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:00,180
like on the inside I don't know exactly
 

3137
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:03,170
like on the inside I don't know exactly
what force captured the institutions I

3138
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:03,180
what force captured the institutions I
 

3139
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,170
what force captured the institutions I
don't think uh anybody knows for sure

3140
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:06,180
don't think uh anybody knows for sure
 

3141
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,789
don't think uh anybody knows for sure
out here in public

3142
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:07,799
out here in public
 

3143
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:09,230
out here in public
I don't even know that it wasn't just

3144
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:09,240
I don't even know that it wasn't just
 

3145
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,510
I don't even know that it wasn't just
simply a process but

3146
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:11,520
simply a process but
 

3147
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,210
simply a process but
you have these institutions they are

3148
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:14,220
you have these institutions they are
 

3149
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:18,289
you have these institutions they are
behaving towards a kind of somatic

3150
01:03:18,289 --> 01:03:18,299
behaving towards a kind of somatic
 

3151
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:20,809
behaving towards a kind of somatic
obligation they have lost sight of what

3152
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:20,819
obligation they have lost sight of what
 

3153
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:24,230
obligation they have lost sight of what
they were built to accomplish and on the

3154
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:24,240
they were built to accomplish and on the
 

3155
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,049
they were built to accomplish and on the
inside the way they avoid going back to

3156
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:27,059
inside the way they avoid going back to
 

3157
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:29,270
inside the way they avoid going back to
their original mission is to say things

3158
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
their original mission is to say things
 

3159
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,910
their original mission is to say things
to themselves like the public can't have

3160
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:31,920
to themselves like the public can't have
 

3161
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,710
to themselves like the public can't have
this discussion it can't be trusted with

3162
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:33,720
this discussion it can't be trusted with
 

3163
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,510
this discussion it can't be trusted with
it yes we need to be able to talk about

3164
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,520
it yes we need to be able to talk about
 

3165
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,950
it yes we need to be able to talk about
this but it has to be private whatever

3166
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:36,960
this but it has to be private whatever
 

3167
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,510
this but it has to be private whatever
it is they say to themselves that is

3168
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:38,520
it is they say to themselves that is
 

3169
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,069
it is they say to themselves that is
what capture sounds like on the inside

3170
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
what capture sounds like on the inside
 

3171
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,730
what capture sounds like on the inside
it's a institutional rationalization

3172
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:43,740
it's a institutional rationalization
 

3173
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,250
it's a institutional rationalization
mechanism and it's very very deadly

3174
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:46,260
mechanism and it's very very deadly
 

3175
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,549
mechanism and it's very very deadly
and at the point you go from Lab leak to

3176
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:49,559
and at the point you go from Lab leak to
 

3177
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,470
and at the point you go from Lab leak to
repurposed drugs you can see that it's

3178
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:51,480
repurposed drugs you can see that it's
 

3179
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,529
repurposed drugs you can see that it's
very deadly in a very direct way

3180
01:03:54,529 --> 01:03:54,539
very deadly in a very direct way
 

3181
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,650
very deadly in a very direct way
yeah I see this on in my field of with

3182
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:57,660
yeah I see this on in my field of with
 

3183
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,029
yeah I see this on in my field of with
uh

3184
01:03:59,029 --> 01:03:59,039
uh
 

3185
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,549
uh
things like autonomous weapon systems

3186
01:04:01,549 --> 01:04:01,559
things like autonomous weapon systems
 

3187
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:04,010
things like autonomous weapon systems
people in AI do not talk about the use

3188
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:04,020
people in AI do not talk about the use
 

3189
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,710
people in AI do not talk about the use
of AI and weapon systems they they kind

3190
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
of AI and weapon systems they they kind
 

3191
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,990
of AI and weapon systems they they kind
of avoid the idea that AIS use them in

3192
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:09,000
of avoid the idea that AIS use them in
 

3193
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,789
of avoid the idea that AIS use them in
the military because it's kind of funny

3194
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:10,799
the military because it's kind of funny
 

3195
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,650
the military because it's kind of funny
there is there's this like kind of

3196
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:12,660
there is there's this like kind of
 

3197
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,150
there is there's this like kind of
discomfort and they're like they all

3198
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
discomfort and they're like they all
 

3199
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,370
discomfort and they're like they all
hurry like uh you know like something

3200
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:16,380
hurry like uh you know like something
 

3201
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,170
hurry like uh you know like something
scary happens in a bunch of sheep kind

3202
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:18,180
scary happens in a bunch of sheep kind
 

3203
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:19,849
scary happens in a bunch of sheep kind
of like run a run away that's what it

3204
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:19,859
of like run a run away that's what it
 

3205
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:22,670
of like run a run away that's what it
looks like and it I don't even know what

3206
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:22,680
looks like and it I don't even know what
 

3207
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,410
looks like and it I don't even know what
to do about it because and then I feel

3208
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:24,420
to do about it because and then I feel
 

3209
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:27,529
to do about it because and then I feel
this natural pull every time I bring up

3210
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:27,539
this natural pull every time I bring up
 

3211
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:29,809
this natural pull every time I bring up
autonomous weapon systems to go along

3212
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:29,819
autonomous weapon systems to go along
 

3213
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:32,029
autonomous weapon systems to go along
with the Sheep there's a natural kind of

3214
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:32,039
with the Sheep there's a natural kind of
 

3215
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:34,010
with the Sheep there's a natural kind of
pull towards that direction because it's

3216
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:34,020
pull towards that direction because it's
 

3217
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,950
pull towards that direction because it's
like what can I do as one person

3218
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:36,960
like what can I do as one person
 

3219
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,950
like what can I do as one person
now there's currently nothing

3220
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:38,960
now there's currently nothing
 

3221
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,970
now there's currently nothing
destructive happening with autonomous

3222
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:40,980
destructive happening with autonomous
 

3223
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,010
destructive happening with autonomous
weapon systems so we're in like in the

3224
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:43,020
weapon systems so we're in like in the
 

3225
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:46,130
weapon systems so we're in like in the
early days of this race that in 10 20

3226
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:46,140
early days of this race that in 10 20
 

3227
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,529
early days of this race that in 10 20
years might become a real problem now

3228
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:48,539
years might become a real problem now
 

3229
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:50,450
years might become a real problem now
where the discussion we're having now

3230
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:50,460
where the discussion we're having now
 

3231
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,569
where the discussion we're having now
we're now facing the result of that in

3232
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:53,579
we're now facing the result of that in
 

3233
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:56,630
we're now facing the result of that in
the space of viruses uh like for many

3234
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:56,640
the space of viruses uh like for many
 

3235
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,349
the space of viruses uh like for many
years avoiding the conversations here

3236
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:00,359
years avoiding the conversations here
 

3237
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:01,670
years avoiding the conversations here
I don't know what to do that in the

3238
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:01,680
I don't know what to do that in the
 

3239
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,289
I don't know what to do that in the
early days

3240
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:03,299
early days
 

3241
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,910
early days
um but I think we'll have to I guess

3242
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:04,920
um but I think we'll have to I guess
 

3243
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,010
um but I think we'll have to I guess
great institutions where people can

3244
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:07,020
great institutions where people can
 

3245
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,089
great institutions where people can
stand out

3246
01:05:08,089 --> 01:05:08,099
stand out
 

3247
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:11,210
stand out
people can stand out and like basically

3248
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:11,220
people can stand out and like basically
 

3249
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,789
people can stand out and like basically
be individual thinkers and break out

3250
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:13,799
be individual thinkers and break out
 

3251
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:16,849
be individual thinkers and break out
into all kinds of spaces of ideas that

3252
01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:16,859
into all kinds of spaces of ideas that
 

3253
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,010
into all kinds of spaces of ideas that
allow us to think freely freedom of

3254
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:19,020
allow us to think freely freedom of
 

3255
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,870
allow us to think freely freedom of
thought and maybe that requires a

3256
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:20,880
thought and maybe that requires a
 

3257
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,150
thought and maybe that requires a
decentralization of Institutions well

3258
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:23,160
decentralization of Institutions well
 

3259
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,789
decentralization of Institutions well
years ago I came up with a concept

3260
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:25,799
years ago I came up with a concept
 

3261
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:28,789
years ago I came up with a concept
called cultivated insecurity

3262
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
called cultivated insecurity
 

3263
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,309
called cultivated insecurity
and the idea is let's just take the

3264
01:05:31,309 --> 01:05:31,319
and the idea is let's just take the
 

3265
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:34,309
and the idea is let's just take the
example of the average Joe right the

3266
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:34,319
example of the average Joe right the
 

3267
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,529
example of the average Joe right the
average Joe has a job somewhere and

3268
01:05:38,529 --> 01:05:38,539
average Joe has a job somewhere and
 

3269
01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:41,950
average Joe has a job somewhere and

their retirement their connection with
 

3273
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,650
their retirement their connection with
the economy is to one degree or another

3274
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:48,660
the economy is to one degree or another
 

3275
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:52,010
the economy is to one degree or another
dependent on their relationship with the

3276
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:52,020
dependent on their relationship with the
 

3277
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,809
dependent on their relationship with the
employer

3278
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:53,819
employer
 

3279
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:56,750
employer
that means that there is a strong

3280
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:56,760
that means that there is a strong
 

3281
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,450
that means that there is a strong
incentive especially in any industry

3282
01:05:59,450 --> 01:05:59,460
incentive especially in any industry
 

3283
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,190
incentive especially in any industry
where it's not easy to move from one

3284
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200
where it's not easy to move from one
 

3285
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,630
where it's not easy to move from one
employer to the next there's a strong

3286
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:02,640
employer to the next there's a strong
 

3287
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,870
employer to the next there's a strong
incentive to stay in your employer's

3288
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:05,880
incentive to stay in your employer's
 

3289
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,089
incentive to stay in your employer's
good graces right so it creates a very

3290
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:08,099
good graces right so it creates a very
 

3291
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:10,789
good graces right so it creates a very
top-down Dynamic not only in terms of

3292
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:10,799
top-down Dynamic not only in terms of
 

3293
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:14,210
top-down Dynamic not only in terms of
who gets to tell uh other people what to

3294
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:14,220
who gets to tell uh other people what to
 

3295
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,670
who gets to tell uh other people what to
do but it really comes down to who gets

3296
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:16,680
do but it really comes down to who gets
 

3297
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,770
do but it really comes down to who gets
to tell other people how to think

3298
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:18,780
to tell other people how to think
 

3299
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,049
to tell other people how to think
so that's extremely dangerous

3300
01:06:21,049 --> 01:06:21,059
so that's extremely dangerous
 

3301
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:24,289
so that's extremely dangerous
the way out of it is to cultivate

3302
01:06:24,289 --> 01:06:24,299
the way out of it is to cultivate
 

3303
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:27,170
the way out of it is to cultivate
security to the extent that somebody is

3304
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:27,180
security to the extent that somebody is
 

3305
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:30,470
security to the extent that somebody is
in a position to go against the grain

3306
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:30,480
in a position to go against the grain
 

3307
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,809
in a position to go against the grain
and have it not be a catastrophe for

3308
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:32,819
and have it not be a catastrophe for
 

3309
01:06:32,819 --> 01:06:34,789
and have it not be a catastrophe for
their family and their ability to earn

3310
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:34,799
their family and their ability to earn
 

3311
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,890
their family and their ability to earn
you will see that behavior a lot more so

3312
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:36,900
you will see that behavior a lot more so
 

3313
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,270
you will see that behavior a lot more so
I would argue that some of what you're

3314
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:38,280
I would argue that some of what you're
 

3315
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,910
I would argue that some of what you're
talking about is just a simple

3316
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:39,920
talking about is just a simple
 

3317
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,470
talking about is just a simple
predictable consequence of the

3318
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480
predictable consequence of the
 

3319
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,730
predictable consequence of the
concentration of the uh the sources of

concentration of the uh the sources of

emergency podcast on the subject which I
 

3369
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,770
emergency podcast on the subject which I
I think that was not an exaggeration

3370

I think that was not an exaggeration
 

3371
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:53,870
I think that was not an exaggeration
this needed to happen

this needed to happen
 

3373
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,130
this needed to happen
for various reasons that he uh he took

for various reasons that he uh he took
 

3375
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,170
for various reasons that he uh he took
us down the road of talking about the

01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:00,180
us down the road of talking about the
 

3377

censorship campaign against Ivermectin
 

3379
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:05,270
censorship campaign against Ivermectin
which I find utterly shocking and

3380
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:05,280
which I find utterly shocking and
 

3381
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,430
which I find utterly shocking and
talking about the drug itself and I

3382
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
talking about the drug itself and I
 

3383
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,289
talking about the drug itself and I
should say we talked uh we had Pierre

are doctors who have innovated uh ways
 

3395
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,189
are doctors who have innovated uh ways
of treating coveted patients and they

of treating coveted patients and they
 

3397
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:28,669

happened on Ivermectin and have been

3398
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:28,679
happened on Ivermectin and have been
 

3399
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:32,030
happened on Ivermectin and have been
using it and I hesitate to use the word

3400
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:32,040
using it and I hesitate to use the word
 

3401
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,769
using it and I hesitate to use the word
advocating for it because that's not

3402
01:08:33,769 --> 01:08:33,779
advocating for it because that's not
 

3403
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:36,289
advocating for it because that's not
really the role of doctors or scientists

3404
01:08:36,289 --> 01:08:36,299
really the role of doctors or scientists
 

3405
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:38,149
really the role of doctors or scientists
but they are advocating for it in the

3406
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:38,159
but they are advocating for it in the
 

3407
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:41,090
but they are advocating for it in the
sense that there is this uh pressure not

3408
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:41,100
sense that there is this uh pressure not
 

3409
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,709
sense that there is this uh pressure not
to talk about its Effectiveness for

3410
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:42,719
to talk about its Effectiveness for
 

3411
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,349
to talk about its Effectiveness for
reasons that we can go into so maybe

3412
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:45,359
reasons that we can go into so maybe
 

3413
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,249
reasons that we can go into so maybe
step back and say what is Ivermectin and

3414
01:08:49,249 --> 01:08:49,259
step back and say what is Ivermectin and
 

3415
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:50,809
step back and say what is Ivermectin and
how much

3416
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:50,819
how much
 

3417
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:52,910
how much
Studies have been done to show its

3418
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:52,920
Studies have been done to show its
 

3419
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,410
Studies have been done to show its
effectiveness

3420
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:54,420
effectiveness
 

3421
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,809
effectiveness
so Ivermectin is an interesting drug it

3422
01:08:56,809 --> 01:08:56,819
so Ivermectin is an interesting drug it
 

3423
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:00,070
so Ivermectin is an interesting drug it
was discovered in the 70s by a Japanese

3424
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,080
was discovered in the 70s by a Japanese
 

3425
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,010
was discovered in the 70s by a Japanese
scientist named Satoshi omura and he

3426
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:04,020
scientist named Satoshi omura and he
 

3427
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:07,669
scientist named Satoshi omura and he
found it in soil near a Japanese golf

3428
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:07,679
found it in soil near a Japanese golf
 

3429
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,829
found it in soil near a Japanese golf
course so I would just point out in

3430
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:09,839
course so I would just point out in
 

3431
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,890
course so I would just point out in
passing that if we were to stop

3432
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:11,900
passing that if we were to stop
 

3433
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,649
passing that if we were to stop
self-silencing over the possibility that

3434
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:15,659
self-silencing over the possibility that
 

3435
01:09:15,659 --> 01:09:18,470
self-silencing over the possibility that
Asians will be demonized over the

Asians will be demonized over the
 

3437
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,510
Asians will be demonized over the
possible lab leak in Wuhan and to

3438
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:20,520
possible lab leak in Wuhan and to
 

3439
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,249
possible lab leak in Wuhan and to
recognize that actually the natural

3440
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:22,259
recognize that actually the natural
 

3441
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,990
recognize that actually the natural
course of the story

3442
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,000
course of the story
 

3443
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,329
course of the story
has a likely lab leak in China it has a

3444
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:29,339
has a likely lab leak in China it has a
 

3445
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:32,930
has a likely lab leak in China it has a
unlikely hero in Japan

unlikely hero in Japan
 

3447
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,870
unlikely hero in Japan
um the story is naturally not a simple

3448
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:35,880
um the story is naturally not a simple
 

3449
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,769
um the story is naturally not a simple
one but in any case uh Amura discovered

periods of time and in fact one of the
 

3487
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,149
periods of time and in fact one of the
reasons that Africa may have had less

reasons that Africa may have had less
 

3489
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:37,130
reasons that Africa may have had less
severe impacts from covid-19 is that

3490
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:37,140
severe impacts from covid-19 is that
 

3491
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,590
severe impacts from covid-19 is that
Ivermectin is widely used there to

01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,050
Ivermectin is widely used there to
prevent parasites and the drug appears

3494
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:42,060
prevent parasites and the drug appears
 

3495
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,390
prevent parasites and the drug appears
to have a long lasting impact so it's an

3496
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,400
to have a long lasting impact so it's an
 

3497
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,669
to have a long lasting impact so it's an
interesting molecule it was discovered

3498
01:10:46,669 --> 01:10:46,679
interesting molecule it was discovered
 

3499
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:49,310
interesting molecule it was discovered
some time ago apparently

3500
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:49,320
some time ago apparently
 

3501
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,470
some time ago apparently
that it has antiviral properties and so

3502
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:51,480
that it has antiviral properties and so
 

3503
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,229
that it has antiviral properties and so
it was tested in early in the covid-19

3504
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:54,239
it was tested in early in the covid-19
 

3505
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:57,169
it was tested in early in the covid-19
pandemic to see if it might work to

3506
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:57,179
pandemic to see if it might work to
 

3507
01:10:57,179 --> 01:10:59,630
pandemic to see if it might work to
treat humans with covid it turned out to

3508
01:10:59,630 --> 01:10:59,640
treat humans with covid it turned out to
 

3509
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,810
treat humans with covid it turned out to
have very promising evidence that it did

3510
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:02,820
have very promising evidence that it did
 

3511
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,450
have very promising evidence that it did
treat humans it was tested in tissues it

3512
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:05,460
treat humans it was tested in tissues it
 

3513
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,970
treat humans it was tested in tissues it
was tested at a very high dosage which

3514
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:07,980
was tested at a very high dosage which
 

3515
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,890
was tested at a very high dosage which
confuses people they think that those of

3516
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:09,900
confuses people they think that those of
 

3517
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,530
confuses people they think that those of
us who believe that Ivermectin might be

3518
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:12,540
us who believe that Ivermectin might be
 

3519
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,050
us who believe that Ivermectin might be
useful in confronting this disease or

3520
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:15,060
useful in confronting this disease or
 

3521
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,850
useful in confronting this disease or
advocating those high doses which is not

3522
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:16,860
advocating those high doses which is not
 

3523
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,169
advocating those high doses which is not
the case

3524
01:11:18,169 --> 01:11:18,179
the case
 

3525
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:20,390
the case
but in any case there have been quite a

3526
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,400
but in any case there have been quite a
 

3527
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,709
but in any case there have been quite a
number of studies

3528
01:11:21,709 --> 01:11:21,719
number of studies
 

3529
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:24,649
number of studies
a wonderful meta-analysis was finally

3530
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:24,659
a wonderful meta-analysis was finally
 

3531
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:26,450
a wonderful meta-analysis was finally
released we had seen it in pre-print

3532

released we had seen it in pre-print
 

3533
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,250
released we had seen it in pre-print
version but it was finally peer-reviewed

and published this last week it reveals
 

3537
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,910
and published this last week it reveals
that the drug as clinicians have been

it's highly effective at treating people

3542
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:37,920
it's highly effective at treating people
 

3543
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,590
it's highly effective at treating people
with the disease especially if you get

dot com well I saw it as uh c19 ever met
 

3573
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,830
dot com well I saw it as uh c19 ever met
yeah

3574
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:21,840
yeah
 

3575
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,930
yeah
um no this is not that meta-analysis

3576
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:23,940
um no this is not that meta-analysis
 

3577
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,310
um no this is not that meta-analysis
stuff so that is as you say a living

3578
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:25,320
stuff so that is as you say a living
 

3579
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,169
stuff so that is as you say a living
meta-analysis where you can watch his

3580
01:12:27,169 --> 01:12:27,179
meta-analysis where you can watch his
 

3581
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:29,030
meta-analysis where you can watch his
evidence which is super cool by the way

3582
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,040
evidence which is super cool by the way
 

3583
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,649
evidence which is super cool by the way
it's really cool and they've got some

3584
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:30,659
it's really cool and they've got some
 

3585
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:32,870
it's really cool and they've got some
really nice Graphics that allow you to

3586
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:32,880
really nice Graphics that allow you to
 

3587
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,850
really nice Graphics that allow you to
understand well what is the evidence you

3588
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:34,860
understand well what is the evidence you
 

3589
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,590
understand well what is the evidence you
know it's concentrated around this level

3590
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:36,600
know it's concentrated around this level
 

3591
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,970
know it's concentrated around this level
of Effectiveness

3592
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:37,980
of Effectiveness
 

3593
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,770
of Effectiveness
Etc so anyway it's great site well worth

3594
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:39,780
Etc so anyway it's great site well worth
 

3595
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,689
Etc so anyway it's great site well worth
paying attention to no this was a

3596
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:41,699
paying attention to no this was a
 

3597
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:43,669
paying attention to no this was a
meta-analysis

3598
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:43,679
meta-analysis
 

3599
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,649
meta-analysis
um I don't know any of the authors but

3600
01:12:45,649 --> 01:12:45,659
um I don't know any of the authors but
 

3601
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:48,830
um I don't know any of the authors but
one second author is Tess Laurie of the

3602
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:48,840
one second author is Tess Laurie of the
 

3603
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,750
one second author is Tess Laurie of the
bird group bird being a uh a group of

3604
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:52,760
bird group bird being a uh a group of
 

3605
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,149
bird group bird being a uh a group of
analysts and doctors in Britain that is

3606
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:56,159
analysts and doctors in Britain that is
 

3607
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,189
analysts and doctors in Britain that is
playing a role similar to the FL Triple

3608
01:12:58,189 --> 01:12:58,199
playing a role similar to the FL Triple
 

3609
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:00,590
playing a role similar to the FL Triple
C here in the U.S

3610
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:00,600
C here in the U.S
 

3611
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,149
C here in the U.S
um so anyway this is a meta-analysis

3612
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:02,159
um so anyway this is a meta-analysis
 

3613
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:05,450
um so anyway this is a meta-analysis
that that uh that uh Tess Laurie and

3614
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:05,460
that that uh that uh Tess Laurie and
 

3615
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,130
that that uh that uh Tess Laurie and
others did of all of the available

3616
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:07,140
others did of all of the available
 

3617
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,410
others did of all of the available
evidence and

3618
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:09,420
evidence and
 

3619
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,270
evidence and
um it's quite compelling people if

3620
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:11,280
um it's quite compelling people if
 

3621
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,010
um it's quite compelling people if
people can look for it on my Twitter I

3622
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:13,020
people can look for it on my Twitter I
 

3623
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,270
people can look for it on my Twitter I
will I will put it up and people can

3624
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:14,280
will I will put it up and people can
 

3625
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,270
will I will put it up and people can
find it there so what about dose here

3626
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:17,280
find it there so what about dose here
 

3627
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,770
find it there so what about dose here
that

3628
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:18,780
that
 

3629
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,950
that
in terms of safety uh uh what do we

3630
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:21,960
in terms of safety uh uh what do we
 

3631
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,450
in terms of safety uh uh what do we
understand about the the kind of dust

3632
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:23,460
understand about the the kind of dust
 

3633
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,390
understand about the the kind of dust
required to to have that level of

3634
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:25,400
required to to have that level of
 

3635
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,890
required to to have that level of
Effectiveness and what do we understand

3636
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:27,900
Effectiveness and what do we understand
 

3637
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,990
Effectiveness and what do we understand
about it the safety of that kind of dust

3638
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,000
about it the safety of that kind of dust
 

3639
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,850
about it the safety of that kind of dust
so let me just say I'm not a medical

3640
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:31,860
so let me just say I'm not a medical
 

3641
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:35,990
so let me just say I'm not a medical
doctor I'm a biologist I'm on Ivermectin

uh in lieu of vaccination in terms of

3644
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:39,840
uh in lieu of vaccination in terms of
 

3645
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,350
uh in lieu of vaccination in terms of
dosage there is one reason for concern

3646
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:42,360
dosage there is one reason for concern
 

3647
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,570
dosage there is one reason for concern
which is that the most effective dose

which is that the most effective dose

and that that is because that is not a

it is possible that there is some

it is possible that there is some

long-term implication of being on it for

01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,950
being on it weekly for a long period of

3672
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:12,980
Corey told me yesterday
 

3673
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,290
Corey told me yesterday
that there are cases in which people

3674
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:15,300
that there are cases in which people
 

3675
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,470
that there are cases in which people
have made calculation errors and taken a

3676
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:18,480
have made calculation errors and taken a
 

3677
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,450
have made calculation errors and taken a
massive overdose of the drug and had no

3678
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:20,460
massive overdose of the drug and had no
 

3679
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,090
massive overdose of the drug and had no
ill effect so anyway there's lots of

3680
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:23,100
ill effect so anyway there's lots of
 

3681
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,110
ill effect so anyway there's lots of
reasons to think the drug is

3682
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:24,120
reasons to think the drug is
 

3683
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,610
reasons to think the drug is
comparatively safe but no drug is

3684
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:25,620
comparatively safe but no drug is
 

3685
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:26,810
comparatively safe but no drug is
perfectly safe

3686
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:26,820
perfectly safe
 

3687
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,490
perfectly safe
and I do worry about the long-term

3688
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:28,500
and I do worry about the long-term
 

3689
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,490
and I do worry about the long-term
implications of taking it I also think

3690
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:31,500
implications of taking it I also think
 

3691
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,649
implications of taking it I also think
it's very likely

3692
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:33,659
it's very likely
 

3693
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:34,370
it's very likely
um

3694
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:34,380
um
 

3695
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:39,290
um

01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:39,300
because the drug is administered in a
 

3697
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,450

the initial double dose that you take 48

the initial double dose that you take 48
 

3707

it is apparent that if the amount of

3710
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:53,940
it is apparent that if the amount of
 

3711
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:56,450
it is apparent that if the amount of
drug in your system is sufficient to be

3712
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:56,460
drug in your system is sufficient to be
 

3713
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,430
drug in your system is sufficient to be
protective at the end of the week then

3714
01:14:58,430 --> 01:14:58,440
protective at the end of the week then
 

3715
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,530
protective at the end of the week then
it was probably far too high at the

3716
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:00,540
it was probably far too high at the
 

3717
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,850
it was probably far too high at the
beginning of the week so there's a

3718
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:01,860
beginning of the week so there's a
 

3719
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,770
beginning of the week so there's a
question about whether or not you could

3720
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:03,780
question about whether or not you could
 

3721
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:07,310
question about whether or not you could
flatten out the intake so that you the

3722
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:07,320
flatten out the intake so that you the
 

3723
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,830
flatten out the intake so that you the
amount of ivermectin goes down

3724
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,840
amount of ivermectin goes down

and therefore the herd becomes immune
 

3845
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:52,790
and therefore the herd becomes immune
through vaccination and you decide not

through vaccination and you decide not
 

3847
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,130
through vaccination and you decide not
to take a vaccine then you benefit from

to take a vaccine then you benefit from

01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:55,860
is they kind of in a very casual way say
 

3953
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:59,870
is they kind of in a very casual way say
their job is simply to uh slow or

3954
01:19:59,870 --> 01:19:59,880
their job is simply to uh slow or
 

3955
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,649
their job is simply to uh slow or
prevent the spread of misinformation

3956
01:20:03,649 --> 01:20:03,659

 

3957
01:20:03,659 --> 01:20:05,510

and they say like that's an easy thing

3958
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:05,520
and they say like that's an easy thing
 

3959
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,770
and they say like that's an easy thing
to do

3960
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:06,780
to do
 

3961
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:09,709
to do
like to know what is true or not

3962
01:20:09,709 --> 01:20:09,719
like to know what is true or not
 

3963
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:12,890
like to know what is true or not
is an easy thing to do and so from the

3964
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:12,900
is an easy thing to do and so from the
 

3965
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,850
is an easy thing to do and so from the
YouTube perspective I think

3966
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:15,860
YouTube perspective I think
 

3967
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:18,950
YouTube perspective I think
they basically Outsource

3968
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:18,960

side comment that certain things become

4130
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:46,920
side comment that certain things become
 

4131
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,169
side comment that certain things become
viral

4132
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:48,179
viral
 

4133
01:23:48,179 --> 01:23:50,810
viral
irregardless of their truth

4134
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:50,820
irregardless of their truth
 

4135
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,030
irregardless of their truth
I I've noticed that things that are

4136
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
I I've noticed that things that are
 

4137
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,229
I I've noticed that things that are
dramatic

4138
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:54,239
dramatic
 

4139
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,930
dramatic
and or funny like things that become

4140
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:56,940
and or funny like things that become
 

4141
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:57,890
and or funny like things that become
memes

4142
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:57,900

4143
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,930

are not don't have to be grounded in

4144
01:23:59,930 --> 01:23:59,940
are not don't have to be grounded in
 

4145
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:02,930
are not don't have to be grounded in
truth and so that what worries me there

4146
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:02,940
truth and so that what worries me there
 

4147
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,770
truth and so that what worries me there
is that we basically

4148
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:05,780
is that we basically
 

4149
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:09,530
is that we basically
maximize for drama versus maximize for

4150
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:09,540
maximize for drama versus maximize for
 

4151
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,510
maximize for drama versus maximize for
truth in a system where everything is

4152
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:11,520
truth in a system where everything is
 

4153
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,750
truth in a system where everything is
free and that's worrying in the time of

4154
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:14,760
free and that's worrying in the time of
 

4155
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,129

emergency

4156
01:24:16,129 --> 01:24:16,139
emergency
 

4157
01:24:16,139 --> 01:24:18,530

well yes it's all worrying in time of

01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:18,540
well yes it's all worrying in time of
 

4159
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,750
well yes it's all worrying in time of
emergency to be sure but I want you to

notice that what you've happened on is

4162
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:22,620
notice that what you've happened on is
 

4163
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:24,649
notice that what you've happened on is
actually an analog for a much deeper and

to be created in the cultural space but
there's also a high tendency for it to

there's also a high tendency for it to
go extinct and you have to keep that in

01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:55,199
go extinct and you have to keep that in

everything is happening at a much higher

4242

everything is happening at a much higher
 

4243
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,530
everything is happening at a much higher
rate if things are being created they're

01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:00,540
rate if things are being created they're
 

4245
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:03,649
rate if things are being created they're
being destroyed and I can't say that you

4246
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:03,659
being destroyed and I can't say that you
 

4247
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:05,149
being destroyed and I can't say that you
know I mean obviously we've seen

01:26:05,149 --> 01:26:05,159
know I mean obviously we've seen

totalitarianism arise many times and
 

4251
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,550
totalitarianism arise many times and
it's very destructive each time it does

it's very destructive each time it does
 

4253
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,189
it's very destructive each time it does
so it's not like hey freedom to come up

4254
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:13,199
so it's not like hey freedom to come up
 

4255
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,770
so it's not like hey freedom to come up

with any idea you want hasn't produced a
whole lot of Carnage but the question is

4258
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:17,340
whole lot of Carnage but the question is
 

4259
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,470
whole lot of Carnage but the question is
over time

4260

over time
 

4261
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,950

4267
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:29,209

I don't know how strongly I believe that
 

4289
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:55,610
I don't know how strongly I believe that
it will work but I will say I haven't

4290
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:55,620
it will work but I will say I haven't
 

4291
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,070
it will work but I will say I haven't
heard a better idea

4292
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,080
heard a better idea
 

4293
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,110
heard a better idea
yeah

4294
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:00,120
yeah
 

4295
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,490
yeah
um I would also point out that there's

4296
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:01,500
um I would also point out that there's
 

4297
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,770
um I would also point out that there's
something very significant in this

4298
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:03,780
something very significant in this
 

4299
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:06,530
something very significant in this
question of the hubris involved in

4300
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:06,540
question of the hubris involved in
 

4301
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:08,390
question of the hubris involved in
imagining that you're going to improve

4302
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:08,400
imagining that you're going to improve
 

4303
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,450
imagining that you're going to improve
the discussion by censoring which is

4304
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:11,460
the discussion by censoring which is
 

4305
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:15,350
the discussion by censoring which is
the majority of Concepts at The Fringe

4306
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:15,360
the majority of Concepts at The Fringe
 

4307
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,050
the majority of Concepts at The Fringe
are nonsense

4308
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:18,060
are nonsense
 

4309
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:22,610
are nonsense
that's automatic but the heterodoxy at

4310
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:22,620
that's automatic but the heterodoxy at
 

4311
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,189
that's automatic but the heterodoxy at
The Fringe which is indistinguishable at

4312
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:25,199
The Fringe which is indistinguishable at
 

4313
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:28,370
The Fringe which is indistinguishable at
the beginning from the nonsense ideas is

4314
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:28,380
the beginning from the nonsense ideas is
 

4315
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:31,669
the beginning from the nonsense ideas is
the key to progress so if you decide hey

4316
01:27:31,669 --> 01:27:31,679
the key to progress so if you decide hey
 

4317
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,790
the key to progress so if you decide hey
The Fringe is 99 garbage let's just get

4318
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:34,800
The Fringe is 99 garbage let's just get
 

4319
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,770
The Fringe is 99 garbage let's just get
rid of it right hey that's a strong win

4320
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:36,780
rid of it right hey that's a strong win
 

4321
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:39,169
rid of it right hey that's a strong win
we're getting rid of 99 garbage for one

4322
01:27:39,169 --> 01:27:39,179
we're getting rid of 99 garbage for one
 

4323
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:41,090
we're getting rid of 99 garbage for one
percent something or other and the point

4324
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:41,100
percent something or other and the point
 

4325
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,350
percent something or other and the point
is yeah but that one percent something

4326
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:42,360
is yeah but that one percent something
 

4327
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,510
is yeah but that one percent something
rather is the key you're throwing out

4328
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:44,520
rather is the key you're throwing out
 

4329
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,149
rather is the key you're throwing out
the key and so that's what YouTube is

4330
01:27:47,149 --> 01:27:47,159
the key and so that's what YouTube is
 

4331

the key and so that's what YouTube is
doing

4332
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:48,239
doing
 

4333
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,090
doing
frankly I think at the point that it

4334
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:50,100
frankly I think at the point that it
 

4335
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,790
frankly I think at the point that it
started censoring my channel you know in

4336
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:52,800
started censoring my channel you know in
 

4337
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,830
started censoring my channel you know in
the immediate aftermath of this major

4338
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:54,840
the immediate aftermath of this major
 

4339
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,169
the immediate aftermath of this major
reversal of for lab leak it should have

4340
01:27:57,169 --> 01:27:57,179
reversal of for lab leak it should have
 

4341
01:27:57,179 --> 01:27:58,430
reversal of for lab leak it should have
looked at itself and said well what the

4342
01:27:58,430 --> 01:27:58,440
looked at itself and said well what the
 

4343
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,470
looked at itself and said well what the
hell are we doing who are we censoring

right
right in a conflict with the very same

if you're on YouTube was this basically

4358
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
if you're on YouTube was this basically
 

4359
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,550
if you're on YouTube was this basically
let all videos go that do not violate

4360
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:16,560
let all videos go that do not violate
 

4361
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,830
let all videos go that do not violate
the law well I should fix that okay I

4362
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:18,840
the law well I should fix that okay I
 

4363
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,570
the law well I should fix that okay I
believe that that is the basic principle

4364
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:20,580
believe that that is the basic principle
 

4365
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:23,030
believe that that is the basic principle
Eric makes an excellent point about the

4366
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,040
Eric makes an excellent point about the
 

4367
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,149
Eric makes an excellent point about the
distinction between ideas and personal

4368
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:26,159
distinction between ideas and personal
 

4369
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:28,850
distinction between ideas and personal
attacks doxing these other things so I

4370
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:28,860
attacks doxing these other things so I
 

4371
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,070
attacks doxing these other things so I
agree there's no value in allowing

4372
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:31,080
agree there's no value in allowing
 

4373
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:33,110
agree there's no value in allowing
people to destroy each other's lives

4374
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:33,120
people to destroy each other's lives
 

4375
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,629
people to destroy each other's lives
even if there's a technical uh legal

4376
01:28:35,629 --> 01:28:35,639
even if there's a technical uh legal
 

4377
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:37,790
even if there's a technical uh legal
defense for it now how you draw that

4378
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:37,800
defense for it now how you draw that
 

4379
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,790
defense for it now how you draw that
line I don't know but you know what I'm

4380
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:40,800
line I don't know but you know what I'm
 

4381
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,530
line I don't know but you know what I'm
talking about is yes people should be

4382
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:42,540
talking about is yes people should be
 

4383
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,450
talking about is yes people should be
free to traffic and bad ideas and they

4384
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:44,460
free to traffic and bad ideas and they
 

4385
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,189
free to traffic and bad ideas and they
should be free to expose that the ideas

4386
01:28:46,189 --> 01:28:46,199
should be free to expose that the ideas
 

4387
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:48,530
should be free to expose that the ideas
are bad and hopefully that process

4388
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:48,540
are bad and hopefully that process
 

4389
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,870
are bad and hopefully that process
results in better ideas winning out yeah

4390
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:50,880
results in better ideas winning out yeah
 

4391
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,090
results in better ideas winning out yeah
there's an interesting line between

4392
01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:53,100
there's an interesting line between
 

4393
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:56,270
there's an interesting line between
you know like uh ideas like the Earth is

4394
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:56,280
you know like uh ideas like the Earth is
 

4395
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:58,850
you know like uh ideas like the Earth is
flat which I believe you should not

4396
01:28:58,850 --> 01:28:58,860
flat which I believe you should not
 

4397
01:28:58,860 --> 01:28:59,870
flat which I believe you should not
censor

4398
01:28:59,870 --> 01:28:59,880
censor
 

4399
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,390
censor
and then like you start to encroach on

4400
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:02,400
and then like you start to encroach on
 

4401
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,689
and then like you start to encroach on
like personal attacks it's not not you

4402
01:29:05,689 --> 01:29:05,699
like personal attacks it's not not you
 

4403
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:07,310
like personal attacks it's not not you
know doxing yes but like not even

4404
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:07,320
know doxing yes but like not even
 

4405
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,050
know doxing yes but like not even
getting to that like there's a certain

4406
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:09,060
getting to that like there's a certain
 

4407
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,490
getting to that like there's a certain
point where it's like

4408
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:10,500
point where it's like
 

4409
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:15,290
point where it's like
that's no longer ideas that's more

4410
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:15,300

 

4411
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,450

that's somehow not productive even if

4412
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:17,460
that's somehow not productive even if
 

4413
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,330
that's somehow not productive even if
it's it feels like uh believing the

4414
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:20,340
it's it feels like uh believing the
 

4415
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:22,010
it's it feels like uh believing the
Earth is flat is somehow productive

4416
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:22,020
Earth is flat is somehow productive
 

4417
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:25,189
Earth is flat is somehow productive
because maybe this tiny percent chance

4418
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
because maybe this tiny percent chance
 

4419
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:28,310
because maybe this tiny percent chance
it is you know like it just feels like

4420
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:28,320
it is you know like it just feels like
 

4421
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,010
it is you know like it just feels like
personal attacks it doesn't

4422
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:31,020
personal attacks it doesn't
 

4423
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,590
personal attacks it doesn't
um well you know it's I'm torn on this

4424
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:33,600
um well you know it's I'm torn on this
 

4425
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,490
um well you know it's I'm torn on this
because

4426
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:34,500
because
 

4427
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,470
because
there's [\h__\h] in this world there's

4428
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:36,480
there's [\h__\h] in this world there's
 

4429
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,090
there's [\h__\h] in this world there's
fraudulent people in this world so

4430
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:38,100
fraudulent people in this world so
 

4431
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,950
fraudulent people in this world so
sometimes personal attacks are useful to

4432
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:39,960
sometimes personal attacks are useful to
 

4433
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,689
sometimes personal attacks are useful to
reveal that

4434
01:29:41,689 --> 01:29:41,699
reveal that
 

4435
01:29:41,699 --> 01:29:44,870
reveal that
um but there's a line you can cross like

4436
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:44,880
um but there's a line you can cross like
 

4437
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,149
um but there's a line you can cross like
there's a comedy where people make fun

4438
01:29:47,149 --> 01:29:47,159
there's a comedy where people make fun
 

4439
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:50,149
there's a comedy where people make fun
of others I think that's amazing that's

4440
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:50,159
of others I think that's amazing that's
 

4441
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:51,590
of others I think that's amazing that's
very powerful and that's very useful

4442
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:51,600
very powerful and that's very useful
 

4443
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,750
very powerful and that's very useful
even if it's painful but then there's

4444
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:53,760
even if it's painful but then there's
 

4445
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,810
even if it's painful but then there's
like once it gets to be

4446
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:56,820
like once it gets to be
 

4447
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,850
like once it gets to be
um yeah there's a certain line it's a

4448
01:29:58,850 --> 01:29:58,860
um yeah there's a certain line it's a
 

4449
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,830
um yeah there's a certain line it's a
gray area where you cross where it's no

4450
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:00,840
gray area where you cross where it's no
 

4451
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,390
gray area where you cross where it's no
longer in any possible World productive

4452
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:04,400
longer in any possible World productive
 

4453
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,970
longer in any possible World productive
and that's a really weird gray area for

4454
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:07,980
and that's a really weird gray area for
 

4455
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:09,950
and that's a really weird gray area for
YouTube to operate in and that feels

4456
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:09,960
YouTube to operate in and that feels
 

4457
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,229
YouTube to operate in and that feels
like should be a crowdsourced thing

4458
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:12,239
like should be a crowdsourced thing
 

4459
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,450
like should be a crowdsourced thing
where people vote on it but then again

4460
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:14,460
where people vote on it but then again
 

4461
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,970
where people vote on it but then again
do you trust the majority to vote on

4462
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:16,980
do you trust the majority to vote on
 

4463
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,430
do you trust the majority to vote on
what is crossing the line and not I mean

4464
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:19,440
what is crossing the line and not I mean
 

4465
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,930
what is crossing the line and not I mean
this is where

4466
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:20,940
this is where
 

4467
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,030
this is where
this is really interesting

4468
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,040
this is really interesting
 

4469
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,189
this is really interesting
on this particular like the scientific

4470
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:25,199
on this particular like the scientific
 

4471
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:27,050
on this particular like the scientific
aspect of this

4472
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:27,060
aspect of this
 

4473
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,990
aspect of this
do you think YouTube should take more of

4474
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:30,000
do you think YouTube should take more of
 

4475
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,470
do you think YouTube should take more of
a stance not censoring but

4476
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:33,480
a stance not censoring but
 

4477
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,290
a stance not censoring but
to actually have scientists within

4478
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:36,300
to actually have scientists within
 

4479
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,030
to actually have scientists within
YouTube having these kinds of

4480
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:38,040
YouTube having these kinds of
 

4481
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,370
YouTube having these kinds of
discussions and then be able to almost

4482
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:40,380
discussions and then be able to almost
 

4483
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:42,649
discussions and then be able to almost
speak out in a transparent way this is

4484
01:30:42,649 --> 01:30:42,659
speak out in a transparent way this is
 

4485
01:30:42,659 --> 01:30:44,530
speak out in a transparent way this is
what we're going to let this video stand

4486
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:44,540
what we're going to let this video stand
 

4487
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:46,990
what we're going to let this video stand
but here's all these other opinions

4488
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:47,000
but here's all these other opinions
 

4489
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,270
but here's all these other opinions
almost like take a more active role in

4490
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:50,280
almost like take a more active role in
 

4491
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,030
almost like take a more active role in
uh its recommendation system in trying

4492
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:53,040
uh its recommendation system in trying
 

4493
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,729
uh its recommendation system in trying
to present a full picture to you right

4494
01:30:55,729 --> 01:30:55,739
to present a full picture to you right
 

4495
01:30:55,739 --> 01:30:57,470
to present a full picture to you right
now they're not they're they're the

01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:57,480
now they're not they're they're the
 

4497
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,689
now they're not they're they're the
recommender systems are not human

4498
01:30:59,689 --> 01:30:59,699
recommender systems are not human

01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:02,810
recommender systems are not human
fine-tuned they're all based on how you

4500
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:02,820
fine-tuned they're all based on how you
 

4501
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:04,250
fine-tuned they're all based on how you
click and there's this clustering

4502
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:04,260
click and there's this clustering
 

4503
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,890

algorithms they're not taking an active

4504
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:06,900
algorithms they're not taking an active

4507
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,450

ideas in in the space of science they

4508
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:11,460
ideas in in the space of science they
 

4509
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:14,990
ideas in in the space of science they
just censor or not well at the moment

4510
01:31:14,990 --> 01:31:15,000
just censor or not well at the moment
 

4511
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,090
just censor or not well at the moment
it's going to be pretty hard to compel

4512
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:17,100
it's going to be pretty hard to compel
 

4513
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,950
it's going to be pretty hard to compel
me that these people should be trusted

4514
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:18,960
me that these people should be trusted
 

4515
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,030
me that these people should be trusted
with any sort of curation or comment on

4516
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:23,040
with any sort of curation or comment on
 

4517
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,550
with any sort of curation or comment on
matters of evidence because they have

4518
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:25,560
matters of evidence because they have
 

4519
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,050
matters of evidence because they have
demonstrated that they are incapable of

4520
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:27,060
demonstrated that they are incapable of
 

4521
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,729
demonstrated that they are incapable of
doing it well

4522
01:31:28,729 --> 01:31:28,739
doing it well
 

4523
01:31:28,739 --> 01:31:31,250
doing it well
um you could make such an argument and I

4524
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:31,260
um you could make such an argument and I
 

4525
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:33,050
um you could make such an argument and I
guess I'm open to the idea of

4526
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:33,060
guess I'm open to the idea of
 

4527
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,629
guess I'm open to the idea of
Institutions that would look something

4528
01:31:35,629 --> 01:31:35,639
Institutions that would look something
 

4529
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:37,430
Institutions that would look something
like YouTube that would be capable of

4530
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:37,440
like YouTube that would be capable of
 

4531
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,530
like YouTube that would be capable of
offering something valuable I mean and

4532
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:39,540
offering something valuable I mean and
 

4533
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,390
offering something valuable I mean and
you know even just the fact of them

4534
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:41,400
you know even just the fact of them
 

4535
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,189
you know even just the fact of them
literally curating things and putting

01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:45,600
some videos next to others you know
 

4539
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,830
some videos next to others you know
implies something so yeah there's a

4540
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:48,840
implies something so yeah there's a
 

4541
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,450
implies something so yeah there's a
question to be answered but at the

4542
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:50,460
question to be answered but at the
 

4543
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:53,270
question to be answered but at the
moment no at the moment what it is doing

4544
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,280
moment no at the moment what it is doing
 

4545
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,930
moment no at the moment what it is doing
is quite literally putting not only

4546
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:55,940
is quite literally putting not only
 

4547
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:59,209
is quite literally putting not only

by censoring discussion of useful tools

4550
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:01,800
by censoring discussion of useful tools
 

4551
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,430
by censoring discussion of useful tools
and making tools that are more hazardous

4552
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:04,440
and making tools that are more hazardous
 

4553
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,350
and making tools that are more hazardous
than has been acknowledged seem safe

4554
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:06,360
than has been acknowledged seem safe
 

4555
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:10,189
than has been acknowledged seem safe
right but it is also placing Humanity in

4556
01:32:10,189 --> 01:32:10,199
right but it is also placing Humanity in
 

4557
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:12,530
right but it is also placing Humanity in
danger of a permanent relationship with

01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:12,540
danger of a permanent relationship with

how expensive that is it's effectively

how expensive that is it's effectively
incalculable if the relationship becomes

that's all you're going to be presented

4711
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:19,609

01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:12,360
if intelligent people
 

4763
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:17,030
if intelligent people
in large amounts are open-minded and are

4764
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:17,040
in large amounts are open-minded and are
 

4765
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,550
in large amounts are open-minded and are
thinking through the the hazards and the

4766
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:19,560
thinking through the the hazards and the
 

4767
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:22,609
thinking through the the hazards and the
benefits of a vaccine a company should

01:36:22,609 --> 01:36:22,619
benefits of a vaccine a company should
 

4769
01:36:22,619 --> 01:36:25,250
benefits of a vaccine a company should
should find the best videos

4770
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:25,260
should find the best videos
 

4771
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,310
should find the best videos
to present uh what people are thinking

4772
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:28,320
to present uh what people are thinking
 

4773
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,750
to present uh what people are thinking
about well let's come up with a

4774
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:29,760
about well let's come up with a
 

4775
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,629
about well let's come up with a
hypothetical okay let's come up with a

4776
01:36:32,629 --> 01:36:32,639
hypothetical okay let's come up with a
 

4777
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:35,450
hypothetical okay let's come up with a
a very deadly disease for which there's

4778
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:35,460
a very deadly disease for which there's
 

4779
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:38,270
a very deadly disease for which there's
a vaccine that is very safe though not

4780
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:38,280
a vaccine that is very safe though not
 

4781
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:39,970
a vaccine that is very safe though not
perfectly safe

4782
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:39,980
perfectly safe
 

4783
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:42,890
perfectly safe
and we are then faced with YouTube

4784
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:42,900
and we are then faced with YouTube
 

4785
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,689
and we are then faced with YouTube
trying to figure out what to do for

4786
01:36:44,689 --> 01:36:44,699
trying to figure out what to do for
 

4787
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:47,209
trying to figure out what to do for
somebody searching on vaccine safety

4788
01:36:47,209 --> 01:36:47,219
somebody searching on vaccine safety
 

4789
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:49,790
somebody searching on vaccine safety
suppose it is necessary in order to

4790
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:49,800
suppose it is necessary in order to
 

4791
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,470
suppose it is necessary in order to
drive the pathogen to Extinction

4792
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:51,480
drive the pathogen to Extinction
 

4793
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,930
drive the pathogen to Extinction
something like smallpox that people get

4794
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:53,940
something like smallpox that people get
 

4795
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:57,169
something like smallpox that people get
on board with the vaccine

4796
01:36:57,169 --> 01:36:57,179

 

4797
01:36:57,179 --> 01:36:59,629

but there's a tiny Fringe of people who

4798
01:36:59,629 --> 01:36:59,639
but there's a tiny Fringe of people who
 

4799
01:36:59,639 --> 01:37:02,450
but there's a tiny Fringe of people who
thinks that the vaccine is a mind

4800
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:02,460
thinks that the vaccine is a mind
 

4801
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:04,550
thinks that the vaccine is a mind
control agent

4802
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:04,560
control agent
 

4803
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,030
control agent
right so should YouTube

4804
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:08,040
right so should YouTube
 

4805
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:11,689
right so should YouTube
direct people to the only claims against

4806
01:37:11,689 --> 01:37:11,699
direct people to the only claims against
 

4807
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:13,370
direct people to the only claims against
this vaccine which is that it's a mind

4808
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:13,380
this vaccine which is that it's a mind
 

4809
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:15,109
this vaccine which is that it's a mind
control agent

4810
01:37:15,109 --> 01:37:15,119
control agent
 

4811
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,350
control agent
when in fact

4812
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:17,360
when in fact
 

4813
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:20,030
when in fact
the vaccine is

4814
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:20,040
the vaccine is
 

4815
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,970
the vaccine is
very safe whatever that means if that

4816
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:22,980
very safe whatever that means if that
 

4817
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:24,890
very safe whatever that means if that
were the actual configuration of the

4818
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:24,900
were the actual configuration of the
 

4819
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,109
were the actual configuration of the
puzzle then YouTube would be doing

4820
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:27,119
puzzle then YouTube would be doing
 

4821
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:30,649
puzzle then YouTube would be doing
active harm pointing you to

4822
01:37:30,649 --> 01:37:30,659
active harm pointing you to
 

4823
01:37:30,659 --> 01:37:33,830
active harm pointing you to
um this other video potentially now yes

4824
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:33,840
um this other video potentially now yes

I would love to live in a world where

4826
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:35,400
I would love to live in a world where
 

4827
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,450
I would love to live in a world where
people are up to the challenge of

4828
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:38,460
people are up to the challenge of
 

4829
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:40,430
people are up to the challenge of
sorting that out but my basic point

4830
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:40,440
sorting that out but my basic point
 

4831
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,750
sorting that out but my basic point
would be

4832
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:41,760
would be
 

4833
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,970
would be
if it's an evidentiary question and

4834
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:43,980
if it's an evidentiary question and
 

4835
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:46,250
if it's an evidentiary question and
there is essentially no evidence that

4836
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:46,260
there is essentially no evidence that
 

4837
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:48,410
there is essentially no evidence that
the vaccine is a mind control agent and

4838
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:48,420
the vaccine is a mind control agent and
 

4839
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:49,550
the vaccine is a mind control agent and
there's plenty of evidence that the

4840
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:49,560
there's plenty of evidence that the
 

4841
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:52,370
there's plenty of evidence that the
vaccine is safe then well you look for

4842
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:52,380
vaccine is safe then well you look for
 

4843
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:53,570
vaccine is safe then well you look for
this video we're going to give you this

one puts it on a par right so for the

one puts it on a par right so for the

01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:05,460
control agent will result in

artificially elevating this now in the
 

4857
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,550
artificially elevating this now in the
current case what we've seen is not this

4858
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:10,560
current case what we've seen is not this
 

4859
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,209
current case what we've seen is not this
at all we have seen evidence obscured in

4860
01:38:14,209 --> 01:38:14,219
at all we have seen evidence obscured in
 

4861
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:16,850
at all we have seen evidence obscured in
order to create a false story about

4862
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:16,860
order to create a false story about
 

4863
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:20,570
order to create a false story about
safety and we saw the inverse with

4864
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:20,580
safety and we saw the inverse with
 

4865
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:24,350
safety and we saw the inverse with
Ivermectin we saw a campaign to portray

4866
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:24,360
Ivermectin we saw a campaign to portray
 

4867
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,750
Ivermectin we saw a campaign to portray
the drug as

4868
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:26,760
the drug as
 

4869
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,910
the drug as
more dangerous and less effective than

01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:28,920
more dangerous and less effective than
 

4871
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,910
more dangerous and less effective than
the evidence clearly suggested it was so

4872
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:31,920
the evidence clearly suggested it was so
 

4873
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,649
the evidence clearly suggested it was so
we're not talking about a comparable

4874
01:38:33,649 --> 01:38:33,659
we're not talking about a comparable
 

4875
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:35,209
we're not talking about a comparable
thing but I guess my point is the

4876
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:35,219
thing but I guess my point is the
 

4877
01:38:35,219 --> 01:38:37,990
thing but I guess my point is the
algorithmic solution that you point to

4878
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:38,000
algorithmic solution that you point to
 

4879
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,070
algorithmic solution that you point to
creates a problem of its own which is

4880
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
creates a problem of its own which is
 

4881
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,050
creates a problem of its own which is
that it means that the way to get

4882
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:42,060
that it means that the way to get
 

4883
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,750
that it means that the way to get
exposure is to generate something fringy

4884
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:44,760
exposure is to generate something fringy
 

4885
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,550
exposure is to generate something fringy
if you're the only thing on some Fringe

4886
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:46,560
if you're the only thing on some Fringe
 

4887
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,229
if you're the only thing on some Fringe
then suddenly YouTube would be

4888
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:48,239
then suddenly YouTube would be
 

4889
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:50,450
then suddenly YouTube would be
recommending those things and that's

4890
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:50,460
recommending those things and that's
 

4891
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:52,850
recommending those things and that's
that's obviously a gamable system at

4892
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:52,860
that's obviously a gamable system at
 

4893
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:55,189
that's obviously a gamable system at
best yeah but the solution to that I

4894
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199
best yeah but the solution to that I
 

4895
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:57,050
best yeah but the solution to that I
know you're you're creating a thought

4896
01:38:57,050 --> 01:38:57,060
know you're you're creating a thought
 

4897
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:58,910
know you're you're creating a thought
experiment maybe playing a little bit of

01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:00,600
a devil's advocate
 

4901
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,750
a devil's advocate
I think the solution to that is not to

01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:02,760
I think the solution to that is not to
 

4903
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,850
I think the solution to that is not to

like they're full of [\h__\h] and I know
they're brilliant why don't they look

01:39:58,910 --> 01:39:58,920
they're brilliant why don't they look
 

4951
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,129
they're brilliant why don't they look
more authentic so they're losing that

know right that's the distinction is

5040
01:41:44,030 --> 01:41:44,040
know right that's the distinction is
 

5041
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:46,609
know right that's the distinction is
flattering you you know playing to your

flattering you you know playing to your
blind spot is something that algorithm

5044
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:48,900
blind spot is something that algorithm
 

5045
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,689
blind spot is something that algorithm
will figure out but it's not healthy for

5046
01:41:50,689 --> 01:41:50,699
will figure out but it's not healthy for
 

5047
01:41:50,699 --> 01:41:52,970
will figure out but it's not healthy for
us all to have Google playing to our

01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:52,980
us all to have Google playing to our
 

5049
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:55,070
us all to have Google playing to our
blind spot it's very very dangerous so

5050
01:41:55,070 --> 01:41:55,080
blind spot it's very very dangerous so
 

5051
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:59,209
blind spot it's very very dangerous so
what I really want is analytics that

5052
01:41:59,209 --> 01:41:59,219
what I really want is analytics that
 

5053
01:41:59,219 --> 01:42:02,209
what I really want is analytics that
allow me or maybe options and analytics

5054
01:42:02,209 --> 01:42:02,219
allow me or maybe options and analytics
 

5055
01:42:02,219 --> 01:42:05,930
allow me or maybe options and analytics
the options should allow me to see what

5056
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:05,940
the options should allow me to see what
 

5057
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,910
the options should allow me to see what
alternative perspectives are being

alternative perspectives are being
 

5059
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,370
alternative perspectives are being
explored right so here's the thing I'm

5060
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:10,380
explored right so here's the thing I'm
 

5061
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:11,930
explored right so here's the thing I'm
searching and it leads me down this road

5062
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:11,940
searching and it leads me down this road
 

5063
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:13,609
searching and it leads me down this road
right let's let's say it's Ivermectin

5064
01:42:13,609 --> 01:42:13,619
right let's let's say it's Ivermectin
 

5065
01:42:13,619 --> 01:42:15,530
right let's let's say it's Ivermectin
okay I find all of this evidence that

5066
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:15,540
okay I find all of this evidence that
 

5067
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:17,149
okay I find all of this evidence that
Ivermectin works I find all of these

5068
01:42:17,149 --> 01:42:17,159
Ivermectin works I find all of these
 

5069
01:42:17,159 --> 01:42:18,410
Ivermectin works I find all of these
discussions and people talk about

5070
01:42:18,410 --> 01:42:18,420
discussions and people talk about
 

5071
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:20,810
discussions and people talk about
various protocols and this and that and

5072
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:20,820
various protocols and this and that and
 

5073
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:23,629
various protocols and this and that and
then I could say all right what is the

5074
01:42:23,629 --> 01:42:23,639
then I could say all right what is the

right you could dismiss it and then as

right you could dismiss it and then as
 

5117
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,689
right you could dismiss it and then as

you'd say wait a minute

you'd say wait a minute
there is evidence for plate tectonia as

01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:23,930
crazy as it sounds that the continents
are floating around on liquid actually

that's not so implausible you know we've

5132
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:26,400
that's not so implausible you know we've
 

5133
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,850
that's not so implausible you know we've
got these subduction zones we've got a

01:43:34,739 --> 01:43:36,709
together wow that's a surprising amount
of evidence for that position so I'm

5142
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:36,719
of evidence for that position so I'm
 

5143
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,750
of evidence for that position so I'm
going to file some Bayesian probability

going to file some Bayesian probability

going to file some Bayesian probability
with it that's updated for the fact that

01:43:40,619 --> 01:43:41,990
with it that's updated for the fact that
actually the Steel Man argument's better

5148
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:42,000
actually the Steel Man argument's better
 

5149
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,030
actually the Steel Man argument's better
than I was expecting right so I could

01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:54,109
solipsistic thing is too dangerous so
the search could be General so we would

you could hear what a good argument

you could hear what a good argument
 

5181
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:17,810
you could hear what a good argument
sounded right like rather than just hear

sounded right like rather than just hear
 

5183
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:19,910
sounded right like rather than just hear
a caricatured argument yeah and also

obvious idea and many of us know that we

um but let me just I wasn't kidding

5438
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:23,520
um but let me just I wasn't kidding
 

5439
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,609
um but let me just I wasn't kidding
about build the system in which your

01:49:25,609 --> 01:49:25,619
about build the system in which your

01:49:25,619 --> 01:49:28,790
about build the system in which your
idea is a great business plan

idea is a great business plan
um so in our upcoming book Heather and I

5444
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:31,860
um so in our upcoming book Heather and I
 

5445
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:33,290
um so in our upcoming book Heather and I
in our last chapter explore something

5446
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:33,300
in our last chapter explore something
 

5447
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,330
in our last chapter explore something
called the fourth Frontier and fourth

5448
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:35,340
called the fourth Frontier and fourth
 

5449
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:37,850
called the fourth Frontier and fourth
Frontier has to do with sort of a 2.0

5450
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:37,860
Frontier has to do with sort of a 2.0
 

5451
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:39,830
Frontier has to do with sort of a 2.0
version of civilization which we freely

5452
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:39,840
version of civilization which we freely
 

5453
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,350
version of civilization which we freely
admit we can't tell you very much about

5454
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:42,360
admit we can't tell you very much about
 

5455
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,209
admit we can't tell you very much about
it's something that would have to be we

5456
01:49:44,209 --> 01:49:44,219
it's something that would have to be we
 

5457
01:49:44,219 --> 01:49:45,830
it's something that would have to be we
would have to prototype our way there we

5458
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:45,840
would have to prototype our way there we
 

5459
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,330
would have to prototype our way there we
would have to effectively navigate our

5460
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:47,340
would have to effectively navigate our
 

5461
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:49,550
would have to effectively navigate our
way there but the result would be very

5462
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:49,560
way there but the result would be very
 

5463
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:51,290
way there but the result would be very
much like what you're describing it

5464
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:51,300
much like what you're describing it
 

5465
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:53,330
much like what you're describing it
would be something that effectively

5466
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:53,340
would be something that effectively
 

5467
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:57,350
would be something that effectively
liberates humans meaningfully and most

5468
01:49:57,350 --> 01:49:57,360
liberates humans meaningfully and most
 

5469
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,169
liberates humans meaningfully and most
importantly it has to feel like growth

5470
01:50:00,169 --> 01:50:00,179
importantly it has to feel like growth
 

5471
01:50:00,179 --> 01:50:02,570
importantly it has to feel like growth
without depending on growth in other

without depending on growth in other

we are looking for under exploited or

we are looking for under exploited or

unexploited opportunities and when we
find them our ancestors for example if

find them our ancestors for example if

would grow until it hit carrying
 

5491
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:24,109
would grow until it hit carrying

capacity so there would be this great
 

5493
01:50:24,119 --> 01:50:26,149

human tragedy when in the absence of
 

5517
01:50:50,099 --> 01:50:52,850
human tragedy when in the absence of
growth people do uh something that

5518
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:52,860
growth people do uh something that
 

5519
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:54,770
growth people do uh something that
causes their population to experience

causes their population to experience
 

5521
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:57,709
causes their population to experience
growth which is they go and make war on

last chapter the as well as well as all
the the previous one I have a few

5548
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:23,820
the the previous one I have a few
 

5549
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:26,750
the the previous one I have a few
questions on that so you you have um you

5550
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:26,760
questions on that so you you have um you
 

5551
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:29,750
questions on that so you you have um you
generally have faith to clarify that

5552
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:29,760
generally have faith to clarify that
 

5553
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:33,050
generally have faith to clarify that
technology could be the thing that

5554
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:33,060
technology could be the thing that
 

5555
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:36,169
technology could be the thing that
empowers this kind of future

5556
01:51:36,169 --> 01:51:36,179
empowers this kind of future
 

5557
01:51:36,179 --> 01:51:40,310
empowers this kind of future
well if you just let technology evolve

5558
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:40,320
well if you just let technology evolve
 

5559
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:44,030
well if you just let technology evolve
it's going to be our undoing right one

5560
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:44,040
it's going to be our undoing right one
 

5561
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,530
it's going to be our undoing right one
of the things that I

5562
01:51:45,530 --> 01:51:45,540
of the things that I
 

5563
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:48,589
of the things that I
um fault my libertarian friends for is

5564
01:51:48,589 --> 01:51:48,599
um fault my libertarian friends for is
 

5565
01:51:48,599 --> 01:51:50,450
um fault my libertarian friends for is
this faith that the market is going to

5566
01:51:50,450 --> 01:51:50,460
this faith that the market is going to
 

5567
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:52,850
this faith that the market is going to
find Solutions without destroying us and

5568
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:52,860
find Solutions without destroying us and
 

5569
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:55,129
find Solutions without destroying us and
my sense is I'm a very strong believer

5570
01:51:55,129 --> 01:51:55,139
my sense is I'm a very strong believer
 

5571
01:51:55,139 --> 01:51:57,050
my sense is I'm a very strong believer
in markets right I believe in their

5572
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:57,060
in markets right I believe in their
 

5573
01:51:57,060 --> 01:51:59,570
in markets right I believe in their
power even above some Market

5574
01:51:59,570 --> 01:51:59,580
power even above some Market
 

5575
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:01,189
power even above some Market
fundamentalists but what I don't believe

5576
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:01,199
fundamentalists but what I don't believe
 

5577
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:04,850
fundamentalists but what I don't believe
is that they should be allowed to plot

5578
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:04,860
is that they should be allowed to plot
 

5579
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:07,669
is that they should be allowed to plot
our course right markets are very good

5580
01:52:07,669 --> 01:52:07,679
our course right markets are very good
 

5581
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:10,310
our course right markets are very good
at figuring out how to do things they

5582
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:10,320
at figuring out how to do things they
 

5583
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,169
at figuring out how to do things they
are not good at all about figuring out

5584
01:52:12,169 --> 01:52:12,179
are not good at all about figuring out
 

5585
01:52:12,179 --> 01:52:14,149
are not good at all about figuring out
what we should do right what we should

5586
01:52:14,149 --> 01:52:14,159
what we should do right what we should
 

5587
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:16,430
what we should do right what we should
want we have to tell markets what we

5588
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:16,440
want we have to tell markets what we
 

5589
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,229
want we have to tell markets what we
want and then they can tell us how to do

5590
01:52:18,229 --> 01:52:18,239
want and then they can tell us how to do
 

5591
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:22,030
want and then they can tell us how to do
it best and if we adopted that kind of

5592
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:22,040
it best and if we adopted that kind of
 

5593
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:25,010
it best and if we adopted that kind of
pro-market but in a context where it's

5594
01:52:25,010 --> 01:52:25,020
pro-market but in a context where it's
 

5595
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:27,229
pro-market but in a context where it's
not steering where human well-being is

5596
01:52:27,229 --> 01:52:27,239
not steering where human well-being is
 

5597
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:28,729
not steering where human well-being is
actually the driver

5598
01:52:28,729 --> 01:52:28,739
actually the driver
 

5599
01:52:28,739 --> 01:52:31,430
actually the driver
we can do remarkable things and the

5600
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:31,440
we can do remarkable things and the
 

5601
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,050
we can do remarkable things and the
technology that emerges would naturally

5602
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:33,060
technology that emerges would naturally
 

5603
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:35,330
technology that emerges would naturally
be enhancing of human well-being

5604
01:52:35,330 --> 01:52:35,340
be enhancing of human well-being
 

5605
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:38,330
be enhancing of human well-being
perfectly so no but overwhelmingly so

5606
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:38,340
perfectly so no but overwhelmingly so
 

5607
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,970
perfectly so no but overwhelmingly so
but at the moment markets are finding

5608
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:40,980
but at the moment markets are finding
 

5609
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:42,950
but at the moment markets are finding
our every defective character and

5610
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:42,960
our every defective character and
 

5611
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,990
our every defective character and
exploiting them and making huge profits

5612
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:45,000
exploiting them and making huge profits
 

5613
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,629
exploiting them and making huge profits
and making us worse to each other in the

5614
01:52:47,629 --> 01:52:47,639
and making us worse to each other in the
 

5615
01:52:47,639 --> 01:52:49,609
and making us worse to each other in the
process

5616
01:52:49,609 --> 01:52:49,619
process
 

5617
01:52:49,619 --> 01:52:53,689
process
before we leave covid-19 let me

5618
01:52:53,689 --> 01:52:53,699
before we leave covid-19 let me
 

5619
01:52:53,699 --> 01:52:57,649
before we leave covid-19 let me
ask you about a very difficult topic

5620
01:52:57,649 --> 01:52:57,659
ask you about a very difficult topic
 

5621
01:52:57,659 --> 01:52:59,629
ask you about a very difficult topic
which is the vaccines

5622
01:52:59,629 --> 01:52:59,639
which is the vaccines
 

5623
01:52:59,639 --> 01:53:00,290
which is the vaccines
um

5624
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:00,300
um
 

5625
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:03,169
um
so I took the Pfizer vaccine the two

5626
01:53:03,169 --> 01:53:03,179
so I took the Pfizer vaccine the two
 

5627
01:53:03,179 --> 01:53:05,149
so I took the Pfizer vaccine the two
shots

5628
01:53:05,149 --> 01:53:05,159
shots
 

5629
01:53:05,159 --> 01:53:06,950
shots
you did not

5630
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:06,960
you did not
 

5631
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,370
you did not
you have been taking

5632
01:53:09,370 --> 01:53:09,380
you have been taking
 

5633
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:12,410
you have been taking
Ivermectin yep

5634
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:12,420
Ivermectin yep
 

5635
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:16,129
Ivermectin yep
so one of the arguments against the

5636
01:53:16,129 --> 01:53:16,139
so one of the arguments against the
 

5637
01:53:16,139 --> 01:53:19,310
so one of the arguments against the
discussion of ivermectin is that

5638
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:19,320
discussion of ivermectin is that
 

5639
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:23,089
discussion of ivermectin is that
it prevents people from being fully

5640
01:53:23,089 --> 01:53:23,099
it prevents people from being fully
 

5641
01:53:23,099 --> 01:53:24,890
it prevents people from being fully
willing to get the vaccine

5642
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:24,900
willing to get the vaccine
 

5643
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:27,609
willing to get the vaccine
how would you compare Ivermectin

5644
01:53:27,609 --> 01:53:27,619
how would you compare Ivermectin
 

5645
01:53:27,619 --> 01:53:31,550
how would you compare Ivermectin
and the vaccine for coven 19.

5646
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:31,560
and the vaccine for coven 19.
 

5647
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,830
and the vaccine for coven 19.
all right that's a good question I would

5648
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:33,840
all right that's a good question I would
 

5649
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,810
all right that's a good question I would
say first of all there are some hazards

5650
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:35,820
say first of all there are some hazards
 

5651
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:37,970
say first of all there are some hazards
with the vaccine that people need to be

5652
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:37,980
with the vaccine that people need to be
 

5653
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:39,770
with the vaccine that people need to be
aware of there are some things that we

5654
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:39,780
aware of there are some things that we
 

5655
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:42,649
aware of there are some things that we
cannot rule out and for which

5656
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:42,659
cannot rule out and for which
 

5657
01:53:42,659 --> 01:53:45,050
cannot rule out and for which
there is some evidence the two that I

5658
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:45,060
there is some evidence the two that I
 

5659
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:47,930
there is some evidence the two that I
think people should be tracking is the

5660
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:47,940
think people should be tracking is the
 

5661
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:50,510
think people should be tracking is the
possibility some would say a likelihood

5662
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:50,520
possibility some would say a likelihood
 

5663
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:53,510
possibility some would say a likelihood
that a vaccine of this nature

5664
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:53,520
that a vaccine of this nature
 

5665
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:56,689
that a vaccine of this nature
that is to say very narrowly focused on

5666
01:53:56,689 --> 01:53:56,699
that is to say very narrowly focused on
 

5667
01:53:56,699 --> 01:53:58,930
that is to say very narrowly focused on
a single antigen

5668
01:53:58,930 --> 01:53:58,940
a single antigen
 

5669
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:02,930
a single antigen
is a an evolutionary pressure that will

5670
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:02,940
is a an evolutionary pressure that will
 

5671
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:05,450
is a an evolutionary pressure that will
drive the emergence of variants that

5672
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:05,460
drive the emergence of variants that
 

5673
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:07,189
drive the emergence of variants that
will escape the protection that comes

5674
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:07,199
will escape the protection that comes
 

5675
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:08,629
will escape the protection that comes
from the vaccine

5676
01:54:08,629 --> 01:54:08,639
from the vaccine
 

5677
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,510
from the vaccine
so this is a hazard

5678
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:11,520
so this is a hazard
 

5679
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,729
so this is a hazard
it is a particular hazard in light of

5680
01:54:13,729 --> 01:54:13,739
it is a particular hazard in light of
 

5681
01:54:13,739 --> 01:54:16,129
it is a particular hazard in light of
the fact that these vaccines have a

5682
01:54:16,129 --> 01:54:16,139
the fact that these vaccines have a
 

5683
01:54:16,139 --> 01:54:18,890
the fact that these vaccines have a
substantial number of breakthrough cases

5684
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:18,900
substantial number of breakthrough cases
 

5685
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:21,350
substantial number of breakthrough cases
so one danger is that a person who has

5686
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:21,360
so one danger is that a person who has
 

5687
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,050
so one danger is that a person who has
been vaccinated will shed viruses that

5688
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:24,060
been vaccinated will shed viruses that
 

5689
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:26,390
been vaccinated will shed viruses that
are specifically

5690
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:26,400
are specifically
 

5691
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,030
are specifically
um less visible or invisible to the

5692
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:29,040
um less visible or invisible to the
 

5693
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,250
um less visible or invisible to the
immunity created by the vaccines

5694
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:31,260
immunity created by the vaccines
 

5695
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:34,250
immunity created by the vaccines
so we may be creating the next pandemic

5696
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:34,260
so we may be creating the next pandemic
 

5697
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:37,729
so we may be creating the next pandemic
by applying the pressure of vaccines at

5698
01:54:37,729 --> 01:54:37,739
by applying the pressure of vaccines at
 

5699
01:54:37,739 --> 01:54:40,669
by applying the pressure of vaccines at
a point that it doesn't make sense to

5700
01:54:40,669 --> 01:54:40,679
a point that it doesn't make sense to
 

5701
01:54:40,679 --> 01:54:42,109
a point that it doesn't make sense to
um the other danger has to do with

5702
01:54:42,109 --> 01:54:42,119
um the other danger has to do with
 

5703
01:54:42,119 --> 01:54:43,790
um the other danger has to do with
something called antibody dependent

5704
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:43,800
something called antibody dependent
 

5705
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,109
something called antibody dependent
enhancement

5706
01:54:45,109 --> 01:54:45,119
enhancement
 

5707
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:46,550
enhancement
which is something that we see in

5708
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:46,560
which is something that we see in
 

5709
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:49,070
which is something that we see in
certain diseases like Dengue Fever you

5710
01:54:49,070 --> 01:54:49,080
certain diseases like Dengue Fever you
 

5711
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,950
certain diseases like Dengue Fever you
may know that Dengue one gets a case and

5712
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:51,960
may know that Dengue one gets a case and
 

5713
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,510
may know that Dengue one gets a case and
then their second case is much more

5714
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:53,520
then their second case is much more
 

5715
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,270
then their second case is much more
devastating so break bone fever is when

5716
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:56,280
devastating so break bone fever is when
 

5717
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:58,550
devastating so break bone fever is when
you get your second case of dengue and

5718
01:54:58,550 --> 01:54:58,560
you get your second case of dengue and
 

5719
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:01,370
you get your second case of dengue and
Dengue effectively utilizes the immune

5720
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:01,380
Dengue effectively utilizes the immune
 

5721
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:03,410
Dengue effectively utilizes the immune
response that is produced by prior

5722
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:03,420
response that is produced by prior
 

5723
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:06,229
response that is produced by prior
exposure to attack the body in ways that

5724
01:55:06,229 --> 01:55:06,239
exposure to attack the body in ways that
 

5725
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,689
exposure to attack the body in ways that
it is incapable of doing before exposure

5726
01:55:08,689 --> 01:55:08,699
it is incapable of doing before exposure
 

5727
01:55:08,699 --> 01:55:11,209
it is incapable of doing before exposure
so this is apparently this pattern has

5728
01:55:11,209 --> 01:55:11,219
so this is apparently this pattern has
 

5729
01:55:11,219 --> 01:55:14,169
so this is apparently this pattern has
apparently blocked past efforts to make

5730
01:55:14,169 --> 01:55:14,179
apparently blocked past efforts to make
 

5731
01:55:14,179 --> 01:55:17,270
apparently blocked past efforts to make
vaccines against coronaviruses

5732
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:17,280
vaccines against coronaviruses
 

5733
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,729

whether it will happen here or not it is

5734
01:55:19,729 --> 01:55:19,739
whether it will happen here or not it is
 

5735
01:55:19,739 --> 01:55:21,290
whether it will happen here or not it is
still too early to say but before we

5736
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:21,300
still too early to say but before we
 

5737
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:24,109
still too early to say but before we
even get to the question of harm done to

5738
01:55:24,109 --> 01:55:24,119
even get to the question of harm done to
 

5739
01:55:24,119 --> 01:55:27,470
even get to the question of harm done to
individuals by these vaccines we have to

5740
01:55:27,470 --> 01:55:27,480
individuals by these vaccines we have to
 

5741
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:29,270
individuals by these vaccines we have to
ask about what the overall impact is

5742
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:29,280
ask about what the overall impact is
 

5743
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,310
ask about what the overall impact is
going to be and it's not clear in the

5744
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:31,320
going to be and it's not clear in the
 

5745
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,750
going to be and it's not clear in the
way people think it is that if we

5746
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:32,760
way people think it is that if we
 

5747
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,550
way people think it is that if we
vaccinate enough people the pandemic

5748
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:34,560
vaccinate enough people the pandemic
 

5749
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,770
vaccinate enough people the pandemic
will end it could be that we vaccinate

5750
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:36,780
will end it could be that we vaccinate
 

5751
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:39,109
will end it could be that we vaccinate
people and make the pandemic worse and

5752
01:55:39,109 --> 01:55:39,119
people and make the pandemic worse and
 

5753
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:40,790
people and make the pandemic worse and
while nobody can say for sure that

5754
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:40,800
while nobody can say for sure that
 

5755
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,770
while nobody can say for sure that
that's where we're headed it is at least

5756
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:42,780
that's where we're headed it is at least
 

5757
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:44,689
that's where we're headed it is at least
something to be aware of so don't

5758
01:55:44,689 --> 01:55:44,699
something to be aware of so don't
 

5759
01:55:44,699 --> 01:55:47,390
something to be aware of so don't
vaccines usually create that kind of uh

5760
01:55:47,390 --> 01:55:47,400
vaccines usually create that kind of uh
 

5761
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:51,050
vaccines usually create that kind of uh
evolutionary pressure to create deadlier

5762
01:55:51,050 --> 01:55:51,060
evolutionary pressure to create deadlier
 

5763
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:53,629
evolutionary pressure to create deadlier
different strains of the virus

different strains of the virus
 

5765
01:55:53,639 --> 01:55:56,149
different strains of the virus
so isn't so is there something

5766
01:55:56,149 --> 01:55:56,159
so isn't so is there something
 

5767
01:55:56,159 --> 01:55:58,669
so isn't so is there something
particular with these mRNA vaccines

5768
01:55:58,669 --> 01:55:58,679
particular with these mRNA vaccines
 

5769
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:01,070
particular with these mRNA vaccines
that's uniquely dangerous in this regard

5770
01:56:01,070 --> 01:56:01,080
that's uniquely dangerous in this regard
 

5771
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,930
that's uniquely dangerous in this regard
well it's not even just the MRNA

5772
01:56:02,930 --> 01:56:02,940
well it's not even just the MRNA
 

5773
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:05,089
well it's not even just the MRNA
vaccines the MRNA vaccines and the

5774
01:56:05,089 --> 01:56:05,099
vaccines the MRNA vaccines and the
 

5775
01:56:05,099 --> 01:56:08,149
vaccines the MRNA vaccines and the
adenovector DNA vaccine all share the

5776
01:56:08,149 --> 01:56:08,159
adenovector DNA vaccine all share the
 

5777
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:10,070
adenovector DNA vaccine all share the
same vulnerability which is they are

5778
01:56:10,070 --> 01:56:10,080
same vulnerability which is they are
 

5779
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,589
same vulnerability which is they are
very narrowly focused on one subunit of

5780
01:56:12,589 --> 01:56:12,599
very narrowly focused on one subunit of
 

5781
01:56:12,599 --> 01:56:14,089
very narrowly focused on one subunit of
the spike protein

5782
01:56:14,089 --> 01:56:14,099
the spike protein
 

5783
01:56:14,099 --> 01:56:16,129
the spike protein
so that is a very concentrated

5784
01:56:16,129 --> 01:56:16,139
so that is a very concentrated
 

5785
01:56:16,139 --> 01:56:18,050
so that is a very concentrated
evolutionary signal

5786
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:18,060
evolutionary signal
 

5787
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:20,750
evolutionary signal
we are also deploying it in mid pandemic

5788
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:20,760
we are also deploying it in mid pandemic
 

5789
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,850
we are also deploying it in mid pandemic
and it takes time for immunity to

5790
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:22,860
and it takes time for immunity to
 

5791
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:26,030
and it takes time for immunity to
develop so part of the problem here if

5792
01:56:26,030 --> 01:56:26,040
develop so part of the problem here if
 

5793
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:27,850
develop so part of the problem here if
you if you inoculated a population

5794
01:56:27,850 --> 01:56:27,860
you if you inoculated a population
 

5795
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:31,550
you if you inoculated a population
before encounter with a pathogen then

5796
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:31,560
before encounter with a pathogen then
 

5797
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:33,109
before encounter with a pathogen then
there might be substantially enough

5798
01:56:33,109 --> 01:56:33,119
there might be substantially enough
 

5799
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:36,530
there might be substantially enough
immunity to prevent this phenomenon from

5800
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:36,540
immunity to prevent this phenomenon from
 

5801
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:38,810
immunity to prevent this phenomenon from
happening but in this case

5802
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:38,820
happening but in this case
 

5803
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:41,149
happening but in this case
we are inoculating people as they are

5804
01:56:41,149 --> 01:56:41,159
we are inoculating people as they are
 

5805
01:56:41,159 --> 01:56:43,370
we are inoculating people as they are
encountering those who are sick with the

5806
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:43,380
encountering those who are sick with the
 

5807
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:45,530
encountering those who are sick with the
disease and what that means is the

5808
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:45,540
disease and what that means is the
 

5809
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,990
disease and what that means is the
disease is now faced with a lot of

5810
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:48,000
disease is now faced with a lot of
 

5811
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,490
disease is now faced with a lot of
opportunities to effectively

01:56:49,490 --> 01:56:49,500
opportunities to effectively
 

5813
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,109
opportunities to effectively
evolutionarily practice Escape

5814
01:56:51,109 --> 01:56:51,119
evolutionarily practice Escape
 

5815
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:54,470
evolutionarily practice Escape
strategies so one thing is the timing

5816
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:54,480
strategies so one thing is the timing
 

5817
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,050
strategies so one thing is the timing
the other thing is the narrow Focus now

5818
01:56:57,050 --> 01:56:57,060
the other thing is the narrow Focus now
 

5819
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:58,790
the other thing is the narrow Focus now
in a traditional vaccine you would

5820
01:56:58,790 --> 01:56:58,800
in a traditional vaccine you would
 

5821
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,490
in a traditional vaccine you would
typically not have one antigen right you

5822
01:57:01,490 --> 01:57:01,500
typically not have one antigen right you
 

5823
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,589
typically not have one antigen right you
would have basically a virus full of

5824
01:57:03,589 --> 01:57:03,599
would have basically a virus full of
 

5825
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:05,810
would have basically a virus full of
antigens and the immune system would

5826
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:05,820
antigens and the immune system would
 

5827
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:08,570
antigens and the immune system would
therefore produce a broader response so

5828
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:08,580
therefore produce a broader response so
 

5829
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:10,910
therefore produce a broader response so
that is the case for people who have had

5830
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:10,920
that is the case for people who have had
 

5831
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,950
that is the case for people who have had
covet right they have an immunity that

5832
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:12,960
covet right they have an immunity that
 

5833
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,870
covet right they have an immunity that
is broader because it wasn't so focused

5834
01:57:14,870 --> 01:57:14,880
is broader because it wasn't so focused
 

5835
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,970
is broader because it wasn't so focused
on one part of the spike protein

5836
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:16,980
on one part of the spike protein
 

5837
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:18,890
on one part of the spike protein
so anyway there is something unique here

5838
01:57:18,890 --> 01:57:18,900
so anyway there is something unique here
 

5839
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:21,470
so anyway there is something unique here
so these platforms create that special

5840
01:57:21,470 --> 01:57:21,480
so these platforms create that special
 

5841
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:24,050
so these platforms create that special
Hazard they also have components that we

5842
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:24,060
Hazard they also have components that we
 

5843
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:26,450
Hazard they also have components that we
haven't used before in people so for

5844
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:26,460
haven't used before in people so for
 

5845
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:28,490
haven't used before in people so for
example the lipid nanoparticles that

5846
01:57:28,490 --> 01:57:28,500
example the lipid nanoparticles that
 

5847
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,970
example the lipid nanoparticles that
coat the rnas are Distributing

5848
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:31,980
coat the rnas are Distributing
 

5849
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,310
coat the rnas are Distributing
themselves around the body in a way that

5850
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:34,320
themselves around the body in a way that
 

5851
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,370
themselves around the body in a way that
will have unknown consequences

5852
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:37,380
will have unknown consequences
 

5853
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:38,810
will have unknown consequences
um so anyway there's there's reason

5854
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:38,820
um so anyway there's there's reason
 

5855
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:41,870
um so anyway there's there's reason
reason for concern is it possible for

5856
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:41,880
reason for concern is it possible for
 

5857
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:43,550
reason for concern is it possible for
you to steal men

5858
01:57:43,550 --> 01:57:43,560
you to steal men
 

5859
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:46,430
you to steal men
the argument that everybody should get

5860
01:57:46,430 --> 01:57:46,440
the argument that everybody should get
 

5861
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:47,930
the argument that everybody should get
vaccinated

5862
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:47,940
vaccinated
 

5863
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:49,910
vaccinated
of course the argument that everybody

5864
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:49,920
of course the argument that everybody
 

5865
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,149
of course the argument that everybody
should get vaccinated is that nothing is

5866
01:57:53,149 --> 01:57:53,159

the population is vaccinated from the
 

5905
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,510
the population is vaccinated from the

they're not vaccinated and with the

they're not vaccinated and with the

vaccine as acryl is being deployed that
 

5911
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:51,129

disagree with that but the the scenario

5934
01:59:14,450 --> 01:59:14,460
disagree with that but the the scenario
 

5935
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:16,070
disagree with that but the the scenario
we're most likely to see not that the

we're most likely to see not that the

5941
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:22,910

first of all I don't believe that the

5942
01:59:22,910 --> 01:59:22,920
first of all I don't believe that the
 

5943
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:25,070
first of all I don't believe that the
probability of creating a worse pandemic

5944
01:59:25,070 --> 01:59:25,080
probability of creating a worse pandemic
 

5945
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:28,010
probability of creating a worse pandemic
is low enough to Discount I think the

5946
01:59:28,010 --> 01:59:28,020
is low enough to Discount I think the
 

5947
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:29,990
is low enough to Discount I think the
probability is fairly high and frankly

5948
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,000
probability is fairly high and frankly
 

5949
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,990
probability is fairly high and frankly
we are seeing a wave of variance that um

5950
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:35,000
we are seeing a wave of variance that um
 

5951
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,490
we are seeing a wave of variance that um
we will have to do a careful analysis to

5952
01:59:37,490 --> 01:59:37,500
we will have to do a careful analysis to
 

5953
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,109
we will have to do a careful analysis to
figure out what exactly that has to do

5954
01:59:39,109 --> 01:59:39,119
figure out what exactly that has to do
 

5955
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:41,209
figure out what exactly that has to do
with campaigns of vaccination where they

5956
01:59:41,209 --> 01:59:41,219
with campaigns of vaccination where they
 

5957
01:59:41,219 --> 01:59:42,709
with campaigns of vaccination where they
have been where they haven't been where

01:59:42,709 --> 01:59:42,719
have been where they haven't been where
 

5959
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:44,450
have been where they haven't been where
the variants emerged from but I believe

5960
01:59:44,450 --> 01:59:44,460
the variants emerged from but I believe
 

5961
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:46,310
the variants emerged from but I believe
that what we are seeing is a disturbing

5962
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:46,320
that what we are seeing is a disturbing
 

5963
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:49,070
that what we are seeing is a disturbing
pattern that reflects that uh those who

01:59:49,070 --> 01:59:49,080
pattern that reflects that uh those who
 

5965
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:51,589

of like HTML and like web design
 

6001
02:00:29,239 --> 02:00:32,930

like it's like the worst website it
 

6003
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:35,030

makes it so unpleasant to report it

02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:35,040
makes it so unpleasant to report it
 

6005
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:36,290
makes it so unpleasant to report it
makes it so unclear what you're

serious effect like if you have very

serious effect like if you have very
 

6011
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:42,410
serious effect like if you have very
mild effects what are the incentives for

02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:42,420
mild effects what are the incentives for
 

6013
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:44,870

you to even use that crappy website with

you to even use that crappy website with

what vaccine coupled with the adverse

02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,189
what vaccine coupled with the adverse
effects all of that we should be

6036
02:01:10,189 --> 02:01:10,199
effects all of that we should be
 

6037
02:01:10,199 --> 02:01:12,649
effects all of that we should be
collecting instead we're completely not

we're doing it in a crappy way and using

02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:15,840
we're doing it in a crappy way and using
 

6041
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,689
we're doing it in a crappy way and using
that crappy data to make conclusions

02:01:17,689 --> 02:01:17,699
that crappy data to make conclusions
 

6043
02:01:17,699 --> 02:01:20,270
that crappy data to make conclusions
that you then twist you're basically

6044
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:20,280
that you then twist you're basically
 

6045
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:24,050
that you then twist you're basically
collecting in a way that can uh arrive

6046
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:24,060
collecting in a way that can uh arrive
 

6047
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:26,149
collecting in a way that can uh arrive
at whatever conclusions you what and the

6048
02:01:26,149 --> 02:01:26,159
at whatever conclusions you what and the
 

6049
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:28,430
at whatever conclusions you what and the
data is being collected by the

02:01:28,430 --> 02:01:28,440
data is being collected by the
 

6051
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:30,890
data is being collected by the

6053
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:32,750

therefore it's obviously they're going

therefore it's obviously they're going
 

6055
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,310
therefore it's obviously they're going
to try to construct any kind of

02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:34,320
to try to construct any kind of
 

6057
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,109
to try to construct any kind of

yeah uh I'm gonna pick up on your rant

6074
02:01:54,770 --> 02:01:54,780
yeah uh I'm gonna pick up on your rant
 

6075
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:58,970
yeah uh I'm gonna pick up on your rant
and say we estimates of the degree of

Under reporting invers are uh that it is
 

6079
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:08,229
Under reporting invers are uh that it is
10 of the real

is the system for reporting Adverse
 

6083
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,229
is the system for reporting Adverse

6084
02:02:12,229 --> 02:02:12,239
Events so
 

6085
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:14,330
Events so
um in the U.S we have

6086
02:02:14,330 --> 02:02:14,340
um in the U.S we have
 

6087
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:16,129
um in the U.S we have
above 5

6088
02:02:16,129 --> 02:02:16,139
above 5

that is an undercount almost certainly

that is an undercount almost certainly
 

6095
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:27,770
that is an undercount almost certainly

and by uh a large Factor
 

6097
02:02:27,780 --> 02:02:29,450
and by uh a large Factor
we don't know how large I've seen

6103
02:02:35,699 --> 02:02:38,330
000 dead in the us alone now you can
make the argument that okay that's a

02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:38,340
make the argument that okay that's a
 

6105
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:41,570
make the argument that okay that's a
large number but the necessity of

02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:41,580
large number but the necessity of

far as cov2 to Extinction is such that

6110
02:02:46,669 --> 02:02:46,679
far as cov2 to Extinction is such that
 

6111
02:02:46,679 --> 02:02:48,470
far as cov2 to Extinction is such that
it's an acceptable number but I would

6112
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,480
it's an acceptable number but I would
 

6113
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:50,149
it's an acceptable number but I would
point out that that actually does not

6114
02:02:50,149 --> 02:02:50,159
point out that that actually does not
 

6115
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:51,830
point out that that actually does not
make any sense and the reason it doesn't

6116
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:51,840
make any sense and the reason it doesn't
 

6117
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,689
make any sense and the reason it doesn't
make any sense is actually there's

6118
02:02:53,689 --> 02:02:53,699
make any sense is actually there's
 

6119
02:02:53,699 --> 02:02:55,250
make any sense is actually there's
several reasons one

6120
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:55,260
several reasons one
 

6121
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:58,310
several reasons one
if that was really your point that yes

6122
02:02:58,310 --> 02:02:58,320
if that was really your point that yes
 

6123
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,290
if that was really your point that yes
many many people are going to die but

6124
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:00,300
many many people are going to die but
 

6125
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:03,050
many many people are going to die but
many more will die if we don't do this

6126
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:03,060
many more will die if we don't do this
 

6127
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:05,870
many more will die if we don't do this
um were that your approach you would not

6128
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:05,880
um were that your approach you would not
 

6129
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:07,850
um were that your approach you would not
be inoculating people who had had

6130
02:03:07,850 --> 02:03:07,860
be inoculating people who had had
 

6131
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:10,010
be inoculating people who had had
covid-19 which is a large population

6132
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:10,020
covid-19 which is a large population
 

6133
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:12,649
covid-19 which is a large population
there's no reason to expose those people

6134
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:12,659
there's no reason to expose those people
 

6135
02:03:12,659 --> 02:03:14,930
there's no reason to expose those people
to Danger their risk of Adverse Events

6136
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:14,940
to Danger their risk of Adverse Events
 

6137
02:03:14,940 --> 02:03:17,270
to Danger their risk of Adverse Events
in the case that they have them is

6138
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:17,280
in the case that they have them is
 

6139
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,970
in the case that they have them is
greater so there's no reason that we

6140
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:19,980
greater so there's no reason that we
 

6141
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:21,770
greater so there's no reason that we
would be allowing those people to face a

6142
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:21,780
would be allowing those people to face a
 

6143
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:23,390
would be allowing those people to face a
risk of death if this was really about

6144
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:23,400
risk of death if this was really about
 

6145
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:26,270
risk of death if this was really about
an acceptable number of deaths arising

6146
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:26,280
an acceptable number of deaths arising
 

6147
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:29,030
an acceptable number of deaths arising
out of this the set of vaccines

6148
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:29,040
out of this the set of vaccines
 

6149
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:31,250
out of this the set of vaccines
I would also point out there's something

6150
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:31,260
I would also point out there's something
 

6151
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:34,310
I would also point out there's something
incredibly bizarre and I would I

6152
02:03:34,310 --> 02:03:34,320
incredibly bizarre and I would I
 

6153
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:36,770
incredibly bizarre and I would I
struggle to find language that is strong

6154
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:36,780
struggle to find language that is strong
 

6155
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:41,089
struggle to find language that is strong
enough uh for the horror of vaccinating

6156
02:03:41,089 --> 02:03:41,099
enough uh for the horror of vaccinating
 

6157
02:03:41,099 --> 02:03:44,750
enough uh for the horror of vaccinating
children in this case because children

6158
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:44,760
children in this case because children
 

6159
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,510
children in this case because children
suffer a greater risk of long-term

6160
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:47,520
suffer a greater risk of long-term
 

6161
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,430
suffer a greater risk of long-term
effects because they are going to live

6162
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:49,440
effects because they are going to live
 

6163
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,290
effects because they are going to live
longer and because this is earlier in

6164
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:51,300
longer and because this is earlier in
 

6165
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:53,089
longer and because this is earlier in
their development therefore it impacts

6166
02:03:53,089 --> 02:03:53,099
their development therefore it impacts
 

6167
02:03:53,099 --> 02:03:56,030
their development therefore it impacts
systems that are still forming they

6168
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:56,040
systems that are still forming they
 

6169
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:59,330
systems that are still forming they
tolerate covid well and so the benefit

6170
02:03:59,330 --> 02:03:59,340
tolerate covid well and so the benefit
 

6171
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:02,149
tolerate covid well and so the benefit
to them is very small and so the only

6172
02:04:02,149 --> 02:04:02,159
to them is very small and so the only
 

6173
02:04:02,159 --> 02:04:03,229
to them is very small and so the only
argument

6174
02:04:03,229 --> 02:04:03,239
argument
 

6175
02:04:03,239 --> 02:04:04,850
argument
for doing this is that they may

6176
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:04,860
for doing this is that they may
 

6177
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:06,770
for doing this is that they may
cryptically be carrying more covert than

6178
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:06,780
cryptically be carrying more covert than
 

6179
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:09,169
cryptically be carrying more covert than
we think and therefore they may be

6180
02:04:09,169 --> 02:04:09,179
we think and therefore they may be
 

6181
02:04:09,179 --> 02:04:10,910
we think and therefore they may be
integral to the way the virus spreads

6182
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:10,920
integral to the way the virus spreads
 

6183
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:12,830

feature of our bodies that each cell has

6346
02:07:37,609 --> 02:07:37,619
feature of our bodies that each cell has
 

6347
02:07:37,619 --> 02:07:40,250
feature of our bodies that each cell has
a limit on the number of times it can

6348
02:07:40,250 --> 02:07:40,260
a limit on the number of times it can
 

6349
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:42,109
a limit on the number of times it can
divide there are a few cells in the body

6350
02:07:42,109 --> 02:07:42,119
divide there are a few cells in the body
 

6351
02:07:42,119 --> 02:07:43,729
divide there are a few cells in the body
that are exceptional but most of our

6352
02:07:43,729 --> 02:07:43,739
that are exceptional but most of our
 

6353
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:45,589
that are exceptional but most of our
cells can only divide a limited number

6354
02:07:45,589 --> 02:07:45,599
cells can only divide a limited number
 

6355
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:47,089
cells can only divide a limited number
of times that's called the hayflick

6356
02:07:47,089 --> 02:07:47,099
of times that's called the hayflick
 

6357
02:07:47,099 --> 02:07:47,870
of times that's called the hayflick
limit

6358
02:07:47,870 --> 02:07:47,880
limit
 

6359
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:49,990
limit
and the hayflick limit

6360
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:50,000
and the hayflick limit
 

6361
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,229
and the hayflick limit
reduces the ability of the organism

6362
02:07:54,229 --> 02:07:54,239
reduces the ability of the organism
 

6363
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:57,229
reduces the ability of the organism
to replace tissues it therefore results

6364
02:07:57,229 --> 02:07:57,239
to replace tissues it therefore results
 

6365
02:07:57,239 --> 02:07:59,990
to replace tissues it therefore results
in a failure over time of maintenance

6366
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:00,000
in a failure over time of maintenance
 

6367
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,410
in a failure over time of maintenance
and repair and that explains why we we

6368
02:08:03,410 --> 02:08:03,420
and repair and that explains why we we
 

6369
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:06,050
and repair and that explains why we we
become decrepit as we grow old

6370
02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:06,060
become decrepit as we grow old
 

6371
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:09,229
become decrepit as we grow old
the question was why would that be

6372
02:08:09,229 --> 02:08:09,239
the question was why would that be
 

6373
02:08:09,239 --> 02:08:11,810
the question was why would that be
especially in light of the fact that the

6374
02:08:11,810 --> 02:08:11,820
especially in light of the fact that the
 

6375
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:14,390
especially in light of the fact that the
mechanism that seems to limit the

6376
02:08:14,390 --> 02:08:14,400
mechanism that seems to limit the
 

6377
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:17,089
mechanism that seems to limit the
ability of cells to reproduce is

6378
02:08:17,089 --> 02:08:17,099
ability of cells to reproduce is
 

6379
02:08:17,099 --> 02:08:19,609
ability of cells to reproduce is
something called a telomere telomere is

6380
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:19,619
something called a telomere telomere is
 

6381
02:08:19,619 --> 02:08:22,370
something called a telomere telomere is
a it's a not a gene but it's a DNA

6382
02:08:22,370 --> 02:08:22,380
a it's a not a gene but it's a DNA
 

6383
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:24,530
a it's a not a gene but it's a DNA
sequence at the ends of our chromosomes

6384
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:24,540
sequence at the ends of our chromosomes
 

6385
02:08:24,540 --> 02:08:26,750
sequence at the ends of our chromosomes
that is just simply repetitive and the

6386
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:26,760
that is just simply repetitive and the
 

6387
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:29,149
that is just simply repetitive and the
number of repeats functions like a

6388
02:08:29,149 --> 02:08:29,159
number of repeats functions like a
 

6389
02:08:29,159 --> 02:08:30,169
number of repeats functions like a
counter

6390
02:08:30,169 --> 02:08:30,179
counter
 

6391
02:08:30,179 --> 02:08:31,910
counter
so there's a number of repeats that you

6392
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:31,920
so there's a number of repeats that you
 

6393
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:34,430
so there's a number of repeats that you
have uh after development is finished

6394
02:08:34,430 --> 02:08:34,440
have uh after development is finished
 

6395
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:36,109
have uh after development is finished
and then each time the cell divides a

6396
02:08:36,109 --> 02:08:36,119
and then each time the cell divides a
 

6397
02:08:36,119 --> 02:08:38,030
and then each time the cell divides a
little bit of telomere is lost and at

6398
02:08:38,030 --> 02:08:38,040
little bit of telomere is lost and at
 

6399
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:39,290
little bit of telomere is lost and at
the point that the telomere becomes

6400
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:39,300
the point that the telomere becomes
 

6401
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:41,990
the point that the telomere becomes
critically short the cell stops dividing

6402
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:42,000
critically short the cell stops dividing
 

6403
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,850
critically short the cell stops dividing
even though it still has the capacity to

6404
02:08:43,850 --> 02:08:43,860
even though it still has the capacity to
 

6405
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:46,069
even though it still has the capacity to
do so stops dividing and it starts

6406
02:08:46,069 --> 02:08:46,079
do so stops dividing and it starts
 

6407
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:47,930
do so stops dividing and it starts
transcribing different genes than it did

6408
02:08:47,930 --> 02:08:47,940
transcribing different genes than it did
 

6409
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:50,209
transcribing different genes than it did
when it had more telomere

6410
02:08:50,209 --> 02:08:50,219
when it had more telomere
 

6411
02:08:50,219 --> 02:08:51,530
when it had more telomere
so

6412
02:08:51,530 --> 02:08:51,540
so
 

6413
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:53,750
so
what my work did was it looked at the

6414
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:53,760
what my work did was it looked at the
 

6415
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,089
what my work did was it looked at the
fact that the telomeric shortening was

6416
02:08:56,089 --> 02:08:56,099
fact that the telomeric shortening was
 

6417
02:08:56,099 --> 02:08:58,069
fact that the telomeric shortening was
being studied by two different groups it

6418
02:08:58,069 --> 02:08:58,079
being studied by two different groups it
 

6419
02:08:58,079 --> 02:08:59,750
being studied by two different groups it
was being studied by people

6420
02:08:59,750 --> 02:08:59,760
was being studied by people
 

6421
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:02,450
was being studied by people
who were interested in counteracting the

6422
02:09:02,450 --> 02:09:02,460
who were interested in counteracting the
 

6423
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:04,850
who were interested in counteracting the
aging process and it was being studied

6424
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:04,860
aging process and it was being studied
 

6425
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:06,770
aging process and it was being studied
in exactly the opposite fashion by

6426
02:09:06,770 --> 02:09:06,780
in exactly the opposite fashion by
 

6427
02:09:06,780 --> 02:09:08,390
in exactly the opposite fashion by
people who were interested in

6428
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:08,400
people who were interested in
 

6429
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,910
people who were interested in
tumorogenesis and cancer the thought

6430
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:10,920
tumorogenesis and cancer the thought
 

6431
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:13,010
tumorogenesis and cancer the thought
being because it was true that when one

6432
02:09:13,010 --> 02:09:13,020
being because it was true that when one
 

6433
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:15,069
being because it was true that when one
looked into tumors they always had

6434
02:09:15,069 --> 02:09:15,079
looked into tumors they always had
 

6435
02:09:15,079 --> 02:09:17,689
looked into tumors they always had
telomerase active that's the enzyme that

6436
02:09:17,689 --> 02:09:17,699
telomerase active that's the enzyme that
 

6437
02:09:17,699 --> 02:09:19,850
telomerase active that's the enzyme that
lengthens art telomeres so those folks

6438
02:09:19,850 --> 02:09:19,860
lengthens art telomeres so those folks
 

6439
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:21,290
lengthens art telomeres so those folks
were interested

6440
02:09:21,290 --> 02:09:21,300
were interested
 

6441
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:24,890
were interested
in uh bringing about a halt to the

6452
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:34,860
order to generate greater repair
 

6453
02:09:34,860 --> 02:09:37,850
order to generate greater repair
capacity and my point was evolutionarily

otherwise favor tumor suppression this

02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:05,940
appears to have greatly elongated the
 

6523
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:08,450
appears to have greatly elongated the
telomeres of laboratory mice with their

6524
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:08,460
telomeres of laboratory mice with their
 

6525
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:10,729

these animals are unreliable models of

6528
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:12,840
these animals are unreliable models of
 

6529
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:15,649
these animals are unreliable models of
normal senescence and tumor formation so

6530
02:11:15,649 --> 02:11:15,659
normal senescence and tumor formation so
 

6531
02:11:15,659 --> 02:11:18,709
normal senescence and tumor formation so
basically using these mice is not going

6532
02:11:18,709 --> 02:11:18,719
basically using these mice is not going
 

6533
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,510
basically using these mice is not going
to lead to the right kinds of

02:11:20,510 --> 02:11:20,520
to lead to the right kinds of

animals likely overestimate cancer risks

6538
02:11:26,569 --> 02:11:26,579
animals likely overestimate cancer risks
 

6539
02:11:26,579 --> 02:11:29,450
animals likely overestimate cancer risks
and underestimate tissue damage and

6540
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:29,460
and underestimate tissue damage and
 

6541
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:32,649
and underestimate tissue damage and
consequent accelerated senescence

6542
02:11:32,649 --> 02:11:32,659
consequent accelerated senescence
 

6543
02:11:32,659 --> 02:11:36,109
consequent accelerated senescence
so I think especially with your

6544
02:11:36,109 --> 02:11:36,119
so I think especially with your
 

6545
02:11:36,119 --> 02:11:38,050
so I think especially with your
discussion with Eric

6546
02:11:38,050 --> 02:11:38,060
discussion with Eric
 

6547
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:41,750
discussion with Eric
the conclusion of this paper has to do

6548
02:11:41,750 --> 02:11:41,760
the conclusion of this paper has to do
 

6549
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,310
the conclusion of this paper has to do
with the fact that

6550
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:43,320
with the fact that
 

6551
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:46,490
with the fact that
like we shouldn't be using these mice to

6552
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:46,500
like we shouldn't be using these mice to
 

6553
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:49,609
like we shouldn't be using these mice to
test the safety or to make conclusions

6554
02:11:49,609 --> 02:11:49,619
test the safety or to make conclusions
 

6555
02:11:49,619 --> 02:11:53,629
test the safety or to make conclusions
about uh uh cancer or senescence is that

6556
02:11:53,629 --> 02:11:53,639
about uh uh cancer or senescence is that
 

6557
02:11:53,639 --> 02:11:56,510
about uh uh cancer or senescence is that
the basic takeaway like basically saying

6558
02:11:56,510 --> 02:11:56,520
the basic takeaway like basically saying
 

6559
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:58,310
the basic takeaway like basically saying
that the length of these telomeres is an

6560
02:11:58,310 --> 02:11:58,320
that the length of these telomeres is an
 

6561
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:00,350
that the length of these telomeres is an
important variable to consider well

6562
02:12:00,350 --> 02:12:00,360
important variable to consider well
 

6563
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:02,629
important variable to consider well
let's put it this way I think there was

6564
02:12:02,629 --> 02:12:02,639
let's put it this way I think there was
 

6565
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:05,870
let's put it this way I think there was
a reason that the world of scientists

6566
02:12:05,870 --> 02:12:05,880
a reason that the world of scientists
 

6567
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:08,209
a reason that the world of scientists
who was working on telomeres did not

6568
02:12:08,209 --> 02:12:08,219
who was working on telomeres did not
 

6569
02:12:08,219 --> 02:12:10,430
who was working on telomeres did not
block did not spot the plyotropic

6570
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:10,440
block did not spot the plyotropic
 

6571
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:13,850
block did not spot the plyotropic
relationship that uh was the key

6572
02:12:13,850 --> 02:12:13,860
relationship that uh was the key
 

6573
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:16,189
relationship that uh was the key
argument in my paper

6574
02:12:16,189 --> 02:12:16,199
argument in my paper
 

6575
02:12:16,199 --> 02:12:18,050
argument in my paper
the reason they didn't spot it was that

6576
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:18,060
the reason they didn't spot it was that
 

6577
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:20,629
the reason they didn't spot it was that
there was a result that everybody knew

6578
02:12:20,629 --> 02:12:20,639
there was a result that everybody knew
 

6579
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:22,910
there was a result that everybody knew
which seemed inconsistent

6580
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:22,920
which seemed inconsistent
 

6581
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:25,910
which seemed inconsistent
the result was that mice have very long

6582
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:25,920
the result was that mice have very long
 

6583
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:28,850
the result was that mice have very long
telomeres but they do not have very long

6584
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:28,860
telomeres but they do not have very long
 

6585
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:30,169
telomeres but they do not have very long
lives

6586
02:12:30,169 --> 02:12:30,179
lives
 

6587
02:12:30,179 --> 02:12:32,149
lives
now we can talk about what the actual

6588
02:12:32,149 --> 02:12:32,159
now we can talk about what the actual
 

6589
02:12:32,159 --> 02:12:34,430
now we can talk about what the actual
meaning of don't have very long lives is

6590
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:34,440
meaning of don't have very long lives is
 

6591
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:38,270
meaning of don't have very long lives is
but in the end I was confronted with a

6592
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:38,280
but in the end I was confronted with a
 

6593
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:40,729
but in the end I was confronted with a
hypothesis that would explain a great

6594
02:12:40,729 --> 02:12:40,739
hypothesis that would explain a great
 

6595
02:12:40,739 --> 02:12:42,709
hypothesis that would explain a great
many features of the way mammals and

6596
02:12:42,709 --> 02:12:42,719
many features of the way mammals and
 

6597
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:45,169
many features of the way mammals and
indeed vertebrates age but it was

6598
02:12:45,169 --> 02:12:45,179
indeed vertebrates age but it was
 

6599
02:12:45,179 --> 02:12:47,030
indeed vertebrates age but it was
inconsistent with one result and at

6600
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:47,040
inconsistent with one result and at
 

6601
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:49,189
inconsistent with one result and at
first I thought maybe there's something

6602
02:12:49,189 --> 02:12:49,199
first I thought maybe there's something
 

6603
02:12:49,199 --> 02:12:50,750
first I thought maybe there's something
wrong with the result maybe this is one

6604
02:12:50,750 --> 02:12:50,760
wrong with the result maybe this is one
 

6605
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:52,609
wrong with the result maybe this is one
of these cases where the result was

6606
02:12:52,609 --> 02:12:52,619
of these cases where the result was
 

6607
02:12:52,619 --> 02:12:55,850
of these cases where the result was
achieved once through some bad protocol

6608
02:12:55,850 --> 02:12:55,860
achieved once through some bad protocol
 

6609
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:57,290
achieved once through some bad protocol
and everybody else was repeating it

6610
02:12:57,290 --> 02:12:57,300
and everybody else was repeating it
 

6611
02:12:57,300 --> 02:12:59,149
and everybody else was repeating it
didn't turn out to be the case many

6612
02:12:59,149 --> 02:12:59,159
didn't turn out to be the case many
 

6613
02:12:59,159 --> 02:13:00,830
didn't turn out to be the case many
Laboratories had established that mice

6614
02:13:00,830 --> 02:13:00,840
Laboratories had established that mice
 

6615
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:02,810
Laboratories had established that mice
had Ultra long telomeres

6616
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:02,820
had Ultra long telomeres
 

6617
02:13:02,820 --> 02:13:05,390
had Ultra long telomeres
and so I began to wonder whether or not

6618
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:05,400
and so I began to wonder whether or not
 

6619
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:08,510
and so I began to wonder whether or not
there was something about the breeding

6620
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:08,520
there was something about the breeding
 

6621
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:11,750
there was something about the breeding
protocols that generated these mice and

6622
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:11,760
protocols that generated these mice and
 

6623
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:13,850
protocols that generated these mice and
what that would predict is that the mice

6624
02:13:13,850 --> 02:13:13,860
what that would predict is that the mice
 

6625
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:15,410
what that would predict is that the mice
that have long telomeres would be

6626
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:15,420
that have long telomeres would be
 

6627
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:18,109
that have long telomeres would be
laboratory mice and that wild mice would

6628
02:13:18,109 --> 02:13:18,119
laboratory mice and that wild mice would
 

6629
02:13:18,119 --> 02:13:21,770
laboratory mice and that wild mice would
not and Carol Grider who agreed to

6630
02:13:21,770 --> 02:13:21,780
not and Carol Grider who agreed to
 

6631
02:13:21,780 --> 02:13:24,169
not and Carol Grider who agreed to
collaborate with me tested that

6632
02:13:24,169 --> 02:13:24,179
collaborate with me tested that
 

6633
02:13:24,179 --> 02:13:27,050
collaborate with me tested that
hypothesis and showed that it was indeed

6634
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:27,060
hypothesis and showed that it was indeed
 

6635
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:29,689
hypothesis and showed that it was indeed
true that wild derived mice or at least

6636
02:13:29,689 --> 02:13:29,699
true that wild derived mice or at least
 

6637
02:13:29,699 --> 02:13:31,729
true that wild derived mice or at least
mice that had been in captivity for a

6638
02:13:31,729 --> 02:13:31,739
mice that had been in captivity for a
 

6639
02:13:31,739 --> 02:13:33,290
mice that had been in captivity for a
much shorter period of time did not have

6640
02:13:33,290 --> 02:13:33,300
much shorter period of time did not have
 

6641
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:35,030
much shorter period of time did not have
Ultra long telomeres

6642
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:35,040
Ultra long telomeres
 

6643
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,370
Ultra long telomeres
now what this implied though

6644
02:13:37,370 --> 02:13:37,380
now what this implied though
 

6645
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:40,250
now what this implied though
as you read is that our reading

6646
02:13:40,250 --> 02:13:40,260
as you read is that our reading
 

6647
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:42,649
as you read is that our reading
protocols generate lengthening of

6648
02:13:42,649 --> 02:13:42,659
protocols generate lengthening of
 

6649
02:13:42,659 --> 02:13:45,050
protocols generate lengthening of
telomeres and the implication of that is

6650
02:13:45,050 --> 02:13:45,060
telomeres and the implication of that is
 

6651
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:46,550
telomeres and the implication of that is
that the animals that have these very

6652
02:13:46,550 --> 02:13:46,560
that the animals that have these very
 

6653
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:49,189
that the animals that have these very
long telomeres will be hyper prone to

6654
02:13:49,189 --> 02:13:49,199
long telomeres will be hyper prone to
 

6655
02:13:49,199 --> 02:13:52,550
long telomeres will be hyper prone to
create tumors they will be extremely

6656
02:13:52,550 --> 02:13:52,560
create tumors they will be extremely
 

6657
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:55,189
create tumors they will be extremely
resistant to toxins because they have

6658
02:13:55,189 --> 02:13:55,199
resistant to toxins because they have
 

6659
02:13:55,199 --> 02:13:57,229
resistant to toxins because they have
effectively an infinite capacity to

6660
02:13:57,229 --> 02:13:57,239
effectively an infinite capacity to
 

6661
02:13:57,239 --> 02:13:59,770
effectively an infinite capacity to
replace any damaged tissue and so

6662
02:13:59,770 --> 02:13:59,780
replace any damaged tissue and so
 

6663
02:13:59,780 --> 02:14:02,750
replace any damaged tissue and so
ironically if you give one of these

Ultra long telomere lab mice a toxin if

6666
02:14:06,770 --> 02:14:06,780
Ultra long telomere lab mice a toxin if
 

6667
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:08,629
Ultra long telomere lab mice a toxin if
the toxin doesn't outright kill it it

6668
02:14:08,629 --> 02:14:08,639
the toxin doesn't outright kill it it
 

6669
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:10,550
the toxin doesn't outright kill it it
may actually increase its lifespan

6670
02:14:10,550 --> 02:14:10,560
may actually increase its lifespan
 

6671
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:12,830
may actually increase its lifespan
because it functions as a kind of

6672
02:14:12,830 --> 02:14:12,840
because it functions as a kind of

because it functions as a kind of
chemotherapy

6674
02:14:14,270 --> 02:14:14,280
chemotherapy
 

6675
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:17,330
chemotherapy
so the reason the chemotherapy works is

6676
02:14:17,330 --> 02:14:17,340
so the reason the chemotherapy works is
 

6677
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:19,189
so the reason the chemotherapy works is
that dividing cells are more vulnerable

6678
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:19,199
that dividing cells are more vulnerable
 

6679
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:21,649
that dividing cells are more vulnerable
than cells that are not dividing and so

6680
02:14:21,649 --> 02:14:21,659
than cells that are not dividing and so
 

6681
02:14:21,659 --> 02:14:24,410
than cells that are not dividing and so
if this mouse has effectively had its

02:14:24,410 --> 02:14:24,420
if this mouse has effectively had its

02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:26,810
if this mouse has effectively had its
cancer protection turned off and it has

6684
02:14:26,810 --> 02:14:26,820
cancer protection turned off and it has
 

6685
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:28,970
cancer protection turned off and it has
cells dividing too rapidly and you give

6686
02:14:28,970 --> 02:14:28,980
cells dividing too rapidly and you give
 

6687
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:31,370
cells dividing too rapidly and you give
it a toxin you will slow down its tumors

6688
02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:31,380
it a toxin you will slow down its tumors
 

6689
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:33,589
it a toxin you will slow down its tumors
faster than you harm its other tissues

6690
02:14:33,589 --> 02:14:33,599
faster than you harm its other tissues
 

6691
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:35,629
faster than you harm its other tissues
and so you'll get a paradoxical result

6692
02:14:35,629 --> 02:14:35,639
and so you'll get a paradoxical result
 

6693
02:14:35,639 --> 02:14:38,030
and so you'll get a paradoxical result
that actually some drug that's toxic

6694
02:14:38,030 --> 02:14:38,040
that actually some drug that's toxic
 

6695
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:40,310
that actually some drug that's toxic
seems to benefit the mouse

6696
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,320
seems to benefit the mouse
 

6697
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:42,290
seems to benefit the mouse
now I don't think that that was

02:14:42,290 --> 02:14:42,300
now I don't think that that was
 

6699
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:44,510
now I don't think that that was
understood before I published my paper

now I'm pretty sure it has to be and the

now I'm pretty sure it has to be and the
 

6703
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:49,550
now I'm pretty sure it has to be and the
problem is that this actually is a

problem is that this actually is a

and these mice predispose our system to

02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:08,469
so to kind of play Devil's Advocate it's
also possible

6824
02:17:08,469 --> 02:17:08,479
also possible
 

6825
02:17:08,479 --> 02:17:11,089
also possible
that this particular the length of the

6826
02:17:11,089 --> 02:17:11,099
that this particular the length of the
 

6827
02:17:11,099 --> 02:17:12,830
that this particular the length of the
telomeres is not a strong variable for

6828
02:17:12,830 --> 02:17:12,840
telomeres is not a strong variable for

development and for the conclusions that
 

6833
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,770
development and for the conclusions that
Carol and others have been studying is

6834
02:17:18,770 --> 02:17:18,780
Carol and others have been studying is
 

6835
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:20,450
Carol and others have been studying is
that is that is it possible for that to

6836
02:17:20,450 --> 02:17:20,460
that is that is it possible for that to
 

6837
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:21,589
that is that is it possible for that to
be the case

6838
02:17:21,589 --> 02:17:21,599
be the case
 

6839
02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:24,650
be the case
that this like so one reason she and

6840
02:17:24,650 --> 02:17:24,660
that this like so one reason she and
 

6841
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:26,929
that this like so one reason she and
others could be ignoring this

6842
02:17:26,929 --> 02:17:26,939
others could be ignoring this
 

6843
02:17:26,939 --> 02:17:29,030
others could be ignoring this
is because it's not a strong variable

6844
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,040
is because it's not a strong variable
 

6845
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,309
is because it's not a strong variable
well I don't believe so and in fact at

I asked her to send me the paper
 

6903
02:18:36,719 --> 02:18:40,009
I asked her to send me the paper
to see whether or not she had put

6904
02:18:40,009 --> 02:18:40,019
to see whether or not she had put
 

6905
02:18:40,019 --> 02:18:42,169
to see whether or not she had put
evidence in it that the hypothesis had

evidence in it that the hypothesis had
 

6907
02:18:42,179 --> 02:18:44,990
evidence in it that the hypothesis had
come from me she grudgingly sent it to

um and you know I was

6980
02:20:09,590 --> 02:20:09,600
um and you know I was
 

6981

um and you know I was
let's put it this way when I watched her

6982
02:20:11,330 --> 02:20:11,340
let's put it this way when I watched her
 

6983
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:13,190
let's put it this way when I watched her
Nobel lecture and I should say there's

6984
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,200
Nobel lecture and I should say there's
 

6985
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:14,750
Nobel lecture and I should say there's
been a lot of confusion about this novel

6986
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:14,760
been a lot of confusion about this novel
 

6987
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:16,429
been a lot of confusion about this novel
stuff I've never said that I should have

6988
02:20:16,429 --> 02:20:16,439
stuff I've never said that I should have
 

6989
02:20:16,439 --> 02:20:19,030
stuff I've never said that I should have
gotten a Nobel Prize people have

6990
02:20:19,030 --> 02:20:19,040
gotten a Nobel Prize people have
 

6991
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:21,770
gotten a Nobel Prize people have
misportrayed that

6992
02:20:21,770 --> 02:20:21,780
misportrayed that
 

6993
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:25,670
misportrayed that
um my in listening to her lecture

6994
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:25,680
um my in listening to her lecture
 

6995
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:28,370
um my in listening to her lecture
I had one of the most bizarre emotional

6996
02:20:28,370 --> 02:20:28,380

6997
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:31,010
I had one of the most bizarre emotional
experiences of my life because she

6998
02:20:31,010 --> 02:20:31,020
experiences of my life because she
 

6999
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:34,910
experiences of my life because she
presented the work that resulted from my

7000
02:20:34,910 --> 02:20:34,920
presented the work that resulted from my
 

7001
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:37,849
presented the work that resulted from my
hypothesis she presented it as she had

7002
02:20:37,849 --> 02:20:37,859
hypothesis she presented it as she had
 

7003
02:20:37,859 --> 02:20:40,550
hypothesis she presented it as she had
in her paper with no acknowledgment of

7004
02:20:40,550 --> 02:20:40,560
in her paper with no acknowledgment of
 

7005
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:43,790
in her paper with no acknowledgment of
where it had come from and she had

7006
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:43,800
where it had come from and she had
 

7007
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:47,630
where it had come from and she had
in fact portrayed the Distortion of the

7008
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:47,640
in fact portrayed the Distortion of the
 

7009
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:50,330
in fact portrayed the Distortion of the
telomeres as if it were a lucky fact

7010
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:50,340
telomeres as if it were a lucky fact
 

7011
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:53,210
telomeres as if it were a lucky fact
because it allowed testing hypotheses

7012
02:20:53,210 --> 02:20:53,220
because it allowed testing hypotheses
 

7013
02:20:53,220 --> 02:20:56,330
because it allowed testing hypotheses
that would otherwise not be testable

7014
02:20:56,330 --> 02:20:56,340
that would otherwise not be testable
 

7015
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:58,969
that would otherwise not be testable
you have to understand as a young

important lecture of her career right
 

7025
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:12,889

it's thrilling it was thrilling to see
 

7027
02:21:12,899 --> 02:21:17,630
it's thrilling it was thrilling to see
you know her uh her figures projected on

7028
02:21:17,630 --> 02:21:17,640
you know her uh her figures projected on
 

7029
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:19,969
you know her uh her figures projected on
the screen there right to have been part

7030
02:21:19,969 --> 02:21:19,979
the screen there right to have been part
 

7031
02:21:19,979 --> 02:21:21,349
the screen there right to have been part
of work that was important enough for

7032
02:21:21,349 --> 02:21:21,359
of work that was important enough for
 

7033
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:23,690
of work that was important enough for
that felt great and of course to be

7034
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:23,700
that felt great and of course to be
 

7035
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:25,730
that felt great and of course to be
erased from the story felt absolutely

7036
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:25,740
erased from the story felt absolutely
 

7037
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:27,469
erased from the story felt absolutely
terrible

7038
02:21:27,469 --> 02:21:27,479
terrible
 

7039
02:21:27,479 --> 02:21:29,929
terrible
um so anyway that's sort of where I am

7040
02:21:29,929 --> 02:21:29,939
um so anyway that's sort of where I am
 

7041
02:21:29,939 --> 02:21:32,630
um so anyway that's sort of where I am
with it my sense is

7042
02:21:32,630 --> 02:21:32,640
with it my sense is
 

7043
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:35,150
with it my sense is
um I what I'm really troubled by in this

7044
02:21:35,150 --> 02:21:35,160
um I what I'm really troubled by in this
 

7045
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:38,630
um I what I'm really troubled by in this
story is the fact

7046
02:21:38,630 --> 02:21:38,640
story is the fact
 

7047
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:40,010
story is the fact
that

7048
02:21:40,010 --> 02:21:40,020
that
 

7049
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:43,130
that
as far as I know the flaw with the mice

7050
02:21:43,130 --> 02:21:43,140
as far as I know the flaw with the mice
 

7051
02:21:43,140 --> 02:21:45,650
as far as I know the flaw with the mice
has not been addressed

7052
02:21:45,650 --> 02:21:45,660
has not been addressed
 

7053
02:21:45,660 --> 02:21:47,809
has not been addressed
and actually Eric did some looking into

7054
02:21:47,809 --> 02:21:47,819
and actually Eric did some looking into
 

7055
02:21:47,819 --> 02:21:50,030
and actually Eric did some looking into
this he tried to establish by calling

7056
02:21:50,030 --> 02:21:50,040
this he tried to establish by calling
 

7057
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:52,210
this he tried to establish by calling
the Jack's lab and trying to ascertain

7058
02:21:52,210 --> 02:21:52,220
the Jack's lab and trying to ascertain
 

7059
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:54,349
the Jack's lab and trying to ascertain
what had happened with the colonies

7060
02:21:54,349 --> 02:21:54,359
what had happened with the colonies
 

7061
02:21:54,359 --> 02:21:56,270
what had happened with the colonies
whether any change in protocol had

7062
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:56,280
whether any change in protocol had
 

7063
02:21:56,280 --> 02:21:58,610
whether any change in protocol had
occurred and he couldn't get anywhere

7064
02:21:58,610 --> 02:21:58,620
occurred and he couldn't get anywhere
 

7065
02:21:58,620 --> 02:22:00,469
occurred and he couldn't get anywhere
there was seemingly no awareness that it

7066
02:22:00,469 --> 02:22:00,479
there was seemingly no awareness that it
 

7067
02:22:00,479 --> 02:22:02,150
there was seemingly no awareness that it
was even an issue

7068
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:02,160
was even an issue
 

7069
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:03,530
was even an issue
so

7070
02:22:03,530 --> 02:22:03,540
so
 

7071
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:05,870
so
I'm very troubled by the fact that as a

7072
02:22:05,870 --> 02:22:05,880
I'm very troubled by the fact that as a
 

7073
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:07,550
I'm very troubled by the fact that as a
father for example

7074
02:22:07,550 --> 02:22:07,560
father for example
 

7075
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:10,190
father for example
I'm in no position to protect my family

7076
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:10,200
I'm in no position to protect my family
 

7077
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:12,590
I'm in no position to protect my family
from the hazard that I believe lurks in

7078
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:12,600
from the hazard that I believe lurks in
 

7079
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:15,230
from the hazard that I believe lurks in
our medicine cabinets right I'm even

7080
02:22:15,230 --> 02:22:15,240
our medicine cabinets right I'm even
 

7081
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:16,670
our medicine cabinets right I'm even
though I'm aware of where the hazard

7082
02:22:16,670 --> 02:22:16,680
though I'm aware of where the hazard
 

7083
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:18,349
though I'm aware of where the hazard
comes from it doesn't tell me anything

7084
02:22:18,349 --> 02:22:18,359
comes from it doesn't tell me anything
 

7085
02:22:18,359 --> 02:22:20,090
comes from it doesn't tell me anything
useful about which of these drugs will

7086
02:22:20,090 --> 02:22:20,100
useful about which of these drugs will
 

7087
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:21,830
useful about which of these drugs will
turn out to do damage if it is

7088
02:22:21,830 --> 02:22:21,840
turn out to do damage if it is
 

7089
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:23,990
turn out to do damage if it is
ultimately tested and that's a very

7090
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:24,000
ultimately tested and that's a very
 

7091
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,809
ultimately tested and that's a very
frustrating position to be in on the

7092
02:22:26,809 --> 02:22:26,819
frustrating position to be in on the
 

7093
02:22:26,819 --> 02:22:28,190
frustrating position to be in on the
other hand you know there's a part of me

7094
02:22:28,190 --> 02:22:28,200
other hand you know there's a part of me
 

7095
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:30,590
other hand you know there's a part of me
that's even still grateful to Carol for

7096
02:22:30,590 --> 02:22:30,600
that's even still grateful to Carol for
 

7097
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:32,510
that's even still grateful to Carol for
taking my call she didn't have to take

7098
02:22:32,510 --> 02:22:32,520
taking my call she didn't have to take
 

7099
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:34,309
taking my call she didn't have to take
my call and talk to some young graduate

7100
02:22:34,309 --> 02:22:34,319
my call and talk to some young graduate
 

7101
02:22:34,319 --> 02:22:36,170
my call and talk to some young graduate
student who had some evolutionary idea

7102
02:22:36,170 --> 02:22:36,180
student who had some evolutionary idea
 

7103
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:39,469
student who had some evolutionary idea
that wasn't you know in her wheelhouse

7104
02:22:39,469 --> 02:22:39,479
that wasn't you know in her wheelhouse
 

7105
02:22:39,479 --> 02:22:41,929
that wasn't you know in her wheelhouse
specifically and yet she did and you

7106
02:22:41,929 --> 02:22:41,939
specifically and yet she did and you
 

7107

specifically and yet she did and you
know for a while she was a good

7108
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:43,200
know for a while she was a good
 

7109
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,429
know for a while she was a good
collaborator so well can I

02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:50,990
and have to proceed carefully here
because it's it's a complicated topic

7114
02:22:50,990 --> 02:22:51,000
because it's it's a complicated topic
 

7115
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,250
because it's it's a complicated topic

7133
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:18,530
let me phrase it this way I've um as a
as a research scientist at MIT I've had

7134
02:23:18,530 --> 02:23:18,540
as a research scientist at MIT I've had
 

7135
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:22,670
as a research scientist at MIT I've had
and especially just part of

7136
02:23:22,670 --> 02:23:22,680
and especially just part of
 

7137
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:26,030
and especially just part of

a large set of collaborations I've had a
 

7139
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:28,210
a large set of collaborations I've had a
lot of students come to me

7140
02:23:28,210 --> 02:23:28,220
lot of students come to me
 

7141
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:31,910
lot of students come to me
and talk to me about ideas perhaps less

7142
02:23:31,910 --> 02:23:31,920
and talk to me about ideas perhaps less
 

7143
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:33,290
and talk to me about ideas perhaps less
interesting than what we're discussing

7144
02:23:33,290 --> 02:23:33,300
interesting than what we're discussing
 

7145
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:35,330
interesting than what we're discussing
here in the space of AI

7146
02:23:35,330 --> 02:23:35,340
here in the space of AI
 

7147
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:37,370
here in the space of AI
that I've been thinking about anyway

7148
02:23:37,370 --> 02:23:37,380
that I've been thinking about anyway
 

7149
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:40,490
that I've been thinking about anyway
it's in in general with everything I'm

7150
02:23:40,490 --> 02:23:40,500
it's in in general with everything I'm
 

7151
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:43,010
it's in in general with everything I'm
doing with robotics

7152
02:23:43,010 --> 02:23:43,020
doing with robotics
 

7153
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:44,450
doing with robotics
people

7154
02:23:44,450 --> 02:23:44,460
people
 

7155
02:23:44,460 --> 02:23:47,570
people
uh will have told me a bunch of ideas

7156
02:23:47,570 --> 02:23:47,580
uh will have told me a bunch of ideas
 

7157
02:23:47,580 --> 02:23:49,849
uh will have told me a bunch of ideas
that I'm already thinking about the

7158
02:23:49,849 --> 02:23:49,859
that I'm already thinking about the
 

7159
02:23:49,859 --> 02:23:52,130
that I'm already thinking about the
point is taking that idea

7160
02:23:52,130 --> 02:23:52,140
point is taking that idea
 

7161
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:54,230
point is taking that idea
see this is different because the idea

7162
02:23:54,230 --> 02:23:54,240
see this is different because the idea
 

7163
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:55,730
see this is different because the idea
has more power in the space that we're

7164
02:23:55,730 --> 02:23:55,740
has more power in the space that we're
 

7165
02:23:55,740 --> 02:23:57,290
has more power in the space that we're
talking about here in robotics is like

7166
02:23:57,290 --> 02:23:57,300
talking about here in robotics is like
 

7167
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:59,809
talking about here in robotics is like
your idea means [\h__\h] until you build it

7168
02:23:59,809 --> 02:23:59,819
your idea means [\h__\h] until you build it
 

7169
02:23:59,819 --> 02:24:02,090
your idea means [\h__\h] until you build it
like so the engineering world is a

7170
02:24:02,090 --> 02:24:02,100
like so the engineering world is a
 

7171
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:05,690
like so the engineering world is a
little different but it there's a kind

7172
02:24:05,690 --> 02:24:05,700
little different but it there's a kind
 

7173
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:08,570
little different but it there's a kind
of sense that I probably forgot a lot of

7174
02:24:08,570 --> 02:24:08,580
of sense that I probably forgot a lot of
 

7175
02:24:08,580 --> 02:24:11,330
of sense that I probably forgot a lot of

people around her there's a bunch of

7186
02:24:24,469 --> 02:24:24,479
people around her there's a bunch of
 

7187
02:24:24,479 --> 02:24:26,690
people around her there's a bunch of
ideas that are swimming in the air and

7188
02:24:26,690 --> 02:24:26,700
ideas that are swimming in the air and
 

7189
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:28,670
ideas that are swimming in the air and
you just kind of forget people that are

7190
02:24:28,670 --> 02:24:28,680
you just kind of forget people that are
 

7191
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:30,770
you just kind of forget people that are
a little bit on the periphery on the

7192
02:24:30,770 --> 02:24:30,780
a little bit on the periphery on the
 

7193
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:32,990
a little bit on the periphery on the
idea generation like or is it some mix

7194
02:24:32,990 --> 02:24:33,000
idea generation like or is it some mix
 

7195
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,130
idea generation like or is it some mix
of both

7196
02:24:34,130 --> 02:24:34,140
of both
 

7197
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:36,710
of both
uh it's not a mix of both

7198
02:24:36,710 --> 02:24:36,720
uh it's not a mix of both
 

7199
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:39,469
uh it's not a mix of both
um I know that because we corresponded

7200
02:24:39,469 --> 02:24:39,479
um I know that because we corresponded
 

7201
02:24:39,479 --> 02:24:41,750

came in
um so there was no ambiguity about what

7208
02:24:49,070 --> 02:24:49,080
um so there was no ambiguity about what
 

7209
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:52,250
um so there was no ambiguity about what
had happened what's more when I went to

had happened what's more when I went to
 

7211
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:53,929
had happened what's more when I went to
publish my work I actually sent it to

7212
02:24:53,929 --> 02:24:53,939
publish my work I actually sent it to
 

7213
02:24:53,939 --> 02:24:56,450

panned it made many critiques that were

7220
02:25:04,849 --> 02:25:04,859
panned it made many critiques that were
 

7221
02:25:04,859 --> 02:25:07,610
panned it made many critiques that were
not valid but it was clear at that point

7222
02:25:07,610 --> 02:25:07,620
not valid but it was clear at that point
 

7223
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:12,050
not valid but it was clear at that point
that he became an antagonist and none of

that he became an antagonist and none of
this adds up she couldn't possibly have

02:25:13,730 --> 02:25:13,740
this adds up she couldn't possibly have
 

7227
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:16,190
this adds up she couldn't possibly have
forgotten the conversation

7228
02:25:16,190 --> 02:25:16,200
forgotten the conversation
 

7229
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:16,790
forgotten the conversation
um

7230
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:16,800
um
 

7231
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:19,670
um
I believe I even Center tissues at some

02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,790
I believe I even Center tissues at some
point in in part in not related to this

7234
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:22,800
point in in part in not related to this
 

7235
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,469
point in in part in not related to this
project but as a favor she was doing

7236
02:25:24,469 --> 02:25:24,479
project but as a favor she was doing
 

7237
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:26,030
project but as a favor she was doing
another project that involved telomeres

7238
02:25:26,030 --> 02:25:26,040
another project that involved telomeres
 

7239
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:27,770
another project that involved telomeres
and she needed samples that I could get

7240
02:25:27,770 --> 02:25:27,780
and she needed samples that I could get
 

7241
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:29,210

02:25:29,210 --> 02:25:29,220
a hold of because of the Museum of
 

7243
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:30,770
a hold of because of the Museum of
zoology that I was in

7244
02:25:30,770 --> 02:25:30,780
zoology that I was in
 

7245
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:34,550
zoology that I was in
so this was not a one-off conversation I

7246
02:25:34,550 --> 02:25:34,560
so this was not a one-off conversation I
 

7247
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:35,570
so this was not a one-off conversation I
certainly know that those sorts of

02:25:35,570 --> 02:25:35,580
certainly know that those sorts of
 

7249
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:37,010
certainly know that those sorts of
things can happen but that's not what

7250
02:25:37,010 --> 02:25:37,020
things can happen but that's not what
 

7251
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:39,830
things can happen but that's not what
happened here this was a relationship

7252
02:25:39,830 --> 02:25:39,840
happened here this was a relationship
 

7253
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:43,130
happened here this was a relationship
that existed and then was suddenly cut

7254
02:25:43,130 --> 02:25:43,140
that existed and then was suddenly cut
 

7255
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:45,410
that existed and then was suddenly cut
short at the point that she published

7256
02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:45,420
short at the point that she published
 

7257
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:47,030
short at the point that she published
her paper by surprise without saying

7258
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:47,040
her paper by surprise without saying
 

7259
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:49,610
her paper by surprise without saying
where the hypothesis had come from and

7260
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:49,620
where the hypothesis had come from and
 

7261
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:53,870
where the hypothesis had come from and
uh began to be a opposing Force to my

7262
02:25:53,870 --> 02:25:53,880
uh began to be a opposing Force to my
 

7263
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:54,710
uh began to be a opposing Force to my
work

7264
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:54,720
work
 

7265
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,110
work
is there there's a bunch of trajectories

7266
02:25:57,110 --> 02:25:57,120
is there there's a bunch of trajectories
 

7267
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:00,170
is there there's a bunch of trajectories
you could have taken through life

7268
02:26:00,170 --> 02:26:00,180
you could have taken through life
 

7269
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:02,270
you could have taken through life
do you think about

7270
02:26:02,270 --> 02:26:02,280
do you think about
 

7271
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:05,090
do you think about
the trajectory of being

7272
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:05,100
the trajectory of being
 

7273
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:08,809
the trajectory of being
um a researcher of then going to to war

7274
02:26:08,809 --> 02:26:08,819
um a researcher of then going to to war
 

7275
02:26:08,819 --> 02:26:10,910
um a researcher of then going to to war
in the space of ideas of publishing

7276
02:26:10,910 --> 02:26:10,920
in the space of ideas of publishing
 

7277
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:13,370
in the space of ideas of publishing
further papers along this line

7278
02:26:13,370 --> 02:26:13,380
further papers along this line
 

7279
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:17,510
further papers along this line
I mean that's often the dynamic of the

7280
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:17,520
I mean that's often the dynamic of the
 

7281
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:19,550
I mean that's often the dynamic of the
that fascinating space is you have a

7282
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:19,560
that fascinating space is you have a
 

7283
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:21,830
that fascinating space is you have a
junior researcher with brilliant ideas

7284
02:26:21,830 --> 02:26:21,840
junior researcher with brilliant ideas
 

7285
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:24,410
junior researcher with brilliant ideas
and a senior researcher that that starts

7286
02:26:24,410 --> 02:26:24,420
and a senior researcher that that starts
 

7287
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:25,730
and a senior researcher that that starts
out as a mentor that becomes a

7288
02:26:25,730 --> 02:26:25,740
out as a mentor that becomes a
 

7289
02:26:25,740 --> 02:26:28,070
out as a mentor that becomes a
competitor I mean that that happens but

7290
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:28,080
competitor I mean that that happens but
 

7291
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:29,690
competitor I mean that that happens but
then the way

7292
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:29,700
then the way
 

7293
02:26:29,700 --> 02:26:33,110
then the way
to uh it's almost an opportunity to

7294
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:33,120
to uh it's almost an opportunity to
 

7295
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:35,450
to uh it's almost an opportunity to

don't like the idea that if you are very
good you get parasitized until it's your

yeah and you know what's the harm

02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:54,650
yeah and you know what's the harm
in publishing them so that your peers

in publishing them so that your peers
 

7661
02:33:54,660 --> 02:33:56,389
in publishing them so that your peers
have to review them in public where they

7662
02:33:56,389 --> 02:33:56,399
have to review them in public where they
 

7663
02:33:56,399 --> 02:33:58,370
have to review them in public where they
actually if they're gonna disagree with

actually if they're gonna disagree with
 

7665
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:00,110
actually if they're gonna disagree with
you they actually have to take the risk

7666
02:34:00,110 --> 02:34:00,120
you they actually have to take the risk
 

7667
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:01,730
you they actually have to take the risk
of saying I don't think this is right

7668
02:34:01,730 --> 02:34:01,740
of saying I don't think this is right

of saying I don't think this is right
and here's why right with their name on

02:34:04,250 --> 02:34:04,260
and here's why right with their name on
 

7671
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:06,349
and here's why right with their name on
it I'd much rather that it's not that I

it I'd much rather that it's not that I

it I'd much rather that it's not that I
don't want my work reviewed by peers but

02:34:07,910 --> 02:34:07,920
don't want my work reviewed by peers but
 

7675
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:10,429
don't want my work reviewed by peers but
I want it done in the open you know for

this popularity in pointing out that the
 

7691

02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:43,849

I've confronted this in scientific work

I've confronted this in scientific work

02:34:43,859 --> 02:34:46,730
I've confronted this in scientific work
I've done in MIT

02:34:46,730 --> 02:34:46,740
I've done in MIT
 

7699
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:49,070
I've done in MIT
where there are certain things that are

where there are certain things that are
not done well people are not being the

02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:50,880
not done well people are not being the
 

7703
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:53,809
not done well people are not being the
best version of themselves

7704
02:34:53,809 --> 02:34:53,819
best version of themselves
 

7705
02:34:53,819 --> 02:34:55,570
best version of themselves
and

7706
02:34:55,570 --> 02:34:55,580
and
 

7707
02:34:55,580 --> 02:35:00,710
and
particular aspects of a particular field

7708
02:35:00,710 --> 02:35:00,720
particular aspects of a particular field
 

7709
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:03,110
particular aspects of a particular field
are in need of a revolution

7710
02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:03,120
are in need of a revolution
 

7711
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:07,070
are in need of a revolution
and part of me wanted to point that out

7712
02:35:07,070 --> 02:35:07,080
and part of me wanted to point that out
 

7713
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:11,870
and part of me wanted to point that out
versus doing the hard work of publishing

7714
02:35:11,870 --> 02:35:11,880
versus doing the hard work of publishing
 

7715
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:13,630
versus doing the hard work of publishing
papers and doing the revolution

7716

papers and doing the revolution
 

7717
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:16,730
papers and doing the revolution
basically just pointing out look

7718
02:35:16,730 --> 02:35:16,740
basically just pointing out look
 

7719
02:35:16,740 --> 02:35:18,469
basically just pointing out look
you guys are doing it wrong and then

7720
02:35:18,469 --> 02:35:18,479
you guys are doing it wrong and then
 

7721
02:35:18,479 --> 02:35:20,150
you guys are doing it wrong and then
just walking away

7722
02:35:20,150 --> 02:35:20,160
just walking away
 

7723
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:23,210
just walking away
are you aware of the drug of martyrdom

7724
02:35:23,210 --> 02:35:23,220

02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:34,130
that it can Cloud your thinking
probably one of the best questions I've

probably one of the best questions I've

um so let me let me try to sort it out

if I was somehow isolated from the rest

7788
02:36:39,290 --> 02:36:39,300
if I was somehow isolated from the rest
 

7789
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:40,849
if I was somehow isolated from the rest
of the world but I was in a place that

7790
02:36:40,849 --> 02:36:40,859
of the world but I was in a place that
 

7791
02:36:40,859 --> 02:36:42,950
of the world but I was in a place that
was biologically interesting you know

was biologically interesting you know
 

7793
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:45,590

not but you know if I were in that
 

7799
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:51,950
not but you know if I were in that
situation and I could just go out every

7800
02:36:51,950 --> 02:36:51,960
situation and I could just go out every
 

7801
02:36:51,960 --> 02:36:53,870
situation and I could just go out every
day and look at cool stuff and figure

7802
02:36:53,870 --> 02:36:53,880
day and look at cool stuff and figure
 

7803
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:56,030
day and look at cool stuff and figure
out what it means I could be all right

willingness to face the hazard rather
 

7919
02:39:08,460 --> 02:39:12,530
willingness to face the hazard rather
than a desire to face it because of the

um for me I actually expect us not to be
 

8009
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:12,170

okay and I'm not okay with that

8010
02:41:12,170 --> 02:41:12,180
okay and I'm not okay with that
 

8011
02:41:12,180 --> 02:41:15,290
okay and I'm not okay with that
but what's really important if I feel

8012
02:41:15,290 --> 02:41:15,300
but what's really important if I feel
 

8013
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:17,030
but what's really important if I feel
like what I've said is I don't know of

8014
02:41:17,030 --> 02:41:17,040
like what I've said is I don't know of
 

8015
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:19,849
like what I've said is I don't know of
any reason that it's too late as far as

8016
02:41:19,849 --> 02:41:19,859
any reason that it's too late as far as
 

8017
02:41:19,859 --> 02:41:22,309
any reason that it's too late as far as
I know we could still save humanity and

8018
02:41:22,309 --> 02:41:22,319
I know we could still save humanity and
 

8019
02:41:22,319 --> 02:41:23,870
I know we could still save humanity and
we could get to the fourth Frontier or

8020
02:41:23,870 --> 02:41:23,880
we could get to the fourth Frontier or
 

8021
02:41:23,880 --> 02:41:25,610
we could get to the fourth Frontier or
something akin to it

8022
02:41:25,610 --> 02:41:25,620
something akin to it
 

8023
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:27,710
something akin to it
but I expect it's not to I expect us to

8024
02:41:27,710 --> 02:41:27,720
but I expect it's not to I expect us to
 

8025
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:30,290
but I expect it's not to I expect us to
[\h__\h] it up right I don't like that

8026
02:41:30,290 --> 02:41:30,300
[\h__\h] it up right I don't like that
 

8027
02:41:30,300 --> 02:41:31,969
[\h__\h] it up right I don't like that
thought but I've looked into the abyss

8028
02:41:31,969 --> 02:41:31,979
thought but I've looked into the abyss
 

8029
02:41:31,979 --> 02:41:35,030
thought but I've looked into the abyss
and I've done my calculations and

8030
02:41:35,030 --> 02:41:35,040
and I've done my calculations and
 

8031
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:37,490
and I've done my calculations and
the number of ways we could not succeed

8032
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:37,500
the number of ways we could not succeed
 

8033
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:40,010
the number of ways we could not succeed
are many and the number of ways that we

8034
02:41:40,010 --> 02:41:40,020
are many and the number of ways that we
 

8035
02:41:40,020 --> 02:41:41,450
are many and the number of ways that we
could manage to get out of this very

8036
02:41:41,450 --> 02:41:41,460
could manage to get out of this very
 

8037
02:41:41,460 --> 02:41:44,690
could manage to get out of this very
dangerous phase of history is small but

8038
02:41:44,690 --> 02:41:44,700
dangerous phase of history is small but
 

8039
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:46,969
dangerous phase of history is small but
the thing I don't have to worry about

8040
02:41:46,969 --> 02:41:46,979
the thing I don't have to worry about
 

8041
02:41:46,979 --> 02:41:51,170
the thing I don't have to worry about
is that I didn't do enough right that I

8042
02:41:51,170 --> 02:41:51,180
is that I didn't do enough right that I
 

8043
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:55,130
is that I didn't do enough right that I
was a coward that I you know prioritized

8044
02:41:55,130 --> 02:41:55,140
was a coward that I you know prioritized
 

8045
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:56,809
was a coward that I you know prioritized
other things

8046
02:41:56,809 --> 02:41:56,819
other things
 

8047
02:41:56,819 --> 02:41:58,910
other things
at the end of the day I think I will be

8048
02:41:58,910 --> 02:41:58,920
at the end of the day I think I will be
 

8049
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:00,650
at the end of the day I think I will be
able to say to myself and in fact the

8050
02:42:00,650 --> 02:42:00,660
able to say to myself and in fact the
 

8051
02:42:00,660 --> 02:42:02,750
able to say to myself and in fact the
thing that allows me to sleep is that

8052
02:42:02,750 --> 02:42:02,760
thing that allows me to sleep is that
 

8053
02:42:02,760 --> 02:42:04,910
thing that allows me to sleep is that
when I saw clearly what needed to be

8054
02:42:04,910 --> 02:42:04,920
when I saw clearly what needed to be
 

8055
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:07,250
when I saw clearly what needed to be
done I tried to do it to the extent that

8056
02:42:07,250 --> 02:42:07,260
done I tried to do it to the extent that
 

8057
02:42:07,260 --> 02:42:10,010
done I tried to do it to the extent that
it was in my power and you know

to you as something like a personality

8066
02:42:20,570 --> 02:42:20,580
to you as something like a personality
 

8067
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:21,830
to you as something like a personality
defect

8068
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:21,840

8079
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:36,650
a good one for me to have it you know
the externalities of it are positive so

8080
02:42:36,650 --> 02:42:36,660
the externalities of it are positive so
 

8081
02:42:36,660 --> 02:42:38,570
the externalities of it are positive so
I don't feel too bad about it

8082
02:42:38,570 --> 02:42:38,580
I don't feel too bad about it
 

8083
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:41,210
I don't feel too bad about it
yeah that's funny so yeah our

8084
02:42:41,210 --> 02:42:41,220
yeah that's funny so yeah our
 

8085
02:42:41,220 --> 02:42:42,769
yeah that's funny so yeah our
perspective on the world

8086
02:42:42,769 --> 02:42:42,779
perspective on the world
 

8087
02:42:42,779 --> 02:42:44,990
perspective on the world
are different but they rhyme like you

8088
02:42:44,990 --> 02:42:45,000
are different but they rhyme like you
 

8089
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,090
are different but they rhyme like you
said because I I I've also looked into

8090
02:42:47,090 --> 02:42:47,100
said because I I I've also looked into
 

8091
02:42:47,100 --> 02:42:48,769
said because I I I've also looked into
the abyss and

8092
02:42:48,769 --> 02:42:48,779
the abyss and
 

8093
02:42:48,779 --> 02:42:53,150
the abyss and
it kind of smiled nervously back so I

8094
02:42:53,150 --> 02:42:53,160
it kind of smiled nervously back so I
 

8095
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:54,710
it kind of smiled nervously back so I
have uh I have a more optimistic sense

8096
02:42:54,710 --> 02:42:54,720
have uh I have a more optimistic sense
 

8097
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:56,929
have uh I have a more optimistic sense
that we're gonna win more than likely

8098
02:42:56,929 --> 02:42:56,939
that we're gonna win more than likely
 

8099
02:42:56,939 --> 02:42:58,910
that we're gonna win more than likely
we're going to be okay

8100
02:42:58,910 --> 02:42:58,920
we're going to be okay
 

8101
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:00,530
we're going to be okay
I'm right there with you brother I'm

8102
02:43:00,530 --> 02:43:00,540
I'm right there with you brother I'm
 

8103
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:02,750
I'm right there with you brother I'm
hoping you're right I'm expecting me to

8104
02:43:02,750 --> 02:43:02,760
hoping you're right I'm expecting me to
 

8105
02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:05,870
hoping you're right I'm expecting me to
be right but back to Eric because he had

8106
02:43:05,870 --> 02:43:05,880
be right but back to Eric because he had
 

8107
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:07,910
be right but back to Eric because he had
a wonderful conversation in that

8108
02:43:07,910 --> 02:43:07,920
a wonderful conversation in that
 

8109
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:10,010
a wonderful conversation in that
conversation he played the Big Brother

8110
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:10,020
conversation he played the Big Brother
 

8111
02:43:10,020 --> 02:43:13,790
conversation he played the Big Brother
role and he was very happy about it he

8112
02:43:13,790 --> 02:43:13,800
role and he was very happy about it he
 

8113
02:43:13,800 --> 02:43:16,510
role and he was very happy about it he
was self-congratulatory bought it I mean

8114
02:43:16,510 --> 02:43:16,520
was self-congratulatory bought it I mean
 

8115
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:19,370
was self-congratulatory bought it I mean
can you talk to

8116
02:43:19,370 --> 02:43:19,380
can you talk to
 

8117
02:43:19,380 --> 02:43:21,769
can you talk to
the ways in which Eric made you a better

8118
02:43:21,769 --> 02:43:21,779
the ways in which Eric made you a better
 

8119
02:43:21,779 --> 02:43:23,870
the ways in which Eric made you a better
man throughout your life

8120
02:43:23,870 --> 02:43:23,880
man throughout your life
 

8121
02:43:23,880 --> 02:43:26,750
man throughout your life
yeah hell yeah I mean for one thing you

8122
02:43:26,750 --> 02:43:26,760
yeah hell yeah I mean for one thing you
 

8123
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:29,929
yeah hell yeah I mean for one thing you
know Eric and I are interestingly

8124
02:43:29,929 --> 02:43:29,939
know Eric and I are interestingly
 

8125
02:43:29,939 --> 02:43:31,910
know Eric and I are interestingly
similar in some ways and radically

8126
02:43:31,910 --> 02:43:31,920
similar in some ways and radically
 

8127
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:33,590
similar in some ways and radically
different in some other ways and it you

8128
02:43:33,590 --> 02:43:33,600
different in some other ways and it you
 

8129
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:35,750
different in some other ways and it you
know it's often a matter of Fascination

8130
02:43:35,750 --> 02:43:35,760
know it's often a matter of Fascination
 

8131
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,250
know it's often a matter of Fascination
to people who know us both because

8132
02:43:37,250 --> 02:43:37,260
to people who know us both because
 

8133
02:43:37,260 --> 02:43:38,929
to people who know us both because
almost always people meet one of us

8134
02:43:38,929 --> 02:43:38,939
almost always people meet one of us
 

8135
02:43:38,939 --> 02:43:40,790
almost always people meet one of us
first and they sort of get used to that

8136
02:43:40,790 --> 02:43:40,800
first and they sort of get used to that
 

8137
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:42,050
first and they sort of get used to that
thing and then they meet the other and

8138
02:43:42,050 --> 02:43:42,060
thing and then they meet the other and
 

8139
02:43:42,060 --> 02:43:44,929
thing and then they meet the other and
it throws the model into chaos but you

8140
02:43:44,929 --> 02:43:44,939
it throws the model into chaos but you
 

8141
02:43:44,939 --> 02:43:47,690
it throws the model into chaos but you
know I had a great Advantage which is I

8142
02:43:47,690 --> 02:43:47,700
know I had a great Advantage which is I
 

8143
02:43:47,700 --> 02:43:50,510
know I had a great Advantage which is I
came second right so although it was

8144
02:43:50,510 --> 02:43:50,520
came second right so although it was
 

8145
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:52,370
came second right so although it was
kind of a pain in the ass to be born

8146
02:43:52,370 --> 02:43:52,380
kind of a pain in the ass to be born
 

8147
02:43:52,380 --> 02:43:54,050
kind of a pain in the ass to be born
into a world that had Eric in it because

8148
02:43:54,050 --> 02:43:54,060
into a world that had Eric in it because
 

8149
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:56,690
into a world that had Eric in it because
he's a force of nature right it was also

8150
02:43:56,690 --> 02:43:56,700
he's a force of nature right it was also
 

8151
02:43:56,700 --> 02:44:00,290
he's a force of nature right it was also
terrifically useful because a he was a

8152
02:44:00,290 --> 02:44:00,300
terrifically useful because a he was a
 

8153
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:04,010
terrifically useful because a he was a
very awesome older brother who you know

8154
02:44:04,010 --> 02:44:04,020
very awesome older brother who you know
 

8155
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:05,870
very awesome older brother who you know
made interesting mistakes learned from

8156
02:44:05,870 --> 02:44:05,880
made interesting mistakes learned from
 

8157
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:07,670
made interesting mistakes learned from
them and conveyed the wisdom of what he

8158
02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:07,680
them and conveyed the wisdom of what he
 

8159
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:11,510
them and conveyed the wisdom of what he
had discovered and that was uh you know

8160
02:44:11,510 --> 02:44:11,520
had discovered and that was uh you know
 

8161
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:13,550
had discovered and that was uh you know
I don't know who else ends up so lucky

8162
02:44:13,550 --> 02:44:13,560
I don't know who else ends up so lucky
 

8163
02:44:13,560 --> 02:44:16,670
I don't know who else ends up so lucky
as to have that kind of person blazing

8164
02:44:16,670 --> 02:44:16,680
as to have that kind of person blazing
 

8165
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:17,809
as to have that kind of person blazing
the trail

8166
02:44:17,809 --> 02:44:17,819
the trail
 

8167
02:44:17,819 --> 02:44:21,550
the trail
it also probably you know my my

8168
02:44:21,550 --> 02:44:21,560
it also probably you know my my
 

8169
02:44:21,560 --> 02:44:24,170
it also probably you know my my
hypothesis for what birth order effects

8170
02:44:24,170 --> 02:44:24,180
hypothesis for what birth order effects
 

8171
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:27,110
hypothesis for what birth order effects
are is that they're actually adaptive

8172
02:44:27,110 --> 02:44:27,120
are is that they're actually adaptive
 

8173
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:30,170
are is that they're actually adaptive
right that the reason that a second born

8174
02:44:30,170 --> 02:44:30,180
right that the reason that a second born
 

8175
02:44:30,180 --> 02:44:32,269
right that the reason that a second born
is different than a firstborn is that

8176
02:44:32,269 --> 02:44:32,279
is different than a firstborn is that
 

8177
02:44:32,279 --> 02:44:33,769
is different than a firstborn is that
they're not born into a world with the

8178
02:44:33,769 --> 02:44:33,779
they're not born into a world with the
 

8179
02:44:33,779 --> 02:44:36,170
they're not born into a world with the
same niches in it right and so the thing

8180
02:44:36,170 --> 02:44:36,180
same niches in it right and so the thing
 

8181
02:44:36,180 --> 02:44:37,550
same niches in it right and so the thing
about Eric

8182
02:44:37,550 --> 02:44:37,560
about Eric
 

8183
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:40,490
about Eric
is he's been completely dominant in the

8184
02:44:40,490 --> 02:44:40,500
is he's been completely dominant in the
 

8185
02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:44,570
is he's been completely dominant in the
realm of fundamental thinking right like

8186
02:44:44,570 --> 02:44:44,580
realm of fundamental thinking right like
 

8187
02:44:44,580 --> 02:44:46,309
realm of fundamental thinking right like
what he's fascinated by is the

8188
02:44:46,309 --> 02:44:46,319
what he's fascinated by is the
 

8189
02:44:46,319 --> 02:44:48,769
what he's fascinated by is the
fundamental of fundamentals and he's

8190
02:44:48,769 --> 02:44:48,779
fundamental of fundamentals and he's
 

8191
02:44:48,779 --> 02:44:50,990
fundamental of fundamentals and he's
excellent at it which meant that I was

8192
02:44:50,990 --> 02:44:51,000
excellent at it which meant that I was
 

8193
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,309
excellent at it which meant that I was
born into a world where somebody was

8194
02:44:52,309 --> 02:44:52,319
born into a world where somebody was
 

8195
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:54,650
born into a world where somebody was
becoming excellent in that and for me to

8196
02:44:54,650 --> 02:44:54,660
becoming excellent in that and for me to
 

8197
02:44:54,660 --> 02:44:56,570
becoming excellent in that and for me to
be anywhere near the fundamental of

8198
02:44:56,570 --> 02:44:56,580
be anywhere near the fundamental of
 

8199
02:44:56,580 --> 02:44:58,309
be anywhere near the fundamental of
fundamentals was going to be pointless

8200
02:44:58,309 --> 02:44:58,319
fundamentals was going to be pointless
 

8201
02:44:58,319 --> 02:44:59,630
fundamentals was going to be pointless
right I was going to be playing second

8202
02:44:59,630 --> 02:44:59,640
right I was going to be playing second
 

8203
02:44:59,640 --> 02:45:01,670
right I was going to be playing second
fiddle forever and I think that that

8204
02:45:01,670 --> 02:45:01,680
fiddle forever and I think that that
 

8205
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:04,070
fiddle forever and I think that that
actually drove me to the other end of

8206
02:45:04,070 --> 02:45:04,080
actually drove me to the other end of
 

8207
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:05,870
actually drove me to the other end of
the Continuum between fundamental and

8208
02:45:05,870 --> 02:45:05,880
the Continuum between fundamental and
 

8209
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:08,210
the Continuum between fundamental and
emergent and so I became fascinated with

8210
02:45:08,210 --> 02:45:08,220
emergent and so I became fascinated with
 

8211
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:11,450
emergent and so I became fascinated with
Biology and have been since I was

8212
02:45:11,450 --> 02:45:11,460
Biology and have been since I was
 

8213
02:45:11,460 --> 02:45:15,050
Biology and have been since I was
three years old right I think Eric drove

8214
02:45:15,050 --> 02:45:15,060
three years old right I think Eric drove
 

8215
02:45:15,060 --> 02:45:17,090
three years old right I think Eric drove
that and I have to thank him for it

8216
02:45:17,090 --> 02:45:17,100
that and I have to thank him for it
 

8217
02:45:17,100 --> 02:45:18,110
that and I have to thank him for it
because

8218
02:45:18,110 --> 02:45:18,120
because
 

8219
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:21,170
because
you know I mean I never thought of so

8220
02:45:21,170 --> 02:45:21,180
you know I mean I never thought of so
 

8221
02:45:21,180 --> 02:45:24,349
you know I mean I never thought of so
Eric drives towards the fundamental and

8222
02:45:24,349 --> 02:45:24,359
Eric drives towards the fundamental and
 

8223
02:45:24,359 --> 02:45:26,210
Eric drives towards the fundamental and
you drive towards the emergent

8224
02:45:26,210 --> 02:45:26,220
you drive towards the emergent
 

8225
02:45:26,220 --> 02:45:28,550
you drive towards the emergent
the physics and the biology right

8226
02:45:28,550 --> 02:45:28,560
the physics and the biology right
 

8227
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:30,950
the physics and the biology right
opposite ends of the Continuum and as

8228
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:30,960
opposite ends of the Continuum and as
 

8229
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:32,929
opposite ends of the Continuum and as
Eric would be quick to point out if he

8230
02:45:32,929 --> 02:45:32,939
Eric would be quick to point out if he
 

8231
02:45:32,939 --> 02:45:35,570
Eric would be quick to point out if he
was sitting here I treat the emergent

8232
02:45:35,570 --> 02:45:35,580
was sitting here I treat the emergent
 

8233
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:37,790
was sitting here I treat the emergent
layer I seek the fundamentals in it

8234
02:45:37,790 --> 02:45:37,800

once you can sequence genes

02:48:42,230 --> 02:48:42,240
once you can sequence genes
 

8385
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:44,450
once you can sequence genes
genes can spit so much data at you that

8386
02:48:44,450 --> 02:48:44,460
genes can spit so much data at you that
 

8387
02:48:44,460 --> 02:48:47,269
genes can spit so much data at you that
you can overwhelm high quality work with

you can overwhelm high quality work with

systematists who are the last of the

8396
02:48:56,389 --> 02:48:56,399
systematists who are the last of the
 

8397
02:48:56,399 --> 02:48:58,190
systematists who are the last of the
greats because what's replacing them as

8398
02:48:58,190 --> 02:48:58,200
greats because what's replacing them as
 

8399
02:48:58,200 --> 02:49:01,849
greats because what's replacing them as
sequencers so anyway I maybe you're

8400
02:49:01,849 --> 02:49:01,859
sequencers so anyway I maybe you're
 

8401
02:49:01,859 --> 02:49:05,990
sequencers so anyway I maybe you're
right about the AI and I guess you said

8402
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:06,000
right about the AI and I guess you said
 

8403
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,570
right about the AI and I guess you said
I like figuring stuff out is there

8404
02:49:08,570 --> 02:49:08,580
I like figuring stuff out is there
 

8405
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:11,030
I like figuring stuff out is there
something that you disagree with aricon

8406
02:49:11,030 --> 02:49:11,040
something that you disagree with aricon
 

8407
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:13,370
something that you disagree with aricon
they've been trying to convince them and

8408
02:49:13,370 --> 02:49:13,380
they've been trying to convince them and
 

8409
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:16,670
they've been trying to convince them and
you've failed so far but uh you will

8410
02:49:16,670 --> 02:49:16,680
you've failed so far but uh you will
 

8411
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:18,469
you've failed so far but uh you will
eventually succeed

8412
02:49:18,469 --> 02:49:18,479
eventually succeed
 

8413
02:49:18,479 --> 02:49:20,809
eventually succeed
you know that is a very long list Eric

8414
02:49:20,809 --> 02:49:20,819
you know that is a very long list Eric
 

8415
02:49:20,819 --> 02:49:23,809
you know that is a very long list Eric
and I have have uh tensions over certain

8416
02:49:23,809 --> 02:49:23,819
and I have have uh tensions over certain
 

8417
02:49:23,819 --> 02:49:27,469
and I have have uh tensions over certain
things that recur all the time and I'm

8418
02:49:27,469 --> 02:49:27,479
things that recur all the time and I'm
 

8419
02:49:27,479 --> 02:49:29,030
things that recur all the time and I'm
trying to think what would be you know

8420
02:49:29,030 --> 02:49:29,040
trying to think what would be you know
 

8421
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:31,250
trying to think what would be you know
the idea in the space of Science and the

well all right let me I'm just going to

8428
02:49:40,910 --> 02:49:40,920
well all right let me I'm just going to
 

8429
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:44,030
well all right let me I'm just going to
use your podcast to uh make a bit of

8430
02:49:44,030 --> 02:49:44,040
use your podcast to uh make a bit of
 

8431
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:46,610
use your podcast to uh make a bit of
cryptic war and just say there are many

8432
02:49:46,610 --> 02:49:46,620
cryptic war and just say there are many
 

8433
02:49:46,620 --> 02:49:49,610
cryptic war and just say there are many
places in which I believe that I have

8434
02:49:49,610 --> 02:49:49,620
places in which I believe that I have
 

8435
02:49:49,620 --> 02:49:51,410
places in which I believe that I have
butted heads with Eric over the course

8436
02:49:51,410 --> 02:49:51,420
butted heads with Eric over the course
 

8437
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:54,110
butted heads with Eric over the course
of decades and I have seen him move in

8438
02:49:54,110 --> 02:49:54,120
of decades and I have seen him move in
 

8439
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:56,750
of decades and I have seen him move in
my direction substantially over you've

8440
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:56,760
my direction substantially over you've
 

8441
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:58,849
my direction substantially over you've
been winning he might he might win a

8442
02:49:58,849 --> 02:49:58,859
been winning he might he might win a
 

8443
02:49:58,859 --> 02:49:59,929
been winning he might he might win a
battle here or there but you've been

8444
02:49:59,929 --> 02:49:59,939
battle here or there but you've been
 

8445
02:49:59,939 --> 02:50:01,730
battle here or there but you've been
winning the war I would not say that

8446
02:50:01,730 --> 02:50:01,740
winning the war I would not say that
 

8447
02:50:01,740 --> 02:50:03,889
winning the war I would not say that
it's quite possible he could say the

8448
02:50:03,889 --> 02:50:03,899
it's quite possible he could say the
 

8449
02:50:03,899 --> 02:50:05,630
it's quite possible he could say the
same thing about me and in fact I know

8450
02:50:05,630 --> 02:50:05,640
same thing about me and in fact I know
 

8451
02:50:05,640 --> 02:50:07,130
same thing about me and in fact I know
that it's true there are places where

8452
02:50:07,130 --> 02:50:07,140
that it's true there are places where
 

8453
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:09,530
that it's true there are places where
he's absolutely convinced me but in any

8454
02:50:09,530 --> 02:50:09,540
he's absolutely convinced me but in any
 

8455
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:11,929
he's absolutely convinced me but in any
case I do believe it's at least you know

8456
02:50:11,929 --> 02:50:11,939
case I do believe it's at least you know
 

8457
02:50:11,939 --> 02:50:13,490
case I do believe it's at least you know
it may not be a totally even fight but

8458
02:50:13,490 --> 02:50:13,500
it may not be a totally even fight but
 

8459
02:50:13,500 --> 02:50:14,809
it may not be a totally even fight but
it's it's more even than some will

8460
02:50:14,809 --> 02:50:14,819
it's it's more even than some will
 

8461
02:50:14,819 --> 02:50:16,550
it's it's more even than some will
imagine

8462
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:16,560
imagine
 

8463
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:18,590
imagine
um but yeah we have um

8464
02:50:18,590 --> 02:50:18,600
um but yeah we have um
 

8465
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:20,030
um but yeah we have um
you know there are things I say that

8466
02:50:20,030 --> 02:50:20,040
you know there are things I say that
 

8467
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:22,190
you know there are things I say that
drive him nuts

8468
02:50:22,190 --> 02:50:22,200
drive him nuts
 

8469
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:25,309
drive him nuts
right like when something you know like

8470
02:50:25,309 --> 02:50:25,319
right like when something you know like
 

8471
02:50:25,319 --> 02:50:28,250
right like when something you know like
you heard me talk about the um

8472
02:50:28,250 --> 02:50:28,260
you heard me talk about the um
 

8473
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:32,630
you heard me talk about the um
what was it it was the autopilot that

8474
02:50:32,630 --> 02:50:32,640
what was it it was the autopilot that
 

8475
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:34,969
what was it it was the autopilot that
seems to be putting a great many humans

8476
02:50:34,969 --> 02:50:34,979
seems to be putting a great many humans
 

8477
02:50:34,979 --> 02:50:38,210
seems to be putting a great many humans
in needless medical Jeopardy over the

8478
02:50:38,210 --> 02:50:38,220
in needless medical Jeopardy over the
 

8479

covid-19 pandemic
 

8481
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:43,790
covid-19 pandemic
and my feeling is we can say this almost

8482
02:50:43,790 --> 02:50:43,800
and my feeling is we can say this almost
 

8483
02:50:43,800 --> 02:50:45,410
and my feeling is we can say this almost
for sure

8484
02:50:45,410 --> 02:50:45,420
for sure
 

8485
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:48,010
for sure
anytime you have the appearance of some

8486
02:50:48,010 --> 02:50:48,020
anytime you have the appearance of some
 

8487
02:50:48,020 --> 02:50:51,290
anytime you have the appearance of some
captured gigantic entity that is

8488
02:50:51,290 --> 02:50:51,300
captured gigantic entity that is
 

8489
02:50:51,300 --> 02:50:53,870
captured gigantic entity that is
censoring you on YouTube and you know

8490
02:50:53,870 --> 02:50:53,880
censoring you on YouTube and you know

02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:55,969
censoring you on YouTube and you know
handing down dictates from The Who and

8492

handing down dictates from The Who and
 

8493
02:50:55,979 --> 02:50:58,429
handing down dictates from The Who and
all of that it is sure that there will

8494
02:50:58,429 --> 02:50:58,439
all of that it is sure that there will
 

8495
02:50:58,439 --> 02:51:01,250
all of that it is sure that there will
be a certain amount of collusion right

8496
02:51:01,250 --> 02:51:01,260
be a certain amount of collusion right
 

8497
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:02,570
be a certain amount of collusion right
there's going to be some embarrassing

8498
02:51:02,570 --> 02:51:02,580
there's going to be some embarrassing
 

8499
02:51:02,580 --> 02:51:04,429
there's going to be some embarrassing
emails in some places that are going to

8500
02:51:04,429 --> 02:51:04,439
emails in some places that are going to
 

8501
02:51:04,439 --> 02:51:06,230
emails in some places that are going to
reveal some shocking connections and

8502
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:06,240
reveal some shocking connections and
 

8503
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:08,510
reveal some shocking connections and
then there's going to be an awful lot of

8504
02:51:08,510 --> 02:51:08,520
then there's going to be an awful lot of
 

8505
02:51:08,520 --> 02:51:11,090
then there's going to be an awful lot of
emergence that didn't involve collusion

8506
02:51:11,090 --> 02:51:11,100
emergence that didn't involve collusion
 

8507
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:12,590
emergence that didn't involve collusion
right in which people were doing their

8508
02:51:12,590 --> 02:51:12,600
right in which people were doing their
 

8509
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:14,150
right in which people were doing their
little part of a job and something was

8510
02:51:14,150 --> 02:51:14,160
little part of a job and something was
 

8511
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:15,290
little part of a job and something was
emerging and you never know what the

8512
02:51:15,290 --> 02:51:15,300
emerging and you never know what the
 

8513
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:16,610
emerging and you never know what the
admixture is

8514
02:51:16,610 --> 02:51:16,620
admixture is
 

8515
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:19,190
admixture is
how much are we looking at actual

8516
02:51:19,190 --> 02:51:19,200
how much are we looking at actual
 

8517
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:20,750
how much are we looking at actual
collusion and how much are we looking at

8518
02:51:20,750 --> 02:51:20,760
collusion and how much are we looking at
 

8519
02:51:20,760 --> 02:51:22,070
collusion and how much are we looking at
an emergent process but you should

8520
02:51:22,070 --> 02:51:22,080
an emergent process but you should
 

8521
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:23,929
an emergent process but you should
always walk in with the sense that it's

8522
02:51:23,929 --> 02:51:23,939
always walk in with the sense that it's
 

8523
02:51:23,939 --> 02:51:25,610
always walk in with the sense that it's
going to be a ratio and the question is

8524
02:51:25,610 --> 02:51:25,620
going to be a ratio and the question is
 

8525
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:28,010
going to be a ratio and the question is
what is the ratio in this case I think

8526
02:51:28,010 --> 02:51:28,020
what is the ratio in this case I think
 

8527
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:29,870
what is the ratio in this case I think
this drives Eric nuts

8528
02:51:29,870 --> 02:51:29,880
this drives Eric nuts
 

8529
02:51:29,880 --> 02:51:32,090
this drives Eric nuts
um because he is very focused on the

8530
02:51:32,090 --> 02:51:32,100
um because he is very focused on the
 

8531
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:33,710
um because he is very focused on the
people I think he's focused on the

8532
02:51:33,710 --> 02:51:33,720
people I think he's focused on the
 

8533
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:35,690
people I think he's focused on the
people who have a choice and make the

8534
02:51:35,690 --> 02:51:35,700
people who have a choice and make the
 

8535
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:36,769
people who have a choice and make the
wrong one

8536
02:51:36,769 --> 02:51:36,779
wrong one
 

8537
02:51:36,779 --> 02:51:39,230
wrong one
and anyway he made a question of the

8538
02:51:39,230 --> 02:51:39,240
and anyway he made a question of the
 

8539
02:51:39,240 --> 02:51:42,050
and anyway he made a question of the
ratio as a distraction to that I think I

8540
02:51:42,050 --> 02:51:42,060
ratio as a distraction to that I think I
 

8541
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:44,929
ratio as a distraction to that I think I
think he takes it almost as an offense

8542
02:51:44,929 --> 02:51:44,939
think he takes it almost as an offense
 

8543
02:51:44,939 --> 02:51:49,670
think he takes it almost as an offense
because it grants cover to people who

8544
02:51:49,670 --> 02:51:49,680
because it grants cover to people who
 

8545
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:52,190
because it grants cover to people who
are harming others and I think I think

8546
02:51:52,190 --> 02:51:52,200
are harming others and I think I think
 

8547
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:53,929
are harming others and I think I think
it offends him

8548
02:51:53,929 --> 02:51:53,939
it offends him
 

8549
02:51:53,939 --> 02:51:55,969
it offends him
uh morally

8550
02:51:55,969 --> 02:51:55,979
uh morally
 

8551
02:51:55,979 --> 02:51:58,969
uh morally
and if I had to say I would say it it

8552
02:51:58,969 --> 02:51:58,979
and if I had to say I would say it it
 

8553
02:51:58,979 --> 02:52:01,910
and if I had to say I would say it it
Alters his judgment on the matter

8554
02:52:01,910 --> 02:52:01,920
Alters his judgment on the matter
 

8555
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:03,290
Alters his judgment on the matter
um but anyway

8556
02:52:03,290 --> 02:52:03,300
um but anyway
 

8557
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:05,630
um but anyway
certainly useful just to leave open the

8558
02:52:05,630 --> 02:52:05,640
certainly useful just to leave open the
 

8559
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:07,309
certainly useful just to leave open the
two possibilities and say it's a ratio

8560
02:52:07,309 --> 02:52:07,319
two possibilities and say it's a ratio
 

8561
02:52:07,319 --> 02:52:10,309
two possibilities and say it's a ratio
but we don't know which one

8562
02:52:10,309 --> 02:52:10,319

 

8563
02:52:10,319 --> 02:52:14,210

brother to brother do you love the guy

8564
02:52:14,210 --> 02:52:14,220
brother to brother do you love the guy
 

8565
02:52:14,220 --> 02:52:16,670
brother to brother do you love the guy
hell yeah hell yeah and you know I'd

8566
02:52:16,670 --> 02:52:16,680
hell yeah hell yeah and you know I'd
 

8567
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:18,410
hell yeah hell yeah and you know I'd
love him if he was just my brother but

8568
02:52:18,410 --> 02:52:18,420
love him if he was just my brother but
 

8569
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:21,050
love him if he was just my brother but
he's also awesome so I I love him and I

8570
02:52:21,050 --> 02:52:21,060
he's also awesome so I I love him and I
 

8571
02:52:21,060 --> 02:52:23,030
he's also awesome so I I love him and I
love him for who he is

8572
02:52:23,030 --> 02:52:23,040
love him for who he is
 

8573
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:25,670
love him for who he is
so let me ask you about uh back to your

8574
02:52:25,670 --> 02:52:25,680
so let me ask you about uh back to your
 

8575
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:28,370
so let me ask you about uh back to your
book Hunter gatherer's Guide to the 21st

8576
02:52:28,370 --> 02:52:28,380
book Hunter gatherer's Guide to the 21st

book Hunter gatherer's Guide to the 21st
century

8578
02:52:29,510 --> 02:52:29,520
century
 

8579
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:32,330
century
I can't wait both for the book and the

8580
02:52:32,330 --> 02:52:32,340
I can't wait both for the book and the
 

8581
02:52:32,340 --> 02:52:34,250
I can't wait both for the book and the
videos you do on the book that's really

8582
02:52:34,250 --> 02:52:34,260
videos you do on the book that's really
 

8583
02:52:34,260 --> 02:52:35,990
videos you do on the book that's really
exciting that there's like a structured

8584
02:52:35,990 --> 02:52:36,000
exciting that there's like a structured
 

8585
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,570
exciting that there's like a structured
organized way to present this

8586
02:52:38,570 --> 02:52:38,580
organized way to present this
 

8587
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:39,590
organized way to present this
um

8588
02:52:39,590 --> 02:52:39,600
um
 

8589
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:42,530
um
I kind of uh

8590
02:52:42,530 --> 02:52:42,540
I kind of uh
 

8591
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:44,510
I kind of uh
from an evolutionary biology perspective

8592
02:52:44,510 --> 02:52:44,520
from an evolutionary biology perspective
 

8593
02:52:44,520 --> 02:52:48,769
from an evolutionary biology perspective
a guide for the future using our past at

8594
02:52:48,769 --> 02:52:48,779
a guide for the future using our past at
 

8595
02:52:48,779 --> 02:52:51,530
a guide for the future using our past at
its the fundamental of the emergent way

8596
02:52:51,530 --> 02:52:51,540
its the fundamental of the emergent way
 

8597
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:55,969
its the fundamental of the emergent way
uh to uh present a picture of the future

8598
02:52:55,969 --> 02:52:55,979
uh to uh present a picture of the future
 

8599
02:52:55,979 --> 02:53:00,530
uh to uh present a picture of the future
let me ask you about uh something that

8600
02:53:00,530 --> 02:53:00,540
let me ask you about uh something that
 

8601
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:02,269
let me ask you about uh something that
you know I think about a little bit in

8602
02:53:02,269 --> 02:53:02,279
you know I think about a little bit in
 

8603
02:53:02,279 --> 02:53:07,550
you know I think about a little bit in
this modern world which is monogamy

8604
02:53:07,550 --> 02:53:07,560

 

8605
02:53:07,560 --> 02:53:10,790

so I personally value monogamy one girl

8606
02:53:10,790 --> 02:53:10,800
so I personally value monogamy one girl
 

8607
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:14,269
so I personally value monogamy one girl
ride or die there you go right or no

8608
02:53:14,269 --> 02:53:14,279
ride or die there you go right or no
 

8609
02:53:14,279 --> 02:53:18,590
ride or die there you go right or no
that's exactly it but that said

8610
02:53:18,590 --> 02:53:18,600
that's exactly it but that said
 

8611
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:21,950
that's exactly it but that said
I'd I don't know what's the right way to

8612
02:53:21,950 --> 02:53:21,960
I'd I don't know what's the right way to
 

8613
02:53:21,960 --> 02:53:24,650
I'd I don't know what's the right way to
approach this but

8614
02:53:24,650 --> 02:53:24,660
approach this but
 

8615
02:53:24,660 --> 02:53:27,050
approach this but
from an evolutionary biology perspective

8616
02:53:27,050 --> 02:53:27,060
from an evolutionary biology perspective
 

8617
02:53:27,060 --> 02:53:29,590
from an evolutionary biology perspective
or from just looking at modern society

8618
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:29,600
or from just looking at modern society
 

8619
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:33,650
or from just looking at modern society
that seems to be an idea that's not

8620
02:53:33,650 --> 02:53:33,660
that seems to be an idea that's not
 

8621
02:53:33,660 --> 02:53:34,849
that seems to be an idea that's not
um what's the right way to put it

8622
02:53:34,849 --> 02:53:34,859
um what's the right way to put it
 

8623
02:53:34,859 --> 02:53:36,889
um what's the right way to put it
flourishing

8624
02:53:36,889 --> 02:53:36,899
flourishing
 

8625
02:53:36,899 --> 02:53:40,730
flourishing
it is waning it's waning

8626
02:53:40,730 --> 02:53:40,740
it is waning it's waning
 

8627
02:53:40,740 --> 02:53:44,030
it is waning it's waning
um so I suppose based on your reaction

8628
02:53:44,030 --> 02:53:44,040
um so I suppose based on your reaction
 

8629
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:46,190
um so I suppose based on your reaction
you're also a supporter of monogamy or

8630
02:53:46,190 --> 02:53:46,200
you're also a supporter of monogamy or
 

8631
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:48,710
you're also a supporter of monogamy or
the you value monogamy are you and I

8632
02:53:48,710 --> 02:53:48,720
the you value monogamy are you and I
 

8633
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:49,969
the you value monogamy are you and I
just

8634
02:53:49,969 --> 02:53:49,979
just
 

8635
02:53:49,979 --> 02:53:53,090
just
um delusional

8636
02:53:53,090 --> 02:53:53,100

 

8637
02:53:53,100 --> 02:53:56,389

um what can you say about monogamy

8638
02:53:56,389 --> 02:53:56,399
um what can you say about monogamy
 

8639
02:53:56,399 --> 02:53:58,610
um what can you say about monogamy
from the context of your book from the

8640
02:53:58,610 --> 02:53:58,620
from the context of your book from the
 

8641
02:53:58,620 --> 02:54:01,130
from the context of your book from the
context of evolutionary biology from the

8642
02:54:01,130 --> 02:54:01,140
context of evolutionary biology from the
 

8643
02:54:01,140 --> 02:54:03,889
context of evolutionary biology from the
context of Being Human yeah I can say

8644
02:54:03,889 --> 02:54:03,899
context of Being Human yeah I can say
 

8645
02:54:03,899 --> 02:54:05,510
context of Being Human yeah I can say
that I fully believe that we are

8646
02:54:05,510 --> 02:54:05,520
that I fully believe that we are
 

8647
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:07,550
that I fully believe that we are
actually enlightened and that although

8648
02:54:07,550 --> 02:54:07,560
actually enlightened and that although
 

8649
02:54:07,560 --> 02:54:10,490
actually enlightened and that although
monogamy is waning that it is not waning

8650
02:54:10,490 --> 02:54:10,500
monogamy is waning that it is not waning
 

8651
02:54:10,500 --> 02:54:12,710
monogamy is waning that it is not waning
because there is a superior system it is

8652
02:54:12,710 --> 02:54:12,720
because there is a superior system it is
 

8653
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:16,849
because there is a superior system it is
waiting for predictable other reasons so

8654
02:54:16,849 --> 02:54:16,859
waiting for predictable other reasons so
 

8655
02:54:16,859 --> 02:54:19,990
waiting for predictable other reasons so
let us just say it is there's a lot of

8656
02:54:19,990 --> 02:54:20,000
let us just say it is there's a lot of
 

8657
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:23,389
let us just say it is there's a lot of
pre-trans fallacy here where

8658
02:54:23,389 --> 02:54:23,399
pre-trans fallacy here where
 

8659
02:54:23,399 --> 02:54:25,309
pre-trans fallacy here where
people go through a phase where they

8660
02:54:25,309 --> 02:54:25,319
people go through a phase where they
 

8661
02:54:25,319 --> 02:54:27,590
people go through a phase where they
recognize that actually we know a lot

8662
02:54:27,590 --> 02:54:27,600
recognize that actually we know a lot
 

8663
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:32,330
recognize that actually we know a lot
about the evolution of monogamy and we

8664
02:54:32,330 --> 02:54:32,340
about the evolution of monogamy and we
 

8665
02:54:32,340 --> 02:54:34,429
about the evolution of monogamy and we
can tell from the fact that humans are

8666
02:54:34,429 --> 02:54:34,439
can tell from the fact that humans are
 

8667
02:54:34,439 --> 02:54:36,590
can tell from the fact that humans are
somewhat sexually dimorphic

8668
02:54:36,590 --> 02:54:36,600
somewhat sexually dimorphic
 

8669
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:38,809
somewhat sexually dimorphic
that there has been a lot of polygeny in

8670
02:54:38,809 --> 02:54:38,819
that there has been a lot of polygeny in
 

8671
02:54:38,819 --> 02:54:40,429
that there has been a lot of polygeny in
human history

8672
02:54:40,429 --> 02:54:40,439
human history
 

8673
02:54:40,439 --> 02:54:43,250
human history
and in fact most of human history was

8674
02:54:43,250 --> 02:54:43,260
and in fact most of human history was
 

8675
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:45,050
and in fact most of human history was
largely poligenous

8676
02:54:45,050 --> 02:54:45,060
largely poligenous
 

8677
02:54:45,060 --> 02:54:48,469
largely poligenous
but it is also the case that most of the

8678
02:54:48,469 --> 02:54:48,479
but it is also the case that most of the
 

8679
02:54:48,479 --> 02:54:50,570
but it is also the case that most of the
people on Earth today belong to

8680
02:54:50,570 --> 02:54:50,580
people on Earth today belong to
 

8681
02:54:50,580 --> 02:54:51,830
people on Earth today belong to
civilizations that are at least

8682
02:54:51,830 --> 02:54:51,840
civilizations that are at least
 

8683
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:54,230
civilizations that are at least
nominally monogamous and have practiced

8684
02:54:54,230 --> 02:54:54,240
nominally monogamous and have practiced
 

8685
02:54:54,240 --> 02:54:56,590
nominally monogamous and have practiced
monogamy and that's not

8686
02:54:56,590 --> 02:54:56,600
monogamy and that's not
 

8687
02:54:56,600 --> 02:54:59,510
monogamy and that's not
anti-evolutionary what that is is part

8688
02:54:59,510 --> 02:54:59,520
anti-evolutionary what that is is part
 

8689
02:54:59,520 --> 02:55:01,849
anti-evolutionary what that is is part
of what I mentioned before where human

8690
02:55:01,849 --> 02:55:01,859
of what I mentioned before where human
 

8691
02:55:01,859 --> 02:55:04,010
of what I mentioned before where human
beings can swap out their software

8692
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:04,020
beings can swap out their software
 

8693
02:55:04,020 --> 02:55:05,210
beings can swap out their software
program

8694
02:55:05,210 --> 02:55:05,220
program
 

8695
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:09,110
program
and different mating patterns are uh

8696
02:55:09,110 --> 02:55:09,120
and different mating patterns are uh
 

8697
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:11,450
and different mating patterns are uh
favored in different periods of History

8698
02:55:11,450 --> 02:55:11,460
favored in different periods of History
 

8699
02:55:11,460 --> 02:55:14,389
favored in different periods of History
so I would argue that the benefit of

8700
02:55:14,389 --> 02:55:14,399
so I would argue that the benefit of
 

8701
02:55:14,399 --> 02:55:16,790
so I would argue that the benefit of
monogamy the primary one that drives the

8702
02:55:16,790 --> 02:55:16,800
monogamy the primary one that drives the
 

8703
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:18,650
monogamy the primary one that drives the
evolution of monogamous patterns in

8704
02:55:18,650 --> 02:55:18,660
evolution of monogamous patterns in
 

8705
02:55:18,660 --> 02:55:22,670
evolution of monogamous patterns in
humans is that it brings all adults into

8706
02:55:22,670 --> 02:55:22,680
humans is that it brings all adults into
 

8707
02:55:22,680 --> 02:55:24,710
humans is that it brings all adults into
child rearing

8708
02:55:24,710 --> 02:55:24,720
child rearing
 

8709
02:55:24,720 --> 02:55:26,990
child rearing
now the reason that that matters is

8710
02:55:26,990 --> 02:55:27,000
now the reason that that matters is
 

8711
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,330
now the reason that that matters is
because human babies are very labor

8712
02:55:29,330 --> 02:55:29,340
because human babies are very labor
 

8713
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:30,830
because human babies are very labor
intensive in order to raise them

8714
02:55:30,830 --> 02:55:30,840
intensive in order to raise them
 

8715
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:33,710
intensive in order to raise them
properly having two parents is a huge

8716
02:55:33,710 --> 02:55:33,720
properly having two parents is a huge
 

8717
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:35,450
properly having two parents is a huge
asset and having more than two parents

8718
02:55:35,450 --> 02:55:35,460
asset and having more than two parents
 

8719
02:55:35,460 --> 02:55:38,210
asset and having more than two parents
having an extended family also is very

8720
02:55:38,210 --> 02:55:38,220
having an extended family also is very
 

8721
02:55:38,220 --> 02:55:39,530
having an extended family also is very
important

8722
02:55:39,530 --> 02:55:39,540
important
 

8723
02:55:39,540 --> 02:55:41,990
important
but what that means

8724
02:55:41,990 --> 02:55:42,000
but what that means
 

8725
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,910
but what that means
is that for a population that is

8726
02:55:43,910 --> 02:55:43,920
is that for a population that is
 

8727
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:45,290
is that for a population that is
expanding

8728
02:55:45,290 --> 02:55:45,300
expanding
 

8729
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:47,809
expanding
a monogamous mating system makes sense

8730
02:55:47,809 --> 02:55:47,819
a monogamous mating system makes sense
 

8731
02:55:47,819 --> 02:55:49,910
a monogamous mating system makes sense
it makes sense because it means that the

8732
02:55:49,910 --> 02:55:49,920
it makes sense because it means that the
 

8733
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:51,469
it makes sense because it means that the
number of offspring that can be raised

8734
02:55:51,469 --> 02:55:51,479
number of offspring that can be raised
 

8735
02:55:51,479 --> 02:55:55,130
number of offspring that can be raised
is elevated it's elevated because all

8736
02:55:55,130 --> 02:55:55,140
is elevated it's elevated because all
 

8737
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:57,170
is elevated it's elevated because all
potential parents are involved in

8738
02:55:57,170 --> 02:55:57,180
potential parents are involved in
 

8739
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:59,450
potential parents are involved in
parenting whereas if you sideline a

8740
02:55:59,450 --> 02:55:59,460
parenting whereas if you sideline a
 

8741
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:01,250
parenting whereas if you sideline a
bunch of males by having a polygenous

8742
02:56:01,250 --> 02:56:01,260
bunch of males by having a polygenous
 

8743
02:56:01,260 --> 02:56:02,750
bunch of males by having a polygenous
system in which one male has many

8744
02:56:02,750 --> 02:56:02,760
system in which one male has many
 

8745
02:56:02,760 --> 02:56:04,429
system in which one male has many
females which is typically the way that

8746
02:56:04,429 --> 02:56:04,439
females which is typically the way that
 

8747
02:56:04,439 --> 02:56:06,650
females which is typically the way that
works what you do is you sideline all

8748
02:56:06,650 --> 02:56:06,660
works what you do is you sideline all
 

8749
02:56:06,660 --> 02:56:08,150
works what you do is you sideline all
those males which means the total amount

8750
02:56:08,150 --> 02:56:08,160
those males which means the total amount
 

8751
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:10,610
those males which means the total amount
of Parental effort is lower and the

8752
02:56:10,610 --> 02:56:10,620
of Parental effort is lower and the
 

8753
02:56:10,620 --> 02:56:13,070
of Parental effort is lower and the
population can't grow so what what I'm

8754
02:56:13,070 --> 02:56:13,080
population can't grow so what what I'm
 

8755
02:56:13,080 --> 02:56:16,730
population can't grow so what what I'm
arguing is that you should expect to see

8756
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:16,740
arguing is that you should expect to see
 

8757
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:19,730
arguing is that you should expect to see
populations that face the possibility of

8758
02:56:19,730 --> 02:56:19,740
populations that face the possibility of
 

8759
02:56:19,740 --> 02:56:22,429
populations that face the possibility of
expansion endorse monogamy and at the

8760
02:56:22,429 --> 02:56:22,439
expansion endorse monogamy and at the
 

8761
02:56:22,439 --> 02:56:23,570
expansion endorse monogamy and at the
point that they have reached carrying

8762
02:56:23,570 --> 02:56:23,580
point that they have reached carrying
 

8763
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:24,889
point that they have reached carrying
capacity you should expect to see

02:56:24,889 --> 02:56:24,899
capacity you should expect to see
 

8765
02:56:24,899 --> 02:56:27,290
capacity you should expect to see
polygeny break back out and what we are

8766
02:56:27,290 --> 02:56:27,300
polygeny break back out and what we are
 

8767
02:56:27,300 --> 02:56:29,750
polygeny break back out and what we are
seeing is a kind of false sophistication

8768
02:56:29,750 --> 02:56:29,760
seeing is a kind of false sophistication
 

8769
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:32,690
seeing is a kind of false sophistication
around polyamory which will end up

02:56:32,690 --> 02:56:32,700
around polyamory which will end up
 

8771
02:56:32,700 --> 02:56:35,809
around polyamory which will end up
breaking down into polygyny which will

8772
02:56:35,809 --> 02:56:35,819
breaking down into polygyny which will
 

8773
02:56:35,819 --> 02:56:37,309
breaking down into polygyny which will
not be in the interests of most people

not be in the interests of most people

really the only people whose interests

02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:42,290
really the only people whose interests
it could be argued to be in would be the

it could be argued to be in would be the
 

8779
02:56:42,300 --> 02:56:43,969
it could be argued to be in would be the
very small number of males at the top

8780
02:56:43,969 --> 02:56:43,979
very small number of males at the top
 

8781
02:56:43,979 --> 02:56:47,630
very small number of males at the top
who have many partners and everybody

who have many partners and everybody
 

8783
02:56:47,640 --> 02:56:50,450
who have many partners and everybody
else suffers is it possible to make the

else suffers is it possible to make the
 

8785
02:56:50,460 --> 02:56:52,969
else suffers is it possible to make the
argument if we focus in on those males

8786
02:56:52,969 --> 02:56:52,979
argument if we focus in on those males
 

8787
02:56:52,979 --> 02:56:56,090
argument if we focus in on those males
at the quote-unquote top with many

02:56:56,090 --> 02:56:56,100
at the quote-unquote top with many

at the quote-unquote top with many
female Partners is it possible to say

8790
02:56:59,389 --> 02:56:59,399
female Partners is it possible to say
 

8791
02:56:59,399 --> 02:57:02,090
female Partners is it possible to say
that that's a sub-optimal life

8792
02:57:02,090 --> 02:57:02,100
that that's a sub-optimal life
 

8793
02:57:02,100 --> 02:57:04,910
that that's a sub-optimal life
that a single partner is the optimal

8794
02:57:04,910 --> 02:57:04,920
that a single partner is the optimal
 

8795
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:06,590
that a single partner is the optimal
life well it depends what you mean I

8796
02:57:06,590 --> 02:57:06,600
life well it depends what you mean I
 

8797
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:08,269
life well it depends what you mean I
have a feeling that you and I wouldn't

8798
02:57:08,269 --> 02:57:08,279
have a feeling that you and I wouldn't
 

8799
02:57:08,279 --> 02:57:11,809
have a feeling that you and I wouldn't
have to go very far to figure out that

8800
02:57:11,809 --> 02:57:11,819
have to go very far to figure out that
 

8801
02:57:11,819 --> 02:57:14,750
have to go very far to figure out that
um what might be evolutionarily optimal

8802
02:57:14,750 --> 02:57:14,760
um what might be evolutionarily optimal
 

8803
02:57:14,760 --> 02:57:17,389
um what might be evolutionarily optimal
doesn't match my values as a person and

8804
02:57:17,389 --> 02:57:17,399
doesn't match my values as a person and
 

8805
02:57:17,399 --> 02:57:18,889
doesn't match my values as a person and
I'm sure it doesn't match yours either

8806
02:57:18,889 --> 02:57:18,899
I'm sure it doesn't match yours either
 

8807
02:57:18,899 --> 02:57:21,230
I'm sure it doesn't match yours either
you know try to can we try to dig into

8808
02:57:21,230 --> 02:57:21,240
you know try to can we try to dig into
 

8809
02:57:21,240 --> 02:57:24,830
you know try to can we try to dig into
the that gap between those two sure

8810
02:57:24,830 --> 02:57:24,840
the that gap between those two sure
 

8811
02:57:24,840 --> 02:57:28,910
the that gap between those two sure
um I mean we can do it very simply uh

8812
02:57:28,910 --> 02:57:28,920
um I mean we can do it very simply uh
 

8813
02:57:28,920 --> 02:57:32,870
um I mean we can do it very simply uh
selection might favor your engaging in

right it's not hard to figure out how

right it's not hard to figure out how
 

8821
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:43,130
right it's not hard to figure out how
that might put your genes at advantage

8827
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:48,950

going to happen I won't do it I will do

going to happen I won't do it I will do
 

8829
02:57:48,960 --> 02:57:51,590
going to happen I won't do it I will do
anything to avoid it so some part of me

8830
02:57:51,590 --> 02:57:51,600
anything to avoid it so some part of me
 

8831
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:54,769
anything to avoid it so some part of me
has decided that my conscious self and

and
 

8839
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:02,750
and
once you figure out that in some extreme

8840
02:58:02,750 --> 02:58:02,760
once you figure out that in some extreme
 

8841
02:58:02,760 --> 02:58:04,910
once you figure out that in some extreme
case that's true and then you realize

case that's true and then you realize
 

8843
02:58:04,920 --> 02:58:06,769
case that's true and then you realize
that that means it must be possible in

8844
02:58:06,769 --> 02:58:06,779
that that means it must be possible in
 

8845
02:58:06,779 --> 02:58:08,269
that that means it must be possible in
many other cases and you start going

8846
02:58:08,269 --> 02:58:08,279
many other cases and you start going
 

8847
02:58:08,279 --> 02:58:09,650
many other cases and you start going
through all of the things that selection

8848
02:58:09,650 --> 02:58:09,660
through all of the things that selection
 

8849
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:11,210
through all of the things that selection
would favor and you realize that a fair

8850
02:58:11,210 --> 02:58:11,220
would favor and you realize that a fair
 

8851
02:58:11,220 --> 02:58:13,190
would favor and you realize that a fair
fraction of the time actually you're not

8852
02:58:13,190 --> 02:58:13,200
fraction of the time actually you're not
 

8853
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:15,950
fraction of the time actually you're not
up for this you don't want to be some

8854
02:58:15,950 --> 02:58:15,960
up for this you don't want to be some
 

8855
02:58:15,960 --> 02:58:17,929
up for this you don't want to be some
robot on a mission that involves

8856
02:58:17,929 --> 02:58:17,939
robot on a mission that involves
 

8857
02:58:17,939 --> 02:58:20,630
robot on a mission that involves
genocide when necessary you want to be

8858
02:58:20,630 --> 02:58:20,640
genocide when necessary you want to be
 

8859
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:22,010
genocide when necessary you want to be
your own person and accomplish things

8860
02:58:22,010 --> 02:58:22,020
your own person and accomplish things
 

8861
02:58:22,020 --> 02:58:24,769
your own person and accomplish things
that you think are valuable

8862
02:58:24,769 --> 02:58:24,779
that you think are valuable
 

8863
02:58:24,779 --> 02:58:28,150
that you think are valuable
and so among those

8864
02:58:28,150 --> 02:58:28,160
and so among those
 

8865
02:58:28,160 --> 02:58:31,130
and so among those
are not advocating you know let's

02:58:31,130 --> 02:58:31,140
are not advocating you know let's
 

8867
02:58:31,140 --> 02:58:32,690
are not advocating you know let's
suppose you're in a position to be one

02:58:32,690 --> 02:58:32,700
suppose you're in a position to be one
 

8869
02:58:32,700 --> 02:58:33,830
suppose you're in a position to be one
of those males at the top of a

8870
02:58:33,830 --> 02:58:33,840
of those males at the top of a
 

8871
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:36,110
of those males at the top of a
polygenous system we both know why that

8872
02:58:36,110 --> 02:58:36,120
polygenous system we both know why that
 

8873
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:38,809
polygenous system we both know why that
would be rewarding right but we also

8874
02:58:38,809 --> 02:58:38,819
would be rewarding right but we also
 

8875
02:58:38,819 --> 02:58:42,110
would be rewarding right but we also
both recognize it yeah sure lots of sex

8876
02:58:42,110 --> 02:58:42,120
both recognize it yeah sure lots of sex
 

8877
02:58:42,120 --> 02:58:44,809
both recognize it yeah sure lots of sex
yeah okay what else lots of sex and lots

8878
02:58:44,809 --> 02:58:44,819
yeah okay what else lots of sex and lots
 

8879
02:58:44,819 --> 02:58:47,870
yeah okay what else lots of sex and lots
of variety right so look

8880
02:58:47,870 --> 02:58:47,880
of variety right so look
 

8881
02:58:47,880 --> 02:58:50,750
of variety right so look
every red-blooded American slash Russian

8882
02:58:50,750 --> 02:58:50,760
every red-blooded American slash Russian
 

8883
02:58:50,760 --> 02:58:52,670
every red-blooded American slash Russian
male could understand why that's

8884
02:58:52,670 --> 02:58:52,680
male could understand why that's
 

8885
02:58:52,680 --> 02:58:56,030
male could understand why that's
appealing right on the other hand it is

8886
02:58:56,030 --> 02:58:56,040
appealing right on the other hand it is
 

8887
02:58:56,040 --> 02:58:58,490
appealing right on the other hand it is
up against an alternative which is

8888
02:58:58,490 --> 02:58:58,500
up against an alternative which is
 

8889
02:58:58,500 --> 02:59:03,250
up against an alternative which is
having a partner with whom one is bonded

8890
02:59:03,250 --> 02:59:03,260
having a partner with whom one is bonded
 

8891
02:59:03,260 --> 02:59:06,710
having a partner with whom one is bonded
especially closely right right and so

8892
02:59:06,710 --> 02:59:06,720
especially closely right right and so
 

8893
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:10,250
especially closely right right and so
hey love right well you know I don't

8894
02:59:10,250 --> 02:59:10,260
hey love right well you know I don't
 

8895
02:59:10,260 --> 02:59:13,790
hey love right well you know I don't
wanna I don't wanna uh straw man the

8896
02:59:13,790 --> 02:59:13,800
wanna I don't wanna uh straw man the
 

8897
02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:16,190
wanna I don't wanna uh straw man the
polygamy position obviously polygeny is

8898
02:59:16,190 --> 02:59:16,200
polygamy position obviously polygeny is
 

8899
02:59:16,200 --> 02:59:18,769
polygamy position obviously polygeny is
complex and there's nothing that stops a

8900
02:59:18,769 --> 02:59:18,779
complex and there's nothing that stops a
 

8901
02:59:18,779 --> 02:59:21,950
complex and there's nothing that stops a
man presumably from loving multiple

8902
02:59:21,950 --> 02:59:21,960
man presumably from loving multiple
 

8903
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:23,929
man presumably from loving multiple
partners and from them loving him back

8904
02:59:23,929 --> 02:59:23,939
partners and from them loving him back
 

8905
02:59:23,939 --> 02:59:25,910
partners and from them loving him back
but in terms of you know if love is your

8906
02:59:25,910 --> 02:59:25,920
but in terms of you know if love is your
 

8907
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:27,650
but in terms of you know if love is your
thing there's a question about okay what

8908
02:59:27,650 --> 02:59:27,660
thing there's a question about okay what
 

8909
02:59:27,660 --> 02:59:30,410
thing there's a question about okay what
is the quality of love if it is divided

8910
02:59:30,410 --> 02:59:30,420
is the quality of love if it is divided
 

8911
02:59:30,420 --> 02:59:33,889
is the quality of love if it is divided
over multiple partners right and what is

8912
02:59:33,889 --> 02:59:33,899
over multiple partners right and what is
 

8913
02:59:33,899 --> 02:59:36,469
over multiple partners right and what is
the net consequence for love in a

8914
02:59:36,469 --> 02:59:36,479
the net consequence for love in a
 

8915
02:59:36,479 --> 02:59:38,870
the net consequence for love in a
society when multiple people will be

8916
02:59:38,870 --> 02:59:38,880
society when multiple people will be
 

8917
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:41,510
society when multiple people will be
frozen out for every individual male in

8918
02:59:41,510 --> 02:59:41,520
frozen out for every individual male in
 

8919
02:59:41,520 --> 02:59:43,550
frozen out for every individual male in
this case who has it

8920
02:59:43,550 --> 02:59:43,560
this case who has it
 

8921
02:59:43,560 --> 02:59:46,550
this case who has it
um and what I would argue

8922
02:59:46,550 --> 02:59:46,560
um and what I would argue
 

8923
02:59:46,560 --> 02:59:49,309
um and what I would argue
is and you know this is weird to even

8924
02:59:49,309 --> 02:59:49,319
is and you know this is weird to even
 

8925
02:59:49,319 --> 02:59:51,349
is and you know this is weird to even
talk about but this is partially me just

8926
02:59:51,349 --> 02:59:51,359
talk about but this is partially me just
 

8927
02:59:51,359 --> 02:59:53,389
talk about but this is partially me just
talking from personal experience I think

8928
02:59:53,389 --> 02:59:53,399
talking from personal experience I think
 

8929
02:59:53,399 --> 02:59:55,610
talking from personal experience I think
there actually is a monogamy program in

8930
02:59:55,610 --> 02:59:55,620
there actually is a monogamy program in
 

8931
02:59:55,620 --> 02:59:59,269
there actually is a monogamy program in
us and it's not automatic but if you

8932
02:59:59,269 --> 02:59:59,279
us and it's not automatic but if you
 

8933
02:59:59,279 --> 03:00:03,530
us and it's not automatic but if you
take it seriously you can find it and

8934
03:00:03,530 --> 03:00:03,540
take it seriously you can find it and
 

8935
03:00:03,540 --> 03:00:05,990
take it seriously you can find it and
frankly marriage and it doesn't have to

8936
03:00:05,990 --> 03:00:06,000
frankly marriage and it doesn't have to
 

8937
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:07,429
frankly marriage and it doesn't have to
be marriage but whatever it is that

8938
03:00:07,429 --> 03:00:07,439
be marriage but whatever it is that
 

8939
03:00:07,439 --> 03:00:09,769
be marriage but whatever it is that
results in a lifelong bond with a

8940
03:00:09,769 --> 03:00:09,779
results in a lifelong bond with a
 

8941
03:00:09,779 --> 03:00:12,170
results in a lifelong bond with a
partner has gotten a very bad rap you

8942
03:00:12,170 --> 03:00:12,180
partner has gotten a very bad rap you
 

8943
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:14,809
partner has gotten a very bad rap you
know it's the butt of too many jokes but

8944
03:00:14,809 --> 03:00:14,819
know it's the butt of too many jokes but
 

8945
03:00:14,819 --> 03:00:18,349
know it's the butt of too many jokes but
the truth is it's hugely rewarding it's

8946
03:00:18,349 --> 03:00:18,359
the truth is it's hugely rewarding it's
 

8947
03:00:18,359 --> 03:00:21,349
the truth is it's hugely rewarding it's
not easy but if you know that you're

8948
03:00:21,349 --> 03:00:21,359
not easy but if you know that you're
 

8949
03:00:21,359 --> 03:00:22,730
not easy but if you know that you're
looking for something right if you know

8950
03:00:22,730 --> 03:00:22,740
looking for something right if you know
 

8951
03:00:22,740 --> 03:00:24,349
looking for something right if you know
that the objective actually exists and

8952
03:00:24,349 --> 03:00:24,359
that the objective actually exists and
 

8953
03:00:24,359 --> 03:00:26,269
that the objective actually exists and
it's not some utopian fantasy that can't

8954
03:00:26,269 --> 03:00:26,279
it's not some utopian fantasy that can't
 

8955
03:00:26,279 --> 03:00:28,309
it's not some utopian fantasy that can't
be found if you know that there's some

8956
03:00:28,309 --> 03:00:28,319
be found if you know that there's some
 

8957
03:00:28,319 --> 03:00:31,190
be found if you know that there's some
real world you know warts and all

8958
03:00:31,190 --> 03:00:31,200
real world you know warts and all
 

8959
03:00:31,200 --> 03:00:33,590
real world you know warts and all
version of it then you might actually

8960
03:00:33,590 --> 03:00:33,600
version of it then you might actually
 

8961
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:35,269
version of it then you might actually
think hey that is something I want and

8962
03:00:35,269 --> 03:00:35,279
think hey that is something I want and
 

8963
03:00:35,279 --> 03:00:36,650
think hey that is something I want and
you might pursue it and my guess is

8964
03:00:36,650 --> 03:00:36,660
you might pursue it and my guess is
 

8965
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:37,969
you might pursue it and my guess is
you'd be very happy when you find it

8966
03:00:37,969 --> 03:00:37,979
you'd be very happy when you find it
 

8967
03:00:37,979 --> 03:00:40,429
you'd be very happy when you find it
yeah I think there is uh getting to the

8968
03:00:40,429 --> 03:00:40,439
yeah I think there is uh getting to the
 

8969
03:00:40,439 --> 03:00:42,170
yeah I think there is uh getting to the
fundamentals of the emergent I feel like

8970
03:00:42,170 --> 03:00:42,180
fundamentals of the emergent I feel like
 

8971
03:00:42,180 --> 03:00:43,910
fundamentals of the emergent I feel like
there is some kind of physics of love so

8972
03:00:43,910 --> 03:00:43,920
there is some kind of physics of love so
 

8973
03:00:43,920 --> 03:00:46,849
there is some kind of physics of love so
one we there's a conservation thing

8974
03:00:46,849 --> 03:00:46,859
one we there's a conservation thing
 

8975
03:00:46,859 --> 03:00:48,410
one we there's a conservation thing
going on so if you have like many

8976
03:00:48,410 --> 03:00:48,420
going on so if you have like many
 

8977
03:00:48,420 --> 03:00:50,450
going on so if you have like many
partners

8978
03:00:50,450 --> 03:00:50,460
partners
 

8979
03:00:50,460 --> 03:00:52,790
partners
yeah in theory you should be able to

8980
03:00:52,790 --> 03:00:52,800
yeah in theory you should be able to
 

8981
03:00:52,800 --> 03:00:54,769
yeah in theory you should be able to
love all of them deeply but it seems

8982
03:00:54,769 --> 03:00:54,779
love all of them deeply but it seems
 

8983
03:00:54,779 --> 03:00:57,590
love all of them deeply but it seems
like in reality that love gets split

8984
03:00:57,590 --> 03:00:57,600
like in reality that love gets split
 

8985
03:00:57,600 --> 03:01:00,590
like in reality that love gets split
yep now there's another law that's

8986
03:01:00,590 --> 03:01:00,600
yep now there's another law that's
 

8987
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:03,290
yep now there's another law that's
interesting in terms of monogamy I don't

8988
03:01:03,290 --> 03:01:03,300
interesting in terms of monogamy I don't
 

8989
03:01:03,300 --> 03:01:05,750
interesting in terms of monogamy I don't
know if it's at the physics level but if

8990
03:01:05,750 --> 03:01:05,760
know if it's at the physics level but if
 

8991
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:08,690
know if it's at the physics level but if
you are in a monogamous relationship by

8992
03:01:08,690 --> 03:01:08,700
you are in a monogamous relationship by
 

8993
03:01:08,700 --> 03:01:10,130
you are in a monogamous relationship by
choice

8994
03:01:10,130 --> 03:01:10,140
choice
 

8995
03:01:10,140 --> 03:01:11,990
choice
and almost as

8996
03:01:11,990 --> 03:01:12,000
and almost as
 

8997
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:16,370
and almost as
um in slight Rebellion to social norms

8998
03:01:16,370 --> 03:01:16,380
um in slight Rebellion to social norms
 

8999
03:01:16,380 --> 03:01:18,590
um in slight Rebellion to social norms
that's much more powerful like if you

9000
03:01:18,590 --> 03:01:18,600
that's much more powerful like if you
 

9001
03:01:18,600 --> 03:01:21,830
that's much more powerful like if you
choose that one partnership that's also

9002
03:01:21,830 --> 03:01:21,840
choose that one partnership that's also
 

9003
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:24,110
choose that one partnership that's also
more powerful if you if like everybody's

9004
03:01:24,110 --> 03:01:24,120
more powerful if you if like everybody's
 

9005
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:25,790
more powerful if you if like everybody's
in a monogamous there's this pressure to

9006
03:01:25,790 --> 03:01:25,800
in a monogamous there's this pressure to
 

9007
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:27,590
in a monogamous there's this pressure to
be married in this precious Society

9008
03:01:27,590 --> 03:01:27,600
be married in this precious Society
 

9009
03:01:27,600 --> 03:01:29,630
be married in this precious Society
that's different because that's almost

9010
03:01:29,630 --> 03:01:29,640
that's different because that's almost
 

9011
03:01:29,640 --> 03:01:32,570
that's different because that's almost
like a constraint and your freedom that

9012
03:01:32,570 --> 03:01:32,580
like a constraint and your freedom that
 

9013
03:01:32,580 --> 03:01:34,790
like a constraint and your freedom that
is enforced by something other than your

9014
03:01:34,790 --> 03:01:34,800
is enforced by something other than your
 

9015
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:38,150
is enforced by something other than your
own ideals it's by by somebody else when

9016
03:01:38,150 --> 03:01:38,160
own ideals it's by by somebody else when
 

9017
03:01:38,160 --> 03:01:40,969
own ideals it's by by somebody else when
you yourself choose to I guess create

9018
03:01:40,969 --> 03:01:40,979
you yourself choose to I guess create
 

9019
03:01:40,979 --> 03:01:44,269
you yourself choose to I guess create
these constraints that enriches that

9020
03:01:44,269 --> 03:01:44,279
these constraints that enriches that
 

9021
03:01:44,279 --> 03:01:46,309
these constraints that enriches that
love so there's some kind of love

9022
03:01:46,309 --> 03:01:46,319

not they're not going to like it because

9184

not they're not going to like it because
 

9185
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:01,010
not they're not going to like it because
it's not easy to operationalize so and

9186
03:05:01,010 --> 03:05:01,020
it's not easy to operationalize so and
 

9187
03:05:01,020 --> 03:05:02,510
it's not easy to operationalize so and
this was a problem when I was a college

03:05:02,510 --> 03:05:02,520
this was a problem when I was a college
 

9189
03:05:02,520 --> 03:05:04,370
this was a problem when I was a college
professor too people would ask me what

they should do should they go to
 

9193
03:05:05,399 --> 03:05:07,190
they should do should they go to
graduate school I had almost nothing

03:05:07,190 --> 03:05:07,200
graduate school I had almost nothing
 

9195
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:10,730
graduate school I had almost nothing
useful to say because the the job market

9196
03:05:10,730 --> 03:05:10,740
useful to say because the the job market
 

9197
03:05:10,740 --> 03:05:13,910
useful to say because the the job market
and the market of you know pre-job

9201
03:05:15,420 --> 03:05:17,889

are all so

but nonetheless they create a mind in

03:07:12,479 --> 03:07:14,090
but nonetheless they create a mind in

which the two things are live and you

which the two things are live and you
can move back and forth between them and

can move back and forth between them and
 

9311
03:07:16,319 --> 03:07:17,809
can move back and forth between them and
you know step out of your own

9312
03:07:17,809 --> 03:07:17,819
you know step out of your own
 

9313
03:07:17,819 --> 03:07:19,490
you know step out of your own
perspective by moving from one to the

that will increase what you can see and
 

9319
03:07:22,920 --> 03:07:25,190
that will increase what you can see and
the quality of your tools and so anyway

9320
03:07:25,190 --> 03:07:25,200
the quality of your tools and so anyway
 

9321
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:26,929
the quality of your tools and so anyway
that isn't useful advice it doesn't tell

9322
03:07:26,929 --> 03:07:26,939
that isn't useful advice it doesn't tell
 

9323
03:07:26,939 --> 03:07:28,070
that isn't useful advice it doesn't tell
you whether you should go to graduate

9324
03:07:28,070 --> 03:07:28,080
you whether you should go to graduate
 

9325
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:31,190
you whether you should go to graduate
school or not but it does tell you the

9326
03:07:31,190 --> 03:07:31,200
school or not but it does tell you the
 

9327
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:33,050
school or not but it does tell you the
one thing we can say for certain about

9328
03:07:33,050 --> 03:07:33,060
one thing we can say for certain about
 

9329
03:07:33,060 --> 03:07:34,969
one thing we can say for certain about
the future is that it's uncertain and so

9330
03:07:34,969 --> 03:07:34,979
the future is that it's uncertain and so
 

9331
03:07:34,979 --> 03:07:37,490
the future is that it's uncertain and so
prepare for it and like you said there's

9332
03:07:37,490 --> 03:07:37,500
prepare for it and like you said there's
 

9333
03:07:37,500 --> 03:07:39,349
prepare for it and like you said there's
cool things to be discovered in the

03:07:39,359 --> 03:07:42,889
cool things to be discovered in the

9337
03:07:42,899 --> 03:07:45,050
intersection of uh fields and ideas and
I would look at grad school that way

9338
03:07:45,050 --> 03:07:45,060
I would look at grad school that way
 

9339
03:07:45,060 --> 03:07:46,730
I would look at grad school that way
actually if you do go

9340
03:07:46,730 --> 03:07:46,740
actually if you do go
 

9341
03:07:46,740 --> 03:07:49,190
actually if you do go
or

9342
03:07:49,190 --> 03:07:49,200
or
 

9343
03:07:49,200 --> 03:07:52,490
or
I see I mean this is such a like every

9344
03:07:52,490 --> 03:07:52,500
I see I mean this is such a like every
 

9345
03:07:52,500 --> 03:07:55,429
I see I mean this is such a like every
course in grad school undergrad too was

9346
03:07:55,429 --> 03:07:55,439
course in grad school undergrad too was
 

9347
03:07:55,439 --> 03:07:57,710
course in grad school undergrad too was
like this little journey that you're on

9348
03:07:57,710 --> 03:07:57,720
like this little journey that you're on
 

9349
03:07:57,720 --> 03:08:00,650
like this little journey that you're on
that explores a particular field and and

9350
03:08:00,650 --> 03:08:00,660
that explores a particular field and and
 

9351
03:08:00,660 --> 03:08:02,570
that explores a particular field and and
it's not immediately obvious how useful

9352
03:08:02,570 --> 03:08:02,580
it's not immediately obvious how useful
 

9353
03:08:02,580 --> 03:08:03,769
it's not immediately obvious how useful
it is

9354
03:08:03,769 --> 03:08:03,779
it is
 

9355
03:08:03,779 --> 03:08:07,389
it is
but it allows you to to discover

9356
03:08:07,389 --> 03:08:07,399
but it allows you to to discover
 

9357
03:08:07,399 --> 03:08:09,769
but it allows you to to discover
intersections between that thing and

9358
03:08:09,769 --> 03:08:09,779
intersections between that thing and
 

9359
03:08:09,779 --> 03:08:12,349
intersections between that thing and
some other thing so you you're bringing

9360
03:08:12,349 --> 03:08:12,359
some other thing so you you're bringing
 

9361
03:08:12,359 --> 03:08:14,450
some other thing so you you're bringing
to the table this

9362
03:08:14,450 --> 03:08:14,460
to the table this
 

9363
03:08:14,460 --> 03:08:17,330
to the table this
these pieces of knowledge some of which

9364
03:08:17,330 --> 03:08:17,340
these pieces of knowledge some of which
 

9365
03:08:17,340 --> 03:08:20,090
these pieces of knowledge some of which
when intersected might create a niche

9366
03:08:20,090 --> 03:08:20,100
when intersected might create a niche
 

9367
03:08:20,100 --> 03:08:22,610
when intersected might create a niche
that's completely novel unique and will

9368
03:08:22,610 --> 03:08:22,620
that's completely novel unique and will
 

9369
03:08:22,620 --> 03:08:24,830
that's completely novel unique and will
bring you Joy I have that I mean I took

9370
03:08:24,830 --> 03:08:24,840
bring you Joy I have that I mean I took
 

9371
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:26,929
bring you Joy I have that I mean I took
a huge number of courses in theoretical

9372
03:08:26,929 --> 03:08:26,939
a huge number of courses in theoretical
 

9373
03:08:26,939 --> 03:08:28,910
a huge number of courses in theoretical
computer science most of them seem

9374
03:08:28,910 --> 03:08:28,920
computer science most of them seem
 

9375
03:08:28,920 --> 03:08:31,309
computer science most of them seem
useless but they totally changed the way

9376
03:08:31,309 --> 03:08:31,319
useless but they totally changed the way
 

9377
03:08:31,319 --> 03:08:34,130
useless but they totally changed the way
I see the world uh in ways that are I'm

9378
03:08:34,130 --> 03:08:34,140
I see the world uh in ways that are I'm
 

9379
03:08:34,140 --> 03:08:35,870
I see the world uh in ways that are I'm
not prepared or is a little bit

9380
03:08:35,870 --> 03:08:35,880
not prepared or is a little bit
 

9381
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:40,610
not prepared or is a little bit
difficult to kind of make explicit but

9382
03:08:40,610 --> 03:08:40,620
difficult to kind of make explicit but
 

9383
03:08:40,620 --> 03:08:42,550
difficult to kind of make explicit but
taken together

9384
03:08:42,550 --> 03:08:42,560
taken together
 

9385
03:08:42,560 --> 03:08:45,590
taken together
they've allowed me to see for example

9386
03:08:45,590 --> 03:08:45,600
they've allowed me to see for example
 

9387
03:08:45,600 --> 03:08:47,929
they've allowed me to see for example
the world of Robotics totally different

9388
03:08:47,929 --> 03:08:47,939
the world of Robotics totally different
 

9389
03:08:47,939 --> 03:08:50,450
the world of Robotics totally different
and different from many of my colleagues

9390
03:08:50,450 --> 03:08:50,460
and different from many of my colleagues
 

9391
03:08:50,460 --> 03:08:53,510
and different from many of my colleagues
and friends and so on and I think that's

9392
03:08:53,510 --> 03:08:53,520
and friends and so on and I think that's
 

9393
03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:55,010
and friends and so on and I think that's
a good way to see if you go to grad

9394
03:08:55,010 --> 03:08:55,020
a good way to see if you go to grad
 

9395
03:08:55,020 --> 03:08:56,330
a good way to see if you go to grad
school as

9396
03:08:56,330 --> 03:08:56,340
school as
 

9397
03:08:56,340 --> 03:08:57,230
school as
um

9398
03:08:57,230 --> 03:08:57,240
um
 

9399
03:08:57,240 --> 03:08:59,950
um
as a opportunity to explore

9400
03:08:59,950 --> 03:08:59,960
as a opportunity to explore
 

9401
03:08:59,960 --> 03:09:02,630
as a opportunity to explore
intersections of fields even if the

9402
03:09:02,630 --> 03:09:02,640
intersections of fields even if the
 

9403
03:09:02,640 --> 03:09:05,389
intersections of fields even if the
individual Fields seem useless yeah and

9404
03:09:05,389 --> 03:09:05,399
individual Fields seem useless yeah and
 

9405
03:09:05,399 --> 03:09:07,070
individual Fields seem useless yeah and
useless doesn't mean useless right

9406
03:09:07,070 --> 03:09:07,080
useless doesn't mean useless right
 

9407
03:09:07,080 --> 03:09:09,230
useless doesn't mean useless right
useless means not directly applicable

9408
03:09:09,230 --> 03:09:09,240
useless means not directly applicable
 

9409
03:09:09,240 --> 03:09:11,570
useless means not directly applicable
not directly a good useless course can

9410
03:09:11,570 --> 03:09:11,580
not directly a good useless course can
 

9411
03:09:11,580 --> 03:09:14,269
not directly a good useless course can
be the best one you ever took

9412
03:09:14,269 --> 03:09:14,279
be the best one you ever took
 

9413
03:09:14,279 --> 03:09:17,269
be the best one you ever took
um yeah I took uh James Joyce uh course

9414
03:09:17,269 --> 03:09:17,279
um yeah I took uh James Joyce uh course
 

9415
03:09:17,279 --> 03:09:19,729
um yeah I took uh James Joyce uh course
on James Joyce and that was truly

9416
03:09:19,729 --> 03:09:19,739
on James Joyce and that was truly
 

9417
03:09:19,739 --> 03:09:21,110
on James Joyce and that was truly
useless

9418
03:09:21,110 --> 03:09:21,120
useless
 

9419
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:25,010
useless
well I took uh I took immunobiology in

9420
03:09:25,010 --> 03:09:25,020
well I took uh I took immunobiology in
 

9421
03:09:25,020 --> 03:09:27,650
well I took uh I took immunobiology in
the medical school when I was at Penn as

9422
03:09:27,650 --> 03:09:27,660
the medical school when I was at Penn as
 

9423
03:09:27,660 --> 03:09:30,229
the medical school when I was at Penn as
uh I guess I would have been a freshman

9424
03:09:30,229 --> 03:09:30,239
uh I guess I would have been a freshman
 

9425
03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:31,670
uh I guess I would have been a freshman
or a sophomore I wasn't supposed to be

9426
03:09:31,670 --> 03:09:31,680
or a sophomore I wasn't supposed to be
 

9427
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:32,870
or a sophomore I wasn't supposed to be
in this class

9428
03:09:32,870 --> 03:09:32,880
in this class
 

9429
03:09:32,880 --> 03:09:35,870
in this class
it blew my goddamn mind and it still

9430
03:09:35,870 --> 03:09:35,880
it blew my goddamn mind and it still
 

9431
03:09:35,880 --> 03:09:38,809
it blew my goddamn mind and it still
does right I mean we had this I don't

9432
03:09:38,809 --> 03:09:38,819
does right I mean we had this I don't
 

9433
03:09:38,819 --> 03:09:40,790
does right I mean we had this I don't
even know who it was but we had this

9434
03:09:40,790 --> 03:09:40,800
even know who it was but we had this
 

9435
03:09:40,800 --> 03:09:42,469
even know who it was but we had this
great Professor who was like highly

9436
03:09:42,469 --> 03:09:42,479
great Professor who was like highly
 

9437
03:09:42,479 --> 03:09:44,330
great Professor who was like highly
placed in the world of immunobiology you

9438
03:09:44,330 --> 03:09:44,340
placed in the world of immunobiology you
 

9439
03:09:44,340 --> 03:09:45,950
placed in the world of immunobiology you
know the course is called immunobiology

9440
03:09:45,950 --> 03:09:45,960
know the course is called immunobiology
 

9441
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:48,070
know the course is called immunobiology
not Immunology

9442
03:09:48,070 --> 03:09:48,080
not Immunology
 

9443
03:09:48,080 --> 03:09:50,450
not Immunology
immunobiology it had the right focus and

9444
03:09:50,450 --> 03:09:50,460
immunobiology it had the right focus and
 

9445
03:09:50,460 --> 03:09:52,010
immunobiology it had the right focus and
as I recall it

9446
03:09:52,010 --> 03:09:52,020
as I recall it
 

9447
03:09:52,020 --> 03:09:53,870
as I recall it
professors stood

9448
03:09:53,870 --> 03:09:53,880
professors stood
 

9449
03:09:53,880 --> 03:09:56,150
professors stood
sideways to the chalkboard staring off

9450
03:09:56,150 --> 03:09:56,160
sideways to the chalkboard staring off
 

9451
03:09:56,160 --> 03:09:59,269
sideways to the chalkboard staring off
into space literally stroking his beard

9452
03:09:59,269 --> 03:09:59,279
into space literally stroking his beard
 

9453
03:09:59,279 --> 03:10:01,910
into space literally stroking his beard
with this bemused look on his face

9454
03:10:01,910 --> 03:10:01,920
with this bemused look on his face
 

9455
03:10:01,920 --> 03:10:04,790
with this bemused look on his face
through the entire lecture and you know

9456
03:10:04,790 --> 03:10:04,800
through the entire lecture and you know
 

9457
03:10:04,800 --> 03:10:05,990
through the entire lecture and you know
he had all these medical students who

9458
03:10:05,990 --> 03:10:06,000
he had all these medical students who
 

9459
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:07,490
he had all these medical students who
were so furiously writing notes that I

9460
03:10:07,490 --> 03:10:07,500
were so furiously writing notes that I
 

9461
03:10:07,500 --> 03:10:08,809
were so furiously writing notes that I
don't even think they were noticing the

9462
03:10:08,809 --> 03:10:08,819
don't even think they were noticing the
 

9463
03:10:08,819 --> 03:10:11,030
don't even think they were noticing the
person delivering this thing but you

9464
03:10:11,030 --> 03:10:11,040
person delivering this thing but you
 

9465
03:10:11,040 --> 03:10:13,429
person delivering this thing but you
know I got what this guy was smiling

9466
03:10:13,429 --> 03:10:13,439
know I got what this guy was smiling
 

9467
03:10:13,439 --> 03:10:15,290
know I got what this guy was smiling
about it was like so what he was

9468
03:10:15,290 --> 03:10:15,300
about it was like so what he was
 

9469
03:10:15,300 --> 03:10:17,330
about it was like so what he was
describing you know adaptive immunity is

9470
03:10:17,330 --> 03:10:17,340
describing you know adaptive immunity is
 

9471
03:10:17,340 --> 03:10:19,490
describing you know adaptive immunity is
so marvelous right that it was like

9472
03:10:19,490 --> 03:10:19,500
so marvelous right that it was like
 

9473
03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:21,469
so marvelous right that it was like
almost a privilege to even be saying it

9474
03:10:21,469 --> 03:10:21,479
almost a privilege to even be saying it
 

9475
03:10:21,479 --> 03:10:22,610
almost a privilege to even be saying it
to a room full of people who were

9476
03:10:22,610 --> 03:10:22,620
to a room full of people who were
 

9477
03:10:22,620 --> 03:10:24,830
to a room full of people who were
listening you know but anyway yeah I

9478
03:10:24,830 --> 03:10:24,840
listening you know but anyway yeah I
 

9479
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:26,210
listening you know but anyway yeah I
took that course and you know lo and

9480
03:10:26,210 --> 03:10:26,220
took that course and you know lo and
 

9481
03:10:26,220 --> 03:10:29,889
took that course and you know lo and
behold

9482
03:10:29,889 --> 03:10:29,899

 

9483
03:10:29,899 --> 03:10:32,809

Suddenly It's front and center and wow

9484
03:10:32,809 --> 03:10:32,819
Suddenly It's front and center and wow
 

9485
03:10:32,819 --> 03:10:35,870
Suddenly It's front and center and wow
my glad I took it but um anyway yeah

9486
03:10:35,870 --> 03:10:35,880
my glad I took it but um anyway yeah
 

9487
03:10:35,880 --> 03:10:37,490
my glad I took it but um anyway yeah
useless courses are great and actually

9488
03:10:37,490 --> 03:10:37,500
useless courses are great and actually
 

9489
03:10:37,500 --> 03:10:38,690
useless courses are great and actually

Eric
 

9491
03:10:38,700 --> 03:10:40,429
Eric
gave me one of the greater pieces of

9492
03:10:40,429 --> 03:10:40,439
gave me one of the greater pieces of
 

9493
03:10:40,439 --> 03:10:42,170
gave me one of the greater pieces of
advice at least for college that

9494
03:10:42,170 --> 03:10:42,180
advice at least for college that
 

9495
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:44,389
advice at least for college that
anyone's ever given which was don't

9496
03:10:44,389 --> 03:10:44,399

given that can I relax a little bit
 

9589
03:12:28,620 --> 03:12:31,370
given that can I relax a little bit
right and figure out well what would

9590
03:12:31,370 --> 03:12:31,380
right and figure out well what would
 

9591
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:34,790
right and figure out well what would
make sense if that were true right and I

9592
03:12:34,790 --> 03:12:34,800
make sense if that were true right and I
 

9593
03:12:34,800 --> 03:12:36,650
make sense if that were true right and I
think there's something very clear to me

think there's something very clear to me
 

9595
03:12:36,660 --> 03:12:38,870
think there's something very clear to me
I think if you do all of the you know if

I think if you do all of the you know if
 

9597

I think if you do all of the you know if
I just take the values that I'm sure we

9598
03:12:41,150 --> 03:12:41,160
I just take the values that I'm sure we
 

9599
03:12:41,160 --> 03:12:44,450
I just take the values that I'm sure we
share and extrapolate from them I think

9600
03:12:44,450 --> 03:12:44,460
share and extrapolate from them I think
 

9601
03:12:44,460 --> 03:12:46,070
share and extrapolate from them I think
the following thing is actually a moral

the following thing is actually a moral
imperative

have opportunity right they get to be
 

9615
03:12:58,859 --> 03:13:00,530
have opportunity right they get to be
human but they're too constrained by

this beautiful planet crippled as it may
 

9625
03:13:11,160 --> 03:13:13,090
this beautiful planet crippled as it may
be is

9626
03:13:13,090 --> 03:13:13,100
be is
 

9627
03:13:13,100 --> 03:13:15,349

how lucky are we that we get that right

9630
03:13:17,330 --> 03:13:17,340
how lucky are we that we get that right
 

9631
03:13:17,340 --> 03:13:19,910
how lucky are we that we get that right
so if that's true

9632
03:13:19,910 --> 03:13:19,920
so if that's true
 

9633
03:13:19,920 --> 03:13:21,950
so if that's true
that it is awesome to be human and to be

9634
03:13:21,950 --> 03:13:21,960
that it is awesome to be human and to be
 

9635
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:22,790
that it is awesome to be human and to be
free

03:13:22,790 --> 03:13:22,800
free
 

9637
03:13:22,800 --> 03:13:25,610
free
then surely it is Our obligation to

9638
03:13:25,610 --> 03:13:25,620
then surely it is Our obligation to
 

9639
03:13:25,620 --> 03:13:27,290
then surely it is Our obligation to
deliver that opportunity to as many

9640
03:13:27,290 --> 03:13:27,300
deliver that opportunity to as many
 

9641
03:13:27,300 --> 03:13:28,910
deliver that opportunity to as many
people as we can

and how do you do that well I think I
 

9645
03:13:31,680 --> 03:13:35,030
and how do you do that well I think I
know what job one is job one is we have

9646
03:13:35,030 --> 03:13:35,040
know what job one is job one is we have
 

9647
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:36,710
know what job one is job one is we have
to get sustainable

9648
03:13:36,710 --> 03:13:36,720
to get sustainable
 

9649
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:38,510
to get sustainable
the way to get the maximum number of

9650
03:13:38,510 --> 03:13:38,520
the way to get the maximum number of
 

9651
03:13:38,520 --> 03:13:40,849
the way to get the maximum number of
humans to have that opportunity to be

9652
03:13:40,849 --> 03:13:40,859
humans to have that opportunity to be
 

9653
03:13:40,859 --> 03:13:44,269
humans to have that opportunity to be

requires us to reach sustainability
 

9661
03:13:50,279 --> 03:13:53,090
requires us to reach sustainability
and then at sustainability you could

9662
03:13:53,090 --> 03:13:53,100
and then at sustainability you could
 

9663
03:13:53,100 --> 03:13:55,190
and then at sustainability you could
have a horror show of sustainability

9664
03:13:55,190 --> 03:13:55,200
have a horror show of sustainability
 

9665
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:57,229
have a horror show of sustainability
right you could have a totalitarian

9675
03:14:04,560 --> 03:14:07,849

I don't know how precise that
 

9699
03:14:36,180 --> 03:14:37,790
I don't know how precise that
calculation is but I'm pretty sure it's

9700
03:14:37,790 --> 03:14:37,800
calculation is but I'm pretty sure it's
 

9701
03:14:37,800 --> 03:14:40,969
calculation is but I'm pretty sure it's
not wrong it's accurate enough and if it

9702
03:14:40,969 --> 03:14:40,979
not wrong it's accurate enough and if it
 

9703
03:14:40,979 --> 03:14:42,950
not wrong it's accurate enough and if it
is accurate enough then the point is

is accurate enough then the point is
 

9705
03:14:42,960 --> 03:14:45,170
is accurate enough then the point is
okay well there's no ultimate meaning

9706

okay well there's no ultimate meaning
 

9707
03:14:45,180 --> 03:14:47,150
okay well there's no ultimate meaning
but the proximate meaning is that one

9708
03:14:47,150 --> 03:14:47,160
but the proximate meaning is that one

how many people can we get to have this
 

9711
03:14:49,319 --> 03:14:50,990
how many people can we get to have this
wonderful experience that we've gotten

to have right and
there's no way that's so wrong that if I

03:14:55,370 --> 03:14:55,380
there's no way that's so wrong that if I
 

9717
03:14:55,380 --> 03:14:57,349
there's no way that's so wrong that if I
invest my life in it that I'm making

some big error for that life is awesome
 

9721
03:15:00,120 --> 03:15:02,630
some big error for that life is awesome

and we want to spread the awesome as
 

9723
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:04,729
and we want to spread the awesome as
much as possible yeah you sum it up that

that's the fourth Frontier and if that

9728
03:15:08,570 --> 03:15:08,580
that's the fourth Frontier and if that
 

9729
03:15:08,580 --> 03:15:10,849
that's the fourth Frontier and if that
fails if the fourth Frontier fails the

9730
03:15:10,849 --> 03:15:10,859
fails if the fourth Frontier fails the
 

9731
03:15:10,859 --> 03:15:12,830
fails if the fourth Frontier fails the
fifth Frontier will be defined by robots

9732
03:15:12,830 --> 03:15:12,840
fifth Frontier will be defined by robots
 

9733
03:15:12,840 --> 03:15:14,750
fifth Frontier will be defined by robots
and hopefully they'll learn the lessons

9734
03:15:14,750 --> 03:15:14,760
and hopefully they'll learn the lessons
 

9735
03:15:14,760 --> 03:15:17,750
and hopefully they'll learn the lessons
uh that the of the mistakes that the

9736
03:15:17,750 --> 03:15:17,760
uh that the of the mistakes that the
 

9737

hope we're very happy here and that they
 

9741
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:23,269
hope we're very happy here and that they
do a better job with the place than we

9742
03:15:23,269 --> 03:15:23,279
do a better job with the place than we
 

9743
03:15:23,279 --> 03:15:25,010
do a better job with the place than we
did
