00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,309

um
 

149
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,430
um
that's an extraordinary

150
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
that's an extraordinary
 

151
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,710
that's an extraordinary
spread in an extraordinarily short

152
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
spread in an extraordinarily short
 

153
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,430
spread in an extraordinarily short
period of historical time

154
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
period of historical time
 

155
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,149
period of historical time
and what that has meant that speed of

156
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
and what that has meant that speed of
 

157
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,750
and what that has meant that speed of
spread and that geographic diversity

158
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
spread and that geographic diversity
 

159
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,790
spread and that geographic diversity
is that the marxian ideas interacted

160
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
is that the marxian ideas interacted
 

161
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,910
is that the marxian ideas interacted
with

162
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
with
 

163
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,229
with
very different cultural histories

164
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
very different cultural histories
 

165
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,149
very different cultural histories
religious histories

166
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
religious histories
 

167
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,630
religious histories
and economic conditions

168
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
and economic conditions
 

169
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,110
and economic conditions
so the end result was that the ideas

170
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
so the end result was that the ideas
 

171
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,350
so the end result was that the ideas
were interpreted differently in

172
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
were interpreted differently in
 

173
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,070
were interpreted differently in
different places at different times

174
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
different places at different times
 

175
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,789

post-capitalist society ought to look
like how it ought to work

512
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
like how it ought to work
 

513
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,430
like how it ought to work
and there's lots of disagreement about

514
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
and there's lots of disagreement about
 

515
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,150
and there's lots of disagreement about
it

516
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
it
 

517
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,310
it
lots of confusion

518
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
lots of confusion
 

519
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,630
lots of confusion
um and i would say that that's still

520
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
um and i would say that that's still
 

521
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,389
um and i would say that that's still
where it is that you have a tradition

522
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
where it is that you have a tradition
 

523
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,269
where it is that you have a tradition
now

524
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
now
 

525
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,470
now
that has these two major wings critique

526
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
that has these two major wings critique
 

527
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,750
that has these two major wings critique
of capitalism notion of the alternative

528
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
of capitalism notion of the alternative
 

529
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,949
of capitalism notion of the alternative
and then a variety of each of those and

530
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
and then a variety of each of those and
 

531
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,710
and then a variety of each of those and
that would be the framework in which i

532
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
that would be the framework in which i
 

533
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,110
that would be the framework in which i
would answer that's what marxism is

534
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
would answer that's what marxism is
 

535
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,069
would answer that's what marxism is
about

536
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
about
 

537
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,110
about
its basic idea if you had to have one

538
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
its basic idea if you had to have one
 

539
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,590
its basic idea if you had to have one
is that human society

540
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
is that human society
 

541
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,069
is that human society
can do better than capitalism and it

542
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
can do better than capitalism and it
 

543
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,590
can do better than capitalism and it
ought to try

544
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
ought to try
 

545
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,910
ought to try
and then we can start to talk about

546
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
and then we can start to talk about
 

547
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,269
and then we can start to talk about
what we mean by capitalism fine

548
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
what we mean by capitalism fine
 

549
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,190
what we mean by capitalism fine
so we'll look at the critique of

550
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
so we'll look at the critique of
 

551
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,670
so we'll look at the critique of
capitalism on one side but maybe

552
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
capitalism on one side but maybe
 

553
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,829
capitalism on one side but maybe
stepping back what do you think marx

554
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
stepping back what do you think marx
 

555
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,550
stepping back what do you think marx
would say if he just looked at the

556
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
would say if he just looked at the
 

557
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,350
would say if he just looked at the
different implementations of the ideas

558
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
different implementations of the ideas
 

559
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,829
different implementations of the ideas
of marxism throughout the 20th century

560
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
of marxism throughout the 20th century
 

561
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,670
of marxism throughout the 20th century
where his ideas that were implicit were

562
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
where his ideas that were implicit were
 

563
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,269
where his ideas that were implicit were
made explicit

564
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279

 

565
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,310

would uh would he shake his head would

566
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
would uh would he shake his head would
 

567
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,190
would uh would he shake his head would
he enjoy some of the parts of the

568
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
he enjoy some of the parts of the
 

569
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,630
he enjoy some of the parts of the
implementations like what how do you

570
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
implementations like what how do you
 

571
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,470
implementations like what how do you
think he would analyze it well he had a

572
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
think he would analyze it well he had a
 

573
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,910
think he would analyze it well he had a
great sense of humor i don't know if he

574
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
great sense of humor i don't know if he
 

575
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,509
great sense of humor i don't know if he
had a chance to take a look at his

576
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
had a chance to take a look at his
 

577
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,870
had a chance to take a look at his
writing but

578
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
writing but
 

579
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,710
writing but
he had an extraordinary sense of humor

580
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
he had an extraordinary sense of humor
 

581
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,949
he had an extraordinary sense of humor
so my guess is he would deploy his humor

582
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
so my guess is he would deploy his humor
 

583
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,190
so my guess is he would deploy his humor
in answering this question too

584
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
in answering this question too
 

585
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,750
in answering this question too
he would say some of them are inspiring

586
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
he would say some of them are inspiring
 

587
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,990
he would say some of them are inspiring
some of the interpretations of his work

588
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
some of the interpretations of his work
 

589
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,550
some of the interpretations of his work
and he's very pleased with those others

590
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
and he's very pleased with those others
 

591
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,670
and he's very pleased with those others
are horrifying and he wishes somehow he

are horrifying and he wishes somehow he
 

593
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,389
are horrifying and he wishes somehow he
could erase the connection between those

594
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
could erase the connection between those
 

595
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,590
could erase the connection between those
things and the lineage they claim

596
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
things and the lineage they claim
 

597

you know that the ideas you put out are
 

631
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,629
you know that the ideas you put out are
a little bit like having a child

632
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
a little bit like having a child
 

633

a little bit like having a child
you have a lot of influence but the

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
you have a lot of influence but the
 

635
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,670
you have a lot of influence but the
child is his own or her own person and

636
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
child is his own or her own person and
 

637
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,310
child is his own or her own person and
will find his or her own way and these

638
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
will find his or her own way and these
 

639
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,269
will find his or her own way and these
ideas once they're out there

640
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
ideas once they're out there
 

641
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,350
ideas once they're out there
go their own way and as you said there's

642
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
go their own way and as you said there's
 

643
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,829
go their own way and as you said there's
a particular way that this idea spread

644
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
a particular way that this idea spread
 

645
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,269
a particular way that this idea spread
the speed at which it spread throughout

646
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
the speed at which it spread throughout
 

647
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,590
the speed at which it spread throughout
the world made it even less

648
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
the world made it even less
 

649
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,550
the world made it even less
able to be sort of stabilized right and

650
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
able to be sort of stabilized right and
 

651
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,550
able to be sort of stabilized right and
connected back to the origins of where

connected back to the origins of where
 

653
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,389
connected back to the origins of where
the idea came from

654
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
the idea came from
 

655
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,150
the idea came from
the only people who ever really tried

656
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
the only people who ever really tried
 

657

the only people who ever really tried
that

were the russians after the revolution
 

661
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,670
were the russians after the revolution
because they occupied a position for a

been all these people criticizing
 

673
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,870
been all these people criticizing

decisions
then for um

884
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:51,279
then for um
 

885
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,990

stalinism one interesting so stalin's

886
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
stalinism one interesting so stalin's
 

887
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,910
stalinism one interesting so stalin's
implementation of all of this one

888
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
implementation of all of this one
 

889
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,990
implementation of all of this one
interesting characteristic is to

890
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
interesting characteristic is to
 

891
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,949
interesting characteristic is to
move away from the international aspect

892
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
move away from the international aspect
 

893
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,630
move away from the international aspect
of the ideal marxism to uh make it all

894
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
of the ideal marxism to uh make it all
 

895
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,350

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,230
nation
and then um so maoism is

900
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
and then um so maoism is
 

901
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,470
and then um so maoism is
it's it's different in that it's focused

902
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
it's it's different in that it's focused
 

903
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,829
it's it's different in that it's focused
on agriculture and rural

904
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
on agriculture and rural
 

905
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,549
on agriculture and rural
and then trotskyism i don't know

906
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:20,559
and then trotskyism i don't know
 

907
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,909
and then trotskyism i don't know
except that it's anti-stalin

908
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
except that it's anti-stalin
 

909
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,110
except that it's anti-stalin
i mean i don't even know if there's

910
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
i mean i don't even know if there's
 

911
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,870
i mean i don't even know if there's
unique sort of philosophical elements

912
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
unique sort of philosophical elements
 

913
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,270
unique sort of philosophical elements
there anyway can you maybe from those or

914
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
there anyway can you maybe from those or
 

915
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,270
there anyway can you maybe from those or
something else speak to different unique

916
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
something else speak to different unique
 

917
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,590
something else speak to different unique
elements that are interesting to think

918
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
elements that are interesting to think
 

919
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,870
elements that are interesting to think
about about implementation of marxism in

920
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
about about implementation of marxism in
 

921
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,029
about about implementation of marxism in
the real world probably the best way to

922
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
the real world probably the best way to
 

923
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,350
the real world probably the best way to
get in there into this

924
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
get in there into this
 

925
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,310
get in there into this
is to describe something that happened

926
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
is to describe something that happened
 

927
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,029
is to describe something that happened
in

00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
in
 

929
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,909
in
marxism that then shapes the answer to

930
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
marxism that then shapes the answer to
 

931
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,870
marxism that then shapes the answer to
your question

932
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880

 

933
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,669

in the early days of marx's writings

934
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679

this is

1660
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,320
this is
 

1661
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,909
this is
socialism

1662
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919

see capitalism is if the government
 

1665
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,909
see capitalism is if the government
doesn't run it if a private individual

who's not a government official runs it
 

1669
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,870
who's not a government official runs it
well then it's capitalism if the

well then it's capitalism if the
 

1671
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,070
well then it's capitalism if the
government takes it then it's socialist

government takes it then it's socialist
so what is wrong with that

1674
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:58,640
so what is wrong with that
 

1675
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,750
so what is wrong with that
reasoning so the idea i think

1676
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
reasoning so the idea i think
 

1677
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,350
reasoning so the idea i think
there's nothing wrong with it's a way of

1678
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,360
there's nothing wrong with it's a way of
 

1679
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,789
there's nothing wrong with it's a way of
looking at the world it's just got

nothing to do with marx well there's
 

1683
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,470
nothing to do with marx well there's
marks there's marxism

1684

marks there's marxism
 

1685
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,509
marks there's marxism
let's try to pull this apart so

1686
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:11,519
let's try to pull this apart so
 

1687
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,590
let's try to pull this apart so
what role

1688
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
what role
 

1689
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,549
what role
uh

1690
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:14,559
uh
 

1691
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,029
uh
does central planning have

1692
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
does central planning have
 

1693
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,950
does central planning have
in marxism

1694
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:18,960
in marxism
 

1695
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,230
in marxism
so

1696
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,240
so
 

1697
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,470
so
marxism is concerned

1698
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
marxism is concerned
 

1699
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,430
marxism is concerned
with this class struggle

1700
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:25,440
with this class struggle
 

1701
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,350
with this class struggle
with respecting the working class right

1702
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,360
with respecting the working class right
 

1703
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,110
with respecting the working class right
what is the connection

1704
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120
what is the connection
 

1705
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,149
what is the connection
between

1706
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
between
 

1707
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,310
between
that struggle and central planning that

1708
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,320
that struggle and central planning that
 

1709
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,350
that struggle and central planning that
is often

1710
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,360
is often
 

1711
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,029
is often
central planning is often associated

1712
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:37,039
central planning is often associated
 

1713
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,750
central planning is often associated
with marxism right so a centralized

1714
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:39,760
with marxism right so a centralized
 

1715
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,630
with marxism right so a centralized
power doing russia did that allocation

1716
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:42,640
power doing russia did that allocation
 

1717
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,269
power doing russia did that allocation
so that's a that's that has to do with a

1718
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
so that's a that's that has to do with a
 

1719
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,990
so that's a that's that has to do with a
very specific set of implementations

1720
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
very specific set of implementations
 

1721
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,750
very specific set of implementations
initiated by the soviet union has

1722
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760
initiated by the soviet union has
 

1723
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,830
initiated by the soviet union has
nothing to do with marxism how else can

marx's work it has to do
 

1737
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,310
marx's work it has to do
with um

1748
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:19,519
but you still have to take that leap
 

1749
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,870
but you still have to take that leap
what is beyond capitalism right so maybe

1750
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
what is beyond capitalism right so maybe
 

1751
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,750

how else can we go beyond capital right
let me push it a little further

1762
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279
let me push it a little further
 

1763
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,230
let me push it a little further
they didn't succeed in my judgment as a

marxist
 

1767
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,190
marxist
and i'm now going to tell you why they

had lived at their time under their
 

1781
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,470
had lived at their time under their
circumstances this is not a critique of

00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
circumstances this is not a critique of
 

1783
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,350
circumstances this is not a critique of
them

1784
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
them
 

1785
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,630
them
but it's a different way of

1786
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:58,640
but it's a different way of
 

1787
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,950
but it's a different way of
understanding what's going on all right

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,550
who made it
and marx's answer is

2084
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
and marx's answer is
 

2085
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,589
and marx's answer is
therein lies one of the great shapers of

what are they asked if anything to do
with it in re in exchange for getting it

with it in re in exchange for getting it
 

2095
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,109
with it in re in exchange for getting it
what's their social role

2096
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
what's their social role
 

2097
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,430
what's their social role
for example here we go now if you get

2098
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,440
for example here we go now if you get
 

2099
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,670
for example here we go now if you get
this and you get the core of it anyway

this and you get the core of it anyway
 

2101
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,630
this and you get the core of it anyway
um

2102
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:10,640
um
 

2103
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,150
um
and i don't charge much um

2104
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,160
and i don't charge much um
 

2105
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,910
and i don't charge much um
the workers themselves could get less

2106
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:15,920
the workers themselves could get less
 

2107
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,230
the workers themselves could get less
than lawyers right that's right

2108
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,240
than lawyers right that's right
 

2109
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,790
than lawyers right that's right
uh the workers themselves could get it

2110
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
uh the workers themselves could get it
 

2111
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,349
uh the workers themselves could get it
yes that's the closest marx comes to a

2112
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359
yes that's the closest marx comes to a
 

2113
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,589
yes that's the closest marx comes to a
definition of communism

2114
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:25,599
definition of communism
 

2115
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,069
definition of communism
communism would would be

2116
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
communism would would be
 

2117
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,190
communism would would be
if the workers who produce the surplus

2118
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,200
if the workers who produce the surplus
 

2119
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,870
if the workers who produce the surplus
together

2120
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
together
 

2121
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,109
together
decide what to do with it

2122
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:35,119
decide what to do with it
 

2123
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,230
decide what to do with it
so this has to do not just with who gets

2124
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,240
so this has to do not just with who gets
 

2125
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,910
so this has to do not just with who gets
it but more importantly who gets to

2126
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:39,920
it but more importantly who gets to
 

2127
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,470
it but more importantly who gets to
decide who gets it well who gets it and

2128
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
decide who gets it well who gets it and
 

2129
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,550
decide who gets it well who gets it and
who get gets to decide what to do with

2130
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:44,560
who get gets to decide what to do with
 

2131
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,990
who get gets to decide what to do with
it right

2132
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,000
it right
 

2133
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,750
it right
because you can't decide it if you don't

2134
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:47,760
because you can't decide it if you don't
 

2135

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,950
as best i can tell
is a history in which

2458
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
is a history in which
 

2459
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,430
is a history in which
a succession of

00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
a succession of

2465
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,109

and as they do

00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:15,119
and as they do
 

2467
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,030
and as they do
they

2468
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:17,040
they
 

2469
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,549
they
rule out some kinds of human behavior

2470
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:20,559
rule out some kinds of human behavior
 

2471
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,150
rule out some kinds of human behavior
on the grounds that they are socially

2472
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:22,160
on the grounds that they are socially
 

2473
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,510
on the grounds that they are socially
disruptive and unacceptable

2474
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:25,520
disruptive and unacceptable
 

2475
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,230
disruptive and unacceptable
the argument isn't really then

2476
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
the argument isn't really then
 

2477
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,549
the argument isn't really then
is there a need or an instinct is there

2478
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:30,559
is there a need or an instinct is there
 

2479
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,950
is there a need or an instinct is there
some human nature

2480
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:32,960
some human nature
 

2481
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,270
some human nature
that makes people want to do this

2482
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,280
that makes people want to do this
 

2483
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,270
that makes people want to do this
well whatever that is this has to be

2484
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
well whatever that is this has to be
 

2485
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,030
well whatever that is this has to be
repressed or else we don't have a

2486
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,040
repressed or else we don't have a
 

2487
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,309
repressed or else we don't have a
society

2488
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319
society
 

2489
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,990
society
you know and freud helps us to

2490
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:42,000
you know and freud helps us to
 

2491
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,510
you know and freud helps us to
understand

2492
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:43,520
understand
 

2493
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,069
understand
that that repression is going on all the

2494
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:46,079
that that repression is going on all the
 

2495
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,030
that that repression is going on all the
time and it has consequences it's not a

2496
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,040
time and it has consequences it's not a
 

2497
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,349
time and it has consequences it's not a
finished project you repress it it's

2498
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:51,359
finished project you repress it it's
 

2499
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,510
finished project you repress it it's
gone it doesn't work like that

2500
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520
gone it doesn't work like that
 

2501
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,270
gone it doesn't work like that
so for example

2502
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:55,280
so for example
 

2503
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,870
so for example
when you get a bunch of people together

2504
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
when you get a bunch of people together
 

2505
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,430
when you get a bunch of people together
at some point they may develop

2506
00:47:59,430 --> 00:47:59,440
at some point they may develop
 

2507
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,150
at some point they may develop
animosities towards one another that

2508
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:02,160
animosities towards one another that
 

2509
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,870
animosities towards one another that
lead them to want the other person or

2510
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:04,880
lead them to want the other person or
 

2511
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,230
lead them to want the other person or
persons to disappear to be dead to be

2512
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,240
persons to disappear to be dead to be
 

2513
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,349
persons to disappear to be dead to be
gone

2514
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:09,359
gone
 

2515
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,309
gone

in which the defenders of those systems

in which the defenders of those systems

in which the defenders of those systems
not all of them of course but many

not all of them of course but many
 

2547
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,270
not all of them of course but many
defenders used that argument to

defenders used that argument to
 

2549
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,670
defenders used that argument to
naturalize a system is a way to hold on

naturalize a system is a way to hold on
 

2551
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,710
naturalize a system is a way to hold on
to it to prevent it from going to

2552
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:04,720
to it to prevent it from going to
 

2553
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,430
to it to prevent it from going to
counter the argument that every system

2554
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:07,440
counter the argument that every system
 

2555
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,150
counter the argument that every system
is born every system evolves and then

2556
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
is born every system evolves and then
 

2557
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,230
is born every system evolves and then
every system dies

2558
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:12,240
every system dies
 

2559
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,030
every system dies
and therefore capitalism since it was

2560
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:15,040
and therefore capitalism since it was
 

2561
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,549
and therefore capitalism since it was
born and since it's been developing we

2562
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:18,559
born and since it's been developing we
 

2563
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,309
born and since it's been developing we
all know what the next stage of

2564
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
all know what the next stage of
 

2565
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,950
all know what the next stage of
capitalism is what can infer

2566
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:22,960
capitalism is what can infer
 

2567
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,950
capitalism is what can infer
you're is what you're saying the burden

2568
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:24,960
you're is what you're saying the burden
 

2569
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,030
you're is what you're saying the burden
is on the people who think it isn't okay

2570
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,040
is on the people who think it isn't okay
 

2571
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,710
is on the people who think it isn't okay
so it doesn't mean they're wrong but

2572
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:28,720
so it doesn't mean they're wrong but
 

2573
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,710
so it doesn't mean they're wrong but
what you're saying is if you look at

2574
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
what you're saying is if you look at
 

2575
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,829
what you're saying is if you look at
history

2576
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:31,839
history
 

2577
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,630
history
you're deeply suspicious of the argument

2578
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:34,640
you're deeply suspicious of the argument
 

2579
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,230
you're deeply suspicious of the argument
this is going against human nature

2580
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:36,240
this is going against human nature
 

2581
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,309
this is going against human nature
because we keep using that for basically

2582
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:38,319
because we keep using that for basically
 

2583
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,309
because we keep using that for basically
everything including toxic relationship

2584
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:40,319
everything including toxic relationship
 

2585
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,230
everything including toxic relationship
toxic systems absolutely destructive

2586
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
toxic systems absolutely destructive
 

2587
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,349
toxic systems absolutely destructive
systems

2588
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:43,359
systems
 

2589
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,150
systems
that said uh well let me just

2590
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,160
that said uh well let me just
 

2591
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,630
that said uh well let me just
ask a million different questions so so

2592
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:48,640
ask a million different questions so so
 

2593
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,510
ask a million different questions so so
one

2594
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
one
 

2595
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,910
one
what about the the argument that sort of

2596
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:51,920
what about the the argument that sort of
 

2597
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,750
what about the the argument that sort of
the employer

2598
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:53,760
the employer
 

2599
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,069
the employer
uh the capitalist takes on risk

2600
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
uh the capitalist takes on risk
 

2601
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,270
uh the capitalist takes on risk
so

2602
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,280
so
 

2603
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,589
so
the yeah versus the employee who's just

2604
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:01,599
the yeah versus the employee who's just
 

2605
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,230
the yeah versus the employee who's just
there doing the labor the the capitalist

2606
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:04,240
there doing the labor the the capitalist
 

2607
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,190
there doing the labor the the capitalist
is actually putting up a lot of risk

2608
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:07,200
is actually putting up a lot of risk
 

2609
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,549
is actually putting up a lot of risk
what's uh

2610
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:08,559
what's uh
 

2611
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,030
what's uh
uh are they not in sort of aggregating

2612
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040
uh are they not in sort of aggregating
 

2613
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,950
uh are they not in sort of aggregating
this organization and taking this giant

2614
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
this organization and taking this giant
 

2615
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,109
this organization and taking this giant
effort hiring a lot of people

2616
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:15,119
effort hiring a lot of people
 

2617
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,270
effort hiring a lot of people
aren't they taking on risk that this is

2618
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:17,280
aren't they taking on risk that this is

government office
where it is looked at against other

where it is looked at against other
projects

3268
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:30,559
projects
 

3269
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,230
projects
and this office in the government

3270
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
and this office in the government
 

3271
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,510
and this office in the government
decides we're going to fund this one

3272
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:35,520
decides we're going to fund this one
 

3273
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,990
decides we're going to fund this one
and that one because they're more

3274
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,000
and that one because they're more
 

3275
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,309
and that one because they're more
needed in our society we we're in

3276
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:40,319
needed in our society we we're in
 

3277
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,630
needed in our society we we're in
greater need of solving this problem

3278
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:42,640
greater need of solving this problem
 

3279
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,470
greater need of solving this problem
than that problem and so we're going to

3280
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:44,480
than that problem and so we're going to
 

3281
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,309
than that problem and so we're going to
lend money to people working on this

3282
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:46,319
lend money to people working on this
 

3283
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,630
lend money to people working on this
problem more readily or more money than

3284
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:48,640
problem more readily or more money than
 

3285
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,230
problem more readily or more money than
we lend over here because we're going to

3286
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:52,240
we lend over here because we're going to
 

3287
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,230
we lend over here because we're going to
but instead what we do is who can pay

3288
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
but instead what we do is who can pay
 

3289
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,549
but instead what we do is who can pay
the highest interest rate

3290
01:02:56,549 --> 01:02:56,559
the highest interest rate
 

3291
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,589
the highest interest rate
whoa what what what do you do it why why

3292
01:02:59,589 --> 01:02:59,599
whoa what what what do you do it why why
 

3293
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,390
whoa what what what do you do it why why
what ethics would justify you do it it's

3294
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:02,400
what ethics would justify you do it it's
 

3295
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,870
what ethics would justify you do it it's
like a market in general something is in

3296
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
like a market in general something is in
 

3297
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,829
like a market in general something is in
shortage all markets are about how to

3298
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:07,839
shortage all markets are about how to
 

3299
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,829
shortage all markets are about how to
handle shortage that's one basic way to

3300
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:09,839
handle shortage that's one basic way to
 

3301
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,829
handle shortage that's one basic way to
understand it

3302
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:11,839
understand it
 

3303
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,910
understand it
and so if if the demand is greater than

3304
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:13,920
and so if if the demand is greater than
 

3305
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,510
and so if if the demand is greater than
the supply which is all the word

3306
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:15,520
the supply which is all the word
 

3307
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,630
the supply which is all the word
shortage

3308
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640
shortage
 

3309
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,029
shortage
means has no other meaning if the demand

3310
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:19,039
means has no other meaning if the demand
 

3311
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,349
means has no other meaning if the demand
is greater than the supply okay now you

3312
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
is greater than the supply okay now you
 

3313
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,470
is greater than the supply okay now you
got a problem you can't satisfy

3314
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:24,480
got a problem you can't satisfy
 

3315
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,309
got a problem you can't satisfy
all the demanders

3316
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:26,319
all the demanders
 

3317
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,230
all the demanders
because you don't have enough supply

3318
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,240
because you don't have enough supply
 

3319
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,630
because you don't have enough supply
you have a shortage okay now how are you

3320
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:30,640
you have a shortage okay now how are you
 

3321
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,270
you have a shortage okay now how are you
gonna do it in a market you allow people

3322
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:33,280
gonna do it in a market you allow people
 

3323
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,510
gonna do it in a market you allow people
who have a lot of money to bid up the

3324
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,520
who have a lot of money to bid up the
 

3325
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,470
who have a lot of money to bid up the
price of whatever's short

3326
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:38,480
price of whatever's short
 

3327
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,470
price of whatever's short
and you that solves your problem because

3328
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:40,480
and you that solves your problem because
 

3329
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,870
and you that solves your problem because
as the price goes up the poor people

3330
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:42,880
as the price goes up the poor people
 

3331
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,109
as the price goes up the poor people
can't they drop out they can't buy the

3332
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
can't they drop out they can't buy the
 

3333
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,150
can't they drop out they can't buy the
thing at the exalted price so you've got

3334
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:48,160
thing at the exalted price so you've got
 

3335
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,309
thing at the exalted price so you've got
a way of distributing the shortage it

3336
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:50,319
a way of distributing the shortage it
 

3337
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,029
a way of distributing the shortage it
goes to the people with the most money

3338
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:53,039
goes to the people with the most money
 

3339
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,069
goes to the people with the most money
at this point most human beings

3340
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:56,079
at this point most human beings
 

3341
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,549
at this point most human beings
confronted with this explanation of a

01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:51,360
another hundred to hire the workers for
 

3747
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,830
another hundred to hire the workers for
the next shift and the other 20 is his

3748
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:53,840
the next shift and the other 20 is his
 

3749
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,229
the next shift and the other 20 is his
profit and he puts that aside

3750
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:56,239
profit and he puts that aside
 

3751
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,310
profit and he puts that aside
now along comes a technological

3752
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,320
now along comes a technological
 

3753
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,990
now along comes a technological
breakthrough

3754
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:00,000
breakthrough
 

3755
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,550
breakthrough
a machine a new machine

3756
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:02,560
a machine a new machine
 

3757
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,590
a machine a new machine
and the new machine is so effective

3758
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:07,600

 

3759
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,669

you can get the same out the same number

3760
01:12:09,669 --> 01:12:09,679
you can get the same out the same number
 

3761
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,030
you can get the same out the same number
of units of output with half the workers

3762
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,040
of units of output with half the workers
 

3763
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,550
of units of output with half the workers
so you don't need to spend 100 on

3764
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:14,560
so you don't need to spend 100 on
 

3765
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,590
so you don't need to spend 100 on
workers you only need to spend 50.

3766
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:17,600
workers you only need to spend 50.
 

3767
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,910
workers you only need to spend 50.
you can do it with half the workers

3768
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:19,920
you can do it with half the workers
 

3769
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,669
you can do it with half the workers
and so the capitalist goes to the

3770
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:21,679
and so the capitalist goes to the
 

3771
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,189
and so the capitalist goes to the
workers by the way this happens every

3772
01:12:23,189 --> 01:12:23,199
workers by the way this happens every
 

3773
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,590
workers by the way this happens every
day and he says to half of them you're

3774
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:25,600
day and he says to half of them you're
 

3775
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,790
day and he says to half of them you're
fired

3776
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:26,800
fired
 

3777
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,950
fired
don't come back monday morning i don't

3778
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:28,960
don't come back monday morning i don't
 

3779
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,030
don't come back monday morning i don't
need you it's nothing personal i just i

3780
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:31,040
need you it's nothing personal i just i
 

3781
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,669
need you it's nothing personal i just i
got a machine

3782
01:12:33,669 --> 01:12:33,679
got a machine
 

3783
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,470
got a machine
why does he do that because the 50 he

3784
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,480
why does he do that because the 50 he
 

3785
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,630
why does he do that because the 50 he
now no longer has to spend on labor

3786
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:38,640
now no longer has to spend on labor
 

3787
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,550
now no longer has to spend on labor
because don't need half of them

3788
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
because don't need half of them
 

3789
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,790
because don't need half of them
he keeps everything else is the same the

3790
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:42,800
he keeps everything else is the same the
 

3791
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,950
he keeps everything else is the same the
machine everything else is this just to

3792
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:44,960
machine everything else is this just to
 

3793
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,390
machine everything else is this just to
make the math easy so he he keeps as his

3794
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:48,400
make the math easy so he he keeps as his
 

3795
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:52,229
make the math easy so he he keeps as his
own profit the 50 that before he paid

3796
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:52,239
own profit the 50 that before he paid
 

3797
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,470
own profit the 50 that before he paid
for those workers yeah right because

3798
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
for those workers yeah right because
 

3799
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,470
for those workers yeah right because
when he sells it for 220

3800
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:56,480
when he sells it for 220
 

3801
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,470
when he sells it for 220
that 50 don't have to give to the next

3802
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,480
that 50 don't have to give to the next
 

3803
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,709
that 50 don't have to give to the next
year because he has a new machine

3804
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:00,719
year because he has a new machine
 

3805
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,229
year because he has a new machine
so that's what he does

3806
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:02,239
so that's what he does
 

3807
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,709
so that's what he does
the technology leads

3808
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
the technology leads
 

3809
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,470
the technology leads
he's happy

3810
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:06,480
he's happy
 

3811
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,350
he's happy
he's become more profitable he's got an

3812
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,360
he's become more profitable he's got an
 

3813
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,270
he's become more profitable he's got an
extra 50 which is why he buys the

3814
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:11,280
extra 50 which is why he buys the
 

3815
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,470
extra 50 which is why he buys the
machine

3816
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:12,480
machine
 

3817
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,830
machine
the workers

3818
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:13,840
the workers
 

3819
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,510
the workers
are screwed

3820
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:15,520
are screwed
 

3821
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,550
are screwed
half of them just lost their job have to

3822
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:18,560
half of them just lost their job have to
 

3823
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,870
half of them just lost their job have to
go home to their husband and wife tell

3824
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:20,880
go home to their husband and wife tell
 

3825
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,630
go home to their husband and wife tell
them i don't have a job anymore i didn't

3826
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:22,640
them i don't have a job anymore i didn't
 

3827
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,950
them i don't have a job anymore i didn't
do anything wrong the guy was nice

3828
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:24,960
do anything wrong the guy was nice
 

3829
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,149
do anything wrong the guy was nice
enough to say there was nothing wrong

3830
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:26,159
enough to say there was nothing wrong
 

3831
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:28,630
enough to say there was nothing wrong
with me but he doesn't need him you know

3832
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:28,640
with me but he doesn't need him you know
 

3833
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,510
with me but he doesn't need him you know
so i'm i'm completely screwed here i

3834
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:31,520
so i'm i'm completely screwed here i
 

3835
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,709
so i'm i'm completely screwed here i
don't know what i'm going to do about

3836
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:32,719
don't know what i'm going to do about
 

3837
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,110
don't know what i'm going to do about
the debts we have the house on mortgage

3838
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120
the debts we have the house on mortgage
 

3839
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,030
the debts we have the house on mortgage
my children's education or whatever else

3840
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:37,040
my children's education or whatever else
 

3841
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,950
my children's education or whatever else
he's got going for himself

3842
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:38,960
he's got going for himself
 

3843
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,270
he's got going for himself
right now now the point

3844
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280
right now now the point
 

3845
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,630
right now now the point
there was of course an alternative path

3846
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:44,640
there was of course an alternative path
 

3847
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,229
there was of course an alternative path
the alternative path would have been to

3848
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:46,239
the alternative path would have been to
 

3849
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,750
the alternative path would have been to
keep all the workers

3850
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:47,760
keep all the workers
 

3851
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,830
keep all the workers
pay them exactly the same that you did

3852
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:49,840
pay them exactly the same that you did
 

3853
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,870
pay them exactly the same that you did
before

3854
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:50,880
before
 

3855
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,229
before
for half a day's work

3856
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239

 

3857
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,229

you would have got the same output

3858
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:56,239
you would have got the same output
 

3859
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:57,750
you would have got the same output
same revenue

3860
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:57,760
same revenue
 

3861
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,030
same revenue
same profit as before

3862
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
same profit as before
 

3863
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,350
same profit as before
but the gain of the technology

3864
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:03,360
but the gain of the technology
 

3865
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,070
but the gain of the technology
would have been a half a day of freedom

3866
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:06,080
would have been a half a day of freedom
 

3867
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,189
would have been a half a day of freedom
every day of the lives of these workers

3868
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:09,199
every day of the lives of these workers
 

3869
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:12,229
every day of the lives of these workers
the majority of workers would have been

3870
01:14:12,229 --> 01:14:12,239
the majority of workers would have been
 

3871
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,189
the majority of workers would have been
really

3872
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:13,199
really
 

3873
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,870
really
helped

3874
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
helped
 

3875
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,950
helped
by this technology

3876
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:16,960
by this technology
 

3877
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,510
by this technology
but instead they were screwed

3878
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:19,520
but instead they were screwed
 

3879
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,390
but instead they were screwed
so that one guy the employer could make

3880
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:22,400
so that one guy the employer could make
 

3881
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,550
so that one guy the employer could make
a big bundle of more money

3882
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:24,560
a big bundle of more money
 

3883
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,630
a big bundle of more money
you want to support a system like this

3884
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:26,640
you want to support a system like this
 

3885
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,310
you want to support a system like this
well uh to go back to hegel yes the good

3886
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:30,320
well uh to go back to hegel yes the good
 

3887
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,310
well uh to go back to hegel yes the good
and the bad yes

3888
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:32,320
and the bad yes
 

3889
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,110
and the bad yes
so

3890
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120
so
 

3891
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,189
so
you just listed the bad and you also

3892
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:35,199
you just listed the bad and you also
 

3893
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:36,950
you just listed the bad and you also
first listed the good the technological

3894
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
first listed the good the technological
 

3895
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,870
first listed the good the technological
innovation of this kind of system

3896
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:38,880
innovation of this kind of system
 

3897
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,510
innovation of this kind of system
the question is the alternative

3898
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:41,520
the question is the alternative
 

3899
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,870
the question is the alternative
uh whatever

3900
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:42,880
uh whatever
 

3901
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,630
uh whatever
as we try to sneak up to ideas of what

3902
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:44,640
as we try to sneak up to ideas of what
 

3903
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,390
as we try to sneak up to ideas of what
the alternative might look like right

3904
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,400
the alternative might look like right
 

3905
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,830
the alternative might look like right
what are the good and the bad of the

3906
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:47,840
what are the good and the bad of the
 

3907
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,510
what are the good and the bad of the
alternative so you just kind of as a

3908
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:51,520
alternative so you just kind of as a
 

3909
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,149
alternative so you just kind of as a
opposite in the contra by contrast

3910
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:54,159
opposite in the contra by contrast
 

3911
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,310
opposite in the contra by contrast
showed that well a nice alternative is

3912
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,320
showed that well a nice alternative is
 

3913
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,990
showed that well a nice alternative is
you work less

3914
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:58,000
you work less
 

3915

that's under all of us yes but then
what cost does that have

3932
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,040
what cost does that have
 

3933
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,910
what cost does that have

01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,630
down it slows it down and the question
is

3948
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:40,640
is
 

3949
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,630
is
which is more important for the

3950
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:42,640
which is more important for the
 

3951
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,110
which is more important for the
flourishing of humanity i love i agree

3952
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
flourishing of humanity i love i agree
 

3953
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,750
flourishing of humanity i love i agree
with that and i'd love there to be

3954
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:47,760
with that and i'd love there to be
 

3955
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,189
with that and i'd love there to be
a democratic mechanism so let's let's

3956
01:15:51,189 --> 01:15:51,199
a democratic mechanism so let's let's
 

3957
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,990
a democratic mechanism so let's let's
discuss it let's debate it and then

3958
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
discuss it let's debate it and then
 

3959
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,310
discuss it let's debate it and then
let's uh decide what mixture because

3960
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:56,320
let's uh decide what mixture because
 

3961
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,550
let's uh decide what mixture because
it's not either or the math problem i

3962
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:58,560
it's not either or the math problem i
 

3963
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,870
it's not either or the math problem i
gave you is either or we could mix it

3964
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:00,880
gave you is either or we could mix it
 

3965
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,229
gave you is either or we could mix it
you could have

3966
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:02,239
you could have
 

3967
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,149
you could have
a third less of a working day instead of

3968
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:04,159
a third less of a working day instead of
 

3969
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,070
a third less of a working day instead of
a half less and then the other part

3970
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:06,080
a half less and then the other part
 

3971
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,070
a half less and then the other part
would be extra profit for our employer

3972
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:08,080
would be extra profit for our employer
 

3973
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,030
would be extra profit for our employer
etc so let's have a democratic

3974
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:11,040
etc so let's have a democratic
 

3975
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,149
etc so let's have a democratic
discussion

3976
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:12,159
discussion
 

3977
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,510
discussion
of what is the mix between the positive

3978
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,520
of what is the mix between the positive
 

3979
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,390
of what is the mix between the positive
and we have no such thing all of this is

3980
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:18,400
and we have no such thing all of this is
 

3981
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,189
and we have no such thing all of this is
decided by one side in this debate which

3982
01:16:21,189 --> 01:16:21,199
decided by one side in this debate which
 

3983
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,229
decided by one side in this debate which
not only

3984
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:22,239
not only
 

3985
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,070
not only
we know what they do they always choose

3986
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,080
we know what they do they always choose
 

3987
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,390
we know what they do they always choose
the one that maximizes their profit

3988
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:26,400
the one that maximizes their profit
 

3989
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,830
the one that maximizes their profit
because that's what they were told to do

3990
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:27,840
because that's what they were told to do
 

3991
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,990
because that's what they were told to do
in business school where i've taught

3992
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:30,000
in business school where i've taught
 

3993
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,990
in business school where i've taught
right um so we

3994
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:32,000
right um so we
 

3995
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,149
right um so we
not only is it an undemocratic decision

3996
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:34,159
not only is it an undemocratic decision
 

3997
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,630
not only is it an undemocratic decision
but it's lopsided to boot so we don't

3998
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:36,640
but it's lopsided to boot so we don't
 

3999
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,189
but it's lopsided to boot so we don't
have the opportunity but i would love

4000
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:39,199
have the opportunity but i would love
 

4001
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,149
have the opportunity but i would love
for us

4002
01:16:40,149 --> 01:16:40,159
for us
 

4003
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,950
for us
to be good hegelian marxists and say

4004
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:42,960
to be good hegelian marxists and say
 

4005
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,630
to be good hegelian marxists and say
let's take a look at the plus and the

4006
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:44,640
let's take a look at the plus and the
 

4007
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,189
let's take a look at the plus and the
minus and make the best decision that we

4008
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:47,199
minus and make the best decision that we
 

4009
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,149
minus and make the best decision that we
can we'll make mistakes but we'll all

4010
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:50,159
can we'll make mistakes but we'll all
 

4011
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,870
can we'll make mistakes but we'll all
make them together it won't be one of us

4012
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:52,880
make them together it won't be one of us
 

4013
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,590
make them together it won't be one of us
making a dictatorial decision

4014
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:55,600
making a dictatorial decision
 

4015
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,270
making a dictatorial decision

01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,590
you know marx developed the notion of
the dictatorship of the proletariat not

as a notion of how government
 

4021
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,310
as a notion of how government
is not i'm sorry not marx lenin did that

4022
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:04,320
is not i'm sorry not marx lenin did that

works but as a notion of what the
 

4027
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,630
works but as a notion of what the
practical reality is

the dictatorship in these key decisions
 

4031
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,990
the dictatorship in these key decisions
is not made by some sitting council it's

4032

his analysis on that point
 

4041
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,510
his analysis on that point
and by the way i can sketch for you

4042
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:27,520
and by the way i can sketch for you
 

4043
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,030
and by the way i can sketch for you
right now so it doesn't lurk in the

right now so it doesn't lurk in the
 

4045
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,510
right now so it doesn't lurk in the
background what the alternative is let's

4046
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,520
background what the alternative is let's
 

4047
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,070
background what the alternative is let's
go there okay it goes right back to what

go there okay it goes right back to what
 

4049

is because there's always alternatives

4234
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:12,320
is because there's always alternatives
 

4235
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,510
is because there's always alternatives
in theory

4236
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
in theory
 

4237
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,270
in theory
then that puts pressure on everyone to

4238
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
then that puts pressure on everyone to
 

4239
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,830
then that puts pressure on everyone to

but what you're saying is that does not
 

4247
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:26,790
but what you're saying is that does not
result in any in a

the automotive sector is so difficult
 

4395
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,629
the automotive sector is so difficult
to uh they operate at such a thin margin

4396
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
to uh they operate at such a thin margin
 

4397
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,189
to uh they operate at such a thin margin
of profit that they're probably a good

example of like capitalism just

4400
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:07,600
example of like capitalism just
 

4401
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,870

completely coming to a halt in terms of

completely coming to a halt in terms of
 

4403
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,910
completely coming to a halt in terms of
lack of innovation because you know

4404
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:13,920
lack of innovation because you know
 

4405
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,830
lack of innovation because you know
that's a very complicated industry

4406
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:15,840
that's a very complicated industry
 

4407
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,350
that's a very complicated industry
because of the supply chain there's so

4408
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,360
because of the supply chain there's so
 

4409
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,189
because of the supply chain there's so
much come on

4410
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:19,199
much come on
 

4411
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,790
much come on
they have their uniquenesses you're

4412
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:20,800
they have their uniquenesses you're
 

4413
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,070
they have their uniquenesses you're
quite right

4414
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:22,080
quite right
 

4415
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,390
quite right
but so does every other industry the one

4416
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:24,400
but so does every other industry the one
 

4417
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,790
but so does every other industry the one
thing that's common is that many become

for but yeah to push back a little bit

4458
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:11,520
for but yeah to push back a little bit
 

4459
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,629
for but yeah to push back a little bit
also because that's could be

4460
01:25:14,629 --> 01:25:14,639
also because that's could be
 

4461
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:16,790
also because that's could be
this is a question also do you think

4462
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:16,800
this is a question also do you think
 

4463
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,270
this is a question also do you think
we're in danger of oversimplifying

4464
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:19,280
we're in danger of oversimplifying
 

4465
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,629
we're in danger of oversimplifying
capitalism

4466
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:20,639
capitalism
 

4467
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,070
capitalism
it completely removes the basic decency

4468
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:24,080
it completely removes the basic decency
 

4469
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,669
it completely removes the basic decency
of human beings

4470
01:25:25,669 --> 01:25:25,679
of human beings
 

4471
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:26,709
of human beings
so

4472
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:26,719
so
 

4473
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:28,470
so
if you give me a choice

4474
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:28,480
if you give me a choice
 

4475
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,590
if you give me a choice
to press to press a button

4476
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:31,600
to press to press a button
 

4477
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,229
to press to press a button
to get rid of the competition and that

4478
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:34,239
to get rid of the competition and that
 

4479
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:35,590
to get rid of the competition and that
but that's going to lead to a lot of

4480
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:35,600
but that's going to lead to a lot of
 

4481
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,430
but that's going to lead to a lot of
suffering there's a lot of people at the

4482
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:37,440
suffering there's a lot of people at the
 

4483
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,790
suffering there's a lot of people at the
heads of companies that won't press that

4484
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:38,800
heads of companies that won't press that
 

4485
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,669
heads of companies that won't press that
button

4486
01:25:39,669 --> 01:25:39,679
button
 

4487
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:42,550
button
that it's not in the calculation it's

4488
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:42,560
that it's not in the calculation it's
 

4489
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,470
that it's not in the calculation it's
not just money

4490
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:44,480
not just money
 

4491
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,790
not just money
it's human well-being too

4492
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
it's human well-being too
 

4493
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,830
it's human well-being too
so like

4494
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:47,840
so like
 

4495
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,709
so like
i think

4496
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:48,719
i think
 

4497
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:49,990
i think
i

4498
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:50,000
i
 

4499
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,510
i
yes

4500
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:51,520
yes
 

4501
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,189
yes
you and i don't live in the same place

4502
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:53,199
you and i don't live in the same place
 

4503
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,030
you and i don't live in the same place
though so you're saying that the forces

4504
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:55,040
though so you're saying that the forces
 

4505
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,430
though so you're saying that the forces
of capitalism take over in the minds of

4506
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:57,440
of capitalism take over in the minds of
 

4507
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,669
of capitalism take over in the minds of
the people at the top you got it and

4508
01:25:59,669 --> 01:25:59,679
the people at the top you got it and
 

4509
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:02,149
the people at the top you got it and
then they they seized being human

4510
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:02,159
then they they seized being human
 

4511
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,310
then they they seized being human
essentially no this the basic okay i

4512
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:04,320
essentially no this the basic okay i
 

4513
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,590
essentially no this the basic okay i
wouldn't i wouldn't

4514
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:05,600
wouldn't i wouldn't
 

4515
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,350
wouldn't i wouldn't
depending on your model of humans yeah

4516
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,360
depending on your model of humans yeah
 

4517
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,189
depending on your model of humans yeah
but they they they lose track of the

4518
01:26:09,189 --> 01:26:09,199
but they they they lose track of the
 

4519
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,110
but they they they lose track of the
better angels of their nature

4520
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
better angels of their nature
 

4521
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,669
better angels of their nature
and uh they just become cogs in the

4522
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
and uh they just become cogs in the
 

4523
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,189
and uh they just become cogs in the
machine but they're just happening to be

4524
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:15,199
machine but they're just happening to be
 

4525
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,629
machine but they're just happening to be
the company i would put it differently

4526
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:16,639
the company i would put it differently
 

4527
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:19,030
the company i would put it differently
that the system is so set up it's a

4528
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:19,040
that the system is so set up it's a
 

4529
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,110
that the system is so set up it's a
little bit like natural selection

4530
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,120
little bit like natural selection
 

4531
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,430
little bit like natural selection
the guys who may honor i could say the

things have had to do things along the
 

4541
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,270
things have had to do things along the
way that become selective if they can't

4542
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:35,280
way that become selective if they can't
 

4543
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,750
way that become selective if they can't
stand it because they have that human

4597
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,950
know
are

4598
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:32,960
are
 

4599
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,550
are
especially at the top of companies are

4600
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
especially at the top of companies are
 

4601
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,390
especially at the top of companies are
in the tech sector

4602
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:36,400
in the tech sector
 

4603
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,270
in the tech sector
where

4604
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,280
where
 

4605
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,189
where
innovation

4606
01:27:39,189 --> 01:27:39,199
innovation
 

4607
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:42,070
innovation
is such a big part of it

4608
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:42,080
is such a big part of it
 

4609
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,709
is such a big part of it
so i think a lot of the things we're

4610
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:44,719
so i think a lot of the things we're
 

4611
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:47,270
so i think a lot of the things we're
talking about is when there's not much

4612
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:47,280
talking about is when there's not much
 

4613
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,750
talking about is when there's not much
innovation in the system

4614
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:49,760
innovation in the system
 

4615
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,870
innovation in the system
so

4616
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:50,880
so
 

4617
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:51,669
so
uh

4618
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:51,679
uh
 

4619
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,910
uh
innovation usually comes in the history

4620
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:53,920
innovation usually comes in the history
 

4621
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,470
innovation usually comes in the history
of capitalism innovation comes in spurts

4622
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:56,480
of capitalism innovation comes in spurts
 

4623
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,990
of capitalism innovation comes in spurts
there's the electric period the

4624
01:27:57,990 --> 01:27:58,000
there's the electric period the

the artificial intelligence or robotics

4630
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:04,960
the artificial intelligence or robotics
 

4631
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,830
the artificial intelligence or robotics
or computer it doesn't it comes and then

4632
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:07,840
or computer it doesn't it comes and then
 

4633
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,590
or computer it doesn't it comes and then
there's a flurry as everything is

4634
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:09,600
there's a flurry as everything is
 

4635
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,790
there's a flurry as everything is
reorganized around whatever the newest

01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:12,800
reorganized around whatever the newest
 

4637
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,629

technology is
 

4639
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,390
technology is
and then you have a period where you can

4640
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:16,400
and then you have a period where you can
 

4641
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,790
and then you have a period where you can
get excited about that and the very rich

01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800
get excited about that and the very rich
 

4643

get excited about that and the very rich
people who come to the top can talk

4644
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120

4645
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,110
people who come to the top can talk
endlessly as they always do about

it up even more why because that's

they have to do each one of them
 

4741
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,550
they have to do each one of them
justifies that i have to do that

4873
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,709
country all the major metropolis this
country's overwhelmingly metropolitan

4874
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:48,719
country's overwhelmingly metropolitan
 

4875
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,950
country's overwhelmingly metropolitan
area well it really has to be more than

4876
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:50,960
area well it really has to be more than
 

4877
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,270
area well it really has to be more than
30 billion but but well it was a few

4878
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:53,280
30 billion but but well it was a few
 

4879
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,790
30 billion but but well it was a few
years ago

4880
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:54,800
years ago
 

4881
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,390
years ago
you're saying it's but i'm using a lot

4882
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:56,400
you're saying it's but i'm using a lot
 

4883
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,310
you're saying it's but i'm using a lot
of that's insane right it's not crazy

4884
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:58,320
of that's insane right it's not crazy
 

4885
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,070
of that's insane right it's not crazy
stuff it's a reasonable number right

4886
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:00,080
stuff it's a reasonable number right
 

4887
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,990
stuff it's a reasonable number right
right hey listen um but there's a and

4888
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:02,000
right hey listen um but there's a and
 

4889
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,830
right hey listen um but there's a and
we'll let me just finish the point sure

4890
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:03,840
we'll let me just finish the point sure
 

4891
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,350
we'll let me just finish the point sure
yes okay

4892
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:05,360
yes okay
 

4893
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,950
yes okay
so

4894
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:06,960
so
 

4895
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,390
so
i'm trying to be rational here

4896
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:10,400
i'm trying to be rational here
 

4897
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,390
i'm trying to be rational here
if we have a climate crisis which

4898
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:12,400
if we have a climate crisis which
 

4899
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,229
if we have a climate crisis which
everyone tells me we do

4900
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:14,239
everyone tells me we do
 

4901
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:15,990
everyone tells me we do
if it's got a lot to do with fossil

4902
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:16,000
if it's got a lot to do with fossil
 

4903
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,750
if it's got a lot to do with fossil
fuels which everybody tells me it has to

4904
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:17,760
fuels which everybody tells me it has to
 

4905
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,550
fuels which everybody tells me it has to
do

4906
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:18,560
do
 

4907
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,550
do
and and with the use of the fossil fuel

4908
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:20,560
and and with the use of the fossil fuel
 

4909
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,790
and and with the use of the fossil fuel
particularly for the automobile

4910
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:22,800
particularly for the automobile
 

4911
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,550
particularly for the automobile
then the solution to the problem would

4912
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,560
then the solution to the problem would
 

4913
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,629
then the solution to the problem would
be mass transit

4914
01:33:26,629 --> 01:33:26,639
be mass transit
 

4915
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:29,030
be mass transit
we don't we're doing nothing to make

4916
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:29,040
we don't we're doing nothing to make
 

4917
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,950
we don't we're doing nothing to make
that happen nothing

4918
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:30,960
that happen nothing
 

4919
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,430
that happen nothing
well there's you know on um

4920
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:33,440
well there's you know on um
 

4921
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,669
well there's you know on um
you could argue that autonomous vehicles

4922
01:33:35,669 --> 01:33:35,679
you could argue that autonomous vehicles
 

4923
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,750
you could argue that autonomous vehicles
is a kind of public transit because it's

4924
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:37,760
is a kind of public transit because it's
 

4925
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,750
is a kind of public transit because it's
going to be reusable vehicles it will

4926
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
going to be reusable vehicles it will
 

4927
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:40,870
going to be reusable vehicles it will

in theory uh car ownership so you just

4930
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:44,080
in theory uh car ownership so you just
 

4931
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,149
in theory uh car ownership so you just
have a more kind of distributed public

4932
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
have a more kind of distributed public
 

4933
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,229
have a more kind of distributed public
transit if it happens but you know that

4934
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:48,239
transit if it happens but you know that

4979
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,510
don't know if they know what a public
transit system is period yes um there's

4980
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:41,520
transit system is period yes um there's
 

4981
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,510

they're well there's this is an
 

4985
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:46,470
they're well there's this is an
interesting

4986
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:46,480
interesting
 

4987
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,430
interesting
so

4988
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:47,440
so
 

4989
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,910
so
the older by the way footnote the older

the older by the way footnote the older
the city the more likely it has public

4992
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:52,480
the city the more likely it has public
 

4993
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,149
the city the more likely it has public
transportation

4994
01:34:54,149 --> 01:34:54,159

so you're saying boston is the best

4996
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:55,760
so you're saying boston is the best
 

4997
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,390
so you're saying boston is the best
example yes you have you been well yeah

4998
01:34:58,390 --> 01:34:58,400
example yes you have you been well yeah
 

4999
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,990
example yes you have you been well yeah
yeah of course yeah i have a place in

5000
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,000
yeah of course yeah i have a place in
 

5001
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,070
yeah of course yeah i have a place in
boston boston with the street railway

5002
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:02,080
boston boston with the street railway
 

5003

boston boston with the street railway
boston is your case study of how to do

5004
01:35:04,470 --> 01:35:04,480
boston is your case study of how to do
 

5005
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,149
boston is your case study of how to do
this because they've been doing it all

5006
01:35:06,149 --> 01:35:06,159
this because they've been doing it all
 

5007
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:07,910
this because they've been doing it all
along new york is pretty good too

5008
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:07,920
along new york is pretty good too
 

5009
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,189
along new york is pretty good too
there's a trade-off yeah new york i

5010
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:09,199
there's a trade-off yeah new york i
 

5011
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,669
there's a trade-off yeah new york i
would say is better than boston because

5012
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:11,679
would say is better than boston because
 

5013
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,350
would say is better than boston because
there's you know

5014
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:13,360
there's you know
 

5015
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,510
there's you know
their technology also helps you out to

5016
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:15,520
their technology also helps you out to
 

5017
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,629
their technology also helps you out to
do the public transit better uh oh it's

5018
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:18,639
do the public transit better uh oh it's
 

5019
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:20,149
do the public transit better uh oh it's
almost like boston is a little too old

5020
01:35:20,149 --> 01:35:20,159
almost like boston is a little too old
 

5021
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,310
almost like boston is a little too old
but yes i get your point uh but there is

5022
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:22,320
but yes i get your point uh but there is
 

5023
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,390
but yes i get your point uh but there is
a

5024
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:24,400
a
 

5025
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,750
a
the the ford f-150 pickup truck

5026
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:27,760
the the ford f-150 pickup truck
 

5027
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,070
the the ford f-150 pickup truck
symbolizes something about america and

5028
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,080
symbolizes something about america and
 

5029
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,070
symbolizes something about america and
and there is a practical nature to the

universities good reason it's a mess
but they're proudly modeling themselves

5356
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:45,520
but they're proudly modeling themselves
 

5357
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,709
but they're proudly modeling themselves
on organizing their bureaucracy in a

5358
01:41:48,709 --> 01:41:48,719
on organizing their bureaucracy in a
 

5359
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:51,750
on organizing their bureaucracy in a
business-like manner

5360

business-like manner
 

5361
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,750
business-like manner
so you're looking at a difference which

5362
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
so you're looking at a difference which
 

5363
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,109
so you're looking at a difference which
isn't there

5364
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:55,119
isn't there
 

5365
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:57,910
isn't there
the government and the private sector

5366
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:57,920
the government and the private sector
 

5367
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,470
the government and the private sector
are partners and both of them wouldn't

5368
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,480
are partners and both of them wouldn't
 

5369
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,189
are partners and both of them wouldn't
have it any other way the corporations

5370
01:42:03,189 --> 01:42:03,199
have it any other way the corporations
 

5371
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:05,669
have it any other way the corporations
want that from the government and the

5372
01:42:05,669 --> 01:42:05,679
want that from the government and the
 

5373
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:07,990
want that from the government and the
government now knows that to please the

5374
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:08,000
government now knows that to please the
 

5375
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,350
government now knows that to please the
corporations is the number one objective

5376
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:11,360
corporations is the number one objective
 

5377
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,350
corporations is the number one objective
they have because that's how they keep

5378
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:13,360
they have because that's how they keep
 

5379
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,990
they have because that's how they keep
their jobs and keep their system going

5380
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:16,000
their jobs and keep their system going
 

5381
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,709
their jobs and keep their system going
and so for all practical purposes this

5382
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
and so for all practical purposes this
 

5383
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:19,430
and so for all practical purposes this
is

5384
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:19,440
is
 

5385
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,590

this is the same people but there's a
 

5387
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,830
this is the same people but there's a
important differences

5388
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:23,840
important differences
 

5389
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:24,629
important differences
that

or just a consequence of history but if
 

5395
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,149
or just a consequence of history but if
you have government

think that's
 

6935
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:15,109
think that's
the focal area we are socialists for

6936
02:12:15,109 --> 02:12:15,119
the focal area we are socialists for
 

6937
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:18,229
the focal area we are socialists for
example because we want to do something

6938
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:18,239
example because we want to do something

think the world is about to kill itself
 

6943
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:27,109
think the world is about to kill itself
um uh physically and we want to take

6944
02:12:27,109 --> 02:12:27,119
um uh physically and we want to take
 

6945
02:12:27,119 --> 02:12:30,390
um uh physically and we want to take
steps with other people to stop that to

6946
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:30,400
steps with other people to stop that to
 

6947
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:32,709
steps with other people to stop that to
to fix that etc etc

6948
02:12:32,709 --> 02:12:32,719
to fix that etc etc
 

6949
02:12:32,719 --> 02:12:35,270
to fix that etc etc
so that that's for me uh a kind of

6950
02:12:35,270 --> 02:12:35,280
so that that's for me uh a kind of
 

6951
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:36,790
so that that's for me uh a kind of
difference

6952
02:12:36,790 --> 02:12:36,800
difference
 

6953
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,629
difference
it's a little difficult to say because

6954
02:12:38,629 --> 02:12:38,639
it's a little difficult to say because
 

6955
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:41,270
it's a little difficult to say because
there's no other figure

6956
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:41,280
there's no other figure
 

6957
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:42,950
there's no other figure
like marx

6958
02:12:42,950 --> 02:12:42,960
like marx

and the only tradition that comes close
 

6967
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:55,350
and the only tradition that comes close
might be

6968
02:12:55,350 --> 02:12:55,360
might be
 

6969
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:58,669
might be
the anarchist tradition but that's very

6970
02:12:58,669 --> 02:12:58,679
the anarchist tradition but that's very
 

6971
02:12:58,679 --> 02:13:01,109
the anarchist tradition but that's very
specialized and

6987
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:22,229
marx and marxism have had so far that
could change but i mean up to this point

6988
02:13:22,229 --> 02:13:22,239
could change but i mean up to this point
 

6989
02:13:22,239 --> 02:13:24,470
could change but i mean up to this point
um that's the

6990
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:24,480
um that's the
 

6991
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:25,910
um that's the
um

6992
02:13:25,910 --> 02:13:25,920
um
 

6993
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:27,990
um
i think that's a way of understanding

6994
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:28,000
i think that's a way of understanding
 

6995
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,750
i think that's a way of understanding
the relationship yeah that's interesting

6996
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:29,760
the relationship yeah that's interesting
 

6997
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,229
the relationship yeah that's interesting
that the some of the ideas within

6998
02:13:32,229 --> 02:13:32,239
that the some of the ideas within
 

6999
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:34,149
that the some of the ideas within
anarchism and of course it's a one of

7000
02:13:34,149 --> 02:13:34,159
anarchism and of course it's a one of
 

7001
02:13:34,159 --> 02:13:36,310
anarchism and of course it's a one of
the more varied

7002
02:13:36,310 --> 02:13:36,320
the more varied
 

7003
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,629
the more varied
um disciplines right because there's

7004
02:13:38,629 --> 02:13:38,639
um disciplines right because there's
 

7005
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:39,750
um disciplines right because there's
such

02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:39,760
such
 

7007
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:42,069
such
maybe by definition such variety in

7008
02:13:42,069 --> 02:13:42,079
maybe by definition such variety in
 

7009
02:13:42,079 --> 02:13:44,470
maybe by definition such variety in

02:15:48,239 --> 02:15:50,709
is desperate to hold on which ought to
be suggestive that maybe the turn to

02:15:50,709 --> 02:15:50,719
be suggestive that maybe the turn to
 

7119
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:53,109
be suggestive that maybe the turn to
powerful governments here in the united

powerful governments here in the united
 

7121

is maybe also because this system is

02:15:58,950 --> 02:15:58,960
is maybe also because this system is
 

7125
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:02,310
is maybe also because this system is
exhausted and can't go on and has to

02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:02,320
exhausted and can't go on and has to
 

7127
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:04,390
exhausted and can't go on and has to
marshal every last

not to be
 

7133
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,589
not to be
lost in history it would be interesting

lost in history it would be interesting
 

7135
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:13,350
lost in history it would be interesting
to see what the soviet union would look
