and so the thing I think about a lot is
 

157
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,210
and so the thing I think about a lot is
just how many patterns in life are we

158
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,220
just how many patterns in life are we
 

159
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,770
just how many patterns in life are we
just like these rats and we're trapped

161
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,270
just like these rats and we're trapped
in a prime number Maze and if we had

162
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
in a prime number Maze and if we had
 

163
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,729
in a prime number Maze and if we had
just a little bit more you know

164
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:13,739
just a little bit more you know
 

165
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,890
just a little bit more you know
cogitation if we had you know a little

166
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:15,900
cogitation if we had you know a little
 

167
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,570
cogitation if we had you know a little
bit more cognitive ability a little bit

168
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:17,580
bit more cognitive ability a little bit
 

169
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,490
bit more cognitive ability a little bit
more whether it's uh you know brain

00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:19,500
more whether it's uh you know brain

00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:21,239
machine interface or just better physics
 

173
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,850

we could just figure out the next step

174
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:22,860
we could just figure out the next step
 

175
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,649
we could just figure out the next step
in that prime numbers we could just see

176
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:24,659
in that prime numbers we could just see
 

177
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,110
in that prime numbers we could just see
it we could see the grid right and

178
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
it we could see the grid right and
 

179
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,430
it we could see the grid right and
that's what I think about like that

180
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,440
that's what I think about like that
 

181
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,710
that's what I think about like that
that's a big thing that drives me

182
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
that's a big thing that drives me
 

183
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,390
that's a big thing that drives me
is figuring out how we can actually

184
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
is figuring out how we can actually
 

185
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,890
is figuring out how we can actually
conceive understand that prime number

186
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:33,900
conceive understand that prime number
 

187
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,750
conceive understand that prime number

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:44,760
cognition yes and uh what do you make
 

195
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,610

a feature or a bug

198
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:49,379
a feature or a bug
 

199
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,369
a feature or a bug
I think mostly a bug I admire vermonagen

and just by writing it down you know

210
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:04,500
and just by writing it down you know
 

211
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,930
and just by writing it down you know
that's that's the leap forward you know

212
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:05,940
that's that's the leap forward you know
 

213
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,630
that's that's the leap forward you know
people talk about it's not the idea it's

them you don't know how they work right

228
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
them you don't know how they work right
 

229
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,770
them you don't know how they work right
you have the phenomenological but you

230
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:24,780
you have the phenomenological but you
 

231
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,510
you have the phenomenological but you
don't have the theory underneath it and

232
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:26,520
don't have the theory underneath it and
 

233
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,950
don't have the theory underneath it and
then that stimulates the advancement of

234
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:27,960
then that stimulates the advancement of
 

235
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,150
then that stimulates the advancement of
theory to figure out why is this thing

236
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,160
theory to figure out why is this thing
 

237
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,530
theory to figure out why is this thing
actually working that's actually you

238
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:30,540
actually working that's actually you
 

239
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,950
actually working that's actually you
know statmac you know arose in part from

240
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:33,960
know statmac you know arose in part from
 

241
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,230
know statmac you know arose in part from
the kind of phenomenological studies

242
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
the kind of phenomenological studies
 

243
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,310
the kind of phenomenological studies
that were basically being done where

244
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,320
that were basically being done where
 

245
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,570
that were basically being done where
people are just getting steam engines

246
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:38,580
people are just getting steam engines
 

247
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,670
people are just getting steam engines
and so on work and then they kind of

248
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:40,680
and so on work and then they kind of
 

249
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,230
and so on work and then they kind of
abstracted out thermodynamics and so on

250
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
abstracted out thermodynamics and so on
 

251
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,210
abstracted out thermodynamics and so on
from that right so the the practice led

252
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:44,220
from that right so the the practice led
 

253
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,890
from that right so the the practice led
the theory rather than vice versa to

254
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:45,900
the theory rather than vice versa to
 

255
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,030
the theory rather than vice versa to
some extent that's happening neural

256
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
some extent that's happening neural
 

257
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,370
some extent that's happening neural
networks now as you're aware right and I

258
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:49,380
networks now as you're aware right and I
 

259
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,629
networks now as you're aware right and I
think that's

260
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
think that's
 

261
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,730
think that's
um so just something that's true and

262
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:52,740
um so just something that's true and
 

263
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,710
um so just something that's true and
that works you know if we don't know yet

264
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
that works you know if we don't know yet
 

265
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,570
that works you know if we don't know yet
that's amazing and it pulls us forward

266
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:56,580
that's amazing and it pulls us forward
 

267
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,550
that's amazing and it pulls us forward
so I I do think that the limits are are

268
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
so I I do think that the limits are are
 

269
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,990
so I I do think that the limits are are
more of a bug than a feature is there

270
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
more of a bug than a feature is there
 

271
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,310
more of a bug than a feature is there
something that humans will never be able

272
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,320
something that humans will never be able
 

273
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,469
something that humans will never be able
to figure out about our universe about

274
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:03,479
to figure out about our universe about
 

275
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,990
to figure out about our universe about
the theory about the practice of our

276
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
the theory about the practice of our
 

277
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,850
the theory about the practice of our
universe yeah people will typically

278
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:07,860
universe yeah people will typically
 

279
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,650
universe yeah people will typically
quote credel's in completeness with for

280
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:09,660
quote credel's in completeness with for
 

281
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,770
quote credel's in completeness with for
such a question and uh yeah there are

282
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:12,780
such a question and uh yeah there are
 

283
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,390
such a question and uh yeah there are
things that are probably unknowable or

284
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
things that are probably unknowable or
 

285
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,310
things that are probably unknowable or
provably unprovable

286
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
provably unprovable
 

287
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,570
provably unprovable
um but I think you can often get an

288
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:17,580
um but I think you can often get an
 

289
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,490
um but I think you can often get an
approximate solution you know the the

290
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:19,500
approximate solution you know the the
 

291
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,290
approximate solution you know the the
Hilbert you know you know Hilbert's

292
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:21,300
Hilbert you know you know Hilbert's
 

293
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,290
Hilbert you know you know Hilbert's
problems like we will know we must know

294
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:23,300
problems like we will know we must know
 

295
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,610
problems like we will know we must know
uh at least we should know that we can

296
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:25,620
uh at least we should know that we can
 

297
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,010
uh at least we should know that we can
know push to get at least an approximate

298
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,020
know push to get at least an approximate
 

299
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,050
know push to get at least an approximate
solution push to know that we can't no

300
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,060
solution push to know that we can't no
 

301
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,090
solution push to know that we can't no
at least we push back that Darkness

302
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:32,100
at least we push back that Darkness
 

303
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,770
at least we push back that Darkness
enough so that we have lit up that

304
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:33,780
enough so that we have lit up that
 

305
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,930
enough so that we have lit up that
corner of the intellectual Universe okay

306
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:35,940
corner of the intellectual Universe okay
 

307
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,090
corner of the intellectual Universe okay
let's actually take a bit of a tangent

308
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,100
let's actually take a bit of a tangent
 

309
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,730
let's actually take a bit of a tangent
and explore a bit in a way that I did

310
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:40,740
and explore a bit in a way that I did
 

311
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,830
and explore a bit in a way that I did
not expect we would but let's talk about

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:42,840
not expect we would but let's talk about
 

313
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,689
not expect we would but let's talk about
the nature of reality briefly I don't

314
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:44,699
the nature of reality briefly I don't
 

315
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,310
the nature of reality briefly I don't
know if you're familiar with the work of

316
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
know if you're familiar with the work of
 

317
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,650
know if you're familiar with the work of
Don Hoffman no I don't I know Roger

series for like basic physics going up

322
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:52,860
series for like basic physics going up
 

323
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,230
series for like basic physics going up
to everything we know but go ahead tell

324
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
to everything we know but go ahead tell
 

325
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,270
to everything we know but go ahead tell
me it's even Wilder yeah in modern

326
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,280
me it's even Wilder yeah in modern
 

327
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,950
me it's even Wilder yeah in modern
physics we start the question of what is

328
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:57,960
physics we start the question of what is
 

329
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,529
physics we start the question of what is
fundamental and what is emergent in this

330
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:00,539
fundamental and what is emergent in this
 

331
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,330
fundamental and what is emergent in this
beautiful Universe of ours and there's a

332
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:02,340
beautiful Universe of ours and there's a
 

333
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,810
beautiful Universe of ours and there's a
bunch of folks who think that space-time

334
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:05,820
bunch of folks who think that space-time
 

335
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,610
bunch of folks who think that space-time
as we know it the four-dimensional space

336
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:07,620
as we know it the four-dimensional space
 

337
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,249
as we know it the four-dimensional space
is emergent it's not fundamental to the

338
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:10,259
is emergent it's not fundamental to the
 

339
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,430
is emergent it's not fundamental to the
physics of the universe and the same May

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,020
the evolutionary case that the reality

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,070
the evolutionary case that the reality
we perceive with our eyes is not only an

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,080
we perceive with our eyes is not only an
 

363
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,950
we perceive with our eyes is not only an
abstraction of objective reality but

364
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:45,960
abstraction of objective reality but
 

365
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,170
abstraction of objective reality but
it's actually completely detached like

366
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,180
it's actually completely detached like
 

367
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,010
it's actually completely detached like
we're in a video game essentially that's

368
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,020
we're in a video game essentially that's
 

369
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,290
we're in a video game essentially that's
consistent between each consistent for

00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,300
consistent between each consistent for
 

371
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,110
consistent between each consistent for
All Humans but it doesn't it's not at

372
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
All Humans but it doesn't it's not at
 

373
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,490
All Humans but it doesn't it's not at
all connected to physical reality

374
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:58,500
all connected to physical reality
 

375
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,469
all connected to physical reality
because it's an illustration version of

376
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
because it's an illustration version of
 

377
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,689
because it's an illustration version of
the simulation hypothesis is that his in

378
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:02,699
the simulation hypothesis is that his in
 

379
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,029
the simulation hypothesis is that his in
a very distant way but

380
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
a very distant way but
 

381
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,610
a very distant way but
as the simulation says that there's a

382
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:07,620
as the simulation says that there's a
 

383
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,290
as the simulation says that there's a
sort of computational nature to reality

384
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:09,300
sort of computational nature to reality
 

385
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,689
sort of computational nature to reality
and then there's a kind of a programmer

386
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:11,699
and then there's a kind of a programmer
 

387
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,850
and then there's a kind of a programmer
that creates this reality and so on no

388
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:13,860
that creates this reality and so on no
 

389
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,129
that creates this reality and so on no
he's he says that we humans have a brain

390
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:16,139
he's he says that we humans have a brain
 

391
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,529
he's he says that we humans have a brain
that is able to perceive the environment

392
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:18,539
that is able to perceive the environment
 

393
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,469
that is able to perceive the environment
and uh evolution is produced from

394
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:21,479
and uh evolution is produced from
 

395
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,469
and uh evolution is produced from
primitive life to complex life on Earth

396
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
primitive life to complex life on Earth
 

397
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,450
primitive life to complex life on Earth
produce the kind of brain that doesn't

398
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:26,460
produce the kind of brain that doesn't
 

399
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,210
produce the kind of brain that doesn't
at all need to sense the reality uh

400
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,220
at all need to sense the reality uh
 

401
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,550
at all need to sense the reality uh
directly so like this table

402
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,560
directly so like this table
 

403
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,610
directly so like this table
according to Donald Hoffman is not there

404
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:34,620
according to Donald Hoffman is not there
 

405
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,089
according to Donald Hoffman is not there
well so like not not just as an

406
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:38,099
well so like not not just as an
 

407
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,770
well so like not not just as an
abstraction like we don't sense the

408
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:39,780
abstraction like we don't sense the
 

409
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,110
abstraction like we don't sense the
molecules that make up the table but all

410
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
molecules that make up the table but all
 

411
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,170
molecules that make up the table but all
of this is fake interesting so you know

412
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:45,180
of this is fake interesting so you know
 

413
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,990
of this is fake interesting so you know
I I tend to be more of a hard science

414
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
I I tend to be more of a hard science
 

415
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,230
I I tend to be more of a hard science
person right and so

416
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,240
person right and so
 

417
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,809
person right and so
um you know so just on that people talk

418
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:53,819
um you know so just on that people talk
 

419
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,990
um you know so just on that people talk
about qualia you know like

420
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
about qualia you know like
 

421
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,430
about qualia you know like
is your perception of green the

422
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,440
is your perception of green the
 

423
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,990
is your perception of green the
different different from my perception

424
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
different different from my perception
 

425
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,629
different different from my perception
of green and you know my counter

426
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
of green and you know my counter
 

427
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,010
of green and you know my counter
argument on that is well we know

428
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,020
argument on that is well we know
 

429
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,510
argument on that is well we know
something about you know spectrum of

430
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
something about you know spectrum of
 

431
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,370
something about you know spectrum of
light and we can build artificial eyes

432
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:07,380
light and we can build artificial eyes
 

433
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,170
light and we can build artificial eyes
and if we can build artificial eyes

434
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:09,180
and if we can build artificial eyes
 

435
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,490
and if we can build artificial eyes
which we can you know they're like

436
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,500
which we can you know they're like
 

437
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,990
which we can you know they're like
they're not amazing but you can actually

438
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
they're not amazing but you can actually
 

439
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,550
they're not amazing but you can actually
you can do that you can build artificial

440
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:13,560
you can do that you can build artificial
 

441
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,990
you can do that you can build artificial
ears and so on obviously we can build

442
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,000
ears and so on obviously we can build
 

443
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,850
ears and so on obviously we can build
recording devices and you know for

444
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:16,860
recording devices and you know for
 

445
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,890
recording devices and you know for
cameras and things like that well

446
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:18,900
cameras and things like that well
 

447
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,650
cameras and things like that well
operationally the whole concept of your

448
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:21,660
operationally the whole concept of your
 

449
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,969
operationally the whole concept of your
perception of green you see green is

450
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:22,979
perception of green you see green is
 

451
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,409
perception of green you see green is
purple I see green is green or what I

452
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:24,419
purple I see green is green or what I
 

453
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:25,969
purple I see green is green or what I
call Green it doesn't seem to add up

454
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:25,979
call Green it doesn't seem to add up
 

455
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,770
call Green it doesn't seem to add up
because it does seem like we can do

456
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:27,780
because it does seem like we can do
 

457
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,170
because it does seem like we can do
engineering around it right so the

458
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:30,180
engineering around it right so the
 

459
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,990
engineering around it right so the
Hoffman thing I get why people more

460
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,000
Hoffman thing I get why people more
 

461
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,190
Hoffman thing I get why people more
broadly will talk about a simulation

462
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,200
broadly will talk about a simulation
 

463
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,589
broadly will talk about a simulation
hypo is because you know it's like fine

464
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:36,599
hypo is because you know it's like fine
 

465
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,529
hypo is because you know it's like fine
when many others have talked about how

466
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:38,539
when many others have talked about how
 

467
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,930
when many others have talked about how
uh math is surprisingly useful to

468
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:41,940
uh math is surprisingly useful to
 

469
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,550
uh math is surprisingly useful to
describe the world you know like very

470
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:43,560
describe the world you know like very
 

471
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,050
describe the world you know like very
simple equations give rise these complex

472
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,060
simple equations give rise these complex
 

473
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,750
simple equations give rise these complex
phenomenal Wolfram is also on this

474
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
phenomenal Wolfram is also on this
 

475
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,250
phenomenal Wolfram is also on this
um from it from a different angle with a

476
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,260
um from it from a different angle with a
 

477
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,670
um from it from a different angle with a
cellular automata stuff but um so

478
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:52,680
cellular automata stuff but um so
 

479
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,250
cellular automata stuff but um so

so there's a lot of folks who have kind
of written and talked about this is you

of written and talked about this is you
 

633
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,090
of written and talked about this is you
know the Drake equation which is like

you know the multiplying all the
 

637
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,810
you know the multiplying all the

more sophisticated takes like the uh the
 

641
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,610
more sophisticated takes like the uh the
Dark Forest you know which says that if

642
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:31,620
Dark Forest you know which says that if
 

643
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,470
Dark Forest you know which says that if
the universe is like a dark Forest where

644
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,480
the universe is like a dark Forest where
 

645
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,210
the universe is like a dark Forest where
the dumb ones that aren't hiding our

646
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,220
the dumb ones that aren't hiding our
 

647
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,650
the dumb ones that aren't hiding our
presence

648
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:36,660
presence
 

649
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,269
presence
um there's one calculation I saw and I

650
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:38,279
um there's one calculation I saw and I
 

651
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,650
um there's one calculation I saw and I
haven't reproduced myself but basically

652
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:39,660
haven't reproduced myself but basically
 

653
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,530
haven't reproduced myself but basically
says that the uh the assumption that

654
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:42,540
says that the uh the assumption that
 

655
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,030
says that the uh the assumption that
other civilizations have seen hours is

656
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,040
other civilizations have seen hours is
 

657
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,769
other civilizations have seen hours is
wrong because when you have like a

658
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:45,779
wrong because when you have like a
 

659
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,930
wrong because when you have like a
spherical radius for like the you know

660
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:47,940
spherical radius for like the you know
 

661
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,490
spherical radius for like the you know
electronic magnetic radiation that's

662
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:49,500
electronic magnetic radiation that's
 

663
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,350
electronic magnetic radiation that's
leaving our planet as that sphere gets

664
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
leaving our planet as that sphere gets
 

665
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,329
leaving our planet as that sphere gets
larger and larger it gets like smaller

666
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:53,339
larger and larger it gets like smaller
 

667
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,269
larger and larger it gets like smaller
and smaller amounts of energy so you

668
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:56,279
and smaller amounts of energy so you
 

669
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,710
and smaller amounts of energy so you
know you get farther out you're not

670
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:57,720
know you get farther out you're not
 

671
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,210
know you get farther out you're not
getting enough

672
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,220
getting enough
 

673
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,430
getting enough
um you know uh you know photons or or

674
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
um you know uh you know photons or or
 

675
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,910
um you know uh you know photons or or
would have you to actually uh detect it

676
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:04,920
would have you to actually uh detect it
 

677
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,050
would have you to actually uh detect it
um I you know I don't know I actually

678
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,060
um I you know I don't know I actually
 

679
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,250
um I you know I don't know I actually
haven't looked into the math behind it

680
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:07,260
haven't looked into the math behind it
 

681
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,389
haven't looked into the math behind it
but I remember remember seeing that

682
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
but I remember remember seeing that
 

683
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,610
but I remember remember seeing that
argument so actually it is possible that

684
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:10,620
argument so actually it is possible that
 

685
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,590
argument so actually it is possible that
it's so diffuse when you go past a

686
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:12,600
it's so diffuse when you go past a
 

687
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,030
it's so diffuse when you go past a
certain you know number of light years

688
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,040
certain you know number of light years
 

689
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,310
certain you know number of light years
out that people you know that alien

690
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
out that people you know that alien
 

691
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,389
out that people you know that alien
civilization wouldn't be able to detect

692
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:17,399
civilization wouldn't be able to detect
 

693
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,410
civilization wouldn't be able to detect
it right that's the that's another

694
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:18,420
it right that's the that's another
 

695
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,610
it right that's the that's another
argument that's more basically about

696
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:19,620
argument that's more basically about
 

697
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,790
argument that's more basically about
signals from them from us yeah to be

698
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
signals from them from us yeah to be
 

699
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,810
signals from them from us yeah to be
able to signals colliding enough to uh

700
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:26,820
able to signals colliding enough to uh
 

701
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,310
able to signals colliding enough to uh
find the signal from the noise right

702
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
find the signal from the noise right
 

703
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,710
find the signal from the noise right
exactly intelligent signal yeah Hanson

704
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
exactly intelligent signal yeah Hanson
 

705
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,170
exactly intelligent signal yeah Hanson
noise Hanson has a article called grabby

706
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:33,180
noise Hanson has a article called grabby
 

707
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,370

aliens

708
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:34,380
aliens
 

709
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,530
aliens
um have you seen his thing yes right and

710
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:36,540
um have you seen his thing yes right and
 

711
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,389
um have you seen his thing yes right and
so there's been on this podcast oh great

712
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
so there's been on this podcast oh great
 

713
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,090
so there's been on this podcast oh great
he's brilliant I'd like him he he pushes

714
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,100
he's brilliant I'd like him he he pushes
 

715
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,829

you know boundaries in interesting ways

716
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:42,839
you know boundaries in interesting ways
 

717
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,810
you know boundaries in interesting ways
in every ways in all of the ways in all

718
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:44,820
in every ways in all of the ways in all
 

719
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,730
in every ways in all of the ways in all
the ways that's right I I like morale

720
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:46,740
the ways that's right I I like morale
 

721
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,889
the ways that's right I I like morale
he's he's you know he he's NASA team

722
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:48,899
he's he's you know he he's NASA team
 

723
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,069
he's he's you know he he's NASA team
Andy gravity aliens so he has he has

724
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
Andy gravity aliens so he has he has
 

725
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,769
Andy gravity aliens so he has he has
this interesting idea that uh the

726
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:54,779
this interesting idea that uh the
 

727
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,090
this interesting idea that uh the
civilizations

728
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,100
civilizations
 

729
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,790
civilizations
uh quickly learn how to travel close to

730
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
uh quickly learn how to travel close to
 

731
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,350
uh quickly learn how to travel close to
the speed of light right so we're not

732
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,360
the speed of light right so we're not
 

733
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,230
the speed of light right so we're not
going to see them until they're here

734
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,240
going to see them until they're here
 

735
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,449
going to see them until they're here
yeah that's possible I mean one of the

736
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:05,459
yeah that's possible I mean one of the
 

737
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:06,829
yeah that's possible I mean one of the
things is so here's for example a

738
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:06,839
things is so here's for example a
 

739
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,629
things is so here's for example a
mystery that we haven't yet Done Right

740
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
mystery that we haven't yet Done Right
 

741
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,370
mystery that we haven't yet Done Right
which or we haven't really figured out

742
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:10,380
which or we haven't really figured out
 

743
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,930
which or we haven't really figured out
yet which is

744
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:11,940
yet which is
 

745
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,590
yet which is
um

746
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:12,600
um
 

747
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,750
um
a biogenesis in the lab

748
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:14,760
a biogenesis in the lab
 

749
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,150
a biogenesis in the lab
right we've done lots of things where

750
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,160
right we've done lots of things where
 

751
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,090
right we've done lots of things where
you've got you can show macromolecules

752
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,100
you've got you can show macromolecules
 

753
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,550
you've got you can show macromolecules
binding to each other you can show you

754
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
binding to each other you can show you
 

755
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,050
binding to each other you can show you
know evidence for the so-called RNA

756
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,060
know evidence for the so-called RNA
 

757
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,350

world abiogenesis is to go from you know

758
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
world abiogenesis is to go from you know
 

759
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,170
world abiogenesis is to go from you know
like non-life to life right in the lab

760
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,180
like non-life to life right in the lab
 

761
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,389
like non-life to life right in the lab
you can show microevolution obviously

762
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
you can show microevolution obviously
 

763
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,069
you can show microevolution obviously
with bacteria you can do artificial

764
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
with bacteria you can do artificial
 

765
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,470
with bacteria you can do artificial
selection on them lots of other aspects

766
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
selection on them lots of other aspects
 

767
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,790

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:37,800
of
 

769
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,410
of
um you know fundamental you know

770
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:39,420
um you know fundamental you know
 

771
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,090
um you know fundamental you know
biochemistry origins of Life stuff have

772
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,100
biochemistry origins of Life stuff have
 

773
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,290
biochemistry origins of Life stuff have
been established there's a lot of

774
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,300
been established there's a lot of
 

775
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,030
been established there's a lot of
plausibility arguments about the

776
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,040
plausibility arguments about the
 

777
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,430
plausibility arguments about the
Primitive environment and nitrogens and

778
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:46,440
Primitive environment and nitrogens and

carbons snapping together to get you

780
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,360
carbons snapping together to get you
 

781
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,329
carbons snapping together to get you
know the you know the RNA world is the

782
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:50,339
know the you know the RNA world is the
 

783
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,430
know the you know the RNA world is the
the initial hypothesis but to my

784
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:52,440
the initial hypothesis but to my
 

785
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,509
the initial hypothesis but to my
knowledge at least we haven't actually

786
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
knowledge at least we haven't actually
 

787
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,150
knowledge at least we haven't actually
seen abiogenesis demonstrated now one

788
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
seen abiogenesis demonstrated now one
 

789
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,949
seen abiogenesis demonstrated now one
argument is you need just like this

790
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:57,959
argument is you need just like this
 

791
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,069
argument is you need just like this
massive world with uh you know so many

792
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:01,079
massive world with uh you know so many
 

793
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,569
massive world with uh you know so many
different reps before that actually

794
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:02,579
different reps before that actually
 

795
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,610
different reps before that actually
happens and

796
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:04,620
happens and
 

797
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,329
happens and
um one possibility is if we could do

798
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:07,339
um one possibility is if we could do
 

799
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,730
um one possibility is if we could do
atomic level you know simulations of

800
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:10,740
atomic level you know simulations of
 

801
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,350
atomic level you know simulations of
molecules bouncing each other it's

802
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,360
molecules bouncing each other it's
 

803
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,730
molecules bouncing each other it's
possible that in some simulation we

804
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:13,740
possible that in some simulation we
 

805
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,410
possible that in some simulation we
could find a path a represent path to

806
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:15,420
could find a path a represent path to
 

807
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,569
could find a path a represent path to
abiogenesis and then just you know

808
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:17,579
abiogenesis and then just you know
 

809
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,030
abiogenesis and then just you know
replicate that in the lab right

810
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,040
replicate that in the lab right
 

811
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,850
replicate that in the lab right
um I I don't know okay uh but that seems

812
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:22,860
um I I don't know okay uh but that seems
 

813
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,009
um I I don't know okay uh but that seems
to me to be like a mystery that we still

814
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:25,019
to me to be like a mystery that we still
 

815
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,329
to me to be like a mystery that we still
don't fully understand like an example

816
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:26,339
don't fully understand like an example
 

817
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,889
don't fully understand like an example
of the prime number maze right one of

818
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:27,899
of the prime number maze right one of
 

819
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,629
of the prime number maze right one of
the most fascinating Mysteries one of

820
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:29,639
the most fascinating Mysteries one of
 

821
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,370
the most fascinating Mysteries one of
the most important yeah yeah and and

822
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:31,380
the most important yeah yeah and and
 

823
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,170
the most important yeah yeah and and
again there may be some biochemists

824
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:33,180
again there may be some biochemists
 

825
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,850
again there may be some biochemists
who's like oh about you you didn't know

826
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:34,860
who's like oh about you you didn't know
 

827
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,350
who's like oh about you you didn't know
about X Y and Z that happened in the day

828
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,360
about X Y and Z that happened in the day
 

829
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,810
about X Y and Z that happened in the day
by agencies field I I freely confess I'm

830
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:38,820
by agencies field I I freely confess I'm
 

831
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,449
by agencies field I I freely confess I'm
not like at you know oh current on it

832
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:41,459
not like at you know oh current on it
 

833
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,129
not like at you know oh current on it
the last thing I remember looking at it

834
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:43,139
the last thing I remember looking at it
 

835
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,050
the last thing I remember looking at it
is still Quran to mean like up to the

836
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,060
is still Quran to mean like up to the
 

837
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,449
is still Quran to mean like up to the
moment oh nice that's a nice word that's

838
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:47,459
moment oh nice that's a nice word that's
 

839
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,009
moment oh nice that's a nice word that's
a current yeah I'm probably

840
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:49,019
a current yeah I'm probably
 

841
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,710
a current yeah I'm probably
mispronouncing it but yeah um we'll edit

842
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:51,720
mispronouncing it but yeah um we'll edit
 

843
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,050
mispronouncing it but yeah um we'll edit
it in post so sure correctly with AI

844
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,060
it in post so sure correctly with AI
 

845
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,350
it in post so sure correctly with AI
yeah yeah it will copy your voice and it

846
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
yeah yeah it will copy your voice and it
 

847
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,910
yeah yeah it will copy your voice and it
will pronounce it perfectly correctly

848
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:58,920
will pronounce it perfectly correctly
 

849
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,069
will pronounce it perfectly correctly
yeah in post one thing that I do think

850
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:01,079
yeah in post one thing that I do think
 

851
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,189
yeah in post one thing that I do think
was interesting is uh Craig Venter a

852
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:04,199
was interesting is uh Craig Venter a
 

853
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,590
was interesting is uh Craig Venter a
while back tried to make a minimum

854
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:06,600
while back tried to make a minimum
 

855
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,449
while back tried to make a minimum
viable sell

856
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:08,459
viable sell
 

857
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,430
viable sell
um where he just tried to delete all of

858
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:10,440
um where he just tried to delete all of
 

859
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,290
um where he just tried to delete all of
the genes that were that were not

860
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:12,300
the genes that were that were not
 

861
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,449
the genes that were that were not
considered essential and so it's like a

862
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:14,459
considered essential and so it's like a
 

863
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:15,889
considered essential and so it's like a
new life form and this was like almost

864
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:15,899
new life form and this was like almost
 

865
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,810
new life form and this was like almost
20 years ago and so on and that thing

866
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:17,820
20 years ago and so on and that thing
 

867
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,090
20 years ago and so on and that thing
was it was was viable in the lab right

868
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:20,100
was it was was viable in the lab right
 

869
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,370
was it was was viable in the lab right
and so it's possible that you could you

870
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:22,380
and so it's possible that you could you
 

871
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,050
and so it's possible that you could you
kind of reverse engineer so you're

872
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,060
kind of reverse engineer so you're
 

873
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,949
kind of reverse engineer so you're
coming at the problem from different

874
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
coming at the problem from different
 

875
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,750
coming at the problem from different
directions like RNA molecules can do

876
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:26,760
directions like RNA molecules can do
 

877
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,509
directions like RNA molecules can do
quite a lot you've got some you know

878
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
quite a lot you've got some you know
 

879
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,250
quite a lot you've got some you know
reasonable assumptions as to how that

880
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:31,260
reasonable assumptions as to how that
 

881
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,009
reasonable assumptions as to how that
could come together uh you've got like

882
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:34,019
could come together uh you've got like
 

883
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,629
could come together uh you've got like
sort of stripped down minimum viable

884
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:35,639
sort of stripped down minimum viable
 

885
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,090
sort of stripped down minimum viable
life forms and so there's it's not there

886
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,100
life forms and so there's it's not there
 

887
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,230
life forms and so there's it's not there
isn't stuff here you can see

888
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,240
isn't stuff here you can see
 

889
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,610
isn't stuff here you can see
microevolution you can see at the

890
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:40,620
microevolution you can see at the
 

891
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,050
microevolution you can see at the
sequence level you know if you do

892
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,060
sequence level you know if you do
 

893
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,189
sequence level you know if you do
molecular phylogenics you can actually

894
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
molecular phylogenics you can actually
 

895
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,990
molecular phylogenics you can actually
track back the bases there's actually so

896
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,000
track back the bases there's actually so
 

897
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,189
track back the bases there's actually so
it's not like there's no evidence here

898
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:46,199
it's not like there's no evidence here
 

899
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,810
it's not like there's no evidence here
there's a lot of tools to work with but

900
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:47,820
there's a lot of tools to work with but
 

901
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,370
there's a lot of tools to work with but
this in my view is a fascinating area

902
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,380
this in my view is a fascinating area
 

903
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,530
this in my view is a fascinating area
and actually also relevant to AI because

904
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:51,540
and actually also relevant to AI because
 

905
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,870
and actually also relevant to AI because
another form of abiogenesis would be if

906
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:53,880
another form of abiogenesis would be if
 

907
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,670
another form of abiogenesis would be if
we were able to give rise to a different

908
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
we were able to give rise to a different
 

909
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,949
we were able to give rise to a different
branch of life form the Silicon based as

910
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:57,959
branch of life form the Silicon based as
 

911
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,269
branch of life form the Silicon based as
opposed to carbon based you know to

912
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
opposed to carbon based you know to
 

913
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,650
opposed to carbon based you know to
stretch a point

914
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:00,660
stretch a point
 

915
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,790
stretch a point
um you give rise to something that

916
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:01,800
um you give rise to something that
 

917
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,889
um you give rise to something that
actually does meet the definition of

918
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:03,899
actually does meet the definition of
 

919
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,230
actually does meet the definition of
life for some definition of Life what do

920
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
life for some definition of Life what do
 

921
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,090
life for some definition of Life what do
you think that definition is for an

922
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,100
you think that definition is for an
 

923
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,769
you think that definition is for an
artificial life form because you

924
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:09,779
artificial life form because you
 

925
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,170
artificial life form because you
mentioned Consciousness yeah when will

926
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,180
mentioned Consciousness yeah when will
 

927
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,030
mentioned Consciousness yeah when will
it give us pause that we created

928
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,040
it give us pause that we created
 

929
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,930
it give us pause that we created
something

930
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:14,940
something

that feels

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:19,260
that feels
 

935
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,189
that feels
by some definition or by some

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:27,480
mathematical definition that it is alive
 

941
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,530
mathematical definition that it is alive
right and we wouldn't want to kill it so

942
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:30,540
right and we wouldn't want to kill it so
 

943
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,870
right and we wouldn't want to kill it so
a couple of remarks on that one is

944
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
a couple of remarks on that one is
 

945
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,210
a couple of remarks on that one is
um Francis Crick of of Watson and Crick

946
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,220
um Francis Crick of of Watson and Crick
 

947
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,790
um Francis Crick of of Watson and Crick
uh before he died I think his last paper

948
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:37,800
uh before he died I think his last paper
 

949
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,230
uh before he died I think his last paper
was published on something called the

950
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,240
was published on something called the
 

951
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,930
was published on something called the
claustrum okay and the thing is that you

952
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:41,940
claustrum okay and the thing is that you
 

953
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,910
claustrum okay and the thing is that you
know sometimes in biology or in any you

954
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
know sometimes in biology or in any you
 

955
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,290
know sometimes in biology or in any you
know domain people are sort of

956
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,300
know domain people are sort of
 

957
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,329
know domain people are sort of
discouraged from going after the big the

958
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:47,339
discouraged from going after the big the
 

959
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,310
discouraged from going after the big the
big questions right but he proposed the

960
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:49,320
big questions right but he proposed the
 

961
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,069
big questions right but he proposed the
claustrum is actually the organ that is

962
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
claustrum is actually the organ that is
 

963
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,870
claustrum is actually the organ that is
the seat of Consciousness it's like this

964
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:53,880
the seat of Consciousness it's like this
 

965
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,949
the seat of Consciousness it's like this
sheath that like covers the brain and uh

966
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:57,959
sheath that like covers the brain and uh
 

967
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,470
sheath that like covers the brain and uh
for mice if you and again and maybe

968
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
for mice if you and again and maybe

recollecting this wrong so but you can

970
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,040
recollecting this wrong so but you can
 

971
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,010
recollecting this wrong so but you can
look at it my recollection is

972
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,020
look at it my recollection is
 

973
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,130
look at it my recollection is
um in mice if you disrupt this the mouse

974
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,140
um in mice if you disrupt this the mouse
 

975
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,230
um in mice if you disrupt this the mouse
is like very disoriented right it's like

976
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,240
is like very disoriented right it's like
 

977
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,449
is like very disoriented right it's like
it's the kind of thing which you know

978
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:11,459
it's the kind of thing which you know
 

979
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,370
it's the kind of thing which you know
Watson Creek we're all about structure

980
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:13,380
Watson Creek we're all about structure
 

981
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,110
Watson Creek we're all about structure
implies function right they found the

982
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
implies function right they found the
 

983
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,150
implies function right they found the
structure of DNA this amazing thing and

984
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,160
structure of DNA this amazing thing and
 

985
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,590
structure of DNA this amazing thing and
you know they were marked in this very

986
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:18,600
you know they were marked in this very
 

987
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,390
you know they were marked in this very
under understated way at the end of the

under understated way at the end of the
 

989
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,030
under understated way at the end of the
paper that well obviously the this uh

990
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,040
paper that well obviously the this uh
 

991
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,710
paper that well obviously the this uh
gives a basis for how the genetic

992
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
gives a basis for how the genetic
 

993
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,030
gives a basis for how the genetic
material might be replicated and error

994
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,040
material might be replicated and error
 

995
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,429

corrected because you know Helix unwinds

996
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:28,439
corrected because you know Helix unwinds
 

997
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,990
corrected because you know Helix unwinds
and you got Pace right so he was a big

998
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
and you got Pace right so he was a big
 

999
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,730
and you got Pace right so he was a big
structure function person and that

1000
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:31,740
structure function person and that
 

1001
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,930
structure function person and that
applies not just at the protein level

1002
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:32,940
applies not just at the protein level
 

1003
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,450
applies not just at the protein level
not just at the level of DNA but

1004
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:35,460
not just at the level of DNA but
 

1005
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,430
not just at the level of DNA but
potentially also at the level of organs

1006
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
potentially also at the level of organs
 

1007
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,230
potentially also at the level of organs
like the colostrum is kind of this

1008
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,240
like the colostrum is kind of this
 

1009
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,029
like the colostrum is kind of this
system integrated level right it's like

1010
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
system integrated level right it's like
 

1011
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,770
system integrated level right it's like
the the last layer in the neural network

1012
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:42,780
the the last layer in the neural network
 

1013
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,330
the the last layer in the neural network
or something you know

1014
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:44,340
or something you know
 

1015
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,970
or something you know
um and uh and so that's that's the kind

1016
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:46,980
um and uh and so that's that's the kind
 

1017
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,430
um and uh and so that's that's the kind
of thing that I think is worth studying

1018
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
of thing that I think is worth studying
 

1019
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,390
of thing that I think is worth studying
um

1020
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
um
 

1021
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,669
um
so Consciousness is another kind of big

1022
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:52,679
so Consciousness is another kind of big
 

1023
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,470
so Consciousness is another kind of big
abiogenesis a big question the prime

1024
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
abiogenesis a big question the prime
 

1025
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,970
abiogenesis a big question the prime
number is consciousness is a big

1026
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:55,980
number is consciousness is a big
 

1027
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,470
number is consciousness is a big
question

1028
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:57,480
question
 

1029
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,230
question
um and uh you know then definition of

1030
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
um and uh you know then definition of
 

1031
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,630
um and uh you know then definition of
life right uh there's folks gosh there's

1032
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
life right uh there's folks gosh there's
 

1033
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,330
life right uh there's folks gosh there's
I think so this one is something I'd

1034
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:05,340
I think so this one is something I'd
 

1035
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,650
I think so this one is something I'd
have to Google around but there was a

1036
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:06,660
have to Google around but there was a
 

1037
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,330
have to Google around but there was a
guy I think at Santa Fe Institute or

1038
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:08,340
guy I think at Santa Fe Institute or
 

1039
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,830
guy I think at Santa Fe Institute or
something who had some definition of

1040
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
something who had some definition of
 

1041
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,570
something who had some definition of
life and like some thermodynamic

1042
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:11,580
life and like some thermodynamic
 

1043
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,010
life and like some thermodynamic
definition

1044
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,020
definition
 

1045
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,810
definition
um but you're right that it's going to

1046
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:14,820
um but you're right that it's going to
 

1047
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,169
um but you're right that it's going to
be a multi-feature definition we might

1048
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:18,179
be a multi-feature definition we might
 

1049
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,430
be a multi-feature definition we might
have a Turing test like definition

1050
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:19,440
have a Turing test like definition
 

1051
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,890
have a Turing test like definition
frankly which is just if enough humans

1052
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:21,900
frankly which is just if enough humans
 

1053
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,350
frankly which is just if enough humans
agree it's alive it's alive right and

1054
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:24,360
agree it's alive it's alive right and
 

1055
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,730
agree it's alive it's alive right and
that might frankly be the operational

1056
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:25,740
that might frankly be the operational
 

1057
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,950
that might frankly be the operational
definition because you know viruses are

1058
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:27,960
definition because you know viruses are
 

1059
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,330

like this boundary case you know are

1060
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:29,340
like this boundary case you know are
 

1061
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,590
like this boundary case you know are
they are they alive or not most people

1062
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:30,600
they are they alive or not most people
 

1063
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,210
they are they alive or not most people
don't think they're alive but they're

1064
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:32,220
don't think they're alive but they're
 

1065
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,070
don't think they're alive but they're
they're they're on they're kind of

they're they're on they're kind of
 

1067
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,930
they're they're on they're kind of
they're more alive than a rock in a

they're more alive than a rock in a
 

1069
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,490
they're more alive than a rock in a
sense well I think uh

1070
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:37,500

so chat Bots

1084
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:52,679
so chat Bots
 

1085
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,190
so chat Bots
essentially creatures whether they're

I think there's going to be chat Bots
that we would ethically be troubled by

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:08,520
that we would ethically be troubled by

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,470
if we wanted to kill them
they would have the capacity to suffer

1100
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
they would have the capacity to suffer
 

1101
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,830
they would have the capacity to suffer
they would be very unhappy with you

1102
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,840
they would be very unhappy with you
 

1103
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,950
they would be very unhappy with you
trying to turn them off and then there

1104
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
trying to turn them off and then there
 

1105
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,409
trying to turn them off and then there
will be large groups of activists that

1106
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:21,419
will be large groups of activists that
 

1107
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,450
will be large groups of activists that
will protest and they'll go to the

1108
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:23,460
will protest and they'll go to the

humans do you think that's possible I

1118
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:37,380
humans do you think that's possible I
 

1119
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,470
humans do you think that's possible I
saw that Google engineer who's basically

1120
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:39,480
saw that Google engineer who's basically
 

1121
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,490
saw that Google engineer who's basically
saying this had already happened and I I

I was surprised by it uh because it just

00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:46,440
I was surprised by it uh because it just
 

1125
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,230
I was surprised by it uh because it just
I when I looked at the chat logs of it

1126
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
I when I looked at the chat logs of it
 

1127
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,630
I when I looked at the chat logs of it
it didn't seem particularly interesting

1128
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
it didn't seem particularly interesting
 

1129
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,450
it didn't seem particularly interesting
on their hand I can definitely see I

1130
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:53,460
on their hand I can definitely see I
 

1131
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,270
on their hand I can definitely see I

step-ups are possible and obviously you

1136
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
step-ups are possible and obviously you
 

1137
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,690
step-ups are possible and obviously you
know you've talked about AI on your

1138
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:02,700
know you've talked about AI on your
 

1139
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,010
know you've talked about AI on your
podcast a ton

1140
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,020
podcast a ton
 

1141
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,909
podcast a ton
um

1142
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:04,919
um
 

1143
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,850
um
is it possible that gpt9 or something is

1144
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:07,860
is it possible that gpt9 or something is
 

1145
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,270
is it possible that gpt9 or something is
is kind of like that or GPT 15 or gpt4

1146
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
is kind of like that or GPT 15 or gpt4
 

1147
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,810
is kind of like that or GPT 15 or gpt4
maybe

1148
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:13,820
maybe
 

1149
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,549
maybe
but yeah for people just listening

1150
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
but yeah for people just listening
 

1151
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,830
but yeah for people just listening
there's a deep skepticism in your face

1152
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
there's a deep skepticism in your face
 

1153
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,930
there's a deep skepticism in your face
yeah you know the reason being because

1154
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:23,940

 

1155
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,490

um you know what's possible it's

1156
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:25,500
um you know what's possible it's
 

1157
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,470
um you know what's possible it's
possible that you have like a partition

1158
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:27,480
possible that you have like a partition
 

1159
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,750
possible that you have like a partition
of society on literally this basis you

1160
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
of society on literally this basis you
 

1161
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,770
of society on literally this basis you
know

1162
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:30,780
know
 

1163
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,210
know
um that's one model where there's some

1164
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,220
um that's one model where there's some
 

1165
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,950
um that's one model where there's some
people just like there's vegetarians and

1166
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:33,960
people just like there's vegetarians and
 

1167
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,250
people just like there's vegetarians and
non-vegetarians right there may be

1168
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,260
non-vegetarians right there may be
 

1169
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,810
non-vegetarians right there may be
um

1170
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:38,820
um
 

1171
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,330
um
machines have life and machines are

1172
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:41,340
machines have life and machines are
 

1173
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,150
machines have life and machines are
machines you know like or something like

1174
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,160
machines you know like or something like
 

1175
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,970
machines you know like or something like
that right uh you know you could you

1176
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:46,980
that right uh you know you could you
 

1177
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,470
that right uh you know you could you
could definitely imagine some kind of

1178
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
could definitely imagine some kind of
 

1179
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,150
could definitely imagine some kind of
partition like that in the future where

1180
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,160
partition like that in the future where
 

1181
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,029
partition like that in the future where
your fundamental political social system

1182
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
your fundamental political social system
 

1183
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,049
your fundamental political social system
that's a foundational assumption and you

1184
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:57,059
that's a foundational assumption and you
 

1185
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:57,890
that's a foundational assumption and you
know

1186
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:57,900
know
 

1187
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,190
know
is AI does it you know deserve the same

1188
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200
is AI does it you know deserve the same
 

1189
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,169
is AI does it you know deserve the same
rights as like a human or for example a

1190
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:03,179
rights as like a human or for example a
 

1191
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,930
rights as like a human or for example a
corporation is an intermediate uh do you

1192
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:05,940
corporation is an intermediate uh do you
 

1193
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,750
corporation is an intermediate uh do you
see the thing which is how human is are

1194
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:08,760
see the thing which is how human is are
 

1195
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,890
see the thing which is how human is are
different corporations have you seen

1196
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:09,900
different corporations have you seen
 

1197
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,049
different corporations have you seen
that infographic it's actually funny so

1198
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:12,059
that infographic it's actually funny so
 

1199
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,850
that infographic it's actually funny so
it's a spectrum there's a spectrum so

1200
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:13,860
it's a spectrum there's a spectrum so
 

1201
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,590
it's a spectrum there's a spectrum so
for example Disney is considered about

1202
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
for example Disney is considered about
 

1203
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,950
for example Disney is considered about
as human as like a dog but like Exxon I

1204
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
as human as like a dog but like Exxon I
 

1205
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,970
as human as like a dog but like Exxon I
may be remembering this wrong but they

1206
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:19,980
may be remembering this wrong but they
 

1207
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,529
may be remembering this wrong but they
had like a level with like human at one

1208
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:21,539
had like a level with like human at one
 

1209
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:22,789
had like a level with like human at one
end and like rock at the other does it

1210
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799
end and like rock at the other does it
 

1211
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,230

have to do with corporate structure what

1212
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
have to do with corporate structure what
 

1213
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,970
have to do with corporate structure what
what I think it's about people's empathy

1214
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:25,980
what I think it's about people's empathy
 

1215
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,169
what I think it's about people's empathy
for that Corporation their brand

1216
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:27,179
for that Corporation their brand
 

1217
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,870
for that Corporation their brand
identity but it's interesting to see

1218
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:29,880
identity but it's interesting to see
 

1219
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,450
identity but it's interesting to see
that first of all people sort of do

1220
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:32,460
that first of all people sort of do
 

1221
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,390
that first of all people sort of do
think of Corporations as being more or

1222
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:35,400
think of Corporations as being more or
 

1223
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,070
think of Corporations as being more or
like The Branding is really what they're

1224
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,080
like The Branding is really what they're
 

1225
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,210
like The Branding is really what they're
responding well that's what I mean

1226
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:38,220
responding well that's what I mean
 

1227
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,730
responding well that's what I mean
they're also responding you know I have

1228
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:40,740
they're also responding you know I have
 

1229
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,310
they're also responding you know I have
a brand of human that I'm trying to sell

1230
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,320
a brand of human that I'm trying to sell
 

1231
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,649
a brand of human that I'm trying to sell
and it seems to be effective for the

1232
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:45,659
and it seems to be effective for the
 

1233
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,169
and it seems to be effective for the
most part sure although it has become

1234
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:48,179
most part sure although it has become
 

1235
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,909
most part sure although it has become
like a running joke that I might be a

1236
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
like a running joke that I might be a
 

1237
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,370
like a running joke that I might be a
robot right which means there's the

1238
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:52,380
robot right which means there's the
 

1239
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,850
robot right which means there's the
brand is cracking because it's seeping

1240
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:55,860
brand is cracking because it's seeping
 

1241
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,850
brand is cracking because it's seeping
through but I mean in that sense I just

1242
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:58,860
through but I mean in that sense I just
 

1243
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,409
through but I mean in that sense I just
I think I don't see a reason why chat

1244
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:03,419
I think I don't see a reason why chat
 

1245
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,370
I think I don't see a reason why chat
Bots

1246
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:04,380
Bots
 

1247
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,909
Bots
can't manufacture the brand of Being

1248
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
can't manufacture the brand of Being
 

1249
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,610
can't manufacture the brand of Being
Human of being sentient I mean that is

1250
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:10,620
Human of being sentient I mean that is
 

1251
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,930
Human of being sentient I mean that is
the Turing test but it's like the

1252
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:11,940
the Turing test but it's like the
 

1253
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,190
the Turing test but it's like the
multiplayer touring test now that

1254
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
multiplayer touring test now that
 

1255
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,570
multiplayer touring test now that
actually a fair number of chat Bots have

1256
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:14,580
actually a fair number of chat Bots have
 

1257
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,669
actually a fair number of chat Bots have
passed a Turing test I'd say there's at

1258
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:16,679
passed a Turing test I'd say there's at
 

1259
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,970
passed a Turing test I'd say there's at
least two steps up right one is

1260
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:19,980
least two steps up right one is
 

1261
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,669
least two steps up right one is
um a multiplayer touring test where you

1262
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:22,679
um a multiplayer touring test where you
 

1263
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,830
um a multiplayer touring test where you
have chatbots talking to each other

1264
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
have chatbots talking to each other
 

1265
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,830
have chatbots talking to each other
and then you ask can you determine the

1266
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
and then you ask can you determine the
 

1267
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,230
and then you ask can you determine the
difference between in chat Bots talking

1268
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
difference between in chat Bots talking
 

1269
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,210
difference between in chat Bots talking
to each other and clicking buttons and

1270
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:32,220
to each other and clicking buttons and
 

1271
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,310
to each other and clicking buttons and
stuff in apps and and humans doing that

1272
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
stuff in apps and and humans doing that
 

1273

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,710
how far we are in terms of time but
we're still far off in terms of

data considered a challenge problem is
 

1377
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,950
data considered a challenge problem is
to go from the Turing test to a genuine

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:30,780
and make money for you if you can do
 

1383
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,850
and make money for you if you can do
that that's a big deal people obviously

1384
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:31,860
that that's a big deal people obviously
 

1385
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,409
that that's a big deal people obviously
have trading Bots and stuff but that

1386
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:33,419
have trading Bots and stuff but that
 

1387
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:34,669
have trading Bots and stuff but that
would be you know the next level is

1388
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:34,679
would be you know the next level is
 

1389
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:35,810
would be you know the next level is
typing out emails it's creating

1390
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:35,820
typing out emails it's creating
 

1391
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,549
typing out emails it's creating
documents it's actually mimic human

1392
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:37,559
documents it's actually mimic human
 

1393
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,649
documents it's actually mimic human
behavior in its entirety yeah that's

1394
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:39,659
behavior in its entirety yeah that's
 

1395
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,450
behavior in its entirety yeah that's
right and it can it'll schedule zooms

1396
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:41,460
right and it can it'll schedule zooms
 

1397
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,850
right and it can it'll schedule zooms
it'll send emails it'll essentially

1398
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:43,860
it'll send emails it'll essentially
 

1399
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,830
it'll send emails it'll essentially
because if you think about it a human is

1400
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
because if you think about it a human is
 

1401
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,029
because if you think about it a human is
hitting the keys and clicking the mouse

1402
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
hitting the keys and clicking the mouse
 

1403
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,190
hitting the keys and clicking the mouse
but just like a self-driving car the

1404
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
but just like a self-driving car the
 

1405
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,250
but just like a self-driving car the
wheel rotates by itself right those keys

1406
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:52,260
wheel rotates by itself right those keys
 

1407
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,049
wheel rotates by itself right those keys
are effectively just it's like uh like

1408
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:54,059
are effectively just it's like uh like
 

1409
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,409
are effectively just it's like uh like
the odd automator app in in apple right

1410
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:57,419
the odd automator app in in apple right
 

1411
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,909
the odd automator app in in apple right
um everything's just moving on the

1412
00:24:58,909 --> 00:24:58,919
um everything's just moving on the
 

1413
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,049
um everything's just moving on the
screen you're seeing it there and it's

1414
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:00,059
screen you're seeing it there and it's
 

1415
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,029
screen you're seeing it there and it's
just an AI it's kind of hilarious that

1416
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:02,039
just an AI it's kind of hilarious that
 

1417
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,909
just an AI it's kind of hilarious that
the I'm not a robot click thing actually

1418
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:04,919
the I'm not a robot click thing actually
 

1419
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,789
the I'm not a robot click thing actually
works because I I actually don't know

1420
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:07,799
works because I I actually don't know
 

1421
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,789
works because I I actually don't know
how that's how it works but I think it

1422
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:10,799
how that's how it works but I think it
 

1423
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,370
how that's how it works but I think it
has to do with the movement of the mouse

1424
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:13,380
has to do with the movement of the mouse
 

1425
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,850
has to do with the movement of the mouse
the timing and they know that it's very

1426
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:16,860
the timing and they know that it's very
 

1427
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,010
the timing and they know that it's very
difficult for currently for a bot to

1428
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,020
difficult for currently for a bot to
 

1429
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,510
difficult for currently for a bot to
mimic human behavior in the way they

1430
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:20,520
mimic human behavior in the way they
 

1431
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,610
mimic human behavior in the way they
would click that little checkbox yeah

1432
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:22,620
would click that little checkbox yeah
 

1433
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,950
would click that little checkbox yeah
exactly I think it's something I mean uh

1434
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
exactly I think it's something I mean uh
 

1435
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,289
exactly I think it's something I mean uh
again my recollection on that is it's

1436
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:27,299
again my recollection on that is it's
 

1437
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,970
again my recollection on that is it's
like a pile of Highly obfuscated

1438
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:28,980
like a pile of Highly obfuscated
 

1439
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,529
like a pile of Highly obfuscated
JavaScript with all kind it looks like a

1440
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:30,539
JavaScript with all kind it looks like a
 

1441
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,630
JavaScript with all kind it looks like a
very simple box but it's doing a lot of

1442
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
very simple box but it's doing a lot of
 

1443
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,830
very simple box but it's doing a lot of
stuff and it's collecting all kinds of

1444
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
stuff and it's collecting all kinds of
 

1445
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,769
stuff and it's collecting all kinds of
instrumentation and yeah exactly like a

1446
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:36,779
instrumentation and yeah exactly like a
 

1447
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,690
instrumentation and yeah exactly like a
like a robot is just a little too

1448
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:38,700
like a robot is just a little too
 

1449
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,669
like a robot is just a little too
deterministic or if it's got noise it's

1450
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:40,679
deterministic or if it's got noise it's
 

1451
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,190
deterministic or if it's got noise it's
like gaussian noise and the way humans

1452
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
like gaussian noise and the way humans
 

1453
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,470
like gaussian noise and the way humans
do it is just not something that you

1454
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:45,480
do it is just not something that you
 

1455
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,750
do it is just not something that you
need to be able to do without collecting

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,330
computer or billions interested I don't
know the computer just sees the

1466
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:56,340
know the computer just sees the

JavaScript it needs to be able to

1468
00:25:59,210 --> 00:25:59,220
JavaScript it needs to be able to
 

1469
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,669
JavaScript it needs to be able to
look outside the simulation for the

1470
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
look outside the simulation for the
 

1471
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,010
look outside the simulation for the
computer the world is like right it

1472
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,020
computer the world is like right it
 

1473
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,210
computer the world is like right it
doesn't the computer doesn't know about

1474
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:05,220
doesn't the computer doesn't know about
 

1475
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,529
doesn't the computer doesn't know about
the physical world so you have to look

1476
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:06,539
the physical world so you have to look
 

1477
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,230
the physical world so you have to look
outside of its world and introspect back

1478
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,240
outside of its world and introspect back
 

1479
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,350
outside of its world and introspect back
on this simple box right is which is

1480
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:12,360
on this simple box right is which is
 

1481
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,510
on this simple box right is which is
kind of you know I think that's exactly

1482
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:14,520
kind of you know I think that's exactly
 

1483
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,490
kind of you know I think that's exactly
what mushrooms do or like psychedelics

1484
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:16,500
what mushrooms do or like psychedelics
 

1485
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,830
what mushrooms do or like psychedelics
is you get to go outside and look back

1486
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:18,840
is you get to go outside and look back
 

1487
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,570
is you get to go outside and look back
in and that's what a computer needs to

1488
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:20,580
in and that's what a computer needs to
 

1489
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,250
in and that's what a computer needs to
do I you know I do wonder whether they

1490
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:22,260
do I you know I do wonder whether they
 

1491
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,810
do I you know I do wonder whether they
actually give people Insight or whether

1492
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:23,820
actually give people Insight or whether
 

1493
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,310
actually give people Insight or whether
they give people the illusion of insight

1494
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:25,320
they give people the illusion of insight
 

1495
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,549
they give people the illusion of insight
uh is there a difference yeah because uh

1496
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:28,559
uh is there a difference yeah because uh
 

1497
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,250
uh is there a difference yeah because uh
well actual Insight you know actual

1498
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,260
well actual Insight you know actual
 

1499
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,390
well actual Insight you know actual
Insight is

1500
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,400
Insight is
 

1501
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,970
Insight is
again Maxwell's equations you're able to

1502
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:34,980
again Maxwell's equations you're able to
 

1503
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,350
again Maxwell's equations you're able to
shift the world with that there's a lot

1504
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:36,360
shift the world with that there's a lot
 

1505
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,269
shift the world with that there's a lot
of practical devices that work the

1506
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:38,279
of practical devices that work the
 

1507
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,370
of practical devices that work the
illusion of insight is

1508
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:40,380
illusion of insight is
 

1509
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,010
illusion of insight is
I'm Jesus Christ and nothing happens

1510
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,020
I'm Jesus Christ and nothing happens
 

1511
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,710
I'm Jesus Christ and nothing happens
right so I don't know I think this is

1512
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:45,720
right so I don't know I think this is
 

1513
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,990
right so I don't know I think this is
quite different uh I don't know I I

1514
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,000
quite different uh I don't know I I
 

1515
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,610
quite different uh I don't know I I
think you can fake it till you make it

1516
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:49,620
think you can fake it till you make it
 

1517
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,649
think you can fake it till you make it
on that one which is

1518
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:51,659
on that one which is
 

1519
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,010
on that one which is
um Insight in some sense is revealing a

1520
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,020
um Insight in some sense is revealing a
 

1521
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,830
um Insight in some sense is revealing a
truth that was there all along yeah so I

1522
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:57,840
truth that was there all along yeah so I
 

1523
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,470
truth that was there all along yeah so I
mean I guess like I'm talking about

1524
00:26:59,470 --> 00:26:59,480
mean I guess like I'm talking about
 

1525
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,390
mean I guess like I'm talking about
technical Insight where you you have

1526
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
technical Insight where you you have
 

1527
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,010
technical Insight where you you have
this is the thing you know we were

1528
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:04,020
this is the thing you know we were
 

1529
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,330
this is the thing you know we were
talking about actually before the

1530
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:05,340
talking about actually before the
 

1531
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,590
talking about actually before the
podcast like technical truths versus

1532
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:06,600
podcast like technical truths versus
 

1533
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,570
podcast like technical truths versus
political truths right some truths

1534
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:08,580
political truths right some truths
 

1535
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,310
political truths right some truths
they're they're on a spectrum and

1536
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
they're they're on a spectrum and
 

1537
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,570
they're they're on a spectrum and
there's some truths that are actually

1538
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:11,580
there's some truths that are actually
 

1539
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,210
there's some truths that are actually
entirely political in the sense that if

1540
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,220
entirely political in the sense that if
 

1541
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,649
entirely political in the sense that if
you can change the software in enough

1542
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:15,659
you can change the software in enough
 

1543
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,990
you can change the software in enough
people's heads you change the the value

1544
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
people's heads you change the the value
 

1545
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,210
people's heads you change the the value
of the truth for example the location of

1546
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:20,220
of the truth for example the location of
 

1547
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,070
of the truth for example the location of
a border is effectively consensus

1548
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
a border is effectively consensus
 

1549
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,190
a border is effectively consensus
between large enough groups of people uh

1550
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
between large enough groups of people uh
 

1551
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,950
between large enough groups of people uh
who is the CEO that's you know consensus

1552
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:27,960
who is the CEO that's you know consensus
 

1553
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,049
who is the CEO that's you know consensus
among a certain group of people what is

1554
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:30,059
among a certain group of people what is
 

1555
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,669
among a certain group of people what is
the value of a currency or any stock

1556
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
the value of a currency or any stock
 

1557
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,010
the value of a currency or any stock
right that market price is just the

1558
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,020
right that market price is just the
 

1559
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,390
right that market price is just the
psychology of a bunch of people like

1560
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:35,400
psychology of a bunch of people like
 

1561
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,289
psychology of a bunch of people like
literally if you can change enough

1562
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:36,299
literally if you can change enough
 

1563
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,090
literally if you can change enough
people's minds you can change the value

1564
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:38,100
people's minds you can change the value
 

1565
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,010
people's minds you can change the value
of the Border or the position the

1566
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,020
of the Border or the position the
 

1567
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,390
of the Border or the position the
hierarchy or the value of the currency

1568
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:41,400
hierarchy or the value of the currency
 

1569
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,730
hierarchy or the value of the currency
those are purely political truths then

1570
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:43,740
those are purely political truths then
 

1571
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,110
those are purely political truths then
all the way on the other end our

1572
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
all the way on the other end our
 

1573
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,149
all the way on the other end our
technical truths that exist independent

1574
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:47,159
technical truths that exist independent
 

1575
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,549
technical truths that exist independent
of whatever any one human or All Humans

1576
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:49,559
of whatever any one human or All Humans
 

1577
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,950
of whatever any one human or All Humans
think like uh the gravitational constant

1578
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:51,960
think like uh the gravitational constant
 

1579
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,830
think like uh the gravitational constant
right or the diameter of a virus those

1580
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:54,840
right or the diameter of a virus those
 

1581
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,350
right or the diameter of a virus those
those are just those exist independent

convention we have is

1602
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:15,659
convention we have is
 

1603
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,029
convention we have is
um that if you hold this amount of

1604
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
um that if you hold this amount of
 

1605
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,070
um that if you hold this amount of
Bitcoin or that if you hold this private

1606
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,080
Bitcoin or that if you hold this private
 

1607
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,269
Bitcoin or that if you hold this private
key you hold this Bitcoin and then we

1608
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:20,279
key you hold this Bitcoin and then we
 

1609
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,529
key you hold this Bitcoin and then we
make that very hard to change because

1610
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:21,539
make that very hard to change because
 

1611
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:22,610
make that very hard to change because
you have to change a lot of technical

1612
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:22,620
you have to change a lot of technical
 

1613
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,970
you have to change a lot of technical
truths so you you can push things

1614
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:25,980
truths so you you can push things
 

1615
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,010
truths so you you can push things

did the question is how how much of our

1618
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:30,720
did the question is how how much of our
 

1619

world can we push into that right and
 

1621
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,370
world can we push into that right and
that takes us

1622
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:36,380
that takes us
 

1623
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,549
that takes us

piece of paper right I've mentioned this
 

1689
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,250
piece of paper right I've mentioned this
actually in in the network State book

1690

right for the same reason you hit plus
 

1707
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,510
right for the same reason you hit plus
and do docs.new you know like create a

1708
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520
and do docs.new you know like create a
 

1709

because you know in backspace you don't

1712
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:15,000
because you know in backspace you don't
 

1713
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,130
because you know in backspace you don't
have just like

1714
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:16,140
have just like
 

1715
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,649
have just like
128 bytes of space 120 kilobytes and

1716
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:18,659
128 bytes of space 120 kilobytes and
 

1717
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:19,850
128 bytes of space 120 kilobytes and
just have to backspace the old document

1718
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:19,860
just have to backspace the old document
 

1719
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,190
just have to backspace the old document
for creating the new one so that's a

1720
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,200
for creating the new one so that's a
 

1721
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,210
for creating the new one so that's a
fundamental thing that's wrong with

1722
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,220
fundamental thing that's wrong with
 

1723
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,190
fundamental thing that's wrong with
today's garments and it's a meta point

1724
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
today's garments and it's a meta point
 

1725
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,049
today's garments and it's a meta point
right because it's not any one specific

1726
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:27,059
right because it's not any one specific
 

1727
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,430
right because it's not any one specific
reform it's a meta reform of being able

1728
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:28,440
reform it's a meta reform of being able

to start new countries
okay so that's one problem but there you

1732
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:32,880
okay so that's one problem but there you
 

1733
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,549
okay so that's one problem but there you
know you could push back and say that's

1734
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:34,559
know you could push back and say that's
 

1735
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,310
know you could push back and say that's
that's a feature because you know a lot

1736
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,320
that's a feature because you know a lot
 

1737
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,990
that's a feature because you know a lot
of people argue that tradition is power

1738
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,000

there's this amazing YouTube video
called

1992
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:15,960
called
 

1993
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,290
called
um it's like 50 states U.S population I

1994
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:18,300
um it's like 50 states U.S population I
 

1995
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,349
um it's like 50 states U.S population I
think 1792 it says 2050s they've got a

1996
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:21,359
think 1792 it says 2050s they've got a
 

1997
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,030
think 1792 it says 2050s they've got a
simulation so you just stop it at 2019

1998
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
simulation so you just stop it at 2019
 

1999
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,490
simulation so you just stop it at 2019
or 2020. but it shows that like Virginia

2000
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:25,500
or 2020. but it shows that like Virginia
 

2001
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,829
or 2020. but it shows that like Virginia
was like number one early on and then it

2002
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:27,839
was like number one early on and then it
 

2003
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,870
was like number one early on and then it
lost ground in like New York gained and

2004

00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,680
then like Ohio was a big deal in the
 

2007

you again you have these two polls of an
app is highly Dynamic and you're you're

00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:39,480
a cost him to having updates all the
 

2189
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,790
a cost him to having updates all the
time and a book is supposed to be static

2190
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
time and a book is supposed to be static
 

2191
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,410
time and a book is supposed to be static
and there's a value in something static

2192
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:42,420
and there's a value in something static
 

2193
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,109
and there's a value in something static
something unchanged and so on but in

2194
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:45,119
something unchanged and so on but in
 

2195
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,329
something unchanged and so on but in
this case I'm glad I kind of shipped a

um you know I'm gonna split into like uh
 

2203
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,930
um you know I'm gonna split into like uh
tentatively motivation theory and

2204
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:56,940
tentatively motivation theory and
 

2205
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,150
tentatively motivation theory and
practice like motivation like what is

2206
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,160
practice like motivation like what is
 

2207
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,829
practice like motivation like what is
the sort of political philosophy and so

2208
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:00,839
the sort of political philosophy and so
 

2209
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,630
the sort of political philosophy and so
on that motivates me at least do this

2210
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:02,640
on that motivates me at least do this
 

2211
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,970
on that motivates me at least do this
which you can take or leave right and

2212
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:04,980
which you can take or leave right and
 

2213
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,670
which you can take or leave right and
then Theory as to why Network state is

2214
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:07,680
then Theory as to why Network state is
 

2215
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,650
then Theory as to why Network state is
now possible and I can Define it in a

2216
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:09,660
now possible and I can Define it in a
 

2217
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,230
now possible and I can Define it in a
second and then the practice is zillions

2218
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,240
second and then the practice is zillions
 

2219
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,730
second and then the practice is zillions
of practical details and everything from

2220
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:13,740
of practical details and everything from
 

2221
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,609
of practical details and everything from
roads diplomatic recognition and so on

2222
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:16,619
roads diplomatic recognition and so on
 

2223
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,010
roads diplomatic recognition and so on
um funding founding all that stuff a lot

2224
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:19,020
um funding founding all that stuff a lot
 

2225
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,270
um funding founding all that stuff a lot
of stuff actually I left out of V1

2226
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:20,280
of stuff actually I left out of V1
 

2227
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,430
of stuff actually I left out of V1
simply because I wanted to kind of get

2228
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:22,440
simply because I wanted to kind of get
 

2229
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,470
simply because I wanted to kind of get
the desirability of it on the table and

2230
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,480
the desirability of it on the table and
 

2231
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,630
the desirability of it on the table and
then talk about the the feasibility I

2232
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
then talk about the the feasibility I
 

2233
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,609
then talk about the the feasibility I
should actually Linger on that briefly

2234
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:28,619
should actually Linger on that briefly
 

2235
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,050
should actually Linger on that briefly
in in terms of things we can

2236
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,060
in in terms of things we can
 

2237
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,510
in in terms of things we can
revolutionize like um one of the biggest

2238
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:32,520
revolutionize like um one of the biggest
 

2239
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,150
revolutionize like um one of the biggest
Innovations I think that Tesla does

2240
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,160
Innovations I think that Tesla does
 

2241
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,310
Innovations I think that Tesla does
with the way they think about the car

2242
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:37,320
with the way they think about the car
 

2243
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,530
with the way they think about the car
with the deploy the car is not the

2244
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:39,540
with the deploy the car is not the
 

2245
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,810
with the deploy the car is not the
automation or the electric to me it's

2246
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:41,820
automation or the electric to me it's
 

2247
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,470
automation or the electric to me it's
the uh over the air updates right be

2248
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:45,480
the uh over the air updates right be
 

2249
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,109
the uh over the air updates right be
able to send

2250
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:47,119
able to send
 

2251
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,390
able to send
instantaneously uh updates to the

2252
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,400
instantaneously uh updates to the
 

2253
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,130
instantaneously uh updates to the
software that completely changes the

2254
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,140
software that completely changes the
 

2255
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,069
software that completely changes the
behavior the ux everything about the car

2256
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:55,079
behavior the ux everything about the car
 

2257
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,710
behavior the ux everything about the car
and so I do think it would be

2258
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:57,720
and so I do think it would be
 

2259
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,510
and so I do think it would be
interesting because books

2260
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
interesting because books
 

2261
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,650
interesting because books
a representation of human knowledge a um

2262
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:03,660
a representation of human knowledge a um
 

2263
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,770
a representation of human knowledge a um
a snapshot of human knowledge and it

2264
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:06,780
a snapshot of human knowledge and it
 

2265
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,530
a snapshot of human knowledge and it
would be interesting that we if we can

2266
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:09,540
would be interesting that we if we can
 

2267
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,170
would be interesting that we if we can
somehow figure out a system that allows

2268
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,180
somehow figure out a system that allows
 

2269
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,089
somehow figure out a system that allows
you to do sort of like a GitHub for

2270
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:14,099
you to do sort of like a GitHub for
 

2271
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:16,430
you to do sort of like a GitHub for
books like if I buy a book on Amazon

2272
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:16,440
books like if I buy a book on Amazon
 

2273
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,589
books like if I buy a book on Amazon
without having to pay again

2274
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:18,599
without having to pay again
 

2275
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,670
without having to pay again
can I get updates like V Point V 1.1 V

2276
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:22,680
can I get updates like V Point V 1.1 V
 

2277
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,609
can I get updates like V Point V 1.1 V
1.2 and there's like release notes right

2278
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:25,619
1.2 and there's like release notes right
 

2279
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,290
1.2 and there's like release notes right
that that would be that would be

2280
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:27,300
that that would be that would be
 

2281
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,030
that that would be that would be
incredible it's not not enough to do

2282
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
incredible it's not not enough to do
 

2283
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,829
incredible it's not not enough to do
like a second edition or a third edition

2284
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:30,839
like a second edition or a third edition
 

2285
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:34,130
like a second edition or a third edition
but like minor updates that's not just

2286
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,140
but like minor updates that's not just
 

2287
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,970
but like minor updates that's not just
on your website but actually go into the

2288
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:37,980
on your website but actually go into the
 

2289
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,849
on your website but actually go into the
the model that we use to buy books right

2290
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:40,859
the model that we use to buy books right
 

2291
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:43,310
the model that we use to buy books right
so I spent my money maybe I I'll do a

2292
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:43,320
so I spent my money maybe I I'll do a
 

2293
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,349
so I spent my money maybe I I'll do a
subscription service for five bucks a

2294
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,359
subscription service for five bucks a
 

2295
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,390
subscription service for five bucks a
month where I get regular updates to the

2296
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:47,400
month where I get regular updates to the
 

2297
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,430
month where I get regular updates to the
books and then there's an incentive for

2298
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440
books and then there's an incentive for
 

2299
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,829
books and then there's an incentive for
authors to actually update their books

2300
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:51,839
authors to actually update their books
 

2301
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,690
authors to actually update their books
such that it makes sense for the

2302
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:53,700
such that it makes sense for the
 

2303
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,730
such that it makes sense for the
subscription and that that means your

2304
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:55,740
subscription and that that means your
 

2305
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,370
subscription and that that means your
book isn't just a snapshot but it's a

2306
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:58,380
book isn't just a snapshot but it's a
 

2307
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,589
book isn't just a snapshot but it's a
lifelong project right you still care

2308
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:00,599
lifelong project right you still care
 

2309
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,930
lifelong project right you still care
enough about the book so I think there's

2310
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:02,940
enough about the book so I think there's
 

2311
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,069
enough about the book so I think there's
a lot that can mean on there because

2312
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
a lot that can mean on there because
 

2313
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,390
a lot that can mean on there because
actually in going through this process

2314
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:05,400
actually in going through this process
 

2315
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,310
actually in going through this process
in many ways the most traditional thing

2316
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:07,320
in many ways the most traditional thing
 

2317
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,130
in many ways the most traditional thing
I did was a self-published eBook on

2318
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,140
I did was a self-published eBook on
 

2319
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,950
I did was a self-published eBook on
Kindle right uh why because basically

2320
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
Kindle right uh why because basically
 

2321
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,750
Kindle right uh why because basically
like you know if you actually ink a deal

2322
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:14,760
like you know if you actually ink a deal
 

2323
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,430
like you know if you actually ink a deal
with a book publisher first they you

2324
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:16,440
with a book publisher first they you
 

2325
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,630
with a book publisher first they you
know they'll give you some advance I

2326
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:17,640
know they'll give you some advance I
 

2327
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,370
know they'll give you some advance I
didn't need the advance or anything but

2328
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:19,380
didn't need the advance or anything but
 

2329
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,589
didn't need the advance or anything but
second is all these constraints

2330
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:21,599
second is all these constraints
 

2331
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,910
second is all these constraints
um oh you know you want to translate

2332
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:22,920
um oh you know you want to translate
 

2333
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,290
um oh you know you want to translate
into this or you want to do this other

2334
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:24,300
into this or you want to do this other
 

2335
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,849
into this or you want to do this other
format or you want to update it you have

2336
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:25,859
format or you want to update it you have
 

2337
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,650
format or you want to update it you have
to go and now talk to this other party

2338
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:27,660
to go and now talk to this other party
 

2339
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,310
to go and now talk to this other party
right you know and uh also the the

2340
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:31,320
right you know and uh also the the
 

2341
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,410
right you know and uh also the the
narrowing window of what they'll

2342
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:33,420
narrowing window of what they'll
 

2343
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,670
narrowing window of what they'll
actually publish it gets narrower

2344
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:34,680
actually publish it gets narrower
 

2345
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,290
actually publish it gets narrower
narrower you can see all these you know

2346
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:36,300
narrower you can see all these you know
 

2347
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,630
narrower you can see all these you know
meltdowns over young adult levels and

2348
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:38,640
meltdowns over young adult levels and
 

2349
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,310
meltdowns over young adult levels and
stuff on Twitter but it's it's more than

2350
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:40,320
stuff on Twitter but it's it's more than
 

2351
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,010
stuff on Twitter but it's it's more than
that so you know actually having an

2352
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,020
that so you know actually having an
 

2353
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,290
that so you know actually having an
Amazon page it's just like a marker that

2354
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:45,300
Amazon page it's just like a marker that
 

2355
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,430
Amazon page it's just like a marker that
a book exists okay and uh now I've got

2356
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,440
a book exists okay and uh now I've got
 

2357
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,550
a book exists okay and uh now I've got

um gosh uh we're just talking about oh
yeah so continue going continue to

2982
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
yeah so continue going continue to
 

2983
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,870
yeah so continue going continue to
Commons yeah so tutors are commons and

2984
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:38,880
Commons yeah so tutors are commons and
 

2985
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,790
Commons yeah so tutors are commons and
Facebook is like it's got all these

2986
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:40,800
Facebook is like it's got all these
 

2987
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,710
Facebook is like it's got all these
Warrens and stuff Facebook is very

2988
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
Warrens and stuff Facebook is very
 

2989
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,530
Warrens and stuff Facebook is very
difficult to reason about uh like

2990
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:45,540
difficult to reason about uh like
 

2991
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,870
difficult to reason about uh like
privacy on that and the reason is I

2992
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:47,880
privacy on that and the reason is I
 

2993
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,010
privacy on that and the reason is I
think it's easy to understand when

2994
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,020
think it's easy to understand when
 

2995
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,630
think it's easy to understand when
something is completely public like

2996
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:50,640
something is completely public like
 

2997
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,790
something is completely public like
Twitter or completely private like

2998
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:52,800
Twitter or completely private like
 

2999
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,829
Twitter or completely private like
signal and those are the only two modes

3000
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:54,839
signal and those are the only two modes
 

3001
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,510
signal and those are the only two modes
I think in which one can really operate

3002
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:56,520
I think in which one can really operate
 

3003
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,030
I think in which one can really operate
when something is quasi-private like

3004
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,040
when something is quasi-private like
 

3005
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,250
when something is quasi-private like
Facebook you have to just kind of assume

3006
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:01,260
Facebook you have to just kind of assume
 

3007
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,170
Facebook you have to just kind of assume
it's public because if if it's

3008
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:03,180
it's public because if if it's
 

3009
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,150
it's public because if if it's
interesting enough it'll go outside your

3010
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:05,160
interesting enough it'll go outside your
 

3011
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,770
interesting enough it'll go outside your
friend Network and it'll get

3012
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:06,780
friend Network and it'll get
 

3013
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,750
friend Network and it'll get
screenshotted or whatever and posted and

3014
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:08,760
screenshotted or whatever and posted and
 

3015
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,170
screenshotted or whatever and posted and
so you know Facebook is sort of sort of

3016
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:12,180
so you know Facebook is sort of sort of
 

3017
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,089
so you know Facebook is sort of sort of
forced into default public despite its

3018
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:14,099
forced into default public despite its
 

3019
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:15,890
forced into default public despite its
privacy settings uh you know for anybody

3020
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:15,900
privacy settings uh you know for anybody
 

3021
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,569
privacy settings uh you know for anybody
who says something interesting you know

3022
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:17,579
who says something interesting you know
 

3023
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,970
who says something interesting you know
if it's like uh you can figure out all

3024
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:19,980
if it's like uh you can figure out all
 

3025
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,470
if it's like uh you can figure out all
their dials and stuff like that but just

3026
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:21,480
their dials and stuff like that but just
 

3027
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,390
their dials and stuff like that but just
hard to understand unless it's totally

3028
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:23,400
hard to understand unless it's totally
 

3029
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,950
hard to understand unless it's totally
private or totally public right you have

3030
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:24,960
private or totally public right you have
 

3031
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,270
private or totally public right you have
to basically treat it if it's totally

3032
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:26,280
to basically treat it if it's totally
 

3033
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,770
to basically treat it if it's totally
public if it's not totally private okay

3034
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:27,780
public if it's not totally private okay
 

3035
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,390
public if it's not totally private okay
at least under a real name I'll come

3036
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:29,400
at least under a real name I'll come
 

3037
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,069
at least under a real name I'll come
back to pseudonym so you've got Twitter

back to pseudonym so you've got Twitter
 

3039
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:32,630
back to pseudonym so you've got Twitter
that's that's total Commons Facebook

3040
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
that's that's total Commons Facebook
 

3041
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,250
that's that's total Commons Facebook
which is like a Warrens you know it's

3042
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:34,260
which is like a Warrens you know it's
 

3043
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,809
which is like a Warrens you know it's
like you know it's like rabbit worms or

3044

like you know it's like rabbit worms or
 

3045
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:37,370
like you know it's like rabbit worms or
like a ant colony where you don't know

3046
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:37,380
like a ant colony where you don't know
 

3047
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,470
like a ant colony where you don't know
where information is traveling then

3048
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:39,480
where information is traveling then
 

3049
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,870
where information is traveling then
you've got Reddit which has serve your

3050
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:41,880
you've got Reddit which has serve your
 

3051
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,950
you've got Reddit which has serve your
Global Reddit and then all the

3052
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:42,960
Global Reddit and then all the
 

3053
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,270
Global Reddit and then all the
subreddits that's a different model of

3054
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:44,280
subreddits that's a different model of
 

3055
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,710

cave and Commons
 

3057
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,150
cave and Commons
I think one of the reasons it works is

3058
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:47,160
I think one of the reasons it works is
 

3059
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,410
I think one of the reasons it works is
that you have individual moderators

3060
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:48,420
that you have individual moderators
 

3061
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,329
that you have individual moderators
where something is totally off topic and

3062
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:50,339
where something is totally off topic and
 

3063
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:52,309
where something is totally off topic and
acceptable uh totally off topic and

3064
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:52,319
acceptable uh totally off topic and
 

3065
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,630
acceptable uh totally off topic and
unacceptable in this subreddit and

3066
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:53,640
unacceptable in this subreddit and
 

3067
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,549
unacceptable in this subreddit and
totally on topic and acceptable another

00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:55,559
totally on topic and acceptable another
 

3069
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,150
totally on topic and acceptable another
that's like kind of a you know a

3070
00:53:59,150 --> 00:53:59,160
that's like kind of a you know a
 

3071
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,950
that's like kind of a you know a
precursor of the digital societies I

3072
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:00,960
precursor of the digital societies I
 

3073
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,210
precursor of the digital societies I
think that we're going to see that

3074
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:02,220
think that we're going to see that
 

3075
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,710
think that we're going to see that
actually become physical societies like

3076
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:03,720
actually become physical societies like

very new thing and I actually think this
 

3235
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,390
very new thing and I actually think this
will be a transitional era in like human

3236
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,400
will be a transitional era in like human
 

3237

there's a book called seeing like a

3248
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200
there's a book called seeing like a
 

3249
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,049
there's a book called seeing like a
state which actually talks about the

3250
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:09,059
state which actually talks about the
 

3251
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:12,530

brown hair that's like an analog
 

3257
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:18,710
brown hair that's like an analog
identifier it could be in 10 different

3258

legible to a state right hence seeing
 

3277
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:39,650
legible to a state right hence seeing
like a state you can see them now right

3295
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,450
say his real name okay or his state name
is a node okay attached to that is uh

3296
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:02,460
is a node okay attached to that is uh
 

3297
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,650
is a node okay attached to that is uh
every database you know his uh his Gmail

every database you know his uh his Gmail
his you know Facebook if he had one

3300
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:08,460
his you know Facebook if he had one
 

3301
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,049
his you know Facebook if he had one
every government record on him right all

3302
00:58:12,049 --> 00:58:12,059
every government record on him right all
 

3303
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,210
every government record on him right all
of these databases

3304
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:14,220
of these databases
 

3305
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:18,230

right why they they slurp up all the
 

3721
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:40,849
right why they they slurp up all the
information then they can't secure it so

3722
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:40,859
information then they can't secure it so
 

3723
01:05:40,859 --> 01:05:42,950
information then they can't secure it so
it leaks out the back door okay they've

3724
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:42,960
it leaks out the back door okay they've
 

3725
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,109
it leaks out the back door okay they've
they basically have you know 100 million

3726
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
they basically have you know 100 million
 

3727
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,030
they basically have you know 100 million
records of all just very 300 million

3728
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:47,040
records of all just very 300 million
 

3729
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,530
records of all just very 300 million
records all this very sense of data they

3730
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:48,540
records all this very sense of data they
 

3731
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,510
records all this very sense of data they
just get owned hacked over and over

3732
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:50,520
just get owned hacked over and over
 

3733
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,370
just get owned hacked over and over
again right and so really there should

3734
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:52,380
again right and so really there should
 

3735
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,870
again right and so really there should
be something which totally inverts the

3736
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:53,880
be something which totally inverts the
 

3737

and these are just ones that have been
 

3767
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:23,510
and these are just ones that have been
admitted and so you know what happens is

3768

have actually that's why that's why I
asked Tristan but let's say

3956
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:41,699

probably has effectively a social smart
 

3961
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:49,970

3967
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:56,510
therefore you're deprived of the right
to exit but upon entry into that Society

the key thing was he said here's a list
of all the quote rich men the cool locks

4036
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:03,600

two-sided thing right you're right that
 

4049
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,850
two-sided thing right you're right that
the tracking can you know prevent

facilitates unfortunately organized
 

4055
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,870
facilitates unfortunately organized
murders lists of undesirables were the

4056
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:26,880
murders lists of undesirables were the
 

4057
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,370
murders lists of undesirables were the
primary tool of all of these oppressive

4058
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:28,380

01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,010

in part it's a cynical point

4066
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:39,020
in part it's a cynical point
 

4067
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:43,790
in part it's a cynical point
which is that the rule of

4068
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:43,800
which is that the rule of
 

4069

which is that the rule of
a centralized state

4070
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:46,560
a centralized state
 

4071
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,930
a centralized state
is

4072
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:47,940
is
 

4073
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,149
is
more negative than positive

4074
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:50,159
more negative than positive
 

4075
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,850
more negative than positive
I think it is a it is like it's like

4076
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:52,860
I think it is a it is like it's like
 

4077
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,970
I think it is a it is like it's like
nuclear energy okay it's it's or it's

4078
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:55,980
nuclear energy okay it's it's or it's
 

4079
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,169
nuclear energy okay it's it's or it's
like fire

4080
01:11:57,169 --> 01:11:57,179
like fire
 

4081
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,750
like fire
it is something which

4082
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
it is something which
 

4083
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,550
it is something which
um you're gonna keep having it reform

4084
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:01,560
um you're gonna keep having it reform
 

4085
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,110
um you're gonna keep having it reform
because there's there's good reasons

4086
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,120
because there's there's good reasons
 

4087
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,189
because there's there's good reasons
where you have centralization

4088
01:12:04,189 --> 01:12:04,199
where you have centralization
 

4089
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:06,770
where you have centralization
decentralization recentralization but

4090
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:06,780
decentralization recentralization but
 

4091
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,689
decentralization recentralization but
power corrupts absolute power corrupts

4092
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:08,699
power corrupts absolute power corrupts
 

4093
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,270
power corrupts absolute power corrupts
absolutely and you just have to be very

4094
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:11,280
absolutely and you just have to be very
 

4095
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,250
absolutely and you just have to be very
suspicious of this kind of centralized

4096
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:13,260
suspicious of this kind of centralized
 

4097
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,290
suspicious of this kind of centralized
power the more trust you give it often

4098
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:15,300
power the more trust you give it often
 

4099
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,450
power the more trust you give it often
the less trusted it deserves

4100
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:17,460
the less trusted it deserves
 

4101
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,070
the less trusted it deserves
it's like a weird feedback loop right

4102
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:19,080
it's like a weird feedback loop right
 

4103
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,750
it's like a weird feedback loop right
the more trust the more it can do the

4104
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:20,760
the more trust the more it can do the
 

4105
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,070
the more trust the more it can do the
more it can do

4106
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,080
more it can do
 

4107
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,890
more it can do
the more bad things it will do so okay

4108
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:26,900

 

4109
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,870

there is a lot of downside to the state

4110
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:29,880
there is a lot of downside to the state
 

4111
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,930
there is a lot of downside to the state
being able to track you right and

4112
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:32,940
being able to track you right and
 

4113
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,270
being able to track you right and
history teaches us lessons one at a

4114
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
history teaches us lessons one at a
 

4115
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,430
history teaches us lessons one at a
large scale especially in the 20th

4116
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:37,440
large scale especially in the 20th
 

4117
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,470
large scale especially in the 20th
century at the largest of scale a state

4118
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:39,480
century at the largest of scale a state
 

4119
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,810
century at the largest of scale a state
can do commit a large amount of murder

4120
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:41,820
can do commit a large amount of murder
 

4121
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:43,550
can do commit a large amount of murder
and suffering and by the way history

4122
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:43,560
and suffering and by the way history
 

4123
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,229
and suffering and by the way history
isn't over if you think about what the

4124
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:45,239
isn't over if you think about what the
 

4125
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:47,930
isn't over if you think about what the
Chinese are building on this right that

4126
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:47,940
Chinese are building on this right that
 

4127
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,250
Chinese are building on this right that
surveillance state

4128
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:49,260
surveillance state
 

4129
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,709
surveillance state
it's not just tracking your name it's

4130
01:12:51,709 --> 01:12:51,719
it's not just tracking your name it's
 

4131
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:54,169
it's not just tracking your name it's
tracking everything on you you know like

4132
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:54,179
tracking everything on you you know like
 

4133
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:57,290
tracking everything on you you know like
WeChat is essentially like it

4134
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:57,300
WeChat is essentially like it
 

4135
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,390
WeChat is essentially like it
it is all the convenience and none of

4136
01:12:59,390 --> 01:12:59,400
it is all the convenience and none of
 

4137
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,750
it is all the convenience and none of
the freedom so that's the downside but

4138
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:01,760
the freedom so that's the downside but
 

4139
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,910
the freedom so that's the downside but
don't you the question is about is I

4140
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:04,920
don't you the question is about is I
 

4141
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,530
don't you the question is about is I
think probably fundamentally about the

4142
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:06,540
think probably fundamentally about the
 

4143
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,530
think probably fundamentally about the
human nature of an individual

4144
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:09,540
human nature of an individual
 

4145
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,330
human nature of an individual
of how

4146
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:11,340
of how
 

4147
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:14,110
of how
much murder that would be if we can just

4148
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:14,120
much murder that would be if we can just
 

4149
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:17,270
much murder that would be if we can just
disappear every time we murder well I

4150
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:17,280
disappear every time we murder well I
 

4151
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,310
disappear every time we murder well I
mean at the individual level so the

4152
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:19,320
mean at the individual level so the
 

4153
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,070
mean at the individual level so the
issue is basically like once once one

4154
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:22,080
issue is basically like once once one
 

4155
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,570
issue is basically like once once one
realizes that the moral trade-off has

4156
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:23,580
realizes that the moral trade-off has
 

4157
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,030
realizes that the moral trade-off has
two polls to it right and moreover that

4158
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:26,040
two polls to it right and moreover that
 

4159
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,830
two polls to it right and moreover that
basically centralized organized murder

4160
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
basically centralized organized murder
 

4161
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,870
basically centralized organized murder
has I mean if we add up all the

4162
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:29,880
has I mean if we add up all the
 

4163
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,990
has I mean if we add up all the
disorganized murder of the 20th century

4164
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,000
disorganized murder of the 20th century
 

4165
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,130
disorganized murder of the 20th century
it's probably significantly less than

4166
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:34,140
it's probably significantly less than
 

4167
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,290
it's probably significantly less than
the organized murder that was that these

4168
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:36,300
the organized murder that was that these
 

4169
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,990
the organized murder that was that these
states facilitated right and probably by

4170
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:39,000
states facilitated right and probably by
 

4171
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,669
states facilitated right and probably by
you know RJ Rommel has this thing called

4172
01:13:40,669 --> 01:13:40,679
you know RJ Rommel has this thing called
 

4173
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:43,189
you know RJ Rommel has this thing called
democide right the thing is it's so Grim

4174
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:43,199
democide right the thing is it's so Grim
 

4175
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,110
democide right the thing is it's so Grim
right because you know it's saying like

4176
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,120
right because you know it's saying like
 

4177
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,270
right because you know it's saying like
one one death is a tragedy a million is

4178
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:47,280
one one death is a tragedy a million is
 

4179
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,070
one one death is a tragedy a million is
a statistic right these are just like

4180
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:49,080
a statistic right these are just like
 

4181
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,890
a statistic right these are just like
just incalculable tragedies that we

4182
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:51,900
just incalculable tragedies that we
 

4183
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:56,570
just incalculable tragedies that we
can't even you know uh understand but

4184
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:56,580
can't even you know uh understand but
 

4185
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,830
can't even you know uh understand but
um you know nevertheless engaging with

4186
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
um you know nevertheless engaging with
 

4187
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,630
um you know nevertheless engaging with
it like you know I don't know it's a

4188
01:13:59,630 --> 01:13:59,640
it like you know I don't know it's a
 

4189
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,310
it like you know I don't know it's a
ratio 10x is it 100x I wouldn't be

4190
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:01,320
ratio 10x is it 100x I wouldn't be
 

4191
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,410
ratio 10x is it 100x I wouldn't be
surprised if it's 100 yeah but have you

4192
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:03,420
surprised if it's 100 yeah but have you
 

4193
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:07,250
surprised if it's 100 yeah but have you
seen the viciousness the negativity the

4194
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:07,260
seen the viciousness the negativity the
 

4195
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,470
seen the viciousness the negativity the
division within online communities that

4196
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:09,480
division within online communities that
 

4197
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,990
division within online communities that
have an anonymity so that's the thing is

4198
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
have an anonymity so that's the thing is
 

4199
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,450
have an anonymity so that's the thing is
basically you there's also a Scylla and

4200
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:14,460
basically you there's also a Scylla and
 

4201
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:17,270
basically you there's also a Scylla and
a charybdas I'm not you know when you

4202
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:17,280
a charybdas I'm not you know when you
 

4203
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,490
a charybdas I'm not you know when you
when you see what centralization can do

4204
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:19,500
when you see what centralization can do
 

4205
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,070
when you see what centralization can do
and you correct in the direction of

4206
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:22,080
and you correct in the direction of
 

4207
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,350
and you correct in the direction of
decentralization you can over correct

4208
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:24,360
decentralization you can over correct
 

4209
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,850
decentralization you can over correct
with decentralization and you get

4210
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:25,860
with decentralization and you get
 

4211
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,410
with decentralization and you get
Anarchy and this is basically then you

4212
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:27,420
Anarchy and this is basically then you
 

4213
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:29,390
Anarchy and this is basically then you
want to recentralize right and this is

4214
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:29,400
want to recentralize right and this is
 

4215
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,669
want to recentralize right and this is
the you know uh I think it's a Romance

4216
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:31,679
the you know uh I think it's a Romance
 

4217
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,530
the you know uh I think it's a Romance
of three kingdoms uh the Empire long

4218
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:33,540
of three kingdoms uh the Empire long
 

4219
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,270
of three kingdoms uh the Empire long
United must divide the Empire long

4220
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:35,280
United must divide the Empire long
 

4221
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,709
United must divide the Empire long
divided must unite that's always the way

4222
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:36,719
divided must unite that's always the way
 

4223
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,750
divided must unite that's always the way
of it right so it's going to happen is

4224
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:38,760
of it right so it's going to happen is
 

4225
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,910
of it right so it's going to happen is
we will state certain verbal principles

4226

we will state certain verbal principles
 

4227
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,970
we will state certain verbal principles
right and then the question is where in

4228
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:43,980
right and then the question is where in
 

4229
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,590
right and then the question is where in
state space you are are you too

4230
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600
state space you are are you too
 

4231
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,450
state space you are are you too
centralized well then okay you want to

4232

centralized well then okay you want to
 

4233
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:48,950
centralized well then okay you want to
decentralize and are you too

4234
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:48,960
decentralize and are you too
 

4235
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,270
decentralize and are you too
decentralized and we want to centralize

4236
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:50,280
decentralized and we want to centralize
 

4237

it may track more right and people opt
into more tracking because they will get

4240
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:54,480
into more tracking because they will get
 

4241
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,790
into more tracking because they will get
something from that tracking which is a

4242
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:55,800
something from that tracking which is a

01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:15,350
invented the trauma neckness and then
it's like uh Tech guys at long last we

4364
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:15,360
it's like uh Tech guys at long last we
 

4365

sometimes bad
um then uh but then there's the good

4576
01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:57,420
um then uh but then there's the good
 

4577
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,570
um then uh but then there's the good
version which is oh you know maybe the

4578
01:20:59,570 --> 01:20:59,580
version which is oh you know maybe the
 

4579
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,550
version which is oh you know maybe the
price is down right now but you believe

4580
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:01,560
price is down right now but you believe
 

4581
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,830
price is down right now but you believe
in the cause so even if they're uh you

4582
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:03,840
in the cause so even if they're uh you
 

4583
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,689
in the cause so even if they're uh you
know on paper you you would rationally

4584
01:21:05,689 --> 01:21:05,699
know on paper you you would rationally
 

4585
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:08,510
know on paper you you would rationally
exit you believe in in this thing and

4586
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:08,520
exit you believe in in this thing and
 

4587
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,430
exit you believe in in this thing and
you're gonna stick with it okay so

4588
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:10,440
you're gonna stick with it okay so
 

4589
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,530

your house and stuff like that but it's
not like your experience of the US is

4694
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:04,380
not like your experience of the US is
 

4695
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,610
not like your experience of the US is
like configurable you know uh let me

4696
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:07,620
like configurable you know uh let me
 

4697
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,770
like configurable you know uh let me
think about that let me let me think

4698
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:09,780
think about that let me let me think
 

4699
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:13,030
think about that let me let me think
about sort of the analogy of it so the

4700
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:13,040
about sort of the analogy of it so the
 

4701
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,050
about sort of the analogy of it so the
microeconomic leverage you can switch

4702
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:15,060
microeconomic leverage you can switch
 

4703
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,330
microeconomic leverage you can switch
apps

4704
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:17,340
apps
 

4705
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:20,390
apps
can you switch your experience in in

4706
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:20,400
can you switch your experience in in
 

4707
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,850
can you switch your experience in in
small ways efficiently multiple times a

4708
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:22,860
small ways efficiently multiple times a
 

4709
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:27,050
small ways efficiently multiple times a
day in inside the United States

4710
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:27,060

 

4711
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:29,450

um well the physical world you do yeah

4712
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:29,460
um well the physical world you do yeah
 

4713
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:30,770
um well the physical world you do yeah
under the constraints of the physical

4714
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:30,780
under the constraints of the physical
 

4715
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,770
under the constraints of the physical
world you do like micro migrations so

4716
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:33,780
world you do like micro migrations so
 

4717
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:34,610
world you do like micro migrations so
this is coming back to the

4718
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:34,620
this is coming back to the
 

4719
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:36,950
this is coming back to the
hunter-gatherer farmer Soldier digital

4720
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:36,960
hunter-gatherer farmer Soldier digital
 

4721
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,709
hunter-gatherer farmer Soldier digital
Nomad kind of thing right the

4722
01:23:39,709 --> 01:23:39,719
Nomad kind of thing right the
 

4723
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:42,110
Nomad kind of thing right the
the digital Nomad combines aspects of

4724
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:42,120
the digital Nomad combines aspects of
 

4725
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,110
the digital Nomad combines aspects of
the V1 and the V2 for a V3 right because

4726
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:45,120
the V1 and the V2 for a V3 right because
 

4727
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,330
the V1 and the V2 for a V3 right because
digital Nomad has the mobility and

4728
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:47,340
digital Nomad has the mobility and
 

4729
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,189
digital Nomad has the mobility and
freedom of the hunter-gatherer but some

4730
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:49,199
freedom of the hunter-gatherer but some
 

4731
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,470
freedom of the hunter-gatherer but some
of the consistency of the the

4732
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:51,480
of the consistency of the the
 

4733
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,870
of the consistency of the the
civilization of the farmer and Soldier

4734
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:53,880
civilization of the farmer and Soldier
 

4735
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,729
civilization of the farmer and Soldier
right but coming back to this like one

4736
01:23:55,729 --> 01:23:55,739
right but coming back to this like one
 

4737
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:58,490
right but coming back to this like one
other thing about it is in the 1950s if

4738
01:23:58,490 --> 01:23:58,500
other thing about it is in the 1950s if
 

4739
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,990
other thing about it is in the 1950s if
a guy in assembly line might literally

4740
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:00,000
a guy in assembly line might literally
 

4741
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,630
a guy in assembly line might literally
push the same button for 30 years okay

4742
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:02,640
push the same button for 30 years okay
 

4743
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,790
push the same button for 30 years okay
whereas today you're pushing a different

4744
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:04,800
whereas today you're pushing a different
 

4745
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,470
whereas today you're pushing a different
key every second

4746
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:06,480
key every second
 

4747
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,470
key every second
right that is that's like one version of

4748
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:09,480
right that is that's like one version of
 

4749
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,790
right that is that's like one version of
like microeconomic Leverage another

4750
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
like microeconomic Leverage another
 

4751
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,310
like microeconomic Leverage another
another version is you know in the 1980s

4752
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:13,320
another version is you know in the 1980s
 

4753
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,830
another version is you know in the 1980s
I mean didn't have Google Maps right so

4754
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:15,840
I mean didn't have Google Maps right so
 

4755
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,270
I mean didn't have Google Maps right so
you couldn't just like discover things

4756
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
you couldn't just like discover things
 

4757
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,530
you couldn't just like discover things
off the path people would just

4758
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:18,540
off the path people would just
 

4759
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:21,110
off the path people would just
essentially do you know home to work and

4760
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:21,120
essentially do you know home to work and
 

4761
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,330
essentially do you know home to work and
work to home and home to work and a trip

4762
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:23,340
work to home and home to work and a trip
 

4763
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,729
work to home and home to work and a trip
had to be planned right they were

4764
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:25,739
had to be planned right they were
 

4765
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:27,830
had to be planned right they were
contained within a region of space or

4766
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:27,840
contained within a region of space or
 

4767
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,450
contained within a region of space or
you do home to school school to home

4768
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:29,460
you do home to school school to home
 

4769
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,490
you do home to school school to home
home to school you know it wasn't like

4770
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:31,500
home to school you know it wasn't like
 

4771
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,290
home to school you know it wasn't like
you went and explored the map most

4772
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:33,300
you went and explored the map most
 

4773
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,970
you went and explored the map most
people didn't right they were highly

4774
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:34,980
people didn't right they were highly
 

4775
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:38,030
people didn't right they were highly
canalized okay meaning you know that it

4776
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:38,040
canalized okay meaning you know that it
 

4777
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,590
canalized okay meaning you know that it
was just back and forth back and forth

4778
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:39,600
was just back and forth back and forth
 

4779
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,090
was just back and forth back and forth
very routine just like the push the

4780
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:41,100
very routine just like the push the
 

4781
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,850
very routine just like the push the
button push the button trapped within

4782
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:43,860
button push the button trapped within
 

4783
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:47,209
button push the button trapped within
this very small piece and also trapped

4784
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:47,219
this very small piece and also trapped
 

4785
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:48,530
this very small piece and also trapped
within this large country because it was

4786
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:48,540
within this large country because it was
 

4787
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,090
within this large country because it was
hard to travel between countries and so

4788
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:50,100
hard to travel between countries and so
 

4789
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,709
hard to travel between countries and so
on again you know of course there were

4790
01:24:51,709 --> 01:24:51,719
on again you know of course there were
 

4791
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:53,330
on again you know of course there were
vacations of course there was some

4792
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:53,340
vacations of course there was some
 

4793
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,070
vacations of course there was some
degree of news and so on your Mobility

4794
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:55,080
degree of news and so on your Mobility
 

4795
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,050
degree of news and so on your Mobility
wasn't completely crushed but it was

4796
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:57,060
wasn't completely crushed but it was
 

4797
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,090
wasn't completely crushed but it was
actually quite low okay relatively

4798
01:24:59,090 --> 01:24:59,100
actually quite low okay relatively
 

4799
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,910
actually quite low okay relatively
speaking just the you you were you were

4800
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:01,920
speaking just the you you were you were
 

4801
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,169
speaking just the you you were you were
trapped in a way you weren't even really

4802
01:25:03,169 --> 01:25:03,179
trapped in a way you weren't even really
 

4803
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:05,630
trapped in a way you weren't even really
thinking about it okay and now that map

4804
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:05,640
thinking about it okay and now that map
 

4805
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,970
thinking about it okay and now that map
is opened up now you can see the whole

4806
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:07,980
is opened up now you can see the whole
 

4807
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:10,250
is opened up now you can see the whole
map you can go all over the place

4808
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:10,260
map you can go all over the place
 

4809
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:11,510
map you can go all over the place
um you know I don't have the data to

4810
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:11,520
um you know I don't have the data to
 

4811
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,149
um you know I don't have the data to
show it but I would I'd be shocked if

4812
01:25:14,149 --> 01:25:14,159
show it but I would I'd be shocked if
 

4813
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:15,649
show it but I would I'd be shocked if
people the average person didn't go to

4814
01:25:15,649 --> 01:25:15,659
people the average person didn't go to
 

4815
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:18,110
people the average person didn't go to
more places wasn't you know doing more

4816
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:18,120
more places wasn't you know doing more
 

4817
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,790
more places wasn't you know doing more
you know going to more restaurants and

4818
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:19,800
you know going to more restaurants and
 

4819
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,470
you know going to more restaurants and
things like that today than they were in

4820
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:21,480
things like that today than they were in
 

4821
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,030
things like that today than they were in
the 80s simply because the map is open

4822
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:23,040
the 80s simply because the map is open
 

4823
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,850
the 80s simply because the map is open
okay and the the map is made more open

4824
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:25,860
okay and the the map is made more open
 

4825
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,530
okay and the the map is made more open
through the digital world the digital

4826
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:27,540
through the digital world the digital
 

4827
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,450
through the digital world the digital
world exactly so we're reopening the map

4828
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:29,460
world exactly so we're reopening the map
 

4829
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,310
world exactly so we're reopening the map
like the hunter-gatherer okay because

4830
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:31,320
like the hunter-gatherer okay because
 

4831
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,649
like the hunter-gatherer okay because
you can now think about every site for

4832
01:25:33,649 --> 01:25:33,659
you can now think about every site for
 

4833
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:35,990
you can now think about every site for
very low cost that you can visit right

4834
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:36,000
very low cost that you can visit right
 

4835
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,850
very low cost that you can visit right
the digital world you can I mean how

4836
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:37,860
the digital world you can I mean how
 

4837
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,950
the digital world you can I mean how
many websites have you visited I don't

4838
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:39,960
many websites have you visited I don't
 

4839
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,510
many websites have you visited I don't
know hundreds of thousands probably at

4840
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:41,520
know hundreds of thousands probably at
 

4841
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,310
know hundreds of thousands probably at
this point over your life right how many

4842
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:43,320
this point over your life right how many
 

4843
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,990
this point over your life right how many
places on the services you're actually

4844
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:45,000
places on the services you're actually
 

4845
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,130
places on the services you're actually
unusual you might be like a world

4846
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:46,140
unusual you might be like a world
 

4847
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,990
unusual you might be like a world

um so this is an important concept it is
it's multi-axis right that is to say for

6478
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:34,320
it's multi-axis right that is to say for
 

6479
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:35,330
it's multi-axis right that is to say for
example

6480
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:35,340
example
 

6481
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:37,609
example
um just the introduction of the Bitcoin

6482
01:54:37,609 --> 01:54:37,619
um just the introduction of the Bitcoin
 

6483
01:54:37,619 --> 01:54:41,209
um just the introduction of the Bitcoin
axis right uh and those you because it

6484
01:54:41,209 --> 01:54:41,219
axis right uh and those you because it
 

6485
01:54:41,219 --> 01:54:44,149
axis right uh and those you because it
didn't exist pre-2009 now it exists

6486
01:54:44,149 --> 01:54:44,159
didn't exist pre-2009 now it exists
 

6487
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,250
didn't exist pre-2009 now it exists
um those people who are rich in BTC

6488
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:46,260
um those people who are rich in BTC
 

6489
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:48,590
um those people who are rich in BTC
terms are only partially correlated with

6490
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:48,600
terms are only partially correlated with
 

6491
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:50,570
terms are only partially correlated with
those who are rich in USD terms there's

6492
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:50,580
those who are rich in USD terms there's
 

6493
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:53,149
those who are rich in USD terms there's
all these folks essentially BTC is

6494
01:54:53,149 --> 01:54:53,159
all these folks essentially BTC is
 

6495
01:54:53,159 --> 01:54:56,629
all these folks essentially BTC is
Bitcoin and USD is US dollar yes

6496
01:54:56,629 --> 01:54:56,639
Bitcoin and USD is US dollar yes
 

6497
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,970
Bitcoin and USD is US dollar yes
so that's a new axis and eth is yet

6498
01:54:58,970 --> 01:54:58,980
so that's a new axis and eth is yet
 

6499
01:54:58,980 --> 01:55:01,430
so that's a new axis and eth is yet
another axis right you ethereum eth is

6500
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:01,440
another axis right you ethereum eth is
 

6501
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,709
another axis right you ethereum eth is
ethereum right so you are essentially

6502
01:55:03,709 --> 01:55:03,719
ethereum right so you are essentially
 

6503
01:55:03,719 --> 01:55:04,930
ethereum right so you are essentially
getting

6504
01:55:04,930 --> 01:55:04,940
getting
 

6505
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:07,850
getting
new social systems which are actually

6506
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:07,860
new social systems which are actually
 

6507
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:10,609
new social systems which are actually
net inequality decreasing because before

6508
01:55:10,609 --> 01:55:10,619
net inequality decreasing because before
 

6509
01:55:10,619 --> 01:55:13,129
net inequality decreasing because before
you only had USD Millionaires and now

6510
01:55:13,129 --> 01:55:13,139
you only had USD Millionaires and now
 

6511
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:15,350
you only had USD Millionaires and now
you have a new track and then another

6512
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:15,360
you have a new track and then another
 

6513
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,270
you have a new track and then another
track and another track right you have

6514
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:17,280
track and another track right you have
 

6515
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:18,950
track and another track right you have
different hierarchies different ladders

6516
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:18,960
different hierarchies different ladders
 

6517
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,490
different hierarchies different ladders
right and so on net you have more

6518
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:22,500
right and so on net you have more
 

6519
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:24,950
right and so on net you have more
ladders to climb and so it's not the

6520
01:55:24,950 --> 01:55:24,960
ladders to climb and so it's not the
 

6521
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,870
ladders to climb and so it's not the
rich getting richer in fact old money in

6522
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:26,880
rich getting richer in fact old money in
 

6523
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,629
rich getting richer in fact old money in
some ways is a last to cryptocurrency

6524
01:55:29,629 --> 01:55:29,639
some ways is a last to cryptocurrency
 

6525
01:55:29,639 --> 01:55:31,370
some ways is a last to cryptocurrency
um old money and old States I think

6526
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:31,380
um old money and old States I think
 

6527
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:33,229
um old money and old States I think
those people who are the most focused on

6528
01:55:33,229 --> 01:55:33,239
those people who are the most focused on
 

6529
01:55:33,239 --> 01:55:35,209
those people who are the most focused on

the old world who have the least
 

6535
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:41,870
the old world who have the least
incentive to switch

6536
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:41,880

6554
01:56:03,109 --> 01:56:03,119
these new network States you you I think
 

6555
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,090
these new network States you you I think
said that basically anybody can become

6556

said that basically anybody can become
 

6557
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:06,770
said that basically anybody can become
president of a network State just like

6558
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:06,780
president of a network State just like
 

6559
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:08,090
president of a network State just like

there's like thousands of billionaires
for what in fact 75 of them are outside

6598
01:56:46,189 --> 01:56:46,199
for what in fact 75 of them are outside
 

6599
01:56:46,199 --> 01:56:48,890
for what in fact 75 of them are outside
the US and many of those have been you

6600
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:48,900
the US and many of those have been you
 

6601
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,510
the US and many of those have been you
know some of them are like energy and

6602
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:50,520
know some of them are like energy and
 

6603
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,550
know some of them are like energy and
oil which is often based on political

6604
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
oil which is often based on political
 

6605
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,290
oil which is often based on political
connections but a very large chunk of

01:56:54,290 --> 01:56:54,300
connections but a very large chunk of
 

6607
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:57,410
connections but a very large chunk of
the rest are Tech okay and uh that's

6608
01:56:57,410 --> 01:56:57,420
the rest are Tech okay and uh that's
 

6609
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:59,090
the rest are Tech okay and uh that's
something where you're mining but you're

6610
01:56:59,090 --> 01:56:59,100
something where you're mining but you're
 

6611
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:01,129
something where you're mining but you're
mining online by hitting Keys as opposed

6612
01:57:01,129 --> 01:57:01,139
mining online by hitting Keys as opposed

to with the pickaxe you know in Granite

6614
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:02,820
to with the pickaxe you know in Granite
 

6615
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:05,450
to with the pickaxe you know in Granite
right so the point is that we think it's

6616
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:05,460
right so the point is that we think it's
 

6617
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:08,149
right so the point is that we think it's
totally understandable today for there

6618
01:57:08,149 --> 01:57:08,159
totally understandable today for there
 

6619
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:11,689
totally understandable today for there
to be a you know huge founder who comes

from all over the world right
exceptional people can rise from all the

6628
01:57:20,209 --> 01:57:20,219
exceptional people can rise from all the
 

6629
01:57:20,219 --> 01:57:22,490
exceptional people can rise from all the
world to run giant companies why can

6630
01:57:22,490 --> 01:57:22,500
world to run giant companies why can
 

6631
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:24,770
world to run giant companies why can
they not rise to run giant new countries

6632

they not rise to run giant new countries
 

6633
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:26,089
they not rise to run giant new countries
and the answer has been developed a

6634
01:57:26,089 --> 01:57:26,099
and the answer has been developed a
 

6635
01:57:26,099 --> 01:57:27,830
and the answer has been developed a
mechanism yet right

6636
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:27,840
mechanism yet right
 

6637
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,089
mechanism yet right
um and just as another example I talked

6638
01:57:29,089 --> 01:57:29,099
um and just as another example I talked
 

6639
01:57:29,099 --> 01:57:30,350
um and just as another example I talked
about this in the book

6640
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:30,360
about this in the book
 

6641
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:33,290
about this in the book

something like that right so essentially
that the the grandson squanders it right

6716
01:58:51,649 --> 01:58:51,659
that the the grandson squanders it right
 

6717
01:58:51,659 --> 01:58:54,649
that the the grandson squanders it right
and you know in sense by the way

6718
01:58:54,649 --> 01:58:54,659
and you know in sense by the way
 

6719
01:58:54,659 --> 01:58:55,910
and you know in sense by the way
um just to talk about that for a second

6720
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:55,920
um just to talk about that for a second
 

6721
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:58,490
um just to talk about that for a second
if you have two children and four

6722
01:58:58,490 --> 01:58:58,500
if you have two children and four
 

6723
01:58:58,500 --> 01:58:59,570
if you have two children and four
grandchildren and eight

6724
01:58:59,570 --> 01:58:59,580
grandchildren and eight
 

6725
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:02,030
grandchildren and eight
great-grandchildren and 16 and so on and

6726
01:59:02,030 --> 01:59:02,040
great-grandchildren and 16 and so on and
 

6727
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:03,649
great-grandchildren and 16 and so on and
an older family is you know they were

6728
01:59:03,649 --> 01:59:03,659
an older family is you know they were
 

6729
01:59:03,659 --> 01:59:05,270
an older family is you know they were
much bigger right six you know children

6730
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:05,280
much bigger right six you know children
 

6731
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,550
much bigger right six you know children
is not uncommon whatever Fortune you

6732
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:07,560
is not uncommon whatever Fortune you
 

6733
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:09,470
is not uncommon whatever Fortune you
have is now split six ways and then six

6734
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:09,480
have is now split six ways and then six
 

6735
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:11,930
have is now split six ways and then six
ways and six ways again so with the

6736
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:11,940
ways and six ways again so with the
 

6737
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:13,430
ways and six ways again so with the
exception of primogeneature where the

6738
01:59:13,430 --> 01:59:13,440
exception of primogeneature where the
 

6739
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:15,589
exception of primogeneature where the
oldest son inherits all the way down the

6740
01:59:15,589 --> 01:59:15,599
oldest son inherits all the way down the
 

6741
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:16,850
oldest son inherits all the way down the
majority of your descent is just a few

6742
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:16,860
majority of your descent is just a few
 

6743
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:18,950
majority of your descent is just a few
Generations out have probably inherited

6744
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:18,960
Generations out have probably inherited
 

6745
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,870
Generations out have probably inherited
none of that fortune unless it has

6746
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:20,880
none of that fortune unless it has
 

6747
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,250
none of that fortune unless it has
compound to such an extent that it's

6748
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:22,260
compound to such an extent that it's
 

6749
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:26,270
compound to such an extent that it's
like up 6X over 20 years right so it's

6750
01:59:26,270 --> 01:59:26,280
like up 6X over 20 years right so it's
 

6751
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:28,310
like up 6X over 20 years right so it's
actually hard to maintain a quote rule

6752
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,320
actually hard to maintain a quote rule
 

6753
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,229
actually hard to maintain a quote rule
in class in the sense that this person

6754
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:30,239
in class in the sense that this person
 

6755
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:33,589
in class in the sense that this person
who's like four generations down has you

6756
01:59:33,589 --> 01:59:33,599
who's like four generations down has you
 

6757
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:37,490
who's like four generations down has you
know uh like 1 16 of the DNA you know

6758
01:59:37,490 --> 01:59:37,500
know uh like 1 16 of the DNA you know
 

6759
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,350
know uh like 1 16 of the DNA you know
one over two to the fourth right

6760
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:39,360
one over two to the fourth right
 

6761
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:42,050
one over two to the fourth right
of their their cyan who built a fortune

6762
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:42,060
of their their cyan who built a fortune
 

6763
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:44,209
of their their cyan who built a fortune
so it's not even like the same is it the

6764
01:59:44,209 --> 01:59:44,219
so it's not even like the same is it the
 

6765
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:46,189
so it's not even like the same is it the
same family even right is the fortune

6766
01:59:46,189 --> 01:59:46,199
same family even right is the fortune
 

6767
01:59:46,199 --> 01:59:47,629
same family even right is the fortune
actually in the family so most people

6768
01:59:47,629 --> 01:59:47,639
actually in the family so most people
 

6769
01:59:47,639 --> 01:59:49,310
actually in the family so most people
don't think a few Generations out they

6770
01:59:49,310 --> 01:59:49,320
don't think a few Generations out they
 

6771
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:50,810
don't think a few Generations out they
just kind of think oh Marx is right

6772
01:59:50,810 --> 01:59:50,820
just kind of think oh Marx is right
 

6773

it's actually much more Dynamic than

6776
01:59:53,149 --> 01:59:53,159
it's actually much more Dynamic than
 

6777
01:59:53,159 --> 01:59:54,830
it's actually much more Dynamic than
that because you literally like what is

6778
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:54,840
that because you literally like what is
 

6779

01:59:56,450 --> 01:59:56,460
even the family when it's diluted out
 

6781
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:58,790
even the family when it's diluted out
you know 1 16th right

6782
01:59:58,790 --> 01:59:58,800
you know 1 16th right
 

6783

now are there's again primogenitor where
 

6793
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:09,470
now are there's again primogenitor where
the guy who inherits the name all the

6794
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:09,480
the guy who inherits the name all the
 

6795
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:10,669
the guy who inherits the name all the
way through

6796
02:00:10,669 --> 02:00:10,679
way through
 

6797
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:11,330
way through
um

6798
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:11,340
um
 

6799
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:13,490
um
that would be one way to pass it down

6800
02:00:13,490 --> 02:00:13,500
that would be one way to pass it down
 

6801
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,290
that would be one way to pass it down
but even that person doesn't necessarily

but even that person doesn't necessarily
 

6803
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:16,790
but even that person doesn't necessarily
have the qualities of the guy who you

6871
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:25,790
people have inherited something that
they could not build from scratch

6872
02:01:25,790 --> 02:01:25,800
they could not build from scratch
 

6873
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:26,930
they could not build from scratch
because they could not build from

6874
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:26,940
because they could not build from
 

6875
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:28,310
because they could not build from
scratch they can't even maintain it this

6876
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:28,320
scratch they can't even maintain it this
 

6877
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,990
scratch they can't even maintain it this
is an important point the ability to

6878
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:30,000
is an important point the ability to
 

6879
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,189
is an important point the ability to
build from scratch is so important

6880
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:31,199
build from scratch is so important
 

6881
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:34,490
build from scratch is so important
because if some part breaks and you

6882
02:01:34,490 --> 02:01:34,500
because if some part breaks and you
 

6883
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,350
because if some part breaks and you
don't know why it was there can you even

6884
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:36,360
don't know why it was there can you even
 

6885
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:40,070
don't know why it was there can you even
maintain it no you can't okay unless all

6886
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,080
maintain it no you can't okay unless all
 

6887
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:41,750
maintain it no you can't okay unless all
the replacement parts in the know-how to

6888
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:41,760
the replacement parts in the know-how to
 

6889
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:42,950
the replacement parts in the know-how to
fit them together is there you can't

6890
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:42,960
fit them together is there you can't
 

6891
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:45,350
fit them together is there you can't
repair this so in 2009 Mother Jones had

6892
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:45,360
repair this so in 2009 Mother Jones had
 

6893
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:46,490
repair this so in 2009 Mother Jones had
a story that said that the U.S military

6894
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:46,500
a story that said that the U.S military
 

6895
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:48,890
a story that said that the U.S military
had forgotten how to make some kinds of

6896
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:48,900
had forgotten how to make some kinds of
 

6897
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:51,169
had forgotten how to make some kinds of
nuclear weapons because there's a part

6898
02:01:51,169 --> 02:01:51,179
nuclear weapons because there's a part
 

6899
02:01:51,179 --> 02:01:52,490
nuclear weapons because there's a part
where all the guys who knew how to make

6900
02:01:52,490 --> 02:01:52,500
where all the guys who knew how to make
 

6901
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:55,250
where all the guys who knew how to make
it had like aged out or left okay and

6902
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:55,260
it had like aged out or left okay and
 

6903
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:56,689
it had like aged out or left okay and
this was some like Arrow gel or

6904
02:01:56,689 --> 02:01:56,699
this was some like Arrow gel or
 

6905
02:01:56,699 --> 02:01:57,530
this was some like Arrow gel or
something like that it was it was

6906
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:57,540
something like that it was it was
 

6907
02:01:57,540 --> 02:01:58,970
something like that it was it was
rumored okay

6908
02:01:58,970 --> 02:01:58,980
rumored okay
 

6909
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:00,350
rumored okay
thing is

6910
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:00,360
thing is
 

6911
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:02,030
thing is
um you're seeing you know increasingly

6912
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:02,040
um you're seeing you know increasingly
 

6913
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:04,790
um you're seeing you know increasingly
for example you've got uh wildfires in

6914
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:04,800
for example you've got uh wildfires in
 

6915
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,010
for example you've got uh wildfires in
California you've got you know water

6916
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:07,020
California you've got you know water
 

6917
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:09,470
California you've got you know water
that's not potable in Jackson you've got

6918
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:09,480
that's not potable in Jackson you've got
 

6919
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:12,050
that's not potable in Jackson you've got
power outages in Texas

6920
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:12,060
power outages in Texas
 

6921
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:13,189
power outages in Texas
um you're seeing a lot of the

6922
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:13,199
um you're seeing a lot of the
 

6923
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:15,890
um you're seeing a lot of the
infrastructure of the US is just less

6924
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:15,900
infrastructure of the US is just less
 

6925
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:16,910
infrastructure of the US is just less
functional

6926
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:16,920
functional
 

6927
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:18,830
functional
I think probably part of that is due to

6928
02:02:18,830 --> 02:02:18,840
I think probably part of that is due to
 

6929
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:21,290
I think probably part of that is due to
civil engineering not being that sexy

6930
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:21,300
civil engineering not being that sexy
 

6931
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:24,890
civil engineering not being that sexy
field people aging out and just domain

6932
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:24,900
field people aging out and just domain
 

6933
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:29,930
field people aging out and just domain
knowledge being lost and The Heirs who

6934
02:02:29,930 --> 02:02:29,940
knowledge being lost and The Heirs who
 

6935
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:31,609
knowledge being lost and The Heirs who
win you know the role of mayor or

6936
02:02:31,609 --> 02:02:31,619
win you know the role of mayor or
 

6937
02:02:31,619 --> 02:02:33,589
win you know the role of mayor or
whatever of this town don't have the

6938
02:02:33,589 --> 02:02:33,599
whatever of this town don't have the
 

6939
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:35,149
whatever of this town don't have the
ability to build it from scratch or just

6940
02:02:35,149 --> 02:02:35,159
ability to build it from scratch or just
 

6941
02:02:35,159 --> 02:02:36,649
ability to build it from scratch or just
selected for legitimacy not competence

6942
02:02:36,649 --> 02:02:36,659
selected for legitimacy not competence
 

6943
02:02:36,659 --> 02:02:38,510
selected for legitimacy not competence
okay so once you think about this

6944
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:38,520
okay so once you think about this
 

6945
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,129
okay so once you think about this
concept of founding versus inheriting

6946
02:02:40,129 --> 02:02:40,139
concept of founding versus inheriting
 

6947
02:02:40,139 --> 02:02:41,450
concept of founding versus inheriting
and I've got the whole essay which talks

6948
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:41,460
and I've got the whole essay which talks
 

6949
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:43,490
and I've got the whole essay which talks
about this

6950
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:43,500
about this
 

6951
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:44,870
about this
um of course the alternative to somebody

6952
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:44,880
um of course the alternative to somebody
 

6953
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,209
um of course the alternative to somebody
who's legitimate but not competent what

6954
02:02:47,209 --> 02:02:47,219
who's legitimate but not competent what
 

6955
02:02:47,219 --> 02:02:49,010
who's legitimate but not competent what
people will say is oh we need like uh

6956
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:49,020
people will say is oh we need like uh
 

6957
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:50,510
people will say is oh we need like uh
you know an authoritarian to be in

6958
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:50,520
you know an authoritarian to be in
 

6959
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,609
you know an authoritarian to be in
control of everything and then their

6960
02:02:52,609 --> 02:02:52,619
control of everything and then their
 

6961
02:02:52,619 --> 02:02:54,229
control of everything and then their
their hope is that that person is

6962
02:02:54,229 --> 02:02:54,239
their hope is that that person is
 

6963
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,330
their hope is that that person is
competent but they don't have legitimacy

6964
02:02:56,330 --> 02:02:56,340
competent but they don't have legitimacy
 

6965
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:58,010
competent but they don't have legitimacy
because if they're just installed it's

6966
02:02:58,010 --> 02:02:58,020
because if they're just installed it's
 

6967
02:02:58,020 --> 02:03:00,589
because if they're just installed it's
just like a authoritarian ruler 50 of

6968
02:03:00,589 --> 02:03:00,599
just like a authoritarian ruler 50 of
 

6969
02:03:00,599 --> 02:03:01,669
just like a authoritarian ruler 50 of
the population is really mad at them

6970
02:03:01,669 --> 02:03:01,679
the population is really mad at them
 

6971
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:03,169
the population is really mad at them
they don't have title just grab the

6972
02:03:03,169 --> 02:03:03,179
they don't have title just grab the
 

6973
02:03:03,179 --> 02:03:05,089
they don't have title just grab the
title you know maybe they can exert

6974
02:03:05,089 --> 02:03:05,099
title you know maybe they can exert
 

6975
02:03:05,099 --> 02:03:06,589
title you know maybe they can exert
enough Force but that's the problem with

6976
02:03:06,589 --> 02:03:06,599
enough Force but that's the problem with
 

6977
02:03:06,599 --> 02:03:08,149
enough Force but that's the problem with
kind of the authoritarian you know

6978
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:08,159
kind of the authoritarian you know
 

6979
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:10,070
kind of the authoritarian you know
dictator or takeover right so the

6980
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:10,080
dictator or takeover right so the
 

6981
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:11,990
dictator or takeover right so the
alternative the third version is the

6982
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:12,000
alternative the third version is the
 

6983
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,850
alternative the third version is the
founder who combines both legitimacy and

6984
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:13,860
founder who combines both legitimacy and
 

6985
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:14,810
founder who combines both legitimacy and
competence because they start from

6986
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:14,820
competence because they start from
 

6987
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:16,430
competence because they start from
scratch and they attract people to their

6988
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:16,440
scratch and they attract people to their
 

6989
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:17,870
scratch and they attract people to their
vision and they build it from scratch

6990
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:17,880
vision and they build it from scratch
 

6991
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:19,729
vision and they build it from scratch
and so you need is the ability to

6992
02:03:19,729 --> 02:03:19,739
and so you need is the ability to
 

6993
02:03:19,739 --> 02:03:22,729
and so you need is the ability to
constantly do refoundings rebirths so if

6994
02:03:22,729 --> 02:03:22,739
constantly do refoundings rebirths so if
 

6995
02:03:22,739 --> 02:03:26,450
constantly do refoundings rebirths so if
you imagine a world that is primarily

6996
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:26,460
you imagine a world that is primarily
 

6997
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:28,550
you imagine a world that is primarily
Network States

6998
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:28,560
Network States
 

6999
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,530
Network States
can you help me

7000
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:30,540
can you help me
 

7001
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:33,169
can you help me
imagine what that looks like

7002
02:03:33,169 --> 02:03:33,179
imagine what that looks like
 

7003
02:03:33,179 --> 02:03:35,149
imagine what that looks like
now there's several ways to imagine

7004
02:03:35,149 --> 02:03:35,159
now there's several ways to imagine
 

7005
02:03:35,159 --> 02:03:38,030
now there's several ways to imagine
things which is how many of them are

7006
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:38,040
things which is how many of them are
 

7007
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:41,689
things which is how many of them are
there and how often do they the new ones

7008
02:03:41,689 --> 02:03:41,699
there and how often do they the new ones
 

7009
02:03:41,699 --> 02:03:44,270
there and how often do they the new ones
pop up there could be thousands given

7010
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:44,280
pop up there could be thousands given
 

7011
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:45,649
pop up there could be thousands given
seven billion people eight billion

7012
02:03:45,649 --> 02:03:45,659
seven billion people eight billion
 

7013
02:03:45,659 --> 02:03:47,209
seven billion people eight billion
people on Earth yeah yeah so there's

7014
02:03:47,209 --> 02:03:47,219
people on Earth yeah yeah so there's
 

7015
02:03:47,219 --> 02:03:49,669
people on Earth yeah yeah so there's
Network state in the like the precise

7016
02:03:49,669 --> 02:03:49,679
Network state in the like the precise
 

7017
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:51,830
Network state in the like the precise
definition I have in the book which is a

7018
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:51,840
definition I have in the book which is a
 

7019
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,510
definition I have in the book which is a
diplomatically recognized entity and

7020
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:53,520
diplomatically recognized entity and
 

7021
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:54,649
diplomatically recognized entity and
there's never seen sort of the loose

7022
02:03:54,649 --> 02:03:54,659
there's never seen sort of the loose
 

7023
02:03:54,659 --> 02:03:56,209
there's never seen sort of the loose
definition where you know one thing

7024
02:03:56,209 --> 02:03:56,219
definition where you know one thing
 

7025
02:03:56,219 --> 02:03:58,490
definition where you know one thing
that's interesting is this term has

7026
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:58,500
that's interesting is this term has
 

7027

just can't do that digitally right we're
still physical beings you know so you

7160
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:07,980
still physical beings you know so you
 

7161
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:10,310
still physical beings you know so you
need physical space but how do we get

7162
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:10,320
need physical space but how do we get
 

7163
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,109
need physical space but how do we get
that right so that this is this is meant

idea is it's been to wind its way
through that year maze to find how to

7174
02:06:20,689 --> 02:06:20,699
through that year maze to find how to
 

7175
02:06:20,699 --> 02:06:22,550
through that year maze to find how to
use bits to re-lock unlock innovation in

02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:26,390
atoms the idea is within the bigger
prime number maze or go back to

7180
02:06:26,390 --> 02:06:26,400
prime number maze or go back to
 

7181
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:28,609
prime number maze or go back to
visualizing the number of states and how

7182
02:06:28,609 --> 02:06:28,619
visualizing the number of states and how
 

7183
02:06:28,619 --> 02:06:30,410
visualizing the number of states and how
often are they born so let me first let

7184
02:06:30,410 --> 02:06:30,420
often are they born so let me first let
 

7185
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:32,750
often are they born so let me first let
me first anchor this because people just

7186
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:32,760
me first anchor this because people just
 

7187
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:35,810
me first anchor this because people just
to give some numbers right how many U.N

7188
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:35,820
to give some numbers right how many U.N
 

7189
02:06:35,820 --> 02:06:38,390
to give some numbers right how many U.N
listed countries are there like 196 193

7190
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:38,400
listed countries are there like 196 193
 

7191
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:39,950
listed countries are there like 196 193
okay and there's some that are on the

7192
02:06:39,950 --> 02:06:39,960
okay and there's some that are on the
 

7193
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:42,169
okay and there's some that are on the
border like Taiwan or Israel right uh

7194
02:06:42,169 --> 02:06:42,179
border like Taiwan or Israel right uh
 

7195
02:06:42,179 --> 02:06:43,430
border like Taiwan or Israel right uh
where they're not I mean Israel is a

7196
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:43,440
where they're not I mean Israel is a
 

7197
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:44,750
where they're not I mean Israel is a
country but it's not recognized by every

7198
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:44,760
country but it's not recognized by every
 

7199
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:46,370
country but it's not recognized by every
country or what have you right is Texas

7200
02:06:46,370 --> 02:06:46,380
country or what have you right is Texas
 

7201
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:47,450
country or what have you right is Texas
a country

7202
02:06:47,450 --> 02:06:47,460
a country
 

7203
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:52,430
a country
no but um right okay so within that list

7204
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:52,440
no but um right okay so within that list
 

7205
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,990
no but um right okay so within that list
of about 200 countries okay I've got a

7206
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:54,000
of about 200 countries okay I've got a
 

7207
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,430
of about 200 countries okay I've got a
graph in the book that shows that most

7208
02:06:55,430 --> 02:06:55,440
graph in the book that shows that most
 

7209
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:57,830
graph in the book that shows that most
countries are actually small countries

7210
02:06:57,830 --> 02:06:57,840
countries are actually small countries
 

7211
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:59,330
countries are actually small countries
um about there's 12 countries that have

7212
02:06:59,330 --> 02:06:59,340
um about there's 12 countries that have
 

7213
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:00,830
um about there's 12 countries that have
less than 100 000 people by the UN

7214
02:07:00,830 --> 02:07:00,840
less than 100 000 people by the UN
 

7215

less than 100 000 people by the UN
definition of a country there's another

7217
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:05,089

20 something that have between 100 000

7218
02:07:05,089 --> 02:07:05,099
20 something that have between 100 000
 

7219
02:07:05,099 --> 02:07:06,350
20 something that have between 100 000
and 1 million

7220
02:07:06,350 --> 02:07:06,360
and 1 million
 

7221
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:08,450
and 1 million
a generator 50 or 60 something that have

7222
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:08,460
a generator 50 or 60 something that have
 

7223
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:11,209
a generator 50 or 60 something that have
between a million and 10 million so most

7224
02:07:11,209 --> 02:07:11,219
between a million and 10 million so most
 

7225
02:07:11,219 --> 02:07:12,830
between a million and 10 million so most
countries

7226
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:12,840
countries
 

7227
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:14,689
countries
in the UN are less than 10 million

7228
02:07:14,689 --> 02:07:14,699
in the UN are less than 10 million
 

7229
02:07:14,699 --> 02:07:16,310
in the UN are less than 10 million
people there's only 14 countries that

7230
02:07:16,310 --> 02:07:16,320
people there's only 14 countries that
 

7231
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:18,950
people there's only 14 countries that
are over 100 million people okay so most

7232
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:18,960
are over 100 million people okay so most
 

7233
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:20,570
are over 100 million people okay so most
countries are small countries is kind of

7234
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:20,580
countries are small countries is kind of
 

7235
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:22,250
countries are small countries is kind of
surprising to us because most people

7236
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:22,260
surprising to us because most people
 

7237
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:25,850
surprising to us because most people
live in big countries okay and uh so now

7238
02:07:25,850 --> 02:07:25,860
live in big countries okay and uh so now
 

7239
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:28,010
live in big countries okay and uh so now
you're like okay well I've built social

7240
02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:28,020
you're like okay well I've built social
 

7241
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:29,330
you're like okay well I've built social
networks that are bigger than that I've

7242
02:07:29,330 --> 02:07:29,340
networks that are bigger than that I've
 

7243
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:31,070
networks that are bigger than that I've
you have a following this bigger than a

7244
02:07:31,070 --> 02:07:31,080
you have a following this bigger than a
 

7245
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:32,209
you have a following this bigger than a
hundred thousand people you're following

7246
02:07:32,209 --> 02:07:32,219
hundred thousand people you're following
 

7247
02:07:32,219 --> 02:07:33,530
hundred thousand people you're following
that's bigger than you know a small

7248
02:07:33,530 --> 02:07:33,540
that's bigger than you know a small
 

7249
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:35,149
that's bigger than you know a small
country like cure body or what have you

7250
02:07:35,149 --> 02:07:35,159
country like cure body or what have you
 

7251
02:07:35,159 --> 02:07:38,030
country like cure body or what have you
right and uh okay so that that first

7252
02:07:38,030 --> 02:07:38,040
right and uh okay so that that first
 

7253
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:39,470
right and uh okay so that that first
change is feasibility you think of a

7254
02:07:39,470 --> 02:07:39,480
change is feasibility you think of a
 

7255
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:41,209
change is feasibility you think of a
country as this huge huge huge thing if

7256
02:07:41,209 --> 02:07:41,219
country as this huge huge huge thing if
 

7257
02:07:41,219 --> 02:07:42,589
country as this huge huge huge thing if
it's actually smaller than many many

7258
02:07:42,589 --> 02:07:42,599
it's actually smaller than many many
 

7259
02:07:42,599 --> 02:07:43,850
it's actually smaller than many many
countries are smaller than social

7260
02:07:43,850 --> 02:07:43,860
countries are smaller than social
 

7261
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:45,109
countries are smaller than social
networks that you've built okay number

7262
02:07:45,109 --> 02:07:45,119
networks that you've built okay number
 

7263
02:07:45,119 --> 02:07:47,750
networks that you've built okay number
one uh number two

7264
02:07:47,750 --> 02:07:47,760
one uh number two
 

7265
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:50,629
one uh number two
is the number of U.N listed countries

7266
02:07:50,629 --> 02:07:50,639
is the number of U.N listed countries
 

7267
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:52,490
is the number of U.N listed countries
um even though it's been flat-ish for

7268
02:07:52,490 --> 02:07:52,500
um even though it's been flat-ish for
 

7269
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:54,169
um even though it's been flat-ish for
the last 30 years with like you know a

7270
02:07:54,169 --> 02:07:54,179
the last 30 years with like you know a
 

7271
02:07:54,179 --> 02:07:56,030
the last 30 years with like you know a
few things like South Sudan and East

7272
02:07:56,030 --> 02:07:56,040
few things like South Sudan and East
 

7273
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,310
few things like South Sudan and East
Timor that that have come online there's

7274
02:07:58,310 --> 02:07:58,320
Timor that that have come online there's
 

7275
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,689
Timor that that have come online there's
a graph that I posted which shows that

7276
02:07:59,689 --> 02:07:59,699
a graph that I posted which shows that
 

7277
02:07:59,699 --> 02:08:01,550
a graph that I posted which shows that
it's increased by about from about 40 or

7278
02:08:01,550 --> 02:08:01,560
it's increased by about from about 40 or
 

7279
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:04,310
it's increased by about from about 40 or
50 something at the end of uh World War

7280
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:04,320
50 something at the end of uh World War
 

7281
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,270
50 something at the end of uh World War
II

7282
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:05,280
II
 

7283
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,609
II
um when the end was set up to 197 today

7284
02:08:07,609 --> 02:08:07,619
um when the end was set up to 197 today
 

7285
02:08:07,619 --> 02:08:08,750
um when the end was set up to 197 today
there's been like kind of a steady

7286
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:08,760
there's been like kind of a steady
 

7287
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:10,790
there's been like kind of a steady
increase in particular with all the

7288
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:10,800
increase in particular with all the
 

7289
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,229
increase in particular with all the
decolonization all the countries that

7290
02:08:12,229 --> 02:08:12,239
decolonization all the countries that
 

7291
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:13,669
decolonization all the countries that
got their independence first from the

7292
02:08:13,669 --> 02:08:13,679
got their independence first from the
 

7293
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:15,649
got their independence first from the
British Empire and then from the Soviet

7294
02:08:15,649 --> 02:08:15,659
British Empire and then from the Soviet
 

7295
02:08:15,659 --> 02:08:18,709
British Empire and then from the Soviet
Empire right that imperial breakup led

7296
02:08:18,709 --> 02:08:18,719
Empire right that imperial breakup led
 

7297
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:20,990
Empire right that imperial breakup led
to new countries okay and so the

7298
02:08:20,990 --> 02:08:21,000
to new countries okay and so the
 

7299
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,810
to new countries okay and so the
question is is that flat forever

7300
02:08:23,810 --> 02:08:23,820
question is is that flat forever
 

7301
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:25,629
question is is that flat forever
well the number of new currencies

7302
02:08:25,629 --> 02:08:25,639
well the number of new currencies
 

7303
02:08:25,639 --> 02:08:28,129
well the number of new currencies
similarly increased for a while roughly

7304
02:08:28,129 --> 02:08:28,139
similarly increased for a while roughly
 

7305
02:08:28,139 --> 02:08:30,169
similarly increased for a while roughly
one per country or thereabouts

7306
02:08:30,169 --> 02:08:30,179
one per country or thereabouts
 

7307
02:08:30,179 --> 02:08:31,669
one per country or thereabouts
and then it was flat for a while and

7308
02:08:31,669 --> 02:08:31,679
and then it was flat for a while and
 

7309
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:33,050
and then it was flat for a while and
then suddenly it's gone completely

7310
02:08:33,050 --> 02:08:33,060
then suddenly it's gone completely
 

7311
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:34,490
then suddenly it's gone completely
vertical

7312
02:08:34,490 --> 02:08:34,500
vertical
 

7313
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:35,990
vertical
that's an interesting graph right where

7314
02:08:35,990 --> 02:08:36,000
that's an interesting graph right where
 

7315
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,930
that's an interesting graph right where
it's like linear ish then it's flat and

7316
02:08:38,930 --> 02:08:38,940
it's like linear ish then it's flat and
 

7317
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:41,390
it's like linear ish then it's flat and
then it just goes like this now you can

7318
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:41,400
then it just goes like this now you can
 

7319
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:43,850
then it just goes like this now you can
Define you can you can argue where the

7320
02:08:43,850 --> 02:08:43,860
Define you can you can argue where the
 

7321
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:45,950
Define you can you can argue where the
boundary is for quite a new currency

7322
02:08:45,950 --> 02:08:45,960
boundary is for quite a new currency
 

7323
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:47,390
boundary is for quite a new currency
okay

7324
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:47,400
okay
 

7325
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:48,770
okay
um but I think Bitcoin certainly counts

7326
02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:48,780
um but I think Bitcoin certainly counts
 

7327
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:50,209
um but I think Bitcoin certainly counts
I think ethereum certainly counts in

7328
02:08:50,209 --> 02:08:50,219
I think ethereum certainly counts in
 

7329
02:08:50,219 --> 02:08:51,950
I think ethereum certainly counts in
terms of just its scale and adoption

7330
02:08:51,950 --> 02:08:51,960
terms of just its scale and adoption
 

7331
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:53,870
terms of just its scale and adoption
worldwide so at least you have two

7332
02:08:53,870 --> 02:08:53,880

and I think it will will again at some

7370
02:09:32,990 --> 02:09:33,000
and I think it will will again at some
 

7371
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,709
and I think it will will again at some
point so we know that you can have a

7372
02:09:36,709 --> 02:09:36,719
point so we know that you can have a
 

7373
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:38,270
point so we know that you can have a
currency out of nowhere that ranks with

the Fiat currencies of the world could
 

7377
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,970
the Fiat currencies of the world could
you have a country out of nowhere that

you have a country out of nowhere that
 

7379
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:42,890
you have a country out of nowhere that
ranks with the countries of the world so

7380
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:42,900
ranks with the countries of the world so
 

7381
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:45,169

they just basically you know go in
 

7447
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:50,870
they just basically you know go in
crowdfund lane together right and these

crowdfund lane together right and these
 

7449
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,550
crowdfund lane together right and these
are all networked together you know just

7450
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:52,560
are all networked together you know just
 

7451
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,410
are all networked together you know just
like the islands of Indonesia are

7452
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:54,420
like the islands of Indonesia are
 

7453
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:57,229
like the islands of Indonesia are
separated by ocean these are islands of

7454
02:10:57,229 --> 02:10:57,239
separated by ocean these are islands of
 

7455
02:10:57,239 --> 02:10:58,430
separated by ocean these are islands of
this network state that are separated by

7456
02:10:58,430 --> 02:10:58,440
this network state that are separated by
 

7457
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:00,169
this network state that are separated by
internet okay so it conceptualize

7458
02:11:00,169 --> 02:11:00,179
internet okay so it conceptualize
 

7459
02:11:00,179 --> 02:11:01,669
internet okay so it conceptualize
themselves as something and at the very

7460
02:11:01,669 --> 02:11:01,679
themselves as something and at the very
 

7461
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:03,470
themselves as something and at the very
top of the dashboard there's something

7462
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:03,480
top of the dashboard there's something
 

7463
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:05,149
top of the dashboard there's something
very important which is the population

7464
02:11:05,149 --> 02:11:05,159
very important which is the population
 

7465
02:11:05,159 --> 02:11:07,370
very important which is the population
annual income and real estate footprint

7466

annual income and real estate footprint
 

7467
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:09,649
annual income and real estate footprint
of this network shape so population we

7468
02:11:09,649 --> 02:11:09,659
of this network shape so population we
 

7469
02:11:09,659 --> 02:11:11,149
of this network shape so population we
already discussed you can build an

7470
02:11:11,149 --> 02:11:11,159
already discussed you can build an
 

7471
02:11:11,159 --> 02:11:12,950
already discussed you can build an
online social network we know you can

7472
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:12,960
online social network we know you can
 

7473
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:14,089
online social network we know you can
build something which has a population

7474
02:11:14,089 --> 02:11:14,099
build something which has a population
 

7475
02:11:14,099 --> 02:11:15,709
build something which has a population
that's bigger than these hundred

7476

02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:30,050
it is
um I don't exactly know the numbers on

7492
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:30,060
um I don't exactly know the numbers on
 

7493
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:32,149
um I don't exactly know the numbers on
foreign ownership in Estonia but let's

7494
02:11:32,149 --> 02:11:32,159
foreign ownership in Estonia but let's
 

7495
02:11:32,159 --> 02:11:34,370
foreign ownership in Estonia but let's
say to first order the million something

7496
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:34,380
say to first order the million something
 

7497
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:37,790
say to first order the million something
estonians own and could afford Estonia

7498
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:37,800
estonians own and could afford Estonia
 

7499
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:39,649
estonians own and could afford Estonia
okay a million people

7500
02:11:39,649 --> 02:11:39,659
okay a million people
 

7501
02:11:39,659 --> 02:11:41,570
okay a million people
could buy a territory that is the size

7502
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:41,580
could buy a territory that is the size
 

7503
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:43,370
could buy a territory that is the size
of Estonia right that's probably true to

7504
02:11:43,370 --> 02:11:43,380
of Estonia right that's probably true to
 

7505
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:44,629
of Estonia right that's probably true to
for sure there might be some overseas

7506
02:11:44,629 --> 02:11:44,639
for sure there might be some overseas
 

7507
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:45,709
for sure there might be some overseas
ownership but it's probably true okay

7508
02:11:45,709 --> 02:11:45,719
ownership but it's probably true okay
 

7509
02:11:45,719 --> 02:11:46,910
ownership but it's probably true okay
you probably find a country for which

7510
02:11:46,910 --> 02:11:46,920
you probably find a country for which
 

7511
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:49,129
you probably find a country for which
that's true what that means is

7512
02:11:49,129 --> 02:11:49,139
that's true what that means is
 

7513
02:11:49,139 --> 02:11:51,649
that's true what that means is
a million people digitally could buy

7514
02:11:51,649 --> 02:11:51,659
a million people digitally could buy
 

7515
02:11:51,659 --> 02:11:53,750
a million people digitally could buy
distributed territory that is probably

7516
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:53,760
distributed territory that is probably
 

7517
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:54,950
distributed territory that is probably
greater than or equal to the size of

7518
02:11:54,950 --> 02:11:54,960
greater than or equal to the size of
 

7519
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,750
greater than or equal to the size of
Estonia especially if they're buying

7520
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:56,760
Estonia especially if they're buying
 

7521
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:58,250
Estonia especially if they're buying
like desert territory or stuff like that

7522
02:11:58,250 --> 02:11:58,260
like desert territory or stuff like that
 

7523
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:00,290
like desert territory or stuff like that
which means now you have a digital

7524
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:00,300
which means now you have a digital
 

7525
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:02,330
which means now you have a digital
country that is ranking not just in

7526
02:12:02,330 --> 02:12:02,340
country that is ranking not just in
 

7527
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:03,649
country that is ranking not just in
people

7528
02:12:03,649 --> 02:12:03,659
people
 

7529
02:12:03,659 --> 02:12:06,410
people
not just in real estate footprint you

7530
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:06,420
not just in real estate footprint you
 

7531
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:08,330
not just in real estate footprint you
know so so it's also in real estate with

7532
02:12:08,330 --> 02:12:08,340
know so so it's also in real estate with
 

7533
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:10,070
know so so it's also in real estate with
the with the countries of the world so

7534
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:10,080
the with the countries of the world so
 

7535
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:12,050
the with the countries of the world so
you start ranking and you're bigger than

7536
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:12,060
you start ranking and you're bigger than
 

7537
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:14,030
you start ranking and you're bigger than
these unlisted countries in your

7538
02:12:14,030 --> 02:12:14,040
these unlisted countries in your
 

7539
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:15,589
these unlisted countries in your
population and your real estate and the

7540
02:12:15,589 --> 02:12:15,599
population and your real estate and the
 

7541
02:12:15,599 --> 02:12:18,050
population and your real estate and the
third is income okay you can prove on

7542
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:18,060
third is income okay you can prove on
 

7543
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:22,430
third is income okay you can prove on
chain that you have a income for the for

7544
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:22,440
chain that you have a income for the for
 

7545
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:23,870
chain that you have a income for the for
the digital population that is above a

7546
02:12:23,870 --> 02:12:23,880
the digital population that is above a
 

7547
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:26,030
the digital population that is above a
certain amount right this is what I call

7548
02:12:26,030 --> 02:12:26,040
certain amount right this is what I call
 

7549
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:27,830
certain amount right this is what I call
the census of the network State and it's

7550
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:27,840
the census of the network State and it's
 

7551
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,390
the census of the network State and it's
actually such a crucial component that I

7552
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:29,400
actually such a crucial component that I
 

7553
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,910
actually such a crucial component that I
have it in you know the essay uh the

7554
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:31,920
have it in you know the essay uh the
 

7555
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:33,830
have it in you know the essay uh the
Network's in a thousand words the post

7556
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:33,840
Network's in a thousand words the post
 

7557
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:34,910
Network's in a thousand words the post
office and census were actually

7558
02:12:34,910 --> 02:12:34,920
office and census were actually
 

7559
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:36,229
office and census were actually
important enough to be written into the

7560
02:12:36,229 --> 02:12:36,239
important enough to be written into the
 

7561
02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:38,209
important enough to be written into the
US Constitution okay

7562
02:12:38,209 --> 02:12:38,219
US Constitution okay
 

7563
02:12:38,219 --> 02:12:39,709
US Constitution okay
um partly because it was like for

7564
02:12:39,709 --> 02:12:39,719
um partly because it was like for
 

7565
02:12:39,719 --> 02:12:41,390
um partly because it was like for
apportionment of Representatives partly

7566
02:12:41,390 --> 02:12:41,400
apportionment of Representatives partly
 

7567
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:43,490
apportionment of Representatives partly
because there's a feedback mechanism and

7568
02:12:43,490 --> 02:12:43,500
because there's a feedback mechanism and
 

7569
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:45,290
because there's a feedback mechanism and
so that census was done every 10 years

7570
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:45,300
so that census was done every 10 years
 

7571
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:47,089
so that census was done every 10 years
and it's provided a crucial snapshot of

7572
02:12:47,089 --> 02:12:47,099
and it's provided a crucial snapshot of
 

7573
02:12:47,099 --> 02:12:48,410
and it's provided a crucial snapshot of
the US for the last several hundred

7574
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:48,420
the US for the last several hundred
 

7575
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:51,890
the US for the last several hundred
years okay now here this this census of

7576
02:12:51,890 --> 02:12:51,900
years okay now here this this census of
 

7577
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:54,530
years okay now here this this census of
a digital State could be done every 10

7578
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:54,540
a digital State could be done every 10
 

7579
02:12:54,540 --> 02:12:57,290
a digital State could be done every 10
seconds okay conducting it is actually

7580
02:12:57,290 --> 02:12:57,300
seconds okay conducting it is actually
 

7581
02:12:57,300 --> 02:12:58,550
seconds okay conducting it is actually
not the hard part you know the hard part

7582
02:12:58,550 --> 02:12:58,560
not the hard part you know the hard part

digital State on the leaderboard of the
 

7607
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:25,189
digital State on the leaderboard of the
the Fiat States okay and so it means

7608
02:13:25,189 --> 02:13:25,199
the Fiat States okay and so it means
 

7609
02:13:25,199 --> 02:13:26,450
the Fiat States okay and so it means
that people will start to at first

7610

people are going to start poking and be
 

7617
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:33,890
people are going to start poking and be
like Is that real prove that it's real

um these proof of real estate Etc
 

7641
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:56,030
um these proof of real estate Etc
assertions on chain okay and there's

7642
02:13:56,030 --> 02:13:56,040
assertions on chain okay and there's
 

7643
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:57,770
assertions on chain okay and there's
people who are writing to the to the

signing their assertions now of course

7648
02:14:01,729 --> 02:14:01,739
signing their assertions now of course
 

7649
02:14:01,739 --> 02:14:03,169
signing their assertions now of course
simply just putting something on chain

7650
02:14:03,169 --> 02:14:03,179
simply just putting something on chain
 

7651
02:14:03,179 --> 02:14:05,089
simply just putting something on chain
doesn't make it true it just says you

7652
02:14:05,089 --> 02:14:05,099
doesn't make it true it just says you
 

7653
02:14:05,099 --> 02:14:06,950
doesn't make it true it just says you
can prove not that the what is written

7654
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:06,960
can prove not that the what is written
 

7655
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:08,330
can prove not that the what is written
on chain is true but that the metadata

7656
02:14:08,330 --> 02:14:08,340
on chain is true but that the metadata
 

7657
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:11,390
on chain is true but that the metadata
is true you can show who wrote it the

7658
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:11,400
is true you can show who wrote it the
 

7659
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:13,370
is true you can show who wrote it the
other digital signature what they wrote

7660
02:14:13,370 --> 02:14:13,380
other digital signature what they wrote
 

7661
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:14,689
other digital signature what they wrote
their hash and when they wrote their

7662
02:14:14,689 --> 02:14:14,699
their hash and when they wrote their
 

7663
02:14:14,699 --> 02:14:16,430
their hash and when they wrote their
timestamp so you can establish those

7664
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:16,440
timestamp so you can establish those
 

7665
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:18,589
timestamp so you can establish those
things in metadata of who what and when

7666
02:14:18,589 --> 02:14:18,599
things in metadata of who what and when
 

7667
02:14:18,599 --> 02:14:19,790
things in metadata of who what and when
was written Who's the who in that

7668
02:14:19,790 --> 02:14:19,800
was written Who's the who in that
 

7669
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:21,950
was written Who's the who in that
picture so for example how do you know

7670
02:14:21,950 --> 02:14:21,960
picture so for example how do you know
 

7671
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:23,510
picture so for example how do you know
it's a one human

7672
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:23,520
it's a one human
 

7673
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:25,189
it's a one human
great question so let's say you've

7674
02:14:25,189 --> 02:14:25,199
great question so let's say you've
 

7675
02:14:25,199 --> 02:14:26,089
great question so let's say you've
bought a bunch of your pieces of

7676
02:14:26,089 --> 02:14:26,099
bought a bunch of your pieces of
 

7677
02:14:26,099 --> 02:14:28,250
bought a bunch of your pieces of

vendor you you buy it from it could be a

7712
02:15:01,550 --> 02:15:01,560
vendor you you buy it from it could be a
 

7713
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:02,629
vendor you you buy it from it could be a
company it could obviously be an

7714
02:15:02,629 --> 02:15:02,639
company it could obviously be an
 

7715
02:15:02,639 --> 02:15:04,490
company it could obviously be an
individual right and so you have a bunch

7716
02:15:04,490 --> 02:15:04,500
individual right and so you have a bunch
 

7717
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:05,930
individual right and so you have a bunch
of these assertions you let's say

7718
02:15:05,930 --> 02:15:05,940
of these assertions you let's say
 

7719
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:08,689
of these assertions you let's say
there's 47 different real estate vendors

7720

there's 47 different real estate vendors
 

7721
02:15:08,699 --> 02:15:10,310
there's 47 different real estate vendors
I know vendors in atypical term there

7722
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:10,320
I know vendors in atypical term there
 

7723
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:12,169
I know vendors in atypical term there
but just bear with me right 47 different

7724
02:15:12,169 --> 02:15:12,179
but just bear with me right 47 different
 

7725
02:15:12,179 --> 02:15:13,790
but just bear with me right 47 different
real estate

02:15:16,129 --> 02:15:16,139
um sellers that you've bought all of
 

7729
02:15:16,139 --> 02:15:17,689
um sellers that you've bought all of
your territory from each of them put

7730
02:15:17,689 --> 02:15:17,699
your territory from each of them put
 

7731
02:15:17,699 --> 02:15:19,010
your territory from each of them put
digital signatures that are asserting

digital signatures that are asserting
that a certain amount of real estate was

7734
02:15:20,750 --> 02:15:20,760
that a certain amount of real estate was
 

7735
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:22,490
that a certain amount of real estate was
bought and at square meters its location

7736
02:15:22,490 --> 02:15:22,500
bought and at square meters its location
 

7737
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:24,290
bought and at square meters its location
or whatever unless they want to prove

7738
02:15:24,290 --> 02:15:24,300
or whatever unless they want to prove
 

7739
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:26,569
or whatever unless they want to prove
the sum of all that is now your real

7740
02:15:26,569 --> 02:15:26,579
the sum of all that is now your real
 

7741
02:15:26,579 --> 02:15:28,430
the sum of all that is now your real
estate footprint okay and now the

7742
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:28,440
estate footprint okay and now the
 

7743
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:31,010
estate footprint okay and now the
question is was that real well because

7744
02:15:31,010 --> 02:15:31,020
question is was that real well because
 

7745
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:33,950
question is was that real well because
they signed what they put on chain you

7746
02:15:33,950 --> 02:15:33,960
they signed what they put on chain you
 

7747
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:35,569
they signed what they put on chain you
can do things like you can audit let's

7748
02:15:35,569 --> 02:15:35,579
can do things like you can audit let's
 

7749
02:15:35,579 --> 02:15:37,430
can do things like you can audit let's
say Blackstone is signed

7750
02:15:37,430 --> 02:15:37,440
say Blackstone is signed
 

7751
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:40,010
say Blackstone is signed
500 000 properties and they've sold them

7752
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:40,020
500 000 properties and they've sold them
 

7753
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:41,149
500 000 properties and they've sold them
and put them on chain and I'm not

7754
02:15:41,149 --> 02:15:41,159
and put them on chain and I'm not
 

7755
02:15:41,159 --> 02:15:43,790
and put them on chain and I'm not
talking about 2022 or 2023 but 2030

7756
02:15:43,790 --> 02:15:43,800
talking about 2022 or 2023 but 2030
 

7757
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:45,350
talking about 2022 or 2023 but 2030
right it'll be a few years out but

7758
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:45,360
right it'll be a few years out but
 

7759
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,189
right it'll be a few years out but
people are doing this type of stuff

7760
02:15:46,189 --> 02:15:46,199
people are doing this type of stuff
 

7761
02:15:46,199 --> 02:15:47,569
people are doing this type of stuff
they're putting this up on you so you

7762
02:15:47,569 --> 02:15:47,579
they're putting this up on you so you
 

7763
02:15:47,579 --> 02:15:49,010
they're putting this up on you so you
get that on chain receipt they've got

7764
02:15:49,010 --> 02:15:49,020
get that on chain receipt they've got
 

7765
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:51,530
get that on chain receipt they've got
500 000 of these what you can do is uh

7766
02:15:51,530 --> 02:15:51,540
500 000 of these what you can do is uh
 

7767
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:54,470
500 000 of these what you can do is uh
just sampling okay you pick a subset n

7768
02:15:54,470 --> 02:15:54,480
just sampling okay you pick a subset n
 

7769
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:55,430
just sampling okay you pick a subset n
of them

7770
02:15:55,430 --> 02:15:55,440
of them
 

7771
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:56,990
of them
let's say 500 properties around the

7772
02:15:56,990 --> 02:15:57,000
let's say 500 properties around the
 

7773
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,450
let's say 500 properties around the
world you go there you actually go and

7774
02:15:59,450 --> 02:15:59,460
world you go there you actually go and
 

7775
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:01,669
world you go there you actually go and
independently look at what the square

7776
02:16:01,669 --> 02:16:01,679
independently look at what the square
 

7777
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:04,790
independently look at what the square
footprint is and then from that you can

7778
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:04,800
footprint is and then from that you can
 

7779
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:07,129
footprint is and then from that you can
see what was the actual your measurement

7780
02:16:07,129 --> 02:16:07,139
see what was the actual your measurement
 

7781
02:16:07,139 --> 02:16:09,709
see what was the actual your measurement
versus their reported and then you can

7782
02:16:09,709 --> 02:16:09,719
versus their reported and then you can
 

7783
02:16:09,719 --> 02:16:11,810
versus their reported and then you can
via Cisco inference extrapolate that if

7784
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:11,820
via Cisco inference extrapolate that if
 

7785
02:16:11,820 --> 02:16:13,550
via Cisco inference extrapolate that if
they were randomly selected to the rest

7786
02:16:13,550 --> 02:16:13,560
they were randomly selected to the rest
 

7787
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:15,050
they were randomly selected to the rest
of the properties and get a reliability

7788
02:16:15,050 --> 02:16:15,060
of the properties and get a reliability
 

7789
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:17,270
of the properties and get a reliability
score for blackstone's reporting of its

7790
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:17,280
score for blackstone's reporting of its
 

7791
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,010
score for blackstone's reporting of its
real estate square footage who does the

7792
02:16:19,010 --> 02:16:19,020
real estate square footage who does the
 

7793
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:20,390
real estate square footage who does the
so that's the auditing stuff that's the

7794
02:16:20,390 --> 02:16:20,400
so that's the auditing stuff that's the
 

7795
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:22,750
so that's the auditing stuff that's the
auditing step so the the crypto Oracle

7796
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:22,760
auditing step so the the crypto Oracle
 

7797
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:27,470
auditing step so the the crypto Oracle
is the auditable on chain uh what did

7798
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:27,480
is the auditable on chain uh what did
 

7799
02:16:27,480 --> 02:16:29,149
is the auditable on chain uh what did
you say assertions that's right yeah

7800
02:16:29,149 --> 02:16:29,159
you say assertions that's right yeah
 

7801
02:16:29,159 --> 02:16:31,189
you say assertions that's right yeah
about like who bought stuff with who I

7802
02:16:31,189 --> 02:16:31,199
about like who bought stuff with who I
 

7803
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:32,389
about like who bought stuff with who I
still have to get to the proof of human

7804
02:16:32,389 --> 02:16:32,399
still have to get to the proof of human
 

7805
02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:35,110
still have to get to the proof of human
but auditing there's a bunch of people

7806
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:35,120
but auditing there's a bunch of people
 

7807
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:37,370
but auditing there's a bunch of people
randomly checking that you're not full

7808
02:16:37,370 --> 02:16:37,380
randomly checking that you're not full
 

7809
02:16:37,380 --> 02:16:39,530
randomly checking that you're not full
of [\h__\h] that's right so who is in charge

7810
02:16:39,530 --> 02:16:39,540
of [\h__\h] that's right so who is in charge
 

7811
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:41,270
of [\h__\h] that's right so who is in charge
of the auditing though so it could be a

7812
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:41,280
of the auditing though so it could be a
 

7813
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:44,810
of the auditing though so it could be a
big four like a PWC and uh basically the

7814
02:16:44,810 --> 02:16:44,820
big four like a PWC and uh basically the
 

7815
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:47,209
big four like a PWC and uh basically the
the accountants that do corporate

7816
02:16:47,209 --> 02:16:47,219
the accountants that do corporate
 

7817
02:16:47,219 --> 02:16:49,969
the accountants that do corporate
balance sheet and cash flow and and

7818
02:16:49,969 --> 02:16:49,979
balance sheet and cash flow and and
 

7819
02:16:49,979 --> 02:16:51,709
balance sheet and cash flow and and
keeps them in check

7820
02:16:51,709 --> 02:16:51,719
keeps them in check
 

7821
02:16:51,719 --> 02:16:53,810
keeps them in check
corruption I'm just imagining a world

7822
02:16:53,810 --> 02:16:53,820
corruption I'm just imagining a world
 

7823
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:55,669
corruption I'm just imagining a world
full of network States yeah it's a good

7824
02:16:55,669 --> 02:16:55,679
full of network States yeah it's a good
 

7825
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:57,349
full of network States yeah it's a good
question so you know at a certain point

7826
02:16:57,349 --> 02:16:57,359
question so you know at a certain point
 

7827
02:16:57,359 --> 02:16:58,849
question so you know at a certain point
you get to who watches the Watchers

7828
02:16:58,849 --> 02:16:58,859
you get to who watches the Watchers
 

7829
02:16:58,859 --> 02:17:02,150
you get to who watches the Watchers
right yeah and oh well the government is

7830
02:17:02,150 --> 02:17:02,160
right yeah and oh well the government is
 

7831
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:03,770
right yeah and oh well the government is
meant to keep the accountants

7832
02:17:03,770 --> 02:17:03,780
meant to keep the accountants
 

7833
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:05,389
meant to keep the accountants
accountable and you know Arthur Anderson

7834
02:17:05,389 --> 02:17:05,399
accountable and you know Arthur Anderson
 

7835
02:17:05,399 --> 02:17:07,009
accountable and you know Arthur Anderson
actually did have a whole flame out in

7836
02:17:07,009 --> 02:17:07,019
actually did have a whole flame out in
 

7837
02:17:07,019 --> 02:17:08,209
actually did have a whole flame out in
you know the

7838
02:17:08,209 --> 02:17:08,219
you know the
 

7839
02:17:08,219 --> 02:17:10,310
you know the
um around the time the Enron thing

7840
02:17:10,310 --> 02:17:10,320
um around the time the Enron thing
 

7841
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:12,049
um around the time the Enron thing
um so it is possible that there's

7842
02:17:12,049 --> 02:17:12,059
um so it is possible that there's
 

7843
02:17:12,059 --> 02:17:13,490
um so it is possible that there's
corrupt accountants or bad accountants

7844
02:17:13,490 --> 02:17:13,500
corrupt accountants or bad accountants
 

7845
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,410
corrupt accountants or bad accountants
or what have you but of course the

7846
02:17:15,410 --> 02:17:15,420
or what have you but of course the
 

7847
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:17,750
or what have you but of course the
government itself is corrupt in many

7848
02:17:17,750 --> 02:17:17,760
government itself is corrupt in many
 

7849
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:19,370
government itself is corrupt in many
ways and prints all this money and

7850
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:19,380
ways and prints all this money and
 

7851
02:17:19,380 --> 02:17:21,110
ways and prints all this money and
seizes all these assets and surveils

7852
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:21,120
seizes all these assets and surveils
 

7853
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,290
seizes all these assets and surveils
everybody and so on and so forth so uh

7854
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:24,300
everybody and so on and so forth so uh
 

7855
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:25,849
everybody and so on and so forth so uh
you know the answer to your question is

7856
02:17:25,849 --> 02:17:25,859
you know the answer to your question is
 

7857
02:17:25,859 --> 02:17:27,230
you know the answer to your question is
going to be

7858
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:27,240
going to be
 

7859
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:30,349
going to be
um probably exit in the sense that if

7860
02:17:30,349 --> 02:17:30,359
um probably exit in the sense that if
 

7861
02:17:30,359 --> 02:17:31,669
um probably exit in the sense that if
those accountants

7862
02:17:31,669 --> 02:17:31,679
those accountants
 

7863
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:33,290
those accountants
they are themselves going to digitally

7864
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:33,300
they are themselves going to digitally
 

7865
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:35,509
they are themselves going to digitally
sign a report and put it on chain okay

7866
02:17:35,509 --> 02:17:35,519
sign a report and put it on chain okay
 

7867
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:38,830
sign a report and put it on chain okay
so they're going to say we believe that

7868
02:17:38,830 --> 02:17:38,840
so they're going to say we believe that
 

7869
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:41,690
so they're going to say we believe that
x y and Z's

7870
02:17:41,690 --> 02:17:41,700
x y and Z's
 

7871
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:43,490
x y and Z's
um you know reports are on chain were

7872
02:17:43,490 --> 02:17:43,500
um you know reports are on chain were
 

7873
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:45,410
um you know reports are on chain were
this reliable and here's our study if

7874
02:17:45,410 --> 02:17:45,420
this reliable and here's our study if
 

7875
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:48,349
this reliable and here's our study if
they falsify that well if somebody finds

7876
02:17:48,349 --> 02:17:48,359
they falsify that well if somebody finds
 

7877
02:17:48,359 --> 02:17:50,270
they falsify that well if somebody finds
that eventually then that person is down

7878
02:17:50,270 --> 02:17:50,280
that eventually then that person is down
 

7879
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:51,110
that eventually then that person is down
weight and then you have to go to

7880
02:17:51,110 --> 02:17:51,120
weight and then you have to go to
 

7881
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:53,030
weight and then you have to go to
another accountant right is there ways

7882
02:17:53,030 --> 02:17:53,040
another accountant right is there ways
 

7883
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:55,969
another accountant right is there ways
to mess with this I mean I just

7884
02:17:55,969 --> 02:17:55,979
to mess with this I mean I just
 

7885
02:17:55,979 --> 02:17:58,730
to mess with this I mean I just
let me breathe in and out as I mentioned

7886
02:17:58,730 --> 02:17:58,740
let me breathe in and out as I mentioned
 

7887
02:17:58,740 --> 02:18:00,650
let me breathe in and out as I mentioned
some of the heaviest [\h__\h] I've ever read

7888
02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:00,660
some of the heaviest [\h__\h] I've ever read
 

7889
02:18:00,660 --> 02:18:03,469
some of the heaviest [\h__\h] I've ever read
uh so because I visited Ukraine I've

7890
02:18:03,469 --> 02:18:03,479
uh so because I visited Ukraine I've
 

7891
02:18:03,479 --> 02:18:07,450
uh so because I visited Ukraine I've
read read famine by an Applebaum

7892
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:07,460
read read famine by an Applebaum
 

7893
02:18:07,460 --> 02:18:10,549
read read famine by an Applebaum
bloodlands yep and it's just a lot of

02:18:10,549 --> 02:18:10,559
bloodlands yep and it's just a lot of
 

7895
02:18:10,559 --> 02:18:13,610
bloodlands yep and it's just a lot of
coverage of the senses I mean there's a

7896
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:13,620
coverage of the senses I mean there's a
 

7897
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:14,929
coverage of the senses I mean there's a
lot of coverage of a lot of things but

7898
02:18:14,929 --> 02:18:14,939
lot of coverage of a lot of things but
 

7899
02:18:14,939 --> 02:18:16,750
lot of coverage of a lot of things but

7900
02:18:16,750 --> 02:18:16,760
in Ukraine in the
 

7901
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:19,669
in Ukraine in the
1930s uh Stalin messed a lot with the

7902
02:18:19,669 --> 02:18:19,679
1930s uh Stalin messed a lot with the
 

7903
02:18:19,679 --> 02:18:21,889
1930s uh Stalin messed a lot with the
senses to hide the fact that

7904
02:18:21,889 --> 02:18:21,899
senses to hide the fact that
 

7905
02:18:21,899 --> 02:18:24,889
senses to hide the fact that
sort of a lot of people died from

7906
02:18:24,889 --> 02:18:24,899
sort of a lot of people died from
 

7907
02:18:24,899 --> 02:18:26,209
sort of a lot of people died from
starvation they did that with the

7908
02:18:26,209 --> 02:18:26,219
starvation they did that with the
 

7909
02:18:26,219 --> 02:18:28,549
starvation they did that with the
cooperation of Arthur g salzburger's New

York Times company Like Walter Durante

7912
02:18:30,469 --> 02:18:30,479
York Times company Like Walter Durante
 

7913
02:18:30,479 --> 02:18:32,089
York Times company Like Walter Durante
falsified all those reports there's

7914
02:18:32,089 --> 02:18:32,099
falsified all those reports there's
 

7915
02:18:32,099 --> 02:18:34,129
falsified all those reports there's
several parties involved is there can

7916
02:18:34,129 --> 02:18:34,139
several parties involved is there can
 

7917
02:18:34,139 --> 02:18:36,110
several parties involved is there can
there be several parties involved in

7918
02:18:36,110 --> 02:18:36,120
there be several parties involved in
 

7919
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:40,190
there be several parties involved in
this case that manipulate the truth as

7920
02:18:40,190 --> 02:18:40,200
this case that manipulate the truth as
 

7921
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:43,549
this case that manipulate the truth as
as it is represented by the crypto

7922
02:18:43,549 --> 02:18:43,559
as it is represented by the crypto
 

7923
02:18:43,559 --> 02:18:46,370
as it is represented by the crypto
Oracle And as it is checked by the

7924
02:18:46,370 --> 02:18:46,380
Oracle And as it is checked by the
 

7925
02:18:46,380 --> 02:18:48,290
Oracle And as it is checked by the
auditing mechanism it is possible but

7926
02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:48,300
auditing mechanism it is possible but
 

7927
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:49,790
auditing mechanism it is possible but
the more parties are involved in

7928
02:18:49,790 --> 02:18:49,800
the more parties are involved in
 

7929
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:51,469
the more parties are involved in
falsifying something the more defections

7930
02:18:51,469 --> 02:18:51,479
falsifying something the more defections
 

7931
02:18:51,479 --> 02:18:53,330
falsifying something the more defections
there are so that's why you basically

7932
02:18:53,330 --> 02:18:53,340
there are so that's why you basically
 

7933
02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:55,370
there are so that's why you basically
have you know

7934
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:55,380
have you know
 

7935
02:18:55,380 --> 02:18:57,530
have you know
um another level of auditing you know

7936
02:18:57,530 --> 02:18:57,540
um another level of auditing you know
 

7937
02:18:57,540 --> 02:18:58,969
um another level of auditing you know
it's fundamentally the answer right and

7938
02:18:58,969 --> 02:18:58,979
it's fundamentally the answer right and
 

7939
02:18:58,979 --> 02:19:00,650
it's fundamentally the answer right and
really I think what it comes back to is

7940
02:19:00,650 --> 02:19:00,660
really I think what it comes back to is
 

7941
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:03,469
really I think what it comes back to is
if you're showing your work right this

7942
02:19:03,469 --> 02:19:03,479
if you're showing your work right this
 

7943
02:19:03,479 --> 02:19:04,849
if you're showing your work right this
is the difference between crypto

7944
02:19:04,849 --> 02:19:04,859
is the difference between crypto
 

7945
02:19:04,859 --> 02:19:06,410
is the difference between crypto
economics and Fiat economics you know

7946
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:06,420
economics and Fiat economics you know
 

7947
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:08,030
economics and Fiat economics you know
the the Bitcoin blockchain anybody can

7948
02:19:08,030 --> 02:19:08,040
the the Bitcoin blockchain anybody can
 

7949
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,950
the the Bitcoin blockchain anybody can
download it and run verification on it

7950
02:19:09,950 --> 02:19:09,960
download it and run verification on it
 

7951
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:12,650
download it and run verification on it
okay this is different than government

7952
02:19:12,650 --> 02:19:12,660
okay this is different than government
 

7953
02:19:12,660 --> 02:19:14,089
okay this is different than government
inflation stats which people don't

7954
02:19:14,089 --> 02:19:14,099
inflation stats which people don't
 

7955
02:19:14,099 --> 02:19:16,009
inflation stats which people don't
believe right because the process is

7956
02:19:16,009 --> 02:19:16,019
believe right because the process is
 

7957
02:19:16,019 --> 02:19:19,009
believe right because the process is
just you know it is true that CPI

7958
02:19:19,009 --> 02:19:19,019
just you know it is true that CPI
 

7959
02:19:19,019 --> 02:19:20,990
just you know it is true that CPI
methodology is published and so on but

7960
02:19:20,990 --> 02:19:21,000
methodology is published and so on but
 

7961
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,270
methodology is published and so on but
it is not something which people feel

7962
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:23,280
it is not something which people feel
 

7963
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:25,250
it is not something which people feel
reflects their actual basket of goods

7964
02:19:25,250 --> 02:19:25,260
reflects their actual basket of goods
 

7965
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:28,250
reflects their actual basket of goods
right and so the independent

7966
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:28,260
right and so the independent
 

7967
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:31,129
right and so the independent
verifiability is really the core of what

7968
02:19:31,129 --> 02:19:31,139
verifiability is really the core of what
 

7969
02:19:31,139 --> 02:19:33,530
verifiability is really the core of what
true audibility is and so then to your

7970
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:33,540
true audibility is and so then to your
 

7971
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:35,629
true audibility is and so then to your
question it's hard for some group to be

7972
02:19:35,629 --> 02:19:35,639
question it's hard for some group to be
 

7973
02:19:35,639 --> 02:19:36,889
question it's hard for some group to be
able to collude because the blockchain

7974
02:19:36,889 --> 02:19:36,899
able to collude because the blockchain
 

7975
02:19:36,899 --> 02:19:38,089
able to collude because the blockchain
is public and everything they've written

7976
02:19:38,089 --> 02:19:38,099
is public and everything they've written
 

7977
02:19:38,099 --> 02:19:40,310
is public and everything they've written
to it is public and so if there's an

7978
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:40,320
to it is public and so if there's an
 

7979
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:42,230
to it is public and so if there's an
error it's easier in some ways to tell

7980
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:42,240
error it's easier in some ways to tell
 

7981
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:44,570
error it's easier in some ways to tell
the truth than to lie because the truth

7982
02:19:44,570 --> 02:19:44,580
the truth than to lie because the truth
 

7983
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:46,370
the truth than to lie because the truth
is just naturally consistent across the

7984
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:46,380
is just naturally consistent across the
 

7985
02:19:46,380 --> 02:19:48,770
is just naturally consistent across the
world whereas lies can be found out even

7986
02:19:48,770 --> 02:19:48,780
world whereas lies can be found out even
 

7987
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:50,389
world whereas lies can be found out even
you know ciscal Tesla you know benford's

7988
02:19:50,389 --> 02:19:50,399
you know ciscal Tesla you know benford's
 

7989
02:19:50,399 --> 02:19:51,250
you know ciscal Tesla you know benford's
law

7990
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:51,260
law
 

7991
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:54,050
law
uh yes right it's something where the

7992
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:54,060
uh yes right it's something where the
 

7993
02:19:54,060 --> 02:19:56,450
uh yes right it's something where the
digits in like a real

7994
02:19:56,450 --> 02:19:56,460
digits in like a real
 

7995
02:19:56,460 --> 02:19:58,250
digits in like a real
um if you take the last digit or the

7996
02:19:58,250 --> 02:19:58,260
um if you take the last digit or the
 

7997
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:00,230
um if you take the last digit or the
first last year the first digit I think

7998
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:00,240
first last year the first digit I think
 

7999
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:01,429
first last year the first digit I think
I think it's the first first digit right

8000
02:20:01,429 --> 02:20:01,439
I think it's the first first digit right
 

8001
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:04,010
I think it's the first first digit right
so you take the first digit in

8002
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:04,020
so you take the first digit in
 

8003
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:05,450
so you take the first digit in
um an actual financial statement you

8004
02:20:05,450 --> 02:20:05,460
um an actual financial statement you
 

8005
02:20:05,460 --> 02:20:07,070
um an actual financial statement you
look at the distribution

8006
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:07,080
look at the distribution
 

8007
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:08,990
look at the distribution
of like how many ones and how many twos

8008
02:20:08,990 --> 02:20:09,000
of like how many ones and how many twos
 

8009
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,450
of like how many ones and how many twos
how many threes the percentages

8010
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:11,460
how many threes the percentages
 

8011
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:13,910
how many threes the percentages
um it has actually a you you'd guess it

8012
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:13,920
um it has actually a you you'd guess it
 

8013
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:15,889
um it has actually a you you'd guess it
might be oh each one will be equally

8014
02:20:15,889 --> 02:20:15,899
might be oh each one will be equally
 

8015
02:20:15,899 --> 02:20:17,750
might be oh each one will be equally
random it'd be ten percent it's not like

8016
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:17,760
random it'd be ten percent it's not like
 

8017
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:19,730
random it'd be ten percent it's not like
that actually uh there's a certain

8018
02:20:19,730 --> 02:20:19,740
that actually uh there's a certain
 

8019
02:20:19,740 --> 02:20:22,790
that actually uh there's a certain
distribution that it has and fake data

8020
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:22,800
distribution that it has and fake data
 

8021
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:24,710
distribution that it has and fake data
um doesn't look like that uh but real

8022
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:24,720
um doesn't look like that uh but real
 

8023
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:27,050
um doesn't look like that uh but real
data does that's weird it's interesting

8024
02:20:27,050 --> 02:20:27,060
data does that's weird it's interesting
 

8025
02:20:27,060 --> 02:20:28,910
data does that's weird it's interesting
right bedford's law also called the

8026
02:20:28,910 --> 02:20:28,920
right bedford's law also called the
 

8027
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:30,770
right bedford's law also called the
first digit law states that the leading

8028
02:20:30,770 --> 02:20:30,780
first digit law states that the leading
 

8029
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:33,770
first digit law states that the leading
digits in a collection of data sets are

8030
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:33,780
digits in a collection of data sets are
 

8031
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:36,110
digits in a collection of data sets are
probably going to be small

8032
02:20:36,110 --> 02:20:36,120
probably going to be small
 

8033
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:39,710
probably going to be small
for example most numbers in a set about

8034
02:20:39,710 --> 02:20:39,720
for example most numbers in a set about
 

8035
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:42,530
for example most numbers in a set about
30 will have a leading digit of one yeah

8036
02:20:42,530 --> 02:20:42,540
30 will have a leading digit of one yeah
 

8037
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:44,030
30 will have a leading digit of one yeah
so that's a great example of what we're

8038
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:44,040
so that's a great example of what we're
 

8039
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:45,290
so that's a great example of what we're
talking about earlier the observational

8040
02:20:45,290 --> 02:20:45,300
talking about earlier the observational
 

8041
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:47,750
talking about earlier the observational
leading to the theory oh there's a

8042
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:47,760
leading to the theory oh there's a
 

8043
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:49,429
leading to the theory oh there's a
benfer's law of controversy I'm looking

8044
02:20:49,429 --> 02:20:49,439
benfer's law of controversy I'm looking
 

8045
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:51,050
benfer's law of controversy I'm looking
that up

8046
02:20:51,050 --> 02:20:51,060
that up
 

8047
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:53,690
that up
but for his long controversy bedford's

8048
02:20:53,690 --> 02:20:53,700
but for his long controversy bedford's
 

8049
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,610
but for his long controversy bedford's
law of controversy is an adage from the

8050
02:20:55,610 --> 02:20:55,620
law of controversy is an adage from the
 

8051
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:59,150
law of controversy is an adage from the
1980 novel Timescape stating passion is

8052
02:20:59,150 --> 02:20:59,160
1980 novel Timescape stating passion is
 

8053
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,889
1980 novel Timescape stating passion is
inversely proportional to the amount of

8054
02:21:00,889 --> 02:21:00,899
inversely proportional to the amount of
 

8055
02:21:00,899 --> 02:21:02,929
inversely proportional to the amount of
real information available

real information available
 

8057
02:21:02,939 --> 02:21:05,030
real information available
the adage was quoted in an international

02:21:05,030 --> 02:21:05,040
the adage was quoted in an international
 

8059
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:07,250

Social such can I just say how much I

02:21:08,990 --> 02:21:09,000
Social such can I just say how much I
 

8063
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,270
Social such can I just say how much I
love Wikipedia I have the founder

8064
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:11,280
love Wikipedia I have the founder

Wikipedia coming on this very podcast

8066
02:21:13,370 --> 02:21:13,380
Wikipedia coming on this very podcast
 

8067
02:21:13,380 --> 02:21:16,790
Wikipedia coming on this very podcast
very soon and uh I think the world is a

8068
02:21:16,790 --> 02:21:16,800
very soon and uh I think the world is a
 

8069
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:18,530
very soon and uh I think the world is a
better place because Wikipedia exists

8070
02:21:18,530 --> 02:21:18,540
better place because Wikipedia exists
 

8071
02:21:18,540 --> 02:21:20,450
better place because Wikipedia exists
one of the things you wanted to come on

8072
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:20,460
one of the things you wanted to come on
 

8073
02:21:20,460 --> 02:21:24,349
one of the things you wanted to come on
and talk about is the ways that he

8074
02:21:24,349 --> 02:21:24,359
and talk about is the ways that he
 

8075
02:21:24,359 --> 02:21:25,849
and talk about is the ways that he
believes that Wikipedia is going wrong

8076
02:21:25,849 --> 02:21:25,859
believes that Wikipedia is going wrong
 

8077
02:21:25,859 --> 02:21:28,010
believes that Wikipedia is going wrong
so in technical truth it's great

8078
02:21:28,010 --> 02:21:28,020
so in technical truth it's great
 

8079
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:29,750
so in technical truth it's great
remember things I remember I think

8080
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:29,760
remember things I remember I think
 

8081
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:31,010
remember things I remember I think
earlier on like technical truths versus

8082
02:21:31,010 --> 02:21:31,020
earlier on like technical truths versus
 

8083
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:32,270
earlier on like technical truths versus
political truths and Technical truths

8084
02:21:32,270 --> 02:21:32,280
political truths and Technical truths
 

8085
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:33,950
political truths and Technical truths
it's great on political truths it's like

8086
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:33,960
it's great on political truths it's like
 

8087
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:35,809
it's great on political truths it's like
a defamation engine

8088
02:21:35,809 --> 02:21:35,819
a defamation engine
 

8089
02:21:35,819 --> 02:21:37,670
a defamation engine
um just as one example okay this is

8090
02:21:37,670 --> 02:21:37,680
um just as one example okay this is
 

8091
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:38,750
um just as one example okay this is
something that you know I was gonna

8092

nobody detected it it said that I was
like the founder of hbz token that you

8100
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:50,760
like the founder of hbz token that you
 

8101
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:53,030
like the founder of hbz token that you
were the founder yeah I had nothing to

8102
02:21:53,030 --> 02:21:53,040
were the founder yeah I had nothing to
 

8103
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,790
were the founder yeah I had nothing to
do with this and people were scammed out

8104
02:21:55,790 --> 02:21:55,800
do with this and people were scammed out
 

8105
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:58,070
do with this and people were scammed out
of it because Google just pushes

the US government
 

9225
02:43:50,340 --> 02:43:52,670
the US government
simply say what is true in a centralized

02:43:52,670 --> 02:43:52,680
simply say what is true in a centralized
 

9227
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:53,750
simply say what is true in a centralized
fashion

9228
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:53,760
fashion
 

9229
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:56,270
fashion
so do you think

9230
02:43:56,270 --> 02:43:56,280
so do you think
 

9231
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:59,090
so do you think
truth is such an easy thing as you get

9232
02:43:59,090 --> 02:43:59,100
truth is such an easy thing as you get
 

9233
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:02,030
truth is such an easy thing as you get
to higher and higher questions of

9234
02:44:02,030 --> 02:44:02,040
to higher and higher questions of
 

9235
02:44:02,040 --> 02:44:05,929
to higher and higher questions of
politics is the problem that the

9236
02:44:05,929 --> 02:44:05,939
politics is the problem that the
 

9237
02:44:05,939 --> 02:44:08,030
politics is the problem that the
consensus mechanism is being hacked or

9238
02:44:08,030 --> 02:44:08,040
consensus mechanism is being hacked or
 

9239
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:09,830
consensus mechanism is being hacked or
is the problem that truth is a difficult

9240
02:44:09,830 --> 02:44:09,840
is the problem that truth is a difficult
 

9241
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:12,110
is the problem that truth is a difficult
thing to figure out was the 2020

9242
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:12,120
thing to figure out was the 2020
 

9243
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:15,050
thing to figure out was the 2020
election rigged or not is the earth flat

9244
02:44:15,050 --> 02:44:15,060
election rigged or not is the earth flat
 

9245
02:44:15,060 --> 02:44:17,270
election rigged or not is the earth flat
or not that's a scientific one that's

9246
02:44:17,270 --> 02:44:17,280
or not that's a scientific one that's
 

9247
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:18,650
or not that's a scientific one that's
why this is my technical versus

9248
02:44:18,650 --> 02:44:18,660
why this is my technical versus
 

9249
02:44:18,660 --> 02:44:20,510
why this is my technical versus
political truth Spectrum yeah but even

9250
02:44:20,510 --> 02:44:20,520
political truth Spectrum yeah but even
 

9251
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:23,570
political truth Spectrum yeah but even
the Earth like well that that one is

9252
02:44:23,570 --> 02:44:23,580
the Earth like well that that one is
 

9253
02:44:23,580 --> 02:44:25,190
the Earth like well that that one is
yeah never mind that's a bad example

9254
02:44:25,190 --> 02:44:25,200
yeah never mind that's a bad example
 

9255
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:26,690
yeah never mind that's a bad example
because that is very

9256
02:44:26,690 --> 02:44:26,700
because that is very
 

9257
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:28,910
because that is very
uh you can rigorously show that the

9258
02:44:28,910 --> 02:44:28,920
uh you can rigorously show that the
 

9259
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:30,950
uh you can rigorously show that the
Earth is not flat but

9260
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:30,960
Earth is not flat but
 

9261
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:34,309
Earth is not flat but
um what there's some social phenomena

9262
02:44:34,309 --> 02:44:34,319
um what there's some social phenomena
 

9263
02:44:34,319 --> 02:44:36,410
um what there's some social phenomena
political phenomena philosophical one

9264
02:44:36,410 --> 02:44:36,420
political phenomena philosophical one
 

9265
02:44:36,420 --> 02:44:37,969
political phenomena philosophical one
that that will have a lot of debates

9266
02:44:37,969 --> 02:44:37,979
that that will have a lot of debates
 

9267
02:44:37,979 --> 02:44:41,090
that that will have a lot of debates
historical stuff about uh

9268
02:44:41,090 --> 02:44:41,100
historical stuff about uh
 

9269
02:44:41,100 --> 02:44:45,349
historical stuff about uh
uh about the different forces operating

9270
02:44:45,349 --> 02:44:45,359
uh about the different forces operating
 

9271
02:44:45,359 --> 02:44:48,889
uh about the different forces operating
within Nazi Germany and uh stalinist

9272
02:44:48,889 --> 02:44:48,899
within Nazi Germany and uh stalinist
 

9273
02:44:48,899 --> 02:44:51,110
within Nazi Germany and uh stalinist
Soviet Union and I think there's

9274
02:44:51,110 --> 02:44:51,120
Soviet Union and I think there's
 

9275
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:54,170
Soviet Union and I think there's
probably a lot of yeah like the

9276
02:44:54,170 --> 02:44:54,180
probably a lot of yeah like the
 

9277
02:44:54,180 --> 02:44:56,210
probably a lot of yeah like the
historians debate about a lot of stuff

9278
02:44:56,210 --> 02:44:56,220
historians debate about a lot of stuff
 

9279
02:44:56,220 --> 02:44:57,610
historians debate about a lot of stuff
like uh

9280
02:44:57,610 --> 02:44:57,620
like uh
 

9281
02:44:57,620 --> 02:45:00,889
like uh
Blitz the book that talks about the

9282
02:45:00,889 --> 02:45:00,899
Blitz the book that talks about the
 

9283
02:45:00,899 --> 02:45:02,809
Blitz the book that talks about the
influence of drugs in the Third Reich

9284
02:45:02,809 --> 02:45:02,819
influence of drugs in the Third Reich
 

9285
02:45:02,819 --> 02:45:04,250
influence of drugs in the Third Reich
right were they on math or something

9286
02:45:04,250 --> 02:45:04,260
right were they on math or something
 

9287
02:45:04,260 --> 02:45:05,809
right were they on math or something
yeah they are there's a lot of debates

9288
02:45:05,809 --> 02:45:05,819
yeah they are there's a lot of debates
 

9289
02:45:05,819 --> 02:45:08,030
yeah they are there's a lot of debates
about how how truth what is the

9290
02:45:08,030 --> 02:45:08,040
about how how truth what is the
 

9291
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:10,429
about how how truth what is the
significance of meth on the actual

9292
02:45:10,429 --> 02:45:10,439
significance of meth on the actual
 

9293
02:45:10,439 --> 02:45:13,190
significance of meth on the actual
behavior and decisions of Hitler and so

9294
02:45:13,190 --> 02:45:13,200
behavior and decisions of Hitler and so
 

9295
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:15,349
behavior and decisions of Hitler and so
on so there's still a lot of debates I

9296
02:45:15,349 --> 02:45:15,359
on so there's still a lot of debates I
 

9297
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:19,090
on so there's still a lot of debates I
is it so easy to fix with um

9298
02:45:19,090 --> 02:45:19,100
is it so easy to fix with um
 

9299
02:45:19,100 --> 02:45:20,990
is it so easy to fix with um
decentralization I guess is the question

9300
02:45:20,990 --> 02:45:21,000
decentralization I guess is the question
 

9301
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,210
decentralization I guess is the question
so I actually have like basically

9302
02:45:23,210 --> 02:45:23,220
so I actually have like basically
 

9303
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:25,070
so I actually have like basically
chapter two of the network State book is

9304
02:45:25,070 --> 02:45:25,080
chapter two of the network State book is
 

9305
02:45:25,080 --> 02:45:27,469
chapter two of the network State book is
on essentially this topic and so it's

9306
02:45:27,469 --> 02:45:27,479
on essentially this topic and so it's
 

9307
02:45:27,479 --> 02:45:29,450
on essentially this topic and so it's
like 70 Pages or something like that so

9308
02:45:29,450 --> 02:45:29,460
like 70 Pages or something like that so
 

9309
02:45:29,460 --> 02:45:31,730
like 70 Pages or something like that so
let me try to summarize what I think

9310
02:45:31,730 --> 02:45:31,740
let me try to summarize what I think
 

9311
02:45:31,740 --> 02:45:34,550
let me try to summarize what I think
about on this the first is that there

9312
02:45:34,550 --> 02:45:34,560
about on this the first is that there
 

9313
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:36,590
about on this the first is that there
was an onion article that came out I I

9314
02:45:36,590 --> 02:45:36,600
was an onion article that came out I I
 

9315
02:45:36,600 --> 02:45:38,870
was an onion article that came out I I
can't find it now anymore but it was

9316
02:45:38,870 --> 02:45:38,880
can't find it now anymore but it was
 

9317
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:41,389
can't find it now anymore but it was
about historians in the year 3000

9318
02:45:41,389 --> 02:45:41,399
about historians in the year 3000
 

9319
02:45:41,399 --> 02:45:43,309
about historians in the year 3000
writing about the late 90s and early

9320
02:45:43,309 --> 02:45:43,319
writing about the late 90s and early
 

9321
02:45:43,319 --> 02:45:45,610
writing about the late 90s and early
2000s and they're like yeah clearly

9322
02:45:45,610 --> 02:45:45,620
2000s and they're like yeah clearly
 

9323
02:45:45,620 --> 02:45:47,770
2000s and they're like yeah clearly
Queen Brittany

9324
02:45:47,770 --> 02:45:47,780
Queen Brittany
 

9325
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:53,630
Queen Brittany
was a very powerful Monarch we can see

9326
02:45:53,630 --> 02:45:53,640
was a very powerful Monarch we can see
 

9327
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,550
was a very powerful Monarch we can see
um how many girls around the world

9328
02:45:55,550 --> 02:45:55,560
um how many girls around the world
 

9329
02:45:55,560 --> 02:45:58,309
um how many girls around the world
worshiped her like I got and so it was

9330
02:45:58,309 --> 02:45:58,319
worshiped her like I got and so it was
 

9331
02:45:58,319 --> 02:46:01,030
worshiped her like I got and so it was
very funny because it was a plausible

9332
02:46:01,030 --> 02:46:01,040
very funny because it was a plausible
 

9333
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:04,670
very funny because it was a plausible
Distortion of you know the current

9334
02:46:04,670 --> 02:46:04,680
Distortion of you know the current
 

9335
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:08,270
Distortion of you know the current

9336
02:46:08,270 --> 02:46:08,280
Society by you know a human civilization

picking through the rubble a thousand

9338
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:10,620
picking through the rubble a thousand
 

9339
02:46:10,620 --> 02:46:12,530
picking through the rubble a thousand
years later yeah having no context on

9340
02:46:12,530 --> 02:46:12,540
years later yeah having no context on
 

9341
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:14,150
years later yeah having no context on
anything right and it's a very

9342
02:46:14,150 --> 02:46:14,160
anything right and it's a very
 

9343
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:16,910
anything right and it's a very
thought-provoking article because it

9344
02:46:16,910 --> 02:46:16,920
thought-provoking article because it
 

9345
02:46:16,920 --> 02:46:19,370
thought-provoking article because it
says well to what extent is that us

9346
02:46:19,370 --> 02:46:19,380
says well to what extent is that us
 

9347
02:46:19,380 --> 02:46:23,090
says well to what extent is that us
picking over Pompeii or the pyramids or

9348
02:46:23,090 --> 02:46:23,100
picking over Pompeii or the pyramids or
 

9349
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:24,889
picking over Pompeii or the pyramids or
even like you know the 1600s or the

9350
02:46:24,889 --> 02:46:24,899
even like you know the 1600s or the
 

9351
02:46:24,899 --> 02:46:27,170
even like you know the 1600s or the
1700s like a few hundred years ago were

9352
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:27,180
1700s like a few hundred years ago were
 

9353
02:46:27,180 --> 02:46:30,469
1700s like a few hundred years ago were
basically sifting through artifacts and

9354
02:46:30,469 --> 02:46:30,479
basically sifting through artifacts and
 

9355
02:46:30,479 --> 02:46:32,210
basically sifting through artifacts and
um you know Osama Berger actually has

9356
02:46:32,210 --> 02:46:32,220
um you know Osama Berger actually has
 

9357
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:35,090
um you know Osama Berger actually has
this concept like uh which is is obvious

9358
02:46:35,090 --> 02:46:35,100
this concept like uh which is is obvious
 

9359
02:46:35,100 --> 02:46:36,349
this concept like uh which is is obvious
but it's also useful to have a name for

9360
02:46:36,349 --> 02:46:36,359
but it's also useful to have a name for
 

9361
02:46:36,359 --> 02:46:37,370
but it's also useful to have a name for
it's like I think he calls it like dark

9362
02:46:37,370 --> 02:46:37,380
it's like I think he calls it like dark
 

9363
02:46:37,380 --> 02:46:39,290
it's like I think he calls it like dark
history which is

9364
02:46:39,290 --> 02:46:39,300
history which is
 

9365
02:46:39,300 --> 02:46:40,730
history which is
and again it might be getting this wrong

9366
02:46:40,730 --> 02:46:40,740
and again it might be getting this wrong
 

9367
02:46:40,740 --> 02:46:43,370
and again it might be getting this wrong
but it's like only a small percentage of

9368
02:46:43,370 --> 02:46:43,380
but it's like only a small percentage of
 

9369
02:46:43,380 --> 02:46:45,590
but it's like only a small percentage of
what the Greeks wrote down you know has

9370
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:45,600
what the Greeks wrote down you know has
 

9371
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:48,650
what the Greeks wrote down you know has
come to us to the present day right so

9372
02:46:48,650 --> 02:46:48,660
come to us to the present day right so
 

9373
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:50,750
come to us to the present day right so
perhaps it's not just the winners who

9374
02:46:50,750 --> 02:46:50,760
perhaps it's not just the winners who
 

9375
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:51,830
perhaps it's not just the winners who
write history it's like the surviving

9376
02:46:51,830 --> 02:46:51,840
write history it's like the surviving
 

9377
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:55,450
write history it's like the surviving
records we have this extremely partial

9378
02:46:55,450 --> 02:46:55,460
records we have this extremely partial
 

9379
02:46:55,460 --> 02:46:58,130
records we have this extremely partial
fragmentary record of history and

9380
02:46:58,130 --> 02:46:58,140
fragmentary record of history and
 

9381
02:46:58,140 --> 02:46:59,510
fragmentary record of history and
sometimes there's some discovery that

9382
02:46:59,510 --> 02:46:59,520
sometimes there's some discovery that
 

9383
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:00,889
sometimes there's some discovery that
rewrites the whole thing don't like

9384
02:47:00,889 --> 02:47:00,899
rewrites the whole thing don't like
 

9385
02:47:00,899 --> 02:47:03,170
rewrites the whole thing don't like
Gobekli tepies everything I know about

9386
02:47:03,170 --> 02:47:03,180
Gobekli tepies everything I know about
 

9387
02:47:03,180 --> 02:47:05,090
Gobekli tepies everything I know about
that is from Rogan because he's a huge

9388
02:47:05,090 --> 02:47:05,100
that is from Rogan because he's a huge
 

9389
02:47:05,100 --> 02:47:06,950
that is from Rogan because he's a huge
fan of that that kind of stuff yeah that

9390
02:47:06,950 --> 02:47:06,960
fan of that that kind of stuff yeah that
 

9391
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:08,510
fan of that that kind of stuff yeah that
like rewrites it and then there's a lot

9392
02:47:08,510 --> 02:47:08,520
like rewrites it and then there's a lot
 

9393
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:09,770
like rewrites it and then there's a lot
of debates there there's a lot of

9394
02:47:09,770 --> 02:47:09,780
of debates there there's a lot of
 

9395
02:47:09,780 --> 02:47:10,730
of debates there there's a lot of
debates basically it's like the

9396
02:47:10,730 --> 02:47:10,740
debates basically it's like the
 

9397
02:47:10,740 --> 02:47:12,650
debates basically it's like the
discovery of this site in Northern

9398
02:47:12,650 --> 02:47:12,660
discovery of this site in Northern
 

9399
02:47:12,660 --> 02:47:15,110
discovery of this site in Northern
turkey that totally shifts our estimate

9400
02:47:15,110 --> 02:47:15,120
turkey that totally shifts our estimate
 

9401
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:17,630
turkey that totally shifts our estimate
of like when civilization started maybe

9402
02:47:17,630 --> 02:47:17,640
of like when civilization started maybe
 

9403
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:19,250
of like when civilization started maybe
pushing it back many thousands of years

9404
02:47:19,250 --> 02:47:19,260
pushing it back many thousands of years
 

9405
02:47:19,260 --> 02:47:21,290
pushing it back many thousands of years
further in the past right you know the

9406
02:47:21,290 --> 02:47:21,300
further in the past right you know the
 

9407
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:23,330
further in the past right you know the
past it's like an inverse problem in

9408
02:47:23,330 --> 02:47:23,340
past it's like an inverse problem in
 

9409
02:47:23,340 --> 02:47:25,250
past it's like an inverse problem in
physics right we're trying to

9410
02:47:25,250 --> 02:47:25,260
physics right we're trying to
 

9411
02:47:25,260 --> 02:47:27,469
physics right we're trying to
reconstruct this from limited

9412
02:47:27,469 --> 02:47:27,479
reconstruct this from limited
 

9413
02:47:27,479 --> 02:47:28,969
reconstruct this from limited
information right it's like x-ray

9414
02:47:28,969 --> 02:47:28,979
information right it's like x-ray
 

9415
02:47:28,979 --> 02:47:30,170
information right it's like x-ray
crystallography it's an inverse problem

9416
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:30,180
crystallography it's an inverse problem
 

9417
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:31,070
crystallography it's an inverse problem
right

9418
02:47:31,070 --> 02:47:31,080
right
 

9419
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:32,690
right
um it's it's Plato's Cave you know we're

9420
02:47:32,690 --> 02:47:32,700
um it's it's Plato's Cave you know we're
 

9421
02:47:32,700 --> 02:47:34,190
um it's it's Plato's Cave you know we're
trying to reconstruct what the world

9422
02:47:34,190 --> 02:47:34,200
trying to reconstruct what the world
 

9423
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:35,690
trying to reconstruct what the world
looks like outside from these Shadows

9424
02:47:35,690 --> 02:47:35,700
looks like outside from these Shadows
 

9425
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:38,270
looks like outside from these Shadows
these these fragments that have been

9426
02:47:38,270 --> 02:47:38,280
these these fragments that have been
 

9427
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:40,429
these these fragments that have been
um given to us right or that we've found

9428
02:47:40,429 --> 02:47:40,439
um given to us right or that we've found
 

9429
02:47:40,439 --> 02:47:42,110
um given to us right or that we've found
and

9430
02:47:42,110 --> 02:47:42,120
and
 

9431
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:43,910
and
um so in that sense as you find more

9432
02:47:43,910 --> 02:47:43,920
um so in that sense as you find more
 

9433
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:45,230
um so in that sense as you find more
information your estimate of the past

9434
02:47:45,230 --> 02:47:45,240
information your estimate of the past
 

9435
02:47:45,240 --> 02:47:47,870
information your estimate of the past
changes right oh wow okay that pushes

9436
02:47:47,870 --> 02:47:47,880
changes right oh wow okay that pushes
 

9437
02:47:47,880 --> 02:47:49,130
changes right oh wow okay that pushes
back civilization farther we thought

9438
02:47:49,130 --> 02:47:49,140
back civilization farther we thought
 

9439
02:47:49,140 --> 02:47:50,450
back civilization farther we thought
that one Discovery just changes it so

9440
02:47:50,450 --> 02:47:50,460
that one Discovery just changes it so
 

9441
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:53,929
that one Discovery just changes it so
you want to try to given all the gaps

9442
02:47:53,929 --> 02:47:53,939
you want to try to given all the gaps
 

9443
02:47:53,939 --> 02:47:55,969
you want to try to given all the gaps
in the data we have you want to try to

9444
02:47:55,969 --> 02:47:55,979
in the data we have you want to try to
 

9445
02:47:55,979 --> 02:48:00,110
in the data we have you want to try to
remove bias from the process of trying

9446
02:48:00,110 --> 02:48:00,120
remove bias from the process of trying
 

9447
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:02,030
remove bias from the process of trying
to fill the gaps well so here's the

9448
02:48:02,030 --> 02:48:02,040
to fill the gaps well so here's the
 

9449
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:03,950
to fill the gaps well so here's the
thing um I think we're very close to the

9450
02:48:03,950 --> 02:48:03,960
thing um I think we're very close to the
 

9451
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:05,450
thing um I think we're very close to the
moment of it and that's why it'll sound

9452
02:48:05,450 --> 02:48:05,460
moment of it and that's why it'll sound
 

9453
02:48:05,460 --> 02:48:07,750
moment of it and that's why it'll sound
crazy when I see it now but our

9454
02:48:07,750 --> 02:48:07,760
crazy when I see it now but our
 

9455
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:12,170
crazy when I see it now but our
descendants I I really do think of

9456
02:48:12,170 --> 02:48:12,180
descendants I I really do think of
 

9457
02:48:12,180 --> 02:48:13,730
descendants I I really do think of
what the blockchain is and

9458
02:48:13,730 --> 02:48:13,740
what the blockchain is and
 

9459
02:48:13,740 --> 02:48:15,889
what the blockchain is and
cryptographically verifiable history as

9460
02:48:15,889 --> 02:48:15,899
cryptographically verifiable history as
 

9461
02:48:15,899 --> 02:48:18,110
cryptographically verifiable history as
being the next step after written

9462
02:48:18,110 --> 02:48:18,120
being the next step after written
 

9463
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:19,790
being the next step after written
history it's like on par with that

9464
02:48:19,790 --> 02:48:19,800
history it's like on par with that
 

9465
02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:22,610
history it's like on par with that
because anybody who has the record the

9466
02:48:22,610 --> 02:48:22,620
because anybody who has the record the
 

9467
02:48:22,620 --> 02:48:24,410
because anybody who has the record the
math is not going to change right math

9468
02:48:24,410 --> 02:48:24,420
math is not going to change right math
 

9469
02:48:24,420 --> 02:48:26,510
math is not going to change right math
is constant across human time and space

9470
02:48:26,510 --> 02:48:26,520
is constant across human time and space
 

9471
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:29,150
is constant across human time and space
right so you know the value of pi is

9472
02:48:29,150 --> 02:48:29,160
right so you know the value of pi is
 

9473
02:48:29,160 --> 02:48:30,590
right so you know the value of pi is
constant that's one of the few constants

9474
02:48:30,590 --> 02:48:30,600
constant that's one of the few constants
 

9475
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:31,550
constant that's one of the few constants
across all these different human

9476
02:48:31,550 --> 02:48:31,560
across all these different human
 

9477
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:33,590
across all these different human
civilizations okay

9478
02:48:33,590 --> 02:48:33,600
civilizations okay
 

9479
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:35,150
civilizations okay
um so

9480
02:48:35,150 --> 02:48:35,160
um so
 

9481
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:37,550
um so
somebody in the future assuming of

9482
02:48:37,550 --> 02:48:37,560
somebody in the future assuming of
 

9483
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:38,870
somebody in the future assuming of
course the digital record is actually

9484
02:48:38,870 --> 02:48:38,880
course the digital record is actually
 

9485
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:41,150
course the digital record is actually
intact to that point because you know

9486
02:48:41,150 --> 02:48:41,160
intact to that point because you know
 

9487
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:43,190
intact to that point because you know
the uh in theory digital stuff will

9488
02:48:43,190 --> 02:48:43,200
the uh in theory digital stuff will
 

9489
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:45,830
the uh in theory digital stuff will
persist in practice you have lost data

9490
02:48:45,830 --> 02:48:45,840
persist in practice you have lost data
 

9491
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:47,630
persist in practice you have lost data
and floppy drives and stuff like that in

9492
02:48:47,630 --> 02:48:47,640
and floppy drives and stuff like that in
 

9493
02:48:47,640 --> 02:48:49,130
and floppy drives and stuff like that in
a sense in some ways digital is more

9494
02:48:49,130 --> 02:48:49,140
a sense in some ways digital is more
 

9495
02:48:49,140 --> 02:48:50,270
a sense in some ways digital is more
persistent in some ways physical is more

9496
02:48:50,270 --> 02:48:50,280
persistent in some ways physical is more
 

9497
02:48:50,280 --> 02:48:51,889
persistent in some ways physical is more
persistent okay but assuming we can

9498
02:48:51,889 --> 02:48:51,899
persistent okay but assuming we can
 

9499
02:48:51,899 --> 02:48:53,990
persistent okay but assuming we can
figure out the the archival problem

9500
02:48:53,990 --> 02:48:54,000
figure out the the archival problem
 

9501
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:55,969
figure out the the archival problem
somehow then

9502
02:48:55,969 --> 02:48:55,979
somehow then
 

9503
02:48:55,979 --> 02:48:58,309
somehow then
this future record at least it's

9504
02:48:58,309 --> 02:48:58,319
this future record at least it's
 

9505
02:48:58,319 --> 02:49:00,290
this future record at least it's
internally consistent right you can run

9506
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:00,300
internally consistent right you can run
 

9507
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:02,270
internally consistent right you can run
a bunch of the equivalents of checksums

9508
02:49:02,270 --> 02:49:02,280
a bunch of the equivalents of checksums
 

9509
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:04,190
a bunch of the equivalents of checksums
right the Bitcoin verification process

9510
02:49:04,190 --> 02:49:04,200
right the Bitcoin verification process
 

9511
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:06,469
right the Bitcoin verification process
just sum it all up and see that okay

9512
02:49:06,469 --> 02:49:06,479
just sum it all up and see that okay
 

9513
02:49:06,479 --> 02:49:09,650
just sum it all up and see that okay
it's F of G of H of X and boom that that

9514
02:49:09,650 --> 02:49:09,660
it's F of G of H of X and boom that that
 

9515
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:11,389
it's F of G of H of X and boom that that
at least is internally consistent okay

9516
02:49:11,389 --> 02:49:11,399
at least is internally consistent okay
 

9517
02:49:11,399 --> 02:49:13,849
at least is internally consistent okay
again it doesn't say that all the people

9518
02:49:13,849 --> 02:49:13,859
again it doesn't say that all the people
 

9519
02:49:13,859 --> 02:49:16,610
again it doesn't say that all the people
who reported it were uh you know they

9520
02:49:16,610 --> 02:49:16,620
who reported it were uh you know they
 

9521
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:17,750
who reported it were uh you know they
could have put something on chain that's

9522
02:49:17,750 --> 02:49:17,760
could have put something on chain that's
 

9523
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:19,309
could have put something on chain that's
false but at least you know the metadata

9524
02:49:19,309 --> 02:49:19,319
false but at least you know the metadata
 

9525
02:49:19,319 --> 02:49:20,389
false but at least you know the metadata
is likely to be very difficult to

9526
02:49:20,389 --> 02:49:20,399
is likely to be very difficult to
 

9527
02:49:20,399 --> 02:49:22,969
is likely to be very difficult to
falsify and this is a new tool it's a

9528
02:49:22,969 --> 02:49:22,979
falsify and this is a new tool it's a
 

9529
02:49:22,979 --> 02:49:26,030
falsify and this is a new tool it's a
really a new tool in terms of a robust

9530
02:49:26,030 --> 02:49:26,040
really a new tool in terms of a robust
 

9531
02:49:26,040 --> 02:49:27,530
really a new tool in terms of a robust
um history that is expensive and

9532
02:49:27,530 --> 02:49:27,540
um history that is expensive and
 

9533
02:49:27,540 --> 02:49:29,630
um history that is expensive and
technically challenging to edit and

9534
02:49:29,630 --> 02:49:29,640
technically challenging to edit and
 

9535
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:31,670
technically challenging to edit and
alter and that is the alternative to the

9536
02:49:31,670 --> 02:49:31,680
alter and that is the alternative to the
 

9537
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:33,650
alter and that is the alternative to the
stalin-esque rewriting of History by

02:49:33,650 --> 02:49:33,660
stalin-esque rewriting of History by

02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:35,690
stalin-esque rewriting of History by
centralized power

yeah I'm gonna have to do a lot actually

9542
02:49:37,130 --> 02:49:37,140
yeah I'm gonna have to do a lot actually
 

9543
02:49:37,140 --> 02:49:39,530
yeah I'm gonna have to do a lot actually
reading and thinking about I'm actually

02:49:39,530 --> 02:49:39,540
reading and thinking about I'm actually
 

9545
02:49:39,540 --> 02:49:41,450
reading and thinking about I'm actually
as as you're talking I'm also thinking

9546
02:49:41,450 --> 02:49:41,460
as as you're talking I'm also thinking
 

9547
02:49:41,460 --> 02:49:44,929
as as you're talking I'm also thinking
about the fact that I think 99 of my

02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:50,030

um because I basically use it very

9554
02:49:51,590 --> 02:49:51,600
um because I basically use it very
 

9555
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,570
um because I basically use it very
similarly to stack Overflow and even

02:49:53,570 --> 02:49:53,580
similarly to stack Overflow and even
 

9557
02:49:53,580 --> 02:49:55,130
similarly to stack Overflow and even
there it doesn't have unit tests for

9558
02:49:55,130 --> 02:49:55,140
there it doesn't have unit tests for
 

9559
02:49:55,140 --> 02:49:57,110
there it doesn't have unit tests for
example one thing that's a good way to

9560
02:49:57,110 --> 02:49:57,120
example one thing that's a good way to
 

9561
02:49:57,120 --> 02:49:58,490
example one thing that's a good way to
put it right so one thing I remember

9562
02:49:58,490 --> 02:49:58,500
put it right so one thing I remember
 

9563
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:00,469
put it right so one thing I remember
again I might be wrong on this but I

9564
02:50:00,469 --> 02:50:00,479
again I might be wrong on this but I
 

9565
02:50:00,479 --> 02:50:02,690
again I might be wrong on this but I
recall that the Kelly Criterion it's a

9566
02:50:02,690 --> 02:50:02,700
recall that the Kelly Criterion it's a
 

9567
02:50:02,700 --> 02:50:04,370
recall that the Kelly Criterion it's a
it's actually quite a useful thing to

9568
02:50:04,370 --> 02:50:04,380
it's actually quite a useful thing to
 

9569
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:05,809
it's actually quite a useful thing to
know it's like how to optimally size

9570
02:50:05,809 --> 02:50:05,819
know it's like how to optimally size
 

9571
02:50:05,819 --> 02:50:09,290
know it's like how to optimally size
your bets okay and you can have

9572
02:50:09,290 --> 02:50:09,300
your bets okay and you can have
 

9573
02:50:09,300 --> 02:50:11,090
your bets okay and you can have
um given your kind of probability that

9574
02:50:11,090 --> 02:50:11,100
um given your kind of probability that
 

9575
02:50:11,100 --> 02:50:12,469
um given your kind of probability that
some investment pays off or assume

9576
02:50:12,469 --> 02:50:12,479
some investment pays off or assume
 

9577
02:50:12,479 --> 02:50:14,389
some investment pays off or assume
probability you can have bets that are

9578
02:50:14,389 --> 02:50:14,399
probability you can have bets that are
 

9579
02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:16,670
probability you can have bets that are
too large bets are too small sometimes

9580
02:50:16,670 --> 02:50:16,680
too large bets are too small sometimes
 

9581
02:50:16,680 --> 02:50:18,770
too large bets are too small sometimes
the Kelly Criterion it goes negative and

9582
02:50:18,770 --> 02:50:18,780
the Kelly Criterion it goes negative and
 

9583
02:50:18,780 --> 02:50:20,270
the Kelly Criterion it goes negative and
actually it says you should actually

9584
02:50:20,270 --> 02:50:20,280
actually it says you should actually
 

9585
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:21,950
actually it says you should actually
take leverage you're so sure this is a

9586
02:50:21,950 --> 02:50:21,960
take leverage you're so sure this is a
 

9587
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:23,389
take leverage you're so sure this is a
good outcome that you should actually

9588
02:50:23,389 --> 02:50:23,399
good outcome that you should actually
 

9589
02:50:23,399 --> 02:50:24,770
good outcome that you should actually
spend more than your current bankroll

9590
02:50:24,770 --> 02:50:24,780
spend more than your current bankroll
 

9591
02:50:24,780 --> 02:50:25,790
spend more than your current bankroll
because you're going to get a good

9592
02:50:25,790 --> 02:50:25,800
because you're going to get a good
 

9593
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:26,990
because you're going to get a good
result right so it's a very

9594
02:50:26,990 --> 02:50:27,000
result right so it's a very
 

9595
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,570
result right so it's a very
sophisticated thing and as I recall many

9596
02:50:29,570 --> 02:50:29,580
sophisticated thing and as I recall many
 

9597
02:50:29,580 --> 02:50:31,849
sophisticated thing and as I recall many
sites on the internet have the wrong

02:50:31,849 --> 02:50:31,859
sites on the internet have the wrong
 

9599
02:50:31,859 --> 02:50:34,190
sites on the internet have the wrong
equation and I believe that was

9600
02:50:34,190 --> 02:50:34,200
equation and I believe that was
 

9601
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:35,450
equation and I believe that was
reprinted on Wikipedia the wrong

9602
02:50:35,450 --> 02:50:35,460

9603
02:50:35,460 --> 02:50:36,950

okay and so without unit tests see math

9608
02:50:42,410 --> 02:50:42,420
okay and so without unit tests see math

02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:43,490
okay and so without unit tests see math
is actually the kind of thing that you

9610
02:50:43,490 --> 02:50:43,500
is actually the kind of thing that you
 

9611
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:44,630
is actually the kind of thing that you
could unit test right you could

9612
02:50:44,630 --> 02:50:44,640
could unit test right you could
 

9613
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:46,250
could unit test right you could
literally have the assert on the right

you know on on this

9632
02:51:03,349 --> 02:51:03,359
you know on on this
 

9633
02:51:03,359 --> 02:51:05,090
you know on on this
um and you know I'm not capitalizing

9634
02:51:05,090 --> 02:51:05,100
um and you know I'm not capitalizing
 

9635
02:51:05,100 --> 02:51:06,050
um and you know I'm not capitalizing
these companies or capitalized

these companies or capitalized
 

9637

you know not just talk about a better

9640
02:51:09,290 --> 02:51:09,300
you know not just talk about a better
 

9641
02:51:09,300 --> 02:51:10,490
you know not just talk about a better
version it's hard to build something

9642
02:51:10,490 --> 02:51:10,500
version it's hard to build something
 

9643
02:51:10,500 --> 02:51:12,650
version it's hard to build something
better so actually go and build it and

9644
02:51:12,650 --> 02:51:12,660
better so actually go and build it and
 

9645
02:51:12,660 --> 02:51:14,450
better so actually go and build it and
what you want is assertions that are

9646
02:51:14,450 --> 02:51:14,460
what you want is assertions that are
 

9647
02:51:14,460 --> 02:51:16,250
what you want is assertions that are
actually reproduced you you don't just

9648
02:51:16,250 --> 02:51:16,260
actually reproduced you you don't just
 

9649
02:51:16,260 --> 02:51:17,690
actually reproduced you you don't just
have the equation there you have a

9650
02:51:17,690 --> 02:51:17,700
have the equation there you have a
 

9651
02:51:17,700 --> 02:51:19,070
have the equation there you have a

02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:20,570

can download the page you can rerun it

it's reproducible so the problem with

9656
02:51:22,849 --> 02:51:22,859
it's reproducible so the problem with
 

9657
02:51:22,859 --> 02:51:24,830
it's reproducible so the problem with
that kind of reproducibility is that it

9658
02:51:24,830 --> 02:51:24,840
that kind of reproducibility is that it
 

9659
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:26,030
that kind of reproducibility is that it
adds friction it's harder to put

9660
02:51:26,030 --> 02:51:26,040
adds friction it's harder to put
 

9661
02:51:26,040 --> 02:51:27,410
adds friction it's harder to put
together articles that do that kind of

Wikipedia on the technical side is that

9670
02:51:36,050 --> 02:51:36,060
Wikipedia on the technical side is that
 

9671
02:51:36,060 --> 02:51:38,990
Wikipedia on the technical side is that
without the unit tests without the

it still often does an incredible job

it still often does an incredible job
 

9677
02:51:42,359 --> 02:51:45,410
it still often does an incredible job
because the reason it's the the people

there's a pride

9686
02:51:52,969 --> 02:51:52,979
there's a pride

there's a pride
to getting it right okay so let me agree

9688
02:51:57,349 --> 02:51:57,359
to getting it right okay so let me agree
 

9689
02:51:57,359 --> 02:51:58,610
to getting it right okay so let me agree
and disagree with that right so

9690
02:51:58,610 --> 02:51:58,620
and disagree with that right so
 

9691

and disagree with that right so
absolutely there's there's some good

there there's uh I mean again do I think
 

9695
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:04,670
there there's uh I mean again do I think
Wiki is a huge step up from what

technical topics yes
 

9701
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:10,190
technical topics yes
however you talk about the editing

9702
02:52:10,190 --> 02:52:10,200
however you talk about the editing
 

9703
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:11,929
however you talk about the editing
environment right like the markup for

9704
02:52:11,929 --> 02:52:11,939
environment right like the markup for

02:52:18,830 --> 02:52:18,840
exactly if for a minimum for example
 

9711
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:22,370
exactly if for a minimum for example
it's not wysiwyg right so uh like medium

9712
02:52:22,370 --> 02:52:22,380
it's not wysiwyg right so uh like medium
 

9713
02:52:22,380 --> 02:52:24,530
it's not wysiwyg right so uh like medium
or something like that you you know or

9714
02:52:24,530 --> 02:52:24,540
or something like that you you know or
 

9715
02:52:24,540 --> 02:52:25,610
or something like that you you know or
ghost

9716
02:52:25,610 --> 02:52:25,620
ghost
 

9717

um you can just go in and type and it
 

9719
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:28,550
um you can just go in and type and it
looks exactly like it looks on the page

9720
02:52:28,550 --> 02:52:28,560
looks exactly like it looks on the page
 

9721
02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:31,490
looks exactly like it looks on the page
here you have to go to a uh a markup

9722
02:52:31,490 --> 02:52:31,500
here you have to go to a uh a markup
 

9723
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:32,870
here you have to go to a uh a markup
language where there can be editor

9724
02:52:32,870 --> 02:52:32,880
language where there can be editor
 

9725
02:52:32,880 --> 02:52:35,210
language where there can be editor
conflicts and you hit enter and someone

9726
02:52:35,210 --> 02:52:35,220
conflicts and you hit enter and someone
 

9727
02:52:35,220 --> 02:52:36,769
conflicts and you hit enter and someone
is over in your edit or something like

9728
02:52:36,769 --> 02:52:36,779
is over in your edit or something like
 

9729
02:52:36,779 --> 02:52:38,210
is over in your edit or something like
that and you don't know how it looks on

9730
02:52:38,210 --> 02:52:38,220
that and you don't know how it looks on
 

9731
02:52:38,220 --> 02:52:39,710
that and you don't know how it looks on
the page you might have to do a few you

9732
02:52:39,710 --> 02:52:39,720
the page you might have to do a few you
 

9733
02:52:39,720 --> 02:52:40,790
the page you might have to do a few you
know previews or what have you it's

9734
02:52:40,790 --> 02:52:40,800
know previews or what have you it's
 

9735
02:52:40,800 --> 02:52:43,010
know previews or what have you it's
number one so editing you talk about

9736
02:52:43,010 --> 02:52:43,020
number one so editing you talk about
 

9737
02:52:43,020 --> 02:52:45,110
number one so editing you talk about
bearish ending that's that's the thing

9738
02:52:45,110 --> 02:52:45,120
bearish ending that's that's the thing
 

9739
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:46,429
bearish ending that's that's the thing
um number two is

9740
02:52:46,429 --> 02:52:46,439
um number two is
 

9741
02:52:46,439 --> 02:52:49,190
um number two is
given that it might be read a thousand

9742
02:52:49,190 --> 02:52:49,200
given that it might be read a thousand
 

9743
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:51,710
given that it might be read a thousand
times for every one time it's written it

9744
02:52:51,710 --> 02:52:51,720
times for every one time it's written it
 

9745
02:52:51,720 --> 02:52:53,210
times for every one time it's written it
is important to actually have the

9746
02:52:53,210 --> 02:52:53,220
is important to actually have the
 

9747
02:52:53,220 --> 02:52:55,010
is important to actually have the
mathematical things unit tested if they

9748
02:52:55,010 --> 02:52:55,020
mathematical things unit tested if they
 

9749
02:52:55,020 --> 02:52:56,269
mathematical things unit tested if they
can be given that we've got modern

9750
02:52:56,269 --> 02:52:56,279
can be given that we've got modern
 

9751
02:52:56,279 --> 02:52:57,830
can be given that we've got modern
technology and that's something that's

9752
02:52:57,830 --> 02:52:57,840
technology and that's something that's
 

9753
02:52:57,840 --> 02:52:59,570
technology and that's something that's
hard to like retrofit into this because

9754
02:52:59,570 --> 02:52:59,580
hard to like retrofit into this because
 

9755
02:52:59,580 --> 02:53:01,969
hard to like retrofit into this because
it's so kind of ossified right right

9756
02:53:01,969 --> 02:53:01,979
it's so kind of ossified right right
 

9757
02:53:01,979 --> 02:53:03,889
it's so kind of ossified right right
there's the the interface on every side

9758
02:53:03,889 --> 02:53:03,899
there's the the interface on every side
 

9759
02:53:03,899 --> 02:53:06,830
there's the the interface on every side
for the editor even just for the editors

9760
02:53:06,830 --> 02:53:06,840
for the editor even just for the editors
 

9761
02:53:06,840 --> 02:53:09,290
for the editor even just for the editors
to check that say the editor wants to

9762
02:53:09,290 --> 02:53:09,300
to check that say the editor wants to
 

9763
02:53:09,300 --> 02:53:11,269
to check that say the editor wants to
get it right we make it we want to make

9764
02:53:11,269 --> 02:53:11,279
get it right we make it we want to make
 

9765
02:53:11,279 --> 02:53:12,230
get it right we make it we want to make
it really

9766
02:53:12,230 --> 02:53:12,240
it really
 

9767
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:14,510
it really
uh or not it should be easy but easier

9768
02:53:14,510 --> 02:53:14,520
uh or not it should be easy but easier
 

9769
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:16,250
uh or not it should be easy but easier
to check their work that's like

9770
02:53:16,250 --> 02:53:16,260
to check their work that's like
 

9771
02:53:16,260 --> 02:53:20,650
to check their work that's like
debugging like a nice IDE for the

9772
02:53:20,650 --> 02:53:20,660

 

9773
02:53:20,660 --> 02:53:23,929

that's right and the thing about this is

9774
02:53:23,929 --> 02:53:23,939
that's right and the thing about this is
 

9775
02:53:23,939 --> 02:53:26,630
that's right and the thing about this is
um as I said because the truth is a

9776
02:53:26,630 --> 02:53:26,640
um as I said because the truth is a
 

9777
02:53:26,640 --> 02:53:28,910
um as I said because the truth is a
global constant but like incorrectness

9778
02:53:28,910 --> 02:53:28,920
global constant but like incorrectness
 

9779
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:30,769
global constant but like incorrectness
you know right go ahead every happy

9780
02:53:30,769 --> 02:53:30,779
you know right go ahead every happy
 

9781
02:53:30,779 --> 02:53:34,070
you know right go ahead every happy
family I love I love to think that like

9782
02:53:34,070 --> 02:53:34,080
family I love I love to think that like
 

9783
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:36,650
family I love I love to think that like
truths will have a nice debugger well so

9784
02:53:36,650 --> 02:53:36,660
truths will have a nice debugger well so
 

9785
02:53:36,660 --> 02:53:40,250
truths will have a nice debugger well so
here's right so the thing is that what

9786
02:53:40,250 --> 02:53:40,260
here's right so the thing is that what
 

9787
02:53:40,260 --> 02:53:42,950
here's right so the thing is that what
you can do is uh let's say you did have

9788
02:53:42,950 --> 02:53:42,960
you can do is uh let's say you did have
 

9789
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:44,450
you can do is uh let's say you did have
like a unit tested page for everything

9790
02:53:44,450 --> 02:53:44,460
like a unit tested page for everything
 

9791
02:53:44,460 --> 02:53:45,710
like a unit tested page for everything
that's on Wikipedia first of all it

9792
02:53:45,710 --> 02:53:45,720
that's on Wikipedia first of all it
 

9793
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:47,450
that's on Wikipedia first of all it
makes a page more more useful because

9794
02:53:47,450 --> 02:53:47,460
makes a page more more useful because
 

9795
02:53:47,460 --> 02:53:48,830
makes a page more more useful because
you can download it you can run it you

9796
02:53:48,830 --> 02:53:48,840
you can download it you can run it you
 

9797
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:50,690
you can download it you can run it you
can import it and so on second is it

9798
02:53:50,690 --> 02:53:50,700
can import it and so on second is it
 

9799
02:53:50,700 --> 02:53:53,210
can import it and so on second is it
leads into one of the things that we can

9800
02:53:53,210 --> 02:53:53,220
leads into one of the things that we can
 

9801
02:53:53,220 --> 02:53:54,710
leads into one of the things that we can
talk about I've sort of like a road map

9802
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:54,720
talk about I've sort of like a road map
 

9803
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:57,469
talk about I've sort of like a road map
for building alternatives to not just

9804
02:53:57,469 --> 02:53:57,479
for building alternatives to not just
 

9805
02:53:57,479 --> 02:54:00,130
for building alternatives to not just
existing companies but to many existing

9806
02:54:00,130 --> 02:54:00,140
existing companies but to many existing
 

9807
02:54:00,140 --> 02:54:03,349
existing companies but to many existing
U.S institutions from media and tech

9808
02:54:03,349 --> 02:54:03,359
U.S institutions from media and tech
 

9809
02:54:03,359 --> 02:54:06,410
U.S institutions from media and tech
companies to courts and government and

9810
02:54:06,410 --> 02:54:06,420
companies to courts and government and
 

9811
02:54:06,420 --> 02:54:09,110
companies to courts and government and
you know Academia and non-profits the

9812
02:54:09,110 --> 02:54:09,120
you know Academia and non-profits the
 

9813
02:54:09,120 --> 02:54:12,170
you know Academia and non-profits the
Wikipedia discussion actually relates to

9814
02:54:12,170 --> 02:54:12,180
Wikipedia discussion actually relates to
 

9815
02:54:12,180 --> 02:54:15,050
Wikipedia discussion actually relates to
um how you improve on Academia right and

9816
02:54:15,050 --> 02:54:15,060
um how you improve on Academia right and
 

9817
02:54:15,060 --> 02:54:16,610
um how you improve on Academia right and
so Academia right now one of the big

9818
02:54:16,610 --> 02:54:16,620
so Academia right now one of the big
 

9819
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:18,349
so Academia right now one of the big
problems this is kind of related to the

9820
02:54:18,349 --> 02:54:18,359
problems this is kind of related to the
 

9821
02:54:18,359 --> 02:54:20,690
problems this is kind of related to the
oh boy okay the current institutions we

9822
02:54:20,690 --> 02:54:20,700
oh boy okay the current institutions we
 

9823
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:21,950
oh boy okay the current institutions we
don't have trust in them because the

9824
02:54:21,950 --> 02:54:21,960
don't have trust in them because the
 

9825
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:23,450
don't have trust in them because the
answer is is that the answer to trust no

9826
02:54:23,450 --> 02:54:23,460
answer is is that the answer to trust no
 

9827
02:54:23,460 --> 02:54:25,309
answer is is that the answer to trust no
one right and I think the alternative is

9828
02:54:25,309 --> 02:54:25,319
one right and I think the alternative is
 

9829
02:54:25,319 --> 02:54:27,349
one right and I think the alternative is
decentralized cryptographic trust or

9830
02:54:27,349 --> 02:54:27,359
decentralized cryptographic trust or
 

9831
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:28,790
decentralized cryptographic trust or
verification how does that apply to

9832
02:54:28,790 --> 02:54:28,800
verification how does that apply to
 

9833
02:54:28,800 --> 02:54:30,349
verification how does that apply to
Academia

9834
02:54:30,349 --> 02:54:30,359

right so how does that apply here once
 

9881
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:25,370
right so how does that apply here once
you start thinking about how many

9910
02:55:54,469 --> 02:55:54,479

02:55:57,530 --> 02:55:57,540
publicly as prestigious scientists from
 

9913
02:55:57,540 --> 02:55:59,889
publicly as prestigious scientists from
Stanford and you know Harvard and MIT

9914
02:55:59,889 --> 02:55:59,899
Stanford and you know Harvard and MIT
 

9915
02:55:59,899 --> 02:56:03,769
Stanford and you know Harvard and MIT
all came up with X right and so the

9916
02:56:03,769 --> 02:56:03,779
all came up with X right and so the
 

9917
02:56:03,779 --> 02:56:07,309
all came up with X right and so the
prestige is a substitute for the uh the

9918
02:56:07,309 --> 02:56:07,319
prestige is a substitute for the uh the
 

9919
02:56:07,319 --> 02:56:09,889
prestige is a substitute for the uh the
actual replication so there's a concept

9920
02:56:09,889 --> 02:56:09,899
actual replication so there's a concept
 

9921
02:56:09,899 --> 02:56:11,630
actual replication so there's a concept
called good heart's law okay I'm just

9922
02:56:11,630 --> 02:56:11,640
called good heart's law okay I'm just
 

9923
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:13,309
called good heart's law okay I'm just
going to quote it when a measure becomes

9924
02:56:13,309 --> 02:56:13,319
going to quote it when a measure becomes
 

9925
02:56:13,319 --> 02:56:14,990
going to quote it when a measure becomes
a Target it seems to be a good measure

9926
02:56:14,990 --> 02:56:15,000
a Target it seems to be a good measure
 

9927
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:16,610
a Target it seems to be a good measure
Okay so

9928
02:56:16,610 --> 02:56:16,620
Okay so
 

9929
02:56:16,620 --> 02:56:19,150
Okay so
for example uh

9930
02:56:19,150 --> 02:56:19,160
for example uh
 

9931
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:22,190
for example uh
backlinks on the web were a good signal

9932
02:56:22,190 --> 02:56:22,200
backlinks on the web were a good signal
 

9933
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:23,630
backlinks on the web were a good signal
for Google to use when people didn't

9934
02:56:23,630 --> 02:56:23,640
for Google to use when people didn't
 

9935
02:56:23,640 --> 02:56:24,889
for Google to use when people didn't
know they were being used as a signal

9936
02:56:24,889 --> 02:56:24,899
know they were being used as a signal
 

9937
02:56:24,899 --> 02:56:26,330
know they were being used as a signal
yeah you were talking you talked about

9938
02:56:26,330 --> 02:56:26,340
yeah you were talking you talked about
 

9939
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:28,610
yeah you were talking you talked about
uh quantity versus quality and pagerank

9940
02:56:28,610 --> 02:56:28,620
uh quantity versus quality and pagerank
 

9941
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:30,469
uh quantity versus quality and pagerank
was a pretty good approximation for

9942
02:56:30,469 --> 02:56:30,479
was a pretty good approximation for
 

9943
02:56:30,479 --> 02:56:32,809
was a pretty good approximation for
quality yes such a fascinating thing by

9944
02:56:32,809 --> 02:56:32,819
quality yes such a fascinating thing by
 

9945
02:56:32,819 --> 02:56:34,010
quality yes such a fascinating thing by
the way but yeah it's a fascinating

9946
02:56:34,010 --> 02:56:34,020
the way but yeah it's a fascinating
 

9947
02:56:34,020 --> 02:56:36,230
the way but yeah it's a fascinating
thing we can talk about that but

9948
02:56:36,230 --> 02:56:36,240
thing we can talk about that but
 

9949
02:56:36,240 --> 02:56:38,510
thing we can talk about that but
basically once people know that you're

9950
02:56:38,510 --> 02:56:38,520
basically once people know that you're
 

9951
02:56:38,520 --> 02:56:40,130
basically once people know that you're
using this as a measure they will start

9952
02:56:40,130 --> 02:56:40,140
using this as a measure they will start
 

9953
02:56:40,140 --> 02:56:42,889
using this as a measure they will start
to game it and uh so then you have this

9954
02:56:42,889 --> 02:56:42,899
to game it and uh so then you have this
 

9955
02:56:42,899 --> 02:56:45,290
to game it and uh so then you have this
cycle where you know sometimes you have

9956
02:56:45,290 --> 02:56:45,300
cycle where you know sometimes you have
 

9957
02:56:45,300 --> 02:56:47,510
cycle where you know sometimes you have
a fixed Point like Satoshi with proof of

9958
02:56:47,510 --> 02:56:47,520
a fixed Point like Satoshi with proof of
 

9959
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:49,370
a fixed Point like Satoshi with proof of
work was miraculously able to come up

9960
02:56:49,370 --> 02:56:49,380
work was miraculously able to come up
 

9961
02:56:49,380 --> 02:56:51,230
work was miraculously able to come up
with a game where the gaming of it was

9962
02:56:51,230 --> 02:56:51,240
with a game where the gaming of it was
 

9963
02:56:51,240 --> 02:56:52,550
with a game where the gaming of it was
difficult without just buying more

9964
02:56:52,550 --> 02:56:52,560
difficult without just buying more
 

9965
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:54,590
difficult without just buying more
compute right so it's actually it's a

9966
02:56:54,590 --> 02:56:54,600
compute right so it's actually it's a
 

9967
02:56:54,600 --> 02:56:57,230
compute right so it's actually it's a
rare kind of game where knowledge of the

9968
02:56:57,230 --> 02:56:57,240
rare kind of game where knowledge of the
 

9969
02:56:57,240 --> 02:56:58,670
rare kind of game where knowledge of the
game's rules didn't allow people to game

9970
02:56:58,670 --> 02:56:58,680
game's rules didn't allow people to game
 

9971
02:56:58,680 --> 02:57:01,070
game's rules didn't allow people to game
the game yeah but a brilliant way to put

9972
02:57:01,070 --> 02:57:01,080
the game yeah but a brilliant way to put
 

9973
02:57:01,080 --> 02:57:02,809
the game yeah but a brilliant way to put
it yeah which is one of the reasons

9974
02:57:02,809 --> 02:57:02,819
it yeah which is one of the reasons
 

9975
02:57:02,819 --> 02:57:05,150
it yeah which is one of the reasons
that's brilliant is that it's you can

9976
02:57:05,150 --> 02:57:05,160
that's brilliant is that it's you can
 

9977
02:57:05,160 --> 02:57:07,010
that's brilliant is that it's you can
describe the game and you can't mess

9978
02:57:07,010 --> 02:57:07,020
describe the game and you can't mess
 

9979
02:57:07,020 --> 02:57:08,990
describe the game and you can't mess
with it exactly it's very hard to come

9980
02:57:08,990 --> 02:57:09,000
with it exactly it's very hard to come
 

9981
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,130
with it exactly it's very hard to come
up with something that's stable in this

9982
02:57:10,130 --> 02:57:10,140
up with something that's stable in this
 

9983
02:57:10,140 --> 02:57:11,269
up with something that's stable in this
way it's actually

9984
02:57:11,269 --> 02:57:11,279
way it's actually
 

9985
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:13,969
way it's actually
on The Meta Point uh gosh there's a game

9986
02:57:13,969 --> 02:57:13,979
on The Meta Point uh gosh there's a game
 

9987
02:57:13,979 --> 02:57:17,809
on The Meta Point uh gosh there's a game
where the rule of the game is to change

9988
02:57:17,809 --> 02:57:17,819
where the rule of the game is to change
 

9989
02:57:17,819 --> 02:57:20,030
where the rule of the game is to change
the rules okay

9990
02:57:20,030 --> 02:57:20,040
the rules okay
 

9991
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:22,910
the rules okay
um it is uh you mean human civilization

9992
02:57:22,910 --> 02:57:22,920
um it is uh you mean human civilization
 

9993
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:25,490
um it is uh you mean human civilization
or what well yeah gosh it just called

9994
02:57:25,490 --> 02:57:25,500
or what well yeah gosh it just called
 

9995
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:27,950
or what well yeah gosh it just called
something nomik

9996
02:57:27,950 --> 02:57:27,960
something nomik
 

9997
02:57:27,960 --> 02:57:31,670
something nomik
okay and oh um I see nomeg is a game

9998
02:57:31,670 --> 02:57:31,680
okay and oh um I see nomeg is a game
 

9999
02:57:31,680 --> 02:57:33,469
okay and oh um I see nomeg is a game
where the rule of the game is to change

10000
02:57:33,469 --> 02:57:33,479
where the rule of the game is to change
 

10001
02:57:33,479 --> 02:57:35,150
where the rule of the game is to change
the rules of the game yeah at first it

10002
02:57:35,150 --> 02:57:35,160
the rules of the game yeah at first it
 

10003
02:57:35,160 --> 02:57:37,550
the rules of the game yeah at first it
seems insane then you realize that's

10004
02:57:37,550 --> 02:57:37,560
seems insane then you realize that's
 

10005
02:57:37,560 --> 02:57:40,130
seems insane then you realize that's
Congress

10006
02:57:40,130 --> 02:57:40,140

 

10007
02:57:40,140 --> 02:57:43,849

yeah right yeah literally What It Is So

10008
02:57:43,849 --> 02:57:43,859
yeah right yeah literally What It Is So
 

10009
02:57:43,859 --> 02:57:47,330
yeah right yeah literally What It Is So
Meta because there are laws

10010
02:57:47,330 --> 02:57:47,340
Meta because there are laws
 

10011
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:51,530
Meta because there are laws
for elections that elect the editors

10012
02:57:51,530 --> 02:57:51,540
for elections that elect the editors
 

10013
02:57:51,540 --> 02:57:54,170
for elections that elect the editors
of those laws who then change the laws

10014
02:57:54,170 --> 02:57:54,180
of those laws who then change the laws
 

10015
02:57:54,180 --> 02:57:55,070
of those laws who then change the laws
that get them elected with

10016
02:57:55,070 --> 02:57:55,080
that get them elected with
 

10017
02:57:55,080 --> 02:57:56,510
that get them elected with
gerrymandering and other stuff right

10018
02:57:56,510 --> 02:57:56,520
gerrymandering and other stuff right
 

10019
02:57:56,520 --> 02:57:57,950
gerrymandering and other stuff right
that's a bad version we have to think

10020
02:57:57,950 --> 02:57:57,960
that's a bad version we have to think
 

10021
02:57:57,960 --> 02:57:59,150
that's a bad version we have to think
about everything that the other way of

10022
02:57:59,150 --> 02:57:59,160
about everything that the other way of
 

10023
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:00,590
about everything that the other way of
thinking about it is this is what every

10024
02:58:00,590 --> 02:58:00,600
thinking about it is this is what every
 

10025
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:02,630
thinking about it is this is what every
software engineer is doing you are

10026
02:58:02,630 --> 02:58:02,640
software engineer is doing you are
 

10027
02:58:02,640 --> 02:58:05,030
software engineer is doing you are
constantly changing the rules by editing

10028
02:58:05,030 --> 02:58:05,040
constantly changing the rules by editing
 

10029
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:06,590
constantly changing the rules by editing
software and pushing code updates and

10030
02:58:06,590 --> 02:58:06,600
software and pushing code updates and
 

10031
02:58:06,600 --> 02:58:08,510
software and pushing code updates and
and so on right

10032
02:58:08,510 --> 02:58:08,520
and so on right
 

10033
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:12,110
and so on right
so you know many games devolve into the

10034
02:58:12,110 --> 02:58:12,120
so you know many games devolve into the
 

10035
02:58:12,120 --> 02:58:13,670
so you know many games devolve into the
metagame of who writes the rules of the

10036
02:58:13,670 --> 02:58:13,680
metagame of who writes the rules of the
 

10037
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:15,650
metagame of who writes the rules of the
game right become essentially games of

10038
02:58:15,650 --> 02:58:15,660
game right become essentially games of
 

10039
02:58:15,660 --> 02:58:18,830
game right become essentially games of
nomic proof of work is so amazing

10040
02:58:18,830 --> 02:58:18,840
nomic proof of work is so amazing
 

10041
02:58:18,840 --> 02:58:20,929
nomic proof of work is so amazing
because it didn't devolve in such a way

10042
02:58:20,929 --> 02:58:20,939
because it didn't devolve in such a way
 

10043
02:58:20,939 --> 02:58:22,730
because it didn't devolve in such a way
right it became very hard to rewrite the

10044
02:58:22,730 --> 02:58:22,740
right it became very hard to rewrite the
 

10045
02:58:22,740 --> 02:58:24,110
right it became very hard to rewrite the
rules once they got set up very

10046
02:58:24,110 --> 02:58:24,120
rules once they got set up very
 

10047
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:25,429
rules once they got set up very
financially and technically expensive

10048
02:58:25,429 --> 02:58:25,439
financially and technically expensive
 

10049
02:58:25,439 --> 02:58:28,010
financially and technically expensive
that's not to say it will always be like

10050
02:58:28,010 --> 02:58:28,020
that's not to say it will always be like
 

10051
02:58:28,020 --> 02:58:29,929
that's not to say it will always be like
that but it's very hard to change if we

10052
02:58:29,929 --> 02:58:29,939
that but it's very hard to change if we
 

10053
02:58:29,939 --> 02:58:31,429
that but it's very hard to change if we
could take a small tangent we'll return

10054
02:58:31,429 --> 02:58:31,439
could take a small tangent we'll return
 

10055
02:58:31,439 --> 02:58:33,469
could take a small tangent we'll return
to Academia I'd love to ask you about

10056
02:58:33,469 --> 02:58:33,479
to Academia I'd love to ask you about
 

10057
02:58:33,479 --> 02:58:35,630
to Academia I'd love to ask you about
how to fix the media as well after we

10058
02:58:35,630 --> 02:58:35,640
how to fix the media as well after we
 

10059
02:58:35,640 --> 02:58:37,250
how to fix the media as well after we
fix Academia yeah these are all actually

10060
02:58:37,250 --> 02:58:37,260
fix Academia yeah these are all actually
 

10061
02:58:37,260 --> 02:58:39,830
fix Academia yeah these are all actually
related related yeah Wikipedia media and

10062
02:58:39,830 --> 02:58:39,840
related related yeah Wikipedia media and
 

10063
02:58:39,840 --> 02:58:42,230

Academia are all related to the question

10064
02:58:42,230 --> 02:58:42,240
Academia are all related to the question
 

10065
02:58:42,240 --> 02:58:43,670
Academia are all related to the question
of

10066
02:58:43,670 --> 02:58:43,680
of
 

10067
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:45,170
of
independent replication versus

10068
02:58:45,170 --> 02:58:45,180
independent replication versus
 

10069
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:47,870
independent replication versus
prestigious citation sure so that the

10070
02:58:47,870 --> 02:58:47,880
prestigious citation sure so that the
 

10071
02:58:47,880 --> 02:58:51,349
prestigious citation sure so that the
problem is Authority and Prestige as you

10072
02:58:51,349 --> 02:58:51,359
problem is Authority and Prestige as you
 

10073
02:58:51,359 --> 02:58:55,250
problem is Authority and Prestige as you
see it from Academia and the media and

10074
02:58:55,250 --> 02:58:55,260
see it from Academia and the media and
 

10075
02:58:55,260 --> 02:58:58,969

Wikipedia with the editors we have to

10076
02:58:58,969 --> 02:58:58,979
Wikipedia with the editors we have to
 

10077
02:58:58,979 --> 02:59:01,429
Wikipedia with the editors we have to
have uh

10078
02:59:01,429 --> 02:59:01,439
have uh
 

10079
02:59:01,439 --> 02:59:04,610
have uh
a mechanism where sort of um

10080
02:59:04,610 --> 02:59:04,620
a mechanism where sort of um
 

10081
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:07,969
a mechanism where sort of um
the data and the reproducibility is what

10082
02:59:07,969 --> 02:59:07,979
the data and the reproducibility is what
 

10083
02:59:07,979 --> 02:59:10,370
the data and the reproducibility is what
dominates the discourse that's right and

10084
02:59:10,370 --> 02:59:10,380
dominates the discourse that's right and
 

10085
02:59:10,380 --> 02:59:12,650
dominates the discourse that's right and
so when we think about this is a citizen

10086
02:59:12,650 --> 02:59:12,660
so when we think about this is a citizen
 

10087
02:59:12,660 --> 02:59:14,450
so when we think about this is a citizen
in um I think a tweeted this or

10088
02:59:14,450 --> 02:59:14,460
in um I think a tweeted this or
 

10089
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:15,889
in um I think a tweeted this or
something but Western Civilization

10090
02:59:15,889 --> 02:59:15,899
something but Western Civilization
 

10091
02:59:15,899 --> 02:59:18,410
something but Western Civilization
actually has a break last vacation

02:59:20,210 --> 02:59:20,220
emergency button it's called
 

10095
02:59:20,220 --> 02:59:21,950

decentralization right Martin Luther hit
it when the Catholic church was too

10098
02:59:24,050 --> 02:59:24,060
it when the Catholic church was too
 

10099
02:59:24,060 --> 02:59:26,389
it when the Catholic church was too
ossified and centralized decentralized

10100
02:59:26,389 --> 02:59:26,399
ossified and centralized decentralized
 

10101
02:59:26,399 --> 02:59:28,370
ossified and centralized decentralized
with a Protestant Reformation okay he

10102
02:59:28,370 --> 02:59:28,380
with a Protestant Reformation okay he
 

10103
02:59:28,380 --> 02:59:30,950
with a Protestant Reformation okay he
said you know at the time people were

10104
02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:30,960
said you know at the time people were
 

10105
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:34,849
said you know at the time people were
able to uh pay for indulgences like that

10106
02:59:34,849 --> 02:59:34,859
able to uh pay for indulgences like that
 

10107
02:59:34,859 --> 02:59:36,830
able to uh pay for indulgences like that
is to say they could sin they could say

10108
02:59:36,830 --> 02:59:36,840
is to say they could sin they could say
 

10109
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:38,170
is to say they could sin they could say
okay I sinned five times yesterday

10110
02:59:38,170 --> 02:59:38,180
okay I sinned five times yesterday
 

10111
02:59:38,180 --> 02:59:40,130
okay I sinned five times yesterday
here's you know the equivalent of 50

10112
02:59:40,130 --> 02:59:40,140
here's you know the equivalent of 50
 

10113
02:59:40,140 --> 02:59:41,809
here's you know the equivalent of 50
bucks okay I'm done with my sin I can go

10114
02:59:41,809 --> 02:59:41,819
bucks okay I'm done with my sin I can go
 

10115
02:59:41,819 --> 02:59:43,130
bucks okay I'm done with my sin I can go
and send some more okay this is really

10116
02:59:43,130 --> 02:59:43,140
and send some more okay this is really
 

10117
02:59:43,140 --> 02:59:44,870
and send some more okay this is really
by their way out of sin okay now people

10118
02:59:44,870 --> 02:59:44,880
by their way out of sin okay now people
 

10119
02:59:44,880 --> 02:59:46,490
by their way out of sin okay now people
debate as to how frequent those

10120
02:59:46,490 --> 02:59:46,500
debate as to how frequent those
 

10121
02:59:46,500 --> 02:59:47,630
debate as to how frequent those
intelligence were these are one of the

things he invade against in the 95
Theses so decentralization boom break

10126
02:59:52,010 --> 02:59:52,020
Theses so decentralization boom break
 

10127
02:59:52,020 --> 02:59:54,290
Theses so decentralization boom break
away from this ossified church start

10128
02:59:54,290 --> 02:59:54,300
away from this ossified church start
 

10129
02:59:54,300 --> 02:59:57,349
away from this ossified church start
something new right and in theory the

10130
02:59:57,349 --> 02:59:57,359
something new right and in theory the
 

10131
02:59:57,359 --> 02:59:59,450
something new right and in theory the
quote religious wars of the 1600s that

10132
02:59:59,450 --> 02:59:59,460
quote religious wars of the 1600s that
 

10133
02:59:59,460 --> 03:00:02,330
quote religious wars of the 1600s that
ensued were about things like where you

10134
03:00:02,330 --> 03:00:02,340
ensued were about things like where you
 

10135
03:00:02,340 --> 03:00:04,010
ensued were about things like where you
know the wafer was a body of Christ or

10136
03:00:04,010 --> 03:00:04,020
know the wafer was a body of Christ or
 

10137
03:00:04,020 --> 03:00:05,870
know the wafer was a body of Christ or
what have you but

10138
03:00:05,870 --> 03:00:05,880
what have you but
 

10139
03:00:05,880 --> 03:00:07,670
what have you but
in part they were also about power and

10140
03:00:07,670 --> 03:00:07,680
in part they were also about power and
 

10141
03:00:07,680 --> 03:00:09,170
in part they were also about power and
whether the centralized entity would

10142
03:00:09,170 --> 03:00:09,180
whether the centralized entity would
 

10143
03:00:09,180 --> 03:00:10,490
whether the centralized entity would
write all the rules or the decentralized

10144
03:00:10,490 --> 03:00:10,500
write all the rules or the decentralized
 

10145
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:12,050
write all the rules or the decentralized
one would and so what happened was

10146
03:00:12,050 --> 03:00:12,060
one would and so what happened was
 

10147
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:13,550
one would and so what happened was
obviously Catholicism still exists but

10148
03:00:13,550 --> 03:00:13,560
obviously Catholicism still exists but
 

10149
03:00:13,560 --> 03:00:16,790
obviously Catholicism still exists but
protism also exists okay and uh

10150
03:00:16,790 --> 03:00:16,800
protism also exists okay and uh
 

10151
03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:18,710
protism also exists okay and uh
similarly here you've got this ossified

10152
03:00:18,710 --> 03:00:18,720
similarly here you've got this ossified
 

10153
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:20,870
similarly here you've got this ossified
Central institution where you know

10154
03:00:20,870 --> 03:00:20,880
Central institution where you know
 

10155
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:23,150
Central institution where you know
forget about I mean there's complicated

10156
03:00:23,150 --> 03:00:23,160
forget about I mean there's complicated
 

10157
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:24,710
forget about I mean there's complicated
studies or difficult to summarize but

10158
03:00:24,710 --> 03:00:24,720
studies or difficult to summarize but
 

10159
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:26,990
studies or difficult to summarize but
when you have the science saying masks

10160
03:00:26,990 --> 03:00:27,000
when you have the science saying masks
 

10161
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:28,849
when you have the science saying masks
don't work and then they do

10162
03:00:28,849 --> 03:00:28,859
don't work and then they do
 

10163
03:00:28,859 --> 03:00:31,490
don't work and then they do
okay which everybody saw and this is not

10164
03:00:31,490 --> 03:00:31,500
okay which everybody saw and this is not
 

10165
03:00:31,500 --> 03:00:33,050
okay which everybody saw and this is not
like you know everybody knew that there

10166
03:00:33,050 --> 03:00:33,060
like you know everybody knew that there
 

10167
03:00:33,060 --> 03:00:35,210
like you know everybody knew that there
was not like some massive study that

10168
03:00:35,210 --> 03:00:35,220
was not like some massive study that
 

10169
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:37,070
was not like some massive study that
came out that changed our perspective on

10170
03:00:37,070 --> 03:00:37,080
came out that changed our perspective on
 

10171
03:00:37,080 --> 03:00:38,630
came out that changed our perspective on
mask wearing it was something that was

10172
03:00:38,630 --> 03:00:38,640
mask wearing it was something that was
 

10173
03:00:38,640 --> 03:00:40,429
mask wearing it was something that was
just insistently asserted as this is

10174
03:00:40,429 --> 03:00:40,439
just insistently asserted as this is
 

10175
03:00:40,439 --> 03:00:42,110
just insistently asserted as this is
what the science says and then without

10176
03:00:42,110 --> 03:00:42,120
what the science says and then without
 

10177
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:43,849
what the science says and then without
any acknowledgment the science said

10178
03:00:43,849 --> 03:00:43,859
any acknowledgment the science said
 

10179
03:00:43,859 --> 03:00:45,230
any acknowledgment the science said
something different you know the next

10180
03:00:45,230 --> 03:00:45,240
something different you know the next
 

10181
03:00:45,240 --> 03:00:46,610
something different you know the next
day right I remember because I was in

10182
03:00:46,610 --> 03:00:46,620
day right I remember because I was in
 

10183
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:48,889
day right I remember because I was in
the middle of this this debate

10184
03:00:48,889 --> 03:00:48,899
the middle of this this debate
 

10185
03:00:48,899 --> 03:00:50,570
the middle of this this debate
um and I think you could justify masks

10186
03:00:50,570 --> 03:00:50,580
um and I think you could justify masks
 

10187
03:00:50,580 --> 03:00:52,370
um and I think you could justify masks
early in the pandemic as a useful

10188
03:00:52,370 --> 03:00:52,380
early in the pandemic as a useful
 

10189
03:00:52,380 --> 03:00:55,010
early in the pandemic as a useful
precaution and then later you know

10190
03:00:55,010 --> 03:00:55,020
precaution and then later you know
 

10191
03:00:55,020 --> 03:00:56,750
precaution and then later you know
post-vaccination perhaps not necessarily

10192
03:00:56,750 --> 03:00:56,760
post-vaccination perhaps not necessarily
 

10193
03:00:56,760 --> 03:00:58,010
post-vaccination perhaps not necessarily
I think that's like the rational way of

10194
03:00:58,010 --> 03:00:58,020
I think that's like the rational way of
 

10195
03:00:58,020 --> 03:00:59,929
I think that's like the rational way of
thinking about it but the point was that

10196
03:00:59,929 --> 03:00:59,939
thinking about it but the point was that
 

10197
03:00:59,939 --> 03:01:01,730
thinking about it but the point was that
such levels of uncertainty were not

10198
03:01:01,730 --> 03:01:01,740
such levels of uncertainty were not
 

10199
03:01:01,740 --> 03:01:04,490
such levels of uncertainty were not
acknowledged instead people you know

10200
03:01:04,490 --> 03:01:04,500
acknowledged instead people you know
 

10201
03:01:04,500 --> 03:01:07,010
acknowledged instead people you know
were basically lying in the name of

10202
03:01:07,010 --> 03:01:07,020
were basically lying in the name of
 

10203
03:01:07,020 --> 03:01:10,130
were basically lying in the name of
Science and public policy uh was you

10204
03:01:10,130 --> 03:01:10,140
Science and public policy uh was you
 

10205
03:01:10,140 --> 03:01:11,750
Science and public policy uh was you
know it was wasn't uh Public Health it

10206
03:01:11,750 --> 03:01:11,760
know it was wasn't uh Public Health it
 

10207
03:01:11,760 --> 03:01:13,550
know it was wasn't uh Public Health it
was political Health okay so something

10208
03:01:13,550 --> 03:01:13,560
was political Health okay so something
 

10209
03:01:13,560 --> 03:01:14,870
was political Health okay so something
like that you're spending down all the

10210
03:01:14,870 --> 03:01:14,880
like that you're spending down all the
 

10211
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:15,830
like that you're spending down all the
credibility of an institution for

10212
03:01:15,830 --> 03:01:15,840
credibility of an institution for
 

10213
03:01:15,840 --> 03:01:18,410
credibility of an institution for
basically nothing okay and so in such a

10214
03:01:18,410 --> 03:01:18,420
basically nothing okay and so in such a
 

10215
03:01:18,420 --> 03:01:19,969
basically nothing okay and so in such a
circumstance what do you do

10216
03:01:19,969 --> 03:01:19,979
circumstance what do you do
 

10217
03:01:19,979 --> 03:01:22,490
circumstance what do you do
break glass decentralized what does that

10218
03:01:22,490 --> 03:01:22,500
break glass decentralized what does that
 

10219
03:01:22,500 --> 03:01:24,830
break glass decentralized what does that
look like Okay so

10220
03:01:24,830 --> 03:01:24,840
look like Okay so
 

10221
03:01:24,840 --> 03:01:27,050
look like Okay so
let me just describe what I call crypto

10222
03:01:27,050 --> 03:01:27,060
let me just describe what I call crypto
 

10223
03:01:27,060 --> 03:01:30,290
let me just describe what I call crypto
science uh by analogy to you know crypto

10224
03:01:30,290 --> 03:01:30,300
science uh by analogy to you know crypto
 

10225
03:01:30,300 --> 03:01:31,790
science uh by analogy to you know crypto
just like the Fiat science crypto

10226
03:01:31,790 --> 03:01:31,800
just like the Fiat science crypto
 

10227
03:01:31,800 --> 03:01:35,030
just like the Fiat science crypto
science right Fiat economics okay so

10228
03:01:35,030 --> 03:01:35,040
science right Fiat economics okay so
 

10229
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:37,610
science right Fiat economics okay so
um in any experiment any paper when it

10230
03:01:37,610 --> 03:01:37,620
um in any experiment any paper when it
 

10231
03:01:37,620 --> 03:01:40,070
um in any experiment any paper when it
comes out right

10232
03:01:40,070 --> 03:01:40,080
comes out right
 

10233
03:01:40,080 --> 03:01:42,830
comes out right
it's you can sort of divide it into the

10234
03:01:42,830 --> 03:01:42,840
it's you can sort of divide it into the
 

10235
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:44,750
it's you can sort of divide it into the
analog to digital and the purely digital

10236
03:01:44,750 --> 03:01:44,760
analog to digital and the purely digital
 

10237
03:01:44,760 --> 03:01:46,550
analog to digital and the purely digital
okay so the analog digital is you're

10238
03:01:46,550 --> 03:01:46,560
okay so the analog digital is you're
 

10239
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:47,929
okay so the analog digital is you're
running some instruments you're getting

10240
03:01:47,929 --> 03:01:47,939
running some instruments you're getting
 

10241
03:01:47,939 --> 03:01:50,690
running some instruments you're getting
some data okay and then once you've got

10242
03:01:50,690 --> 03:01:50,700
some data okay and then once you've got
 

10243
03:01:50,700 --> 03:01:53,090
some data okay and then once you've got
the data you're generating figures and

10244
03:01:53,090 --> 03:01:53,100
the data you're generating figures and
 

10245
03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:55,730
the data you're generating figures and
tables and text and a PDF from that data

10246
03:01:55,730 --> 03:01:55,740
tables and text and a PDF from that data
 

10247
03:01:55,740 --> 03:01:56,690
tables and text and a PDF from that data
right

10248
03:01:56,690 --> 03:01:56,700
right
 

10249
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:58,429
right
leave aside the data collection set for

10250
03:01:58,429 --> 03:01:58,439
leave aside the data collection set for
 

10251
03:01:58,439 --> 03:02:00,349
leave aside the data collection set for
now I'll come back to that right just a

10252
03:02:00,349 --> 03:02:00,359
now I'll come back to that right just a
 

10253
03:02:00,359 --> 03:02:02,750
now I'll come back to that right just a
purely digital part what does the ideal

10254
03:02:02,750 --> 03:02:02,760
purely digital part what does the ideal
 

10255
03:02:02,760 --> 03:02:05,170
purely digital part what does the ideal
quote academic paper look like in

10256
03:02:05,170 --> 03:02:05,180
quote academic paper look like in
 

10257
03:02:05,180 --> 03:02:08,450
quote academic paper look like in
2022-2023 first uh there's this concept

10258
03:02:08,450 --> 03:02:08,460
2022-2023 first uh there's this concept
 

10259
03:02:08,460 --> 03:02:10,190
2022-2023 first uh there's this concept
called truly called reproducible

10260
03:02:10,190 --> 03:02:10,200
called truly called reproducible
 

10261
03:02:10,200 --> 03:02:11,929
called truly called reproducible
research okay

10262
03:02:11,929 --> 03:02:11,939
research okay
 

10263
03:02:11,939 --> 03:02:14,870
research okay
reproducible research is the idea that

10264
03:02:14,870 --> 03:02:14,880
reproducible research is the idea that
 

10265
03:02:14,880 --> 03:02:18,830
reproducible research is the idea that
the PDF should be regenerated from the

10266
03:02:18,830 --> 03:02:18,840
the PDF should be regenerated from the
 

10267
03:02:18,840 --> 03:02:21,349
the PDF should be regenerated from the
data and code okay so you should be able

10268
03:02:21,349 --> 03:02:21,359
data and code okay so you should be able
 

10269
03:02:21,359 --> 03:02:23,150
data and code okay so you should be able
to hit enter and regenerate it why is

10270
03:02:23,150 --> 03:02:23,160
to hit enter and regenerate it why is
 

10271
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:24,530
to hit enter and regenerate it why is
this really important as a concept John

10272
03:02:24,530 --> 03:02:24,540
this really important as a concept John
 

10273
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:26,929
this really important as a concept John

20 years ago pioneered this in stats

10276
03:02:29,570 --> 03:02:29,580
20 years ago pioneered this in stats
 

10277
03:02:29,580 --> 03:02:31,309
20 years ago pioneered this in stats
because

10278
03:02:31,309 --> 03:02:31,319
because
 

10279
03:02:31,319 --> 03:02:33,170
because
the text alone often doesn't describe

10280
03:02:33,170 --> 03:02:33,180
the text alone often doesn't describe
 

10281
03:02:33,180 --> 03:02:34,610
the text alone often doesn't describe
every parameter that goes into a figure

10282
03:02:34,610 --> 03:02:34,620
every parameter that goes into a figure
 

10283
03:02:34,620 --> 03:02:36,349
every parameter that goes into a figure
or something right you kind of sometimes

10284
03:02:36,349 --> 03:02:36,359
or something right you kind of sometimes
 

10285
03:02:36,359 --> 03:02:37,309
or something right you kind of sometimes
just need to look at the code and then

10286
03:02:37,309 --> 03:02:37,319
just need to look at the code and then
 

10287
03:02:37,319 --> 03:02:38,870
just need to look at the code and then
it's easy and without that it's hard

10288
03:02:38,870 --> 03:02:38,880
it's easy and without that it's hard
 

10289
03:02:38,880 --> 03:02:41,809
it's easy and without that it's hard
okay so reproducible research means you

10290
03:02:41,809 --> 03:02:41,819
okay so reproducible research means you
 

10291
03:02:41,819 --> 03:02:45,830
okay so reproducible research means you
regenerate the PDF from the code and and

10292
03:02:45,830 --> 03:02:45,840
regenerate the PDF from the code and and
 

10293
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:48,590
regenerate the PDF from the code and and
the data you hit enter okay now

10294
03:02:48,590 --> 03:02:48,600
the data you hit enter okay now
 

10295
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:50,990
the data you hit enter okay now
one issue is that many papers out there

10296
03:02:50,990 --> 03:02:51,000
one issue is that many papers out there
 

10297
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,210
one issue is that many papers out there
science nature Etc are not reproducible

10298
03:02:53,210 --> 03:02:53,220

research moreover the data isn't even

10300
03:02:54,650 --> 03:02:54,660
research moreover the data isn't even
 

10301
03:02:54,660 --> 03:02:56,570
research moreover the data isn't even
public uh moreover sometimes the paper

10302
03:02:56,570 --> 03:02:56,580
public uh moreover sometimes the paper
 

10303
03:02:56,580 --> 03:02:58,370
public uh moreover sometimes the paper
isn't even public the Open Access

10304
03:02:58,370 --> 03:02:58,380
isn't even public the Open Access

10307
03:02:59,880 --> 03:03:01,550

03:03:01,560 --> 03:03:03,530
last 27 years there's various levels of
this like green and gold Open Access

10310
03:03:03,530 --> 03:03:03,540
this like green and gold Open Access
 

10311
03:03:03,540 --> 03:03:07,429
this like green and gold Open Access
okay so the first step is the code the

10312
03:03:07,429 --> 03:03:07,439
okay so the first step is the code the
 

10313
03:03:07,439 --> 03:03:10,250
okay so the first step is the code the
data and the PDF go on chain step number

10314
03:03:10,250 --> 03:03:10,260
data and the PDF go on chain step number
 

10315
03:03:10,260 --> 03:03:12,650
data and the PDF go on chain step number
one okay the second thing is once you've

10316
03:03:12,650 --> 03:03:12,660
one okay the second thing is once you've
 

10317
03:03:12,660 --> 03:03:15,349
one okay the second thing is once you've
got so you can anybody who is and that

10318
03:03:15,349 --> 03:03:15,359
got so you can anybody who is and that
 

10319
03:03:15,359 --> 03:03:16,550
got so you can anybody who is and that
could be the ethereum chain it could be

10320
03:03:16,550 --> 03:03:16,560
could be the ethereum chain it could be
 

10321
03:03:16,560 --> 03:03:18,650
could be the ethereum chain it could be
its own dedicated chain whatever okay it

10322
03:03:18,650 --> 03:03:18,660
its own dedicated chain whatever okay it
 

10323
03:03:18,660 --> 03:03:20,510
its own dedicated chain whatever okay it
could be something where there's a just

10324
03:03:20,510 --> 03:03:20,520
could be something where there's a just
 

10325
03:03:20,520 --> 03:03:22,070
could be something where there's a just
the URLs or on the ethereum chain and

10326
03:03:22,070 --> 03:03:22,080
the URLs or on the ethereum chain and
 

10327
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:23,150
the URLs or on the ethereum chain and
stored on filecoin many different

10328
03:03:23,150 --> 03:03:23,160
stored on filecoin many different
 

10329
03:03:23,160 --> 03:03:24,650
stored on filecoin many different
implementations but let's call that on

10330
03:03:24,650 --> 03:03:24,660
implementations but let's call that on
 

10331
03:03:24,660 --> 03:03:26,210
implementations but let's call that on
chain broadly okay

10332
03:03:26,210 --> 03:03:26,220
chain broadly okay
 

10333
03:03:26,220 --> 03:03:28,070
chain broadly okay
not just online on chain when it's on

10334
03:03:28,070 --> 03:03:28,080
not just online on chain when it's on
 

10335
03:03:28,080 --> 03:03:30,530
not just online on chain when it's on
chain it's public and anybody can get it

10336
03:03:30,530 --> 03:03:30,540
chain it's public and anybody can get it
 

10337
03:03:30,540 --> 03:03:33,170
chain it's public and anybody can get it
so that's first second is once you've

10338
03:03:33,170 --> 03:03:33,180
so that's first second is once you've
 

10339
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:34,849
so that's first second is once you've
got something where you can regenerate

10340
03:03:34,849 --> 03:03:34,859
got something where you can regenerate
 

10341
03:03:34,859 --> 03:03:36,349
got something where you can regenerate
the code

10342
03:03:36,349 --> 03:03:36,359
the code
 

10343
03:03:36,359 --> 03:03:38,450
the code
um or the PDF from the code and the data

10344
03:03:38,450 --> 03:03:38,460
um or the PDF from the code and the data
 

10345
03:03:38,460 --> 03:03:41,870
um or the PDF from the code and the data
on chain guess what you can have uh

10346
03:03:41,870 --> 03:03:41,880
on chain guess what you can have uh
 

10347
03:03:41,880 --> 03:03:44,269
on chain guess what you can have uh
citations between two papers turn into

10348
03:03:44,269 --> 03:03:44,279
citations between two papers turn into
 

10349
03:03:44,279 --> 03:03:46,910
citations between two papers turn into
import statements yeah that's funny

10350
03:03:46,910 --> 03:03:46,920
import statements yeah that's funny
 

10351
03:03:46,920 --> 03:03:49,370
import statements yeah that's funny
that's cool right so now you're not just

10352
03:03:49,370 --> 03:03:49,380
that's cool right so now you're not just
 

10353
03:03:49,380 --> 03:03:52,190
that's cool right so now you're not just
getting composable Finance like D5 where

10354
03:03:52,190 --> 03:03:52,200
getting composable Finance like D5 where
 

10355
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:53,389
getting composable Finance like D5 where
you have like one interest rate

10356
03:03:53,389 --> 03:03:53,399
you have like one interest rate
 

10357
03:03:53,399 --> 03:03:55,429
you have like one interest rate
calculator calling another

10358
03:03:55,429 --> 03:03:55,439
calculator calling another
 

10359
03:03:55,439 --> 03:03:57,410
calculator calling another
you have composable science

10360
03:03:57,410 --> 03:03:57,420
you have composable science
 

10361
03:03:57,420 --> 03:03:59,990
you have composable science
and now you can say this paper on this

10362
03:03:59,990 --> 03:04:00,000
and now you can say this paper on this
 

10363
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:03,110
and now you can say this paper on this
especially in ml right you'll often cite

10364
03:04:03,110 --> 03:04:03,120
especially in ml right you'll often cite
 

10365
03:04:03,120 --> 03:04:05,090
especially in ml right you'll often cite
a previous paper in its Benchmark or its

10366
03:04:05,090 --> 03:04:05,100
a previous paper in its Benchmark or its
 

10367
03:04:05,100 --> 03:04:06,290
a previous paper in its Benchmark or its
method right you're gonna You're Gonna

10368
03:04:06,290 --> 03:04:06,300
method right you're gonna You're Gonna
 

10369
03:04:06,300 --> 03:04:08,570
method right you're gonna You're Gonna
Wanna scatter plot sometimes your paper

10370
03:04:08,570 --> 03:04:08,580
Wanna scatter plot sometimes your paper
 

10371
03:04:08,580 --> 03:04:10,550
Wanna scatter plot sometimes your paper
your algorithm versus theirs on the same

10372
03:04:10,550 --> 03:04:10,560
your algorithm versus theirs on the same
 

10373
03:04:10,560 --> 03:04:13,849
your algorithm versus theirs on the same
data set that is facilitated if their

10374
03:04:13,849 --> 03:04:13,859
data set that is facilitated if their
 

10375
03:04:13,859 --> 03:04:17,389
data set that is facilitated if their
entire paper is reproducible research

10376
03:04:17,389 --> 03:04:17,399
entire paper is reproducible research
 

10377
03:04:17,399 --> 03:04:18,950
entire paper is reproducible research
that is generated you can just literally

10378
03:04:18,950 --> 03:04:18,960
that is generated you can just literally
 

10379
03:04:18,960 --> 03:04:21,230
that is generated you can just literally
import that Python and you know then you

10380
03:04:21,230 --> 03:04:21,240
import that Python and you know then you
 

10381
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:22,969
import that Python and you know then you
can you can generate your figure off of

10382
03:04:22,969 --> 03:04:22,979
can you can generate your figure off of
 

10383
03:04:22,979 --> 03:04:25,070
can you can generate your figure off of
it right moreover think about how that

10384
03:04:25,070 --> 03:04:25,080
it right moreover think about how that
 

10385
03:04:25,080 --> 03:04:27,230
it right moreover think about how that
aids reproducibility because you don't

10386
03:04:27,230 --> 03:04:27,240
aids reproducibility because you don't
 

10387
03:04:27,240 --> 03:04:29,210
aids reproducibility because you don't
have to reproduce in in the literal

10388
03:04:29,210 --> 03:04:29,220
have to reproduce in in the literal
 

10389
03:04:29,220 --> 03:04:31,250
have to reproduce in in the literal
sense every single snippet of code that

10390
03:04:31,250 --> 03:04:31,260
sense every single snippet of code that
 

10391
03:04:31,260 --> 03:04:32,510
sense every single snippet of code that
they did you can literally use their

10392
03:04:32,510 --> 03:04:32,520
they did you can literally use their
 

10393
03:04:32,520 --> 03:04:34,490
they did you can literally use their
code import it okay people start

10394
03:04:34,490 --> 03:04:34,500
code import it okay people start
 

10395
03:04:34,500 --> 03:04:35,809
code import it okay people start
compounding on each other it's better

10396
03:04:35,809 --> 03:04:35,819
compounding on each other it's better
 

10397
03:04:35,819 --> 03:04:38,990
compounding on each other it's better
science okay now I talked about this but

10398
03:04:38,990 --> 03:04:39,000
science okay now I talked about this but
 

10399
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:40,130
science okay now I talked about this but
actually there's a few folks who have

10400
03:04:40,130 --> 03:04:40,140
actually there's a few folks who have
 

10401
03:04:40,140 --> 03:04:41,750
actually there's a few folks who have
been actually building this

10402
03:04:41,750 --> 03:04:41,760
been actually building this
 

10403
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:42,349
been actually building this
um

10404
03:04:42,349 --> 03:04:42,359
um
 

10405
03:04:42,359 --> 03:04:45,650
um
so there's use scholar.org which

10406
03:04:45,650 --> 03:04:45,660
so there's use scholar.org which
 

10407
03:04:45,660 --> 03:04:47,450
so there's use scholar.org which
actually has a demo of this like just a

10408
03:04:47,450 --> 03:04:47,460
actually has a demo of this like just a
 

10409
03:04:47,460 --> 03:04:49,429
actually has a demo of this like just a
V1 like kind of prototype where it shows

10410
03:04:49,429 --> 03:04:49,439
V1 like kind of prototype where it shows
 

10411
03:04:49,439 --> 03:04:52,790
V1 like kind of prototype where it shows
two stats papers on chain

10412
03:04:52,790 --> 03:04:52,800
two stats papers on chain
 

10413
03:04:52,800 --> 03:04:55,190
two stats papers on chain
um and uh one of them is citing the

10414
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:55,200
um and uh one of them is citing the
 

10415
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:56,450
um and uh one of them is citing the
other with an import statement there's

10416
03:04:56,450 --> 03:04:56,460
other with an import statement there's
 

10417
03:04:56,460 --> 03:04:58,429
other with an import statement there's
also a thing like called I think dsi.com

10418
03:04:58,429 --> 03:04:58,439
also a thing like called I think dsi.com
 

10419
03:04:58,439 --> 03:04:59,750
also a thing like called I think dsi.com
which is trying to do this all right

10420
03:04:59,750 --> 03:04:59,760
which is trying to do this all right
 

10421
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:02,389
which is trying to do this all right
decentralized science so

10422
03:05:02,389 --> 03:05:02,399
decentralized science so
 

10423
03:05:02,399 --> 03:05:04,309
decentralized science so
this itself changes how we think about

10424
03:05:04,309 --> 03:05:04,319
this itself changes how we think about
 

10425
03:05:04,319 --> 03:05:06,530
this itself changes how we think about
papers and actually by the way

10426
03:05:06,530 --> 03:05:06,540
papers and actually by the way
 

10427
03:05:06,540 --> 03:05:09,650
papers and actually by the way
um the inspiration for pagerank was

10428
03:05:09,650 --> 03:05:09,660
um the inspiration for pagerank was
 

10429
03:05:09,660 --> 03:05:11,330
um the inspiration for pagerank was
actually citations it was like the

10430
03:05:11,330 --> 03:05:11,340
actually citations it was like the
 

10431
03:05:11,340 --> 03:05:12,530
actually citations it was like the
impact factor out of Academia that's

10432
03:05:12,530 --> 03:05:12,540
impact factor out of Academia that's
 

10433
03:05:12,540 --> 03:05:14,150
impact factor out of Academia that's
where Larry Page and sergeyman got the

10434
03:05:14,150 --> 03:05:14,160
where Larry Page and sergeyman got the
 

10435
03:05:14,160 --> 03:05:17,269
where Larry Page and sergeyman got the
concept out of right so now you've got a

10436
03:05:17,269 --> 03:05:17,279
concept out of right so now you've got a
 

10437
03:05:17,279 --> 03:05:19,070
concept out of right so now you've got a
web of citations that are import

10438
03:05:19,070 --> 03:05:19,080
web of citations that are import
 

10439
03:05:19,080 --> 03:05:21,410
web of citations that are import
statements on chain in theory you could

10440
03:05:21,410 --> 03:05:21,420
statements on chain in theory you could
 

10441
03:05:21,420 --> 03:05:23,389
statements on chain in theory you could
track back a paper all the way back to

10442
03:05:23,389 --> 03:05:23,399
track back a paper all the way back to
 

10443
03:05:23,399 --> 03:05:24,830
track back a paper all the way back to
its antecedents

10444
03:05:24,830 --> 03:05:24,840
its antecedents
 

10445
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:27,410
its antecedents
okay so if it's citing something you can

10446
03:05:27,410 --> 03:05:27,420
okay so if it's citing something you can
 

10447
03:05:27,420 --> 03:05:28,730
okay so if it's citing something you can
now look it up and look it up and look

10448
03:05:28,730 --> 03:05:28,740
now look it up and look it up and look
 

10449
03:05:28,740 --> 03:05:32,510
now look it up and look it up and look
it up and a surprising number of papers

10450
03:05:32,510 --> 03:05:32,520
it up and a surprising number of papers
 

10451
03:05:32,520 --> 03:05:34,190
it up and a surprising number of papers
actually

10452
03:05:34,190 --> 03:05:34,200
actually
 

10453
03:05:34,200 --> 03:05:35,570
actually
um you know their antecedents don't

10454
03:05:35,570 --> 03:05:35,580
um you know their antecedents don't
 

10455
03:05:35,580 --> 03:05:37,309
um you know their antecedents don't
terminate or the the original Source

10456
03:05:37,309 --> 03:05:37,319
terminate or the the original Source
 

10457
03:05:37,319 --> 03:05:38,809
terminate or the the original Source
says something different or it just kind

10458
03:05:38,809 --> 03:05:38,819
says something different or it just kind
 

10459
03:05:38,819 --> 03:05:41,269
says something different or it just kind
of got garbled like a telephone game and

10460
03:05:41,269 --> 03:05:41,279
of got garbled like a telephone game and
 

10461
03:05:41,279 --> 03:05:43,010
of got garbled like a telephone game and
uh you know there's this famous thing on

10462
03:05:43,010 --> 03:05:43,020
uh you know there's this famous thing on
 

10463
03:05:43,020 --> 03:05:45,110
uh you know there's this famous thing on
like uh the spinach

10464
03:05:45,110 --> 03:05:45,120
like uh the spinach
 

10465
03:05:45,120 --> 03:05:47,630
like uh the spinach
um like uh it does actually have iron in

10466
03:05:47,630 --> 03:05:47,640
um like uh it does actually have iron in
 

10467
03:05:47,640 --> 03:05:49,610
um like uh it does actually have iron in
it or something like that I I forget the

10468
03:05:49,610 --> 03:05:49,620
it or something like that I I forget the
 

10469
03:05:49,620 --> 03:05:50,929
it or something like that I I forget the
details on this story but it was

10470
03:05:50,929 --> 03:05:50,939
details on this story but it was
 

10471
03:05:50,939 --> 03:05:51,889
details on this story but it was
something where you track back the

10472
03:05:51,889 --> 03:05:51,899
something where you track back the
 

10473
03:05:51,899 --> 03:05:53,630
something where you track back the
citations and people are contradicting

10474
03:05:53,630 --> 03:05:53,640
citations and people are contradicting
 

10475
03:05:53,640 --> 03:05:55,190
citations and people are contradicting
each other okay but it's just something

10476
03:05:55,190 --> 03:05:55,200
each other okay but it's just something
 

10477
03:05:55,200 --> 03:05:56,870
each other okay but it's just something
that just gets copy pasted and it's a

10478
03:05:56,870 --> 03:05:56,880
that just gets copy pasted and it's a
 

10479
03:05:56,880 --> 03:05:58,130
that just gets copy pasted and it's a
fact that's not actually a fact because

10480
03:05:58,130 --> 03:05:58,140
fact that's not actually a fact because
 

10481
03:05:58,140 --> 03:06:00,349
fact that's not actually a fact because
it's not audited properly this allows

10482
03:06:00,349 --> 03:06:00,359
it's not audited properly this allows
 

10483
03:06:00,359 --> 03:06:02,929
it's not audited properly this allows
you to cheaply audit in theory all the

10484
03:06:02,929 --> 03:06:02,939
you to cheaply audit in theory all the
 

10485
03:06:02,939 --> 03:06:04,370
you to cheaply audit in theory all the
way back to Maxwell or Newton or

10486
03:06:04,370 --> 03:06:04,380
way back to Maxwell or Newton or
 

10487
03:06:04,380 --> 03:06:06,410
way back to Maxwell or Newton or
something like that okay now what I'm

10488
03:06:06,410 --> 03:06:06,420
something like that okay now what I'm
 

10489
03:06:06,420 --> 03:06:08,269
something like that okay now what I'm
describing is a big problem but it's a

10490
03:06:08,269 --> 03:06:08,279
describing is a big problem but it's a
 

10491
03:06:08,279 --> 03:06:10,130
describing is a big problem but it's a
finite problem it's essentially taking

10492
03:06:10,130 --> 03:06:10,140
finite problem it's essentially taking
 

10493
03:06:10,140 --> 03:06:12,710
finite problem it's essentially taking
all the important papers and putting

10494
03:06:12,710 --> 03:06:12,720
all the important papers and putting
 

10495
03:06:12,720 --> 03:06:14,030
all the important papers and putting
them on chain it's about the scale of

10496
03:06:14,030 --> 03:06:14,040
them on chain it's about the scale of
 

10497
03:06:14,040 --> 03:06:16,849
them on chain it's about the scale of
let's say Wikipedia okay so it's like I

10498
03:06:16,849 --> 03:06:16,859
let's say Wikipedia okay so it's like I
 

10499
03:06:16,859 --> 03:06:17,929
let's say Wikipedia okay so it's like I
don't know a few hundred thousand a few

10500
03:06:17,929 --> 03:06:17,939
don't know a few hundred thousand a few
 

10501
03:06:17,939 --> 03:06:19,190
don't know a few hundred thousand a few
million papers I don't know the exact

10502
03:06:19,190 --> 03:06:19,200
million papers I don't know the exact
 

10503
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:20,450
million papers I don't know the exact
number but it'll be out of that level

10504
03:06:20,450 --> 03:06:20,460
number but it'll be out of that level
 

10505
03:06:20,460 --> 03:06:22,790
number but it'll be out of that level
okay so now you've got number one

10506
03:06:22,790 --> 03:06:22,800
okay so now you've got number one
 

10507
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:24,410
okay so now you've got number one
these things that are they're on chain

10508
03:06:24,410 --> 03:06:24,420
these things that are they're on chain
 

10509
03:06:24,420 --> 03:06:26,389
these things that are they're on chain
okay number two they're you've turned

10510
03:06:26,389 --> 03:06:26,399
okay number two they're you've turned
 

10511
03:06:26,399 --> 03:06:28,490
okay number two they're you've turned
citations into import statements number

10512
03:06:28,490 --> 03:06:28,500
citations into import statements number
 

10513
03:06:28,500 --> 03:06:29,990
citations into import statements number
three anybody

10514
03:06:29,990 --> 03:06:30,000
three anybody
 

10515
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,990
three anybody
can now at a minimum download that code

10516
03:06:32,990 --> 03:06:33,000
can now at a minimum download that code
 

10517
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,969
can now at a minimum download that code
and while they may not have the

10518
03:06:34,969 --> 03:06:34,979
and while they may not have the
 

10519
03:06:34,979 --> 03:06:36,110
and while they may not have the
instruments and I'll come back to that

10520
03:06:36,110 --> 03:06:36,120
instruments and I'll come back to that
 

10521
03:06:36,120 --> 03:06:37,490
instruments and I'll come back to that
point but let me know the instruments

10522
03:06:37,490 --> 03:06:37,500
point but let me know the instruments
 

10523
03:06:37,500 --> 03:06:38,750
point but let me know the instruments
they can do internal checks the

10524
03:06:38,750 --> 03:06:38,760
they can do internal checks the
 

10525
03:06:38,760 --> 03:06:40,070
they can do internal checks the
benford's law stuff we were just talking

10526
03:06:40,070 --> 03:06:40,080
benford's law stuff we were just talking
 

10527
03:06:40,080 --> 03:06:41,030
benford's law stuff we were just talking
about

10528
03:06:41,030 --> 03:06:41,040
about
 

10529
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:43,070
about
you can internally check the consistency

10530
03:06:43,070 --> 03:06:43,080
you can internally check the consistency
 

10531
03:06:43,080 --> 03:06:45,170
you can internally check the consistency
of these tables and graphs and often

10532
03:06:45,170 --> 03:06:45,180
of these tables and graphs and often
 

10533
03:06:45,180 --> 03:06:46,849
of these tables and graphs and often
you'll find fraud or things that don't

10534
03:06:46,849 --> 03:06:46,859
you'll find fraud or things that don't
 

10535
03:06:46,859 --> 03:06:48,290
you'll find fraud or things that don't
add up that way because all the code and

10536
03:06:48,290 --> 03:06:48,300
add up that way because all the code and
 

10537
03:06:48,300 --> 03:06:51,590
add up that way because all the code and
the data is is there right and now

10538
03:06:51,590 --> 03:06:51,600
the data is is there right and now
 

10539
03:06:51,600 --> 03:06:53,990
the data is is there right and now
you've made it so that anybody in Brazil

10540
03:06:53,990 --> 03:06:54,000
you've made it so that anybody in Brazil
 

10541
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:55,370
you've made it so that anybody in Brazil
in India and Nigeria they may not have

10542
03:06:55,370 --> 03:06:55,380
in India and Nigeria they may not have
 

10543
03:06:55,380 --> 03:06:58,130
in India and Nigeria they may not have
an academic you know like uh Library

10544
03:06:58,130 --> 03:06:58,140
an academic you know like uh Library
 

10545
03:06:58,140 --> 03:06:59,750
an academic you know like uh Library
access is on but they can get into this

10546
03:06:59,750 --> 03:06:59,760
access is on but they can get into this
 

10547
03:06:59,760 --> 03:07:02,210
access is on but they can get into this
all right now how do you fund all this

10548
03:07:02,210 --> 03:07:02,220
all right now how do you fund all this
 

10549
03:07:02,220 --> 03:07:03,530
all right now how do you fund all this
well

10550
03:07:03,530 --> 03:07:03,540
well
 

10551
03:07:03,540 --> 03:07:05,090
well
good thing is crypto actually allows

10552
03:07:05,090 --> 03:07:05,100
good thing is crypto actually allows
 

10553
03:07:05,100 --> 03:07:06,530
good thing is crypto actually allows
tools for that as well Andrew huberman

10554
03:07:06,530 --> 03:07:06,540
tools for that as well Andrew huberman
 

10555
03:07:06,540 --> 03:07:07,670
tools for that as well Andrew huberman
and others have started doing things

10556
03:07:07,670 --> 03:07:07,680
and others have started doing things
 

10557
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:10,070
and others have started doing things
like with nfts

10558
03:07:10,070 --> 03:07:10,080
like with nfts
 

10559
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:11,510
like with nfts
um to fund their lab I can talk about

10560
03:07:11,510 --> 03:07:11,520
um to fund their lab I can talk about
 

10561
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:12,969
um to fund their lab I can talk about
the funding aspect there's things like

10562
03:07:12,969 --> 03:07:12,979
the funding aspect there's things like
 

10563
03:07:12,979 --> 03:07:15,110
the funding aspect there's things like
researchhub.com which are trying to

10564
03:07:15,110 --> 03:07:15,120
researchhub.com which are trying to
 

10565
03:07:15,120 --> 03:07:17,389
researchhub.com which are trying to
issue tokens for labs but a lab isn't

10566
03:07:17,389 --> 03:07:17,399
issue tokens for labs but a lab isn't
 

10567
03:07:17,399 --> 03:07:18,830
issue tokens for labs but a lab isn't
that expensive to fund maybe it's a few

10568
03:07:18,830 --> 03:07:18,840
that expensive to fund maybe it's a few
 

10569
03:07:18,840 --> 03:07:20,030
that expensive to fund maybe it's a few
hundred thousand a few million a year

10570
03:07:20,030 --> 03:07:20,040
hundred thousand a few million a year
 

10571
03:07:20,040 --> 03:07:22,070
hundred thousand a few million a year
depending on where you are crypto does

10572
03:07:22,070 --> 03:07:22,080
depending on where you are crypto does
 

10573
03:07:22,080 --> 03:07:24,170
depending on where you are crypto does
generate money and so you can probably

10574
03:07:24,170 --> 03:07:24,180
generate money and so you can probably
 

10575
03:07:24,180 --> 03:07:25,910
generate money and so you can probably
imagine various tools whether it's

10576
03:07:25,910 --> 03:07:25,920
imagine various tools whether it's
 

10577
03:07:25,920 --> 03:07:27,710
imagine various tools whether it's
tokens or nfts or something like that to

10578
03:07:27,710 --> 03:07:27,720
tokens or nfts or something like that to
 

10579
03:07:27,720 --> 03:07:28,550
tokens or nfts or something like that to
fund

10580
03:07:28,550 --> 03:07:28,560
fund
 

10581
03:07:28,560 --> 03:07:30,170
fund
finally

10582
03:07:30,170 --> 03:07:30,180
finally
 

10583
03:07:30,180 --> 03:07:33,650
finally
um what this does is it is not Q Anon

10584
03:07:33,650 --> 03:07:33,660
um what this does is it is not Q Anon
 

10585
03:07:33,660 --> 03:07:35,269
um what this does is it is not Q Anon
right it is not saying don't trust

10586
03:07:35,269 --> 03:07:35,279
right it is not saying don't trust
 

10587
03:07:35,279 --> 03:07:37,969
right it is not saying don't trust
anybody neither is it just trust the

10588
03:07:37,969 --> 03:07:37,979
anybody neither is it just trust the
 

10589
03:07:37,979 --> 03:07:39,590
anybody neither is it just trust the
centralized academic establishment

10590
03:07:39,590 --> 03:07:39,600
centralized academic establishment
 

10591
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:42,110
centralized academic establishment
instead of saying trust because you can

10592
03:07:42,110 --> 03:07:42,120
instead of saying trust because you can
 

10593
03:07:42,120 --> 03:07:44,150
instead of saying trust because you can
verify because we can download things

10594
03:07:44,150 --> 03:07:44,160
verify because we can download things
 

10595
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:46,070
verify because we can download things
and run them The crucial thing that I'm

10596
03:07:46,070 --> 03:07:46,080
and run them The crucial thing that I'm
 

10597
03:07:46,080 --> 03:07:48,590
and run them The crucial thing that I'm
assuming here is the billions of

10598
03:07:48,590 --> 03:07:48,600
assuming here is the billions of
 

10599
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:50,389
assuming here is the billions of
supercomputers around the world that we

10600
03:07:50,389 --> 03:07:50,399
supercomputers around the world that we
 

10601
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:52,670
supercomputers around the world that we
have all the MacBooks and iPhones that

10602
03:07:52,670 --> 03:07:52,680
have all the MacBooks and iPhones that
 

10603
03:07:52,680 --> 03:07:53,990
have all the MacBooks and iPhones that
can crank through lots and lots of

10604
03:07:53,990 --> 03:07:54,000
can crank through lots and lots of
 

10605
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,870
can crank through lots and lots of
computation so everything digital we can

10606
03:07:56,870 --> 03:07:56,880
computation so everything digital we can
 

10607
03:07:56,880 --> 03:07:59,570
computation so everything digital we can
verify it locally okay now there's one

10608
03:07:59,570 --> 03:07:59,580
verify it locally okay now there's one
 

10609
03:07:59,580 --> 03:08:01,190
verify it locally okay now there's one
last step which is I mentioned the

10610
03:08:01,190 --> 03:08:01,200
last step which is I mentioned the
 

10611
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:02,690
last step which is I mentioned the
instruments right whether it's your

10612
03:08:02,690 --> 03:08:02,700
instruments right whether it's your
 

10613
03:08:02,700 --> 03:08:05,809
instruments right whether it's your
sequencing machine or your accelerometer

10614
03:08:05,809 --> 03:08:05,819
sequencing machine or your accelerometer
 

10615

or something like that is generating the

10616
03:08:07,490 --> 03:08:07,500
or something like that is generating the
 

10617
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:09,590
or something like that is generating the
data that you are reporting in your

10618
03:08:09,590 --> 03:08:09,600
data that you are reporting in your
 

10619
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:11,170
data that you are reporting in your
paper when you put it on channel okay

10620
03:08:11,170 --> 03:08:11,180
paper when you put it on channel okay
 

10621
03:08:11,180 --> 03:08:13,130
paper when you put it on channel okay
basically you think that's the analog

10622
03:08:13,130 --> 03:08:13,140
basically you think that's the analog
 

10623
03:08:13,140 --> 03:08:14,389
basically you think that's the analog
digital interface

10624
03:08:14,389 --> 03:08:14,399
digital interface
 

10625
03:08:14,399 --> 03:08:17,330
digital interface
we can crypto find that too why

10626
03:08:17,330 --> 03:08:17,340
we can crypto find that too why
 

10627
03:08:17,340 --> 03:08:19,190
we can crypto find that too why
for example an Illumina sequencing

10628
03:08:19,190 --> 03:08:19,200
for example an Illumina sequencing
 

10629
03:08:19,200 --> 03:08:22,550
for example an Illumina sequencing
machine has an experiment manifest and

10630
03:08:22,550 --> 03:08:22,560
machine has an experiment manifest and
 

10631
03:08:22,560 --> 03:08:24,950
machine has an experiment manifest and
when uh that's written to there's a

10632
03:08:24,950 --> 03:08:24,960
when uh that's written to there's a
 

10633
03:08:24,960 --> 03:08:27,170
when uh that's written to there's a
website called ncbi National Center for

10634
03:08:27,170 --> 03:08:27,180
website called ncbi National Center for
 

10635
03:08:27,180 --> 03:08:29,090
website called ncbi National Center for
biotechnology information you can see

10636
03:08:29,090 --> 03:08:29,100
biotechnology information you can see
 

10637
03:08:29,100 --> 03:08:30,889
biotechnology information you can see
the experiment metadata

10638
03:08:30,889 --> 03:08:30,899
the experiment metadata
 

10639
03:08:30,899 --> 03:08:33,170
the experiment metadata
on various sequencing runs it'll tell

10640
03:08:33,170 --> 03:08:33,180
on various sequencing runs it'll tell
 

10641
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:35,389
on various sequencing runs it'll tell
you what instrument and what time it was

10642
03:08:35,389 --> 03:08:35,399
you what instrument and what time it was
 

10643
03:08:35,399 --> 03:08:37,070
you what instrument and what time it was
Ron and who ran it and so and so forth

10644
03:08:37,070 --> 03:08:37,080
Ron and who ran it and so and so forth
 

10645
03:08:37,080 --> 03:08:38,870
Ron and who ran it and so and so forth
okay

10646
03:08:38,870 --> 03:08:38,880
okay
 

10647
03:08:38,880 --> 03:08:40,610
okay
what that does is allows you to correct

10648
03:08:40,610 --> 03:08:40,620
what that does is allows you to correct
 

10649
03:08:40,620 --> 03:08:42,410
what that does is allows you to correct
for things like batch effects sometimes

10650
03:08:42,410 --> 03:08:42,420
for things like batch effects sometimes
 

10651
03:08:42,420 --> 03:08:44,330
for things like batch effects sometimes
you will sequence on this day and the

10652
03:08:44,330 --> 03:08:44,340
you will sequence on this day and the
 

10653
03:08:44,340 --> 03:08:45,590
you will sequence on this day and the
next day and maybe the humidity or

10654
03:08:45,590 --> 03:08:45,600
next day and maybe the humidity or
 

10655
03:08:45,600 --> 03:08:47,570
next day and maybe the humidity or
something like that makes it look like

10656
03:08:47,570 --> 03:08:47,580
something like that makes it look like
 

10657
03:08:47,580 --> 03:08:48,769
something like that makes it look like
there's a ciscally significant

10658
03:08:48,769 --> 03:08:48,779
there's a ciscally significant
 

10659
03:08:48,779 --> 03:08:50,210
there's a ciscally significant
difference between your two results but

10660
03:08:50,210 --> 03:08:50,220
difference between your two results but
 

10661
03:08:50,220 --> 03:08:53,150
difference between your two results but
it was just actually batch effects okay

10662
03:08:53,150 --> 03:08:53,160
it was just actually batch effects okay
 

10663
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:56,090
it was just actually batch effects okay
what's my point point is if you have a

10664
03:08:56,090 --> 03:08:56,100
what's my point point is if you have a
 

10665
03:08:56,100 --> 03:08:57,230
what's my point point is if you have a
crypto instrument

10666
03:08:57,230 --> 03:08:57,240
crypto instrument
 

10667
03:08:57,240 --> 03:08:59,690
crypto instrument
you can have you know various hashes and

10668
03:08:59,690 --> 03:08:59,700
you can have you know various hashes and
 

10669
03:08:59,700 --> 03:09:01,969
you can have you know various hashes and
stuff of the data as a chain of custody

10670
03:09:01,969 --> 03:09:01,979
stuff of the data as a chain of custody
 

10671
03:09:01,979 --> 03:09:03,769
stuff of the data as a chain of custody
for the data itself that are streamed

10672
03:09:03,769 --> 03:09:03,779
for the data itself that are streamed
 

10673
03:09:03,779 --> 03:09:05,450
for the data itself that are streamed
and written on chain that the

10674
03:09:05,450 --> 03:09:05,460
and written on chain that the
 

10675
03:09:05,460 --> 03:09:07,550
and written on chain that the
manufacturer can program into this for

10676
03:09:07,550 --> 03:09:07,560
manufacturer can program into this for
 

10677
03:09:07,560 --> 03:09:08,389
manufacturer can program into this for
anything that's really anything you

10678
03:09:08,389 --> 03:09:08,399
anything that's really anything you
 

10679
03:09:08,399 --> 03:09:10,190
anything that's really anything you
might say well boy that's Overkill right

10680
03:09:10,190 --> 03:09:10,200
might say well boy that's Overkill right
 

10681
03:09:10,200 --> 03:09:12,469
might say well boy that's Overkill right
I'm saying actually not you know why if

10682
03:09:12,469 --> 03:09:12,479
I'm saying actually not you know why if
 

10683
03:09:12,479 --> 03:09:14,870
I'm saying actually not you know why if
you're doing a study whose results are

10684
03:09:14,870 --> 03:09:14,880
you're doing a study whose results are
 

10685
03:09:14,880 --> 03:09:16,490
you're doing a study whose results are
going to be used to influence a policy

10686
03:09:16,490 --> 03:09:16,500
going to be used to influence a policy
 

10687
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:17,750
going to be used to influence a policy
that's going to control the lives of

10688
03:09:17,750 --> 03:09:17,760
that's going to control the lives of
 

10689
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:20,450
that's going to control the lives of
millions of people every single step has

10690
03:09:20,450 --> 03:09:20,460
millions of people every single step has
 

10691
03:09:20,460 --> 03:09:22,010
millions of people every single step has
to be totally audible you need the glass

10692
03:09:22,010 --> 03:09:22,020
to be totally audible you need the glass
 

10693
03:09:22,020 --> 03:09:24,349
to be totally audible you need the glass
box model you need to be able to go back

10694
03:09:24,349 --> 03:09:24,359
box model you need to be able to go back
 

10695
03:09:24,359 --> 03:09:26,389
box model you need to be able to go back
to the raw data you need to be able to

10696
03:09:26,389 --> 03:09:26,399
to the raw data you need to be able to
 

10697
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:29,330
to the raw data you need to be able to
interrogate that and again this is

10698
03:09:29,330 --> 03:09:29,340
interrogate that and again this is
 

10699
03:09:29,340 --> 03:09:31,790
interrogate that and again this is
anybody who's a good scientist will

10700
03:09:31,790 --> 03:09:31,800
anybody who's a good scientist will
 

10701
03:09:31,800 --> 03:09:34,730
anybody who's a good scientist will
Embrace this right yeah so first of all

10702
03:09:34,730 --> 03:09:34,740
Embrace this right yeah so first of all
 

10703
03:09:34,740 --> 03:09:37,130
Embrace this right yeah so first of all
those a brilliant exposition of a future

10704
03:09:37,130 --> 03:09:37,140
those a brilliant exposition of a future
 

10705
03:09:37,140 --> 03:09:39,290
those a brilliant exposition of a future
of science that I would love to see

10706
03:09:39,290 --> 03:09:39,300
of science that I would love to see
 

10707
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:41,389
of science that I would love to see
um the the pushback I'll provide which

10708
03:09:41,389 --> 03:09:41,399
um the the pushback I'll provide which
 

10709
03:09:41,399 --> 03:09:44,450
um the the pushback I'll provide which
is not really a pushback is like

10710
03:09:44,450 --> 03:09:44,460
is not really a pushback is like
 

10711
03:09:44,460 --> 03:09:47,269
is not really a pushback is like
what you describe is so much better than

10712
03:09:47,269 --> 03:09:47,279
what you describe is so much better than
 

10713
03:09:47,279 --> 03:09:51,530
what you describe is so much better than
what we currently have that I think a

10714
03:09:51,530 --> 03:09:51,540
what we currently have that I think a
 

10715
03:09:51,540 --> 03:09:54,110
what we currently have that I think a
lot of people would say any of the sub

10716
03:09:54,110 --> 03:09:54,120
lot of people would say any of the sub
 

10717
03:09:54,120 --> 03:09:56,929
lot of people would say any of the sub
steps you suggest are already going to

10718
03:09:56,929 --> 03:09:56,939
steps you suggest are already going to
 

10719
03:09:56,939 --> 03:09:59,570
steps you suggest are already going to
be a huge Improvement so even just

10720
03:09:59,570 --> 03:09:59,580
be a huge Improvement so even just
 

10721
03:09:59,580 --> 03:10:02,870
be a huge Improvement so even just
sharing the code yes or sharing the data

10722
03:10:02,870 --> 03:10:02,880
sharing the code yes or sharing the data
 

10723
03:10:02,880 --> 03:10:05,929
sharing the code yes or sharing the data
you said like off it's I think it would

10724
03:10:05,929 --> 03:10:05,939
you said like off it's I think it would
 

10725
03:10:05,939 --> 03:10:08,510
you said like off it's I think it would
surprise people how often it's hard to

10726
03:10:08,510 --> 03:10:08,520
surprise people how often it's hard to
 

10727
03:10:08,520 --> 03:10:11,389
surprise people how often it's hard to
get data uh is it like the actual data

10728
03:10:11,389 --> 03:10:11,399
get data uh is it like the actual data
 

10729
03:10:11,399 --> 03:10:14,090
get data uh is it like the actual data
or specifics or a large number of the

10730
03:10:14,090 --> 03:10:14,100
or specifics or a large number of the
 

10731
03:10:14,100 --> 03:10:16,309
or specifics or a large number of the
parameters not the you'll share like one

10732
03:10:16,309 --> 03:10:16,319
parameters not the you'll share like one
 

10733
03:10:16,319 --> 03:10:18,889
parameters not the you'll share like one
or two parameters that were involved

10734
03:10:18,889 --> 03:10:18,899
or two parameters that were involved
 

10735
03:10:18,899 --> 03:10:21,410
or two parameters that were involved
with running the experiment you won't

10736
03:10:21,410 --> 03:10:21,420
with running the experiment you won't
 

10737
03:10:21,420 --> 03:10:24,290
with running the experiment you won't
mention the machines involved except

10738
03:10:24,290 --> 03:10:24,300
mention the machines involved except
 

10739
03:10:24,300 --> 03:10:26,630
mention the machines involved except
maybe at a higher level but the versions

10740
03:10:26,630 --> 03:10:26,640
maybe at a higher level but the versions
 

10741
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:28,969
maybe at a higher level but the versions
and so on the dates when the experiments

10742
03:10:28,969 --> 03:10:28,979
and so on the dates when the experiments
 

10743
03:10:28,979 --> 03:10:30,410
and so on the dates when the experiments
will run so don't mention any of this

10744
03:10:30,410 --> 03:10:30,420
will run so don't mention any of this
 

10745
03:10:30,420 --> 03:10:33,290
will run so don't mention any of this
kind of stuff right so there's there's

10746
03:10:33,290 --> 03:10:33,300
kind of stuff right so there's there's
 

10747
03:10:33,300 --> 03:10:35,469
kind of stuff right so there's there's
several ways to fix this

10748
03:10:35,469 --> 03:10:35,479
several ways to fix this
 

10749
03:10:35,479 --> 03:10:38,389
several ways to fix this
and one of them

10750
03:10:38,389 --> 03:10:38,399
and one of them
 

10751
03:10:38,399 --> 03:10:40,550
and one of them
I think implied in what you're

10752
03:10:40,550 --> 03:10:40,560
I think implied in what you're
 

10753
03:10:40,560 --> 03:10:42,530
I think implied in what you're
describing is a culture

10754
03:10:42,530 --> 03:10:42,540
describing is a culture
 

10755
03:10:42,540 --> 03:10:45,410
describing is a culture
that says it's not okay

10756
03:10:45,410 --> 03:10:45,420
that says it's not okay
 

10757
03:10:45,420 --> 03:10:48,530
that says it's not okay
exactly to like so first of all there

10758
03:10:48,530 --> 03:10:48,540
exactly to like so first of all there
 

10759
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:50,269
exactly to like so first of all there
should be even if it's not perfectly

10760
03:10:50,269 --> 03:10:50,279
should be even if it's not perfectly
 

10761
03:10:50,279 --> 03:10:52,250
should be even if it's not perfectly
Unchained to where you can automatically

import all the way to Newton

10764
03:10:54,830 --> 03:10:54,840
import all the way to Newton
 

10765
03:10:54,840 --> 03:10:58,610
import all the way to Newton
is it just just even the

10766
03:10:58,610 --> 03:10:58,620
is it just just even the
 

10767
03:10:58,620 --> 03:11:01,070
is it just just even the
the act of sharing the code sharing the

03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:03,889
the act of sharing the code sharing the
data Maybe in a way that's not uh

10770
03:11:03,889 --> 03:11:03,899
data Maybe in a way that's not uh
 

10771
03:11:03,899 --> 03:11:06,050
data Maybe in a way that's not uh
perfectly integrated into a larger

10772
03:11:06,050 --> 03:11:06,060
perfectly integrated into a larger
 

10773
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:08,870
perfectly integrated into a larger
structure is already a very big positive

10774
03:11:08,870 --> 03:11:08,880
structure is already a very big positive
 

10775
03:11:08,880 --> 03:11:12,250
structure is already a very big positive
step saying like if you don't do this

10776
03:11:12,250 --> 03:11:12,260
step saying like if you don't do this
 

10777
03:11:12,260 --> 03:11:13,870
step saying like if you don't do this
then

10778
03:11:13,870 --> 03:11:13,880
then
 

10779
03:11:13,880 --> 03:11:18,290
then
this doesn't count and because in

10780
03:11:18,290 --> 03:11:18,300
this doesn't count and because in
 

10781
03:11:18,300 --> 03:11:21,410
this doesn't count and because in
general I think my worry

10782
03:11:21,410 --> 03:11:21,420
general I think my worry
 

10783
03:11:21,420 --> 03:11:23,929
general I think my worry
uh I you know as somebody who's a

10784
03:11:23,929 --> 03:11:23,939
uh I you know as somebody who's a
 

10785
03:11:23,939 --> 03:11:26,809
uh I you know as somebody who's a
programmer who's OCD I love the the

10786
03:11:26,809 --> 03:11:26,819
programmer who's OCD I love the the
 

10787
03:11:26,819 --> 03:11:28,130
programmer who's OCD I love the the
picture you paint that you can just

10788
03:11:28,130 --> 03:11:28,140
picture you paint that you can just
 

10789
03:11:28,140 --> 03:11:30,170
picture you paint that you can just
import everything into all automatically

10790
03:11:30,170 --> 03:11:30,180
import everything into all automatically
 

10791
03:11:30,180 --> 03:11:32,450
import everything into all automatically
checks everything my my problem is is

10792
03:11:32,450 --> 03:11:32,460
checks everything my my problem is is
 

10793
03:11:32,460 --> 03:11:35,269
checks everything my my problem is is
that makes incremental science easier

10794
03:11:35,269 --> 03:11:35,279
that makes incremental science easier
 

10795
03:11:35,279 --> 03:11:37,969
that makes incremental science easier
and revolutionary science harder oh I

10796
03:11:37,969 --> 03:11:37,979
and revolutionary science harder oh I
 

10797
03:11:37,979 --> 03:11:39,230
and revolutionary science harder oh I
actually very much just screwed that I

10798
03:11:39,230 --> 03:11:39,240
actually very much just screwed that I
 

10799
03:11:39,240 --> 03:11:40,309
actually very much just screwed that I
would love to hear you I'll give you

10800
03:11:40,309 --> 03:11:40,319
would love to hear you I'll give you
 

10801
03:11:40,319 --> 03:11:41,929
would love to hear you I'll give you
guys let me just kind of collaborate

10802
03:11:41,929 --> 03:11:41,939
guys let me just kind of collaborate
 

10803
03:11:41,939 --> 03:11:43,429
guys let me just kind of collaborate
sure

10804
03:11:43,429 --> 03:11:43,439
sure
 

10805
03:11:43,439 --> 03:11:46,910
sure
um why sometimes you have to think in

10806
03:11:46,910 --> 03:11:46,920
um why sometimes you have to think in
 

10807
03:11:46,920 --> 03:11:49,910
um why sometimes you have to think in
this gray area of fuzziness and you're

10808
03:11:49,910 --> 03:11:49,920
this gray area of fuzziness and you're
 

10809
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:52,610
this gray area of fuzziness and you're
thinking in totally novel ideas and when

10810
03:11:52,610 --> 03:11:52,620
thinking in totally novel ideas and when
 

10811
03:11:52,620 --> 03:11:54,950
thinking in totally novel ideas and when
you have to concretize in data like some

10812
03:11:54,950 --> 03:11:54,960
you have to concretize in data like some
 

10813
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:56,269
you have to concretize in data like some
of the greatest papers I've ever written

10814
03:11:56,269 --> 03:11:56,279
of the greatest papers I've ever written
 

10815
03:11:56,279 --> 03:11:58,250
of the greatest papers I've ever written
are they don't have data they're in the

10816
03:11:58,250 --> 03:11:58,260
are they don't have data they're in the
 

10817
03:11:58,260 --> 03:12:01,010
are they don't have data they're in the
space of ideas almost like you're kind

10818
03:12:01,010 --> 03:12:01,020
space of ideas almost like you're kind
 

10819
03:12:01,020 --> 03:12:02,269
space of ideas almost like you're kind
of sketching stuff and there could be

10820
03:12:02,269 --> 03:12:02,279
of sketching stuff and there could be
 

10821
03:12:02,279 --> 03:12:04,610
of sketching stuff and there could be
errors but like Einstein himself with a

10822
03:12:04,610 --> 03:12:04,620
errors but like Einstein himself with a
 

10823
03:12:04,620 --> 03:12:05,929
errors but like Einstein himself with a
famous five papers I mean they're

10824
03:12:05,929 --> 03:12:05,939
famous five papers I mean they're
 

10825
03:12:05,939 --> 03:12:07,610
famous five papers I mean they're
they're really strong but they're

10826
03:12:07,610 --> 03:12:07,620
they're really strong but they're
 

10827
03:12:07,620 --> 03:12:10,070
they're really strong but they're
they're fuzzy they're they're a little

10828
03:12:10,070 --> 03:12:10,080
they're fuzzy they're they're a little
 

10829
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:12,950
they're fuzzy they're they're a little
bit fuzzy and so I I think uh you know

10830
03:12:12,950 --> 03:12:12,960
bit fuzzy and so I I think uh you know
 

10831
03:12:12,960 --> 03:12:15,830
bit fuzzy and so I I think uh you know
even like the Gan paper you're often

10832
03:12:15,830 --> 03:12:15,840
even like the Gan paper you're often
 

10833
03:12:15,840 --> 03:12:18,590
even like the Gan paper you're often
thinking of like new data sets new ideas

10834
03:12:18,590 --> 03:12:18,600
thinking of like new data sets new ideas
 

10835
03:12:18,600 --> 03:12:20,570
thinking of like new data sets new ideas
and

10836
03:12:20,570 --> 03:12:20,580
and
 

10837
03:12:20,580 --> 03:12:23,809
and
I think maybe as a step after the paper

10838
03:12:23,809 --> 03:12:23,819
I think maybe as a step after the paper
 

10839
03:12:23,819 --> 03:12:25,550
I think maybe as a step after the paper
is written you could probably concretize

10840
03:12:25,550 --> 03:12:25,560
is written you could probably concretize
 

10841
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:27,290
is written you could probably concretize
it integrate it into the rest of science

10842
03:12:27,290 --> 03:12:27,300
it integrate it into the rest of science
 

10843
03:12:27,300 --> 03:12:29,030
it integrate it into the rest of science
sure like you shouldn't feel that

10844
03:12:29,030 --> 03:12:29,040
sure like you shouldn't feel that
 

10845
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:31,550
sure like you shouldn't feel that
pressure I guess early on I well I mean

10846
03:12:31,550 --> 03:12:31,560
pressure I guess early on I well I mean
 

10847
03:12:31,560 --> 03:12:33,889
pressure I guess early on I well I mean
there's there's different each each of

10848
03:12:33,889 --> 03:12:33,899
there's there's different each each of
 

10849
03:12:33,899 --> 03:12:35,210
there's there's different each each of
the steps that I'm talking about right

10850
03:12:35,210 --> 03:12:35,220
the steps that I'm talking about right
 

10851
03:12:35,220 --> 03:12:36,469
the steps that I'm talking about right
there's like

10852
03:12:36,469 --> 03:12:36,479
there's like
 

10853
03:12:36,479 --> 03:12:37,910
there's like
the day of being public and everything

10854
03:12:37,910 --> 03:12:37,920
the day of being public and everything
 

10855
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:39,349
the day of being public and everything
just that just having the paper being

10856
03:12:39,349 --> 03:12:39,359
just that just having the paper being
 

10857
03:12:39,359 --> 03:12:42,050
just that just having the paper being
public that's like V1 right then you

10858
03:12:42,050 --> 03:12:42,060
public that's like V1 right then you
 

10859
03:12:42,060 --> 03:12:43,790
public that's like V1 right then you
have the thing being regenerated from

10860
03:12:43,790 --> 03:12:43,800
have the thing being regenerated from
 

10861
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:45,650
have the thing being regenerated from
code and data like the PDF being

10862
03:12:45,650 --> 03:12:45,660
code and data like the PDF being
 

10863
03:12:45,660 --> 03:12:47,450
code and data like the PDF being
presented from code data then you have

10864
03:12:47,450 --> 03:12:47,460
presented from code data then you have
 

10865
03:12:47,460 --> 03:12:49,610
presented from code data then you have
the citations as import statements then

10866
03:12:49,610 --> 03:12:49,620
the citations as import statements then
 

10867
03:12:49,620 --> 03:12:51,290
the citations as import statements then
you have the full citation graph as an

10868
03:12:51,290 --> 03:12:51,300
you have the full citation graph as an
 

10869
03:12:51,300 --> 03:12:52,309
you have the full citation graph as an
important statement so you just follow

10870
03:12:52,309 --> 03:12:52,319
important statement so you just follow
 

10871
03:12:52,319 --> 03:12:55,250
important statement so you just follow
it all the way back right and uh and now

10872
03:12:55,250 --> 03:12:55,260
it all the way back right and uh and now
 

10873
03:12:55,260 --> 03:12:57,469
it all the way back right and uh and now
you have that gives you audibility

10874
03:12:57,469 --> 03:12:57,479
you have that gives you audibility
 

10875
03:12:57,479 --> 03:13:00,769
you have that gives you audibility
then you have the off chain you know the

10876
03:13:00,769 --> 03:13:00,779
then you have the off chain you know the
 

10877
03:13:00,779 --> 03:13:02,690
then you have the off chain you know the
the analog digital crypto custody right

10878
03:13:02,690 --> 03:13:02,700
the analog digital crypto custody right
 

10879
03:13:02,700 --> 03:13:04,010
the analog digital crypto custody right
like where you're hashing things and

10880
03:13:04,010 --> 03:13:04,020
like where you're hashing things and
 

10881
03:13:04,020 --> 03:13:05,570
like where you're hashing things and
streaming things so you have the chain

10882
03:13:05,570 --> 03:13:05,580
streaming things so you have the chain
 

10883
03:13:05,580 --> 03:13:07,490
streaming things so you have the chain
of custody each of those is kind of like

10884
03:13:07,490 --> 03:13:07,500
of custody each of those is kind of like
 

10885
03:13:07,500 --> 03:13:10,190
of custody each of those is kind of like
a level up and adds to complexity but it

10886
03:13:10,190 --> 03:13:10,200
a level up and adds to complexity but it
 

10887
03:13:10,200 --> 03:13:11,630
a level up and adds to complexity but it
also adds the audibility and the

10888
03:13:11,630 --> 03:13:11,640
also adds the audibility and the
 

10889
03:13:11,640 --> 03:13:13,969
also adds the audibility and the
verifiability of the reproducibility but

10890
03:13:13,969 --> 03:13:13,979
verifiability of the reproducibility but
 

10891
03:13:13,979 --> 03:13:16,070
verifiability of the reproducibility but
you know one thing I'd say I wanted to

10892
03:13:16,070 --> 03:13:16,080
you know one thing I'd say I wanted to
 

10893
03:13:16,080 --> 03:13:18,410
you know one thing I'd say I wanted to
respond to that you said was uh that you

10894
03:13:18,410 --> 03:13:18,420
respond to that you said was uh that you
 

10895
03:13:18,420 --> 03:13:20,090
respond to that you said was uh that you
think this would be good for incremental

10896
03:13:20,090 --> 03:13:20,100
think this would be good for incremental
 

10897
03:13:20,100 --> 03:13:21,349
think this would be good for incremental
but not Innovative actually it's quite

10898
03:13:21,349 --> 03:13:21,359
but not Innovative actually it's quite
 

10899
03:13:21,359 --> 03:13:23,170
but not Innovative actually it's quite
the opposite I think

10900
03:13:23,170 --> 03:13:23,180
the opposite I think
 

10901
03:13:23,180 --> 03:13:26,150
the opposite I think
Academia is institutional and it's not

10902
03:13:26,150 --> 03:13:26,160
Academia is institutional and it's not
 

10903
03:13:26,160 --> 03:13:28,070
Academia is institutional and it's not
Innovative for example NIH has this

10904
03:13:28,070 --> 03:13:28,080
Innovative for example NIH has this
 

10905
03:13:28,080 --> 03:13:30,710
Innovative for example NIH has this
graph which is like I think it's age of

10906
03:13:30,710 --> 03:13:30,720
graph which is like I think it's age of
 

10907
03:13:30,720 --> 03:13:33,889
graph which is like I think it's age of
recipients of r01 Grants okay and what

10908
03:13:33,889 --> 03:13:33,899
recipients of r01 Grants okay and what
 

10909
03:13:33,899 --> 03:13:36,530
recipients of r01 Grants okay and what
it shows is basically it's like a hump

10910
03:13:36,530 --> 03:13:36,540
it shows is basically it's like a hump
 

10911
03:13:36,540 --> 03:13:39,290
it shows is basically it's like a hump
that moves over time roughly plus one

10912
03:13:39,290 --> 03:13:39,300
that moves over time roughly plus one
 

10913
03:13:39,300 --> 03:13:41,690
that moves over time roughly plus one
year forward for the average age as the

10914
03:13:41,690 --> 03:13:41,700
year forward for the average age as the
 

10915
03:13:41,700 --> 03:13:43,610
year forward for the average age as the
year moves on okay I'll see if I can

10916
03:13:43,610 --> 03:13:43,620
year moves on okay I'll see if I can
 

10917
03:13:43,620 --> 03:13:44,750
year moves on okay I'll see if I can
find the gif

10918
03:13:44,750 --> 03:13:44,760
find the gif
 

10919
03:13:44,760 --> 03:13:47,030
find the gif
what this why is this let me see if I

10920
03:13:47,030 --> 03:13:47,040
what this why is this let me see if I

now this is 10 years ago one year in age
 

10949
03:14:24,120 --> 03:14:27,170
now this is 10 years ago one year in age
per year of time and notice how first of

10950
03:14:27,170 --> 03:14:27,180
per year of time and notice how first of
 

10951
03:14:27,180 --> 03:14:29,929
per year of time and notice how first of
all the average age is moving way upward

10952
03:14:29,929 --> 03:14:29,939
all the average age is moving way upward
 

10953
03:14:29,939 --> 03:14:33,349

before you you know become an HPI second

10954
03:14:33,349 --> 03:14:33,359
before you you know become an HPI second
 

10955
03:14:33,359 --> 03:14:36,410
before you you know become an HPI second
is it's a court of guys people who are

10956
03:14:36,410 --> 03:14:36,420
is it's a court of guys people who are
 

10957
03:14:36,420 --> 03:14:38,389
is it's a court of guys people who are
just aborting grants to each other yeah

10958
03:14:38,389 --> 03:14:38,399
just aborting grants to each other yeah
 

10959
03:14:38,399 --> 03:14:40,370
just aborting grants to each other yeah
that's clearly what's happening you know

10960
03:14:40,370 --> 03:14:40,380
that's clearly what's happening you know
 

10961
03:14:40,380 --> 03:14:41,929
that's clearly what's happening you know
that's that's the underlying Dynamic

10962
03:14:41,929 --> 03:14:41,939
that's that's the underlying Dynamic
 

10963
03:14:41,939 --> 03:14:43,670
that's that's the underlying Dynamic
they're not awarding grants to folks who

10964
03:14:43,670 --> 03:14:43,680
they're not awarding grants to folks who
 

10965
03:14:43,680 --> 03:14:45,469
they're not awarding grants to folks who
are much younger okay because those

10966
03:14:45,469 --> 03:14:45,479
are much younger okay because those
 

10967
03:14:45,479 --> 03:14:46,910

folks haven't proven themselves yet
 

10969
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:48,950
folks haven't proven themselves yet
right so it is this this is what happens

10970
03:14:48,950 --> 03:14:48,960
right so it is this this is what happens
 

10971
03:14:48,960 --> 03:14:50,929
right so it is this this is what happens
when you get prestigious citation rather

10972
03:14:50,929 --> 03:14:50,939
when you get prestigious citation rather

just keeps creeping up and this was 10
years ago and it's gotten even worse

10978
03:14:56,030 --> 03:14:56,040
years ago and it's gotten even worse
 

10979
03:14:56,040 --> 03:14:58,190
years ago and it's gotten even worse
it's become even more democratic even

10980

03:14:58,200 --> 03:15:00,290
it's become even more democratic even
more High bound right and so the thing

10982
03:15:00,290 --> 03:15:00,300
more High bound right and so the thing
 

10983
03:15:00,300 --> 03:15:02,389
more High bound right and so the thing
is the the structures that van of our

10984
03:15:02,389 --> 03:15:02,399

the reason they they kind of they don't
 

11007
03:15:27,060 --> 03:15:28,309
the reason they they kind of they don't
say it quite in that way but that's

11008
03:15:28,309 --> 03:15:28,319
say it quite in that way but that's
 

11009

as you know some tech bro could possibly

11030
03:15:51,950 --> 03:15:51,960
as you know some tech bro could possibly
 

11031
03:15:51,960 --> 03:15:54,590
as you know some tech bro could possibly
think you could ever do basic science

11032
03:15:54,590 --> 03:15:54,600
think you could ever do basic science
 

11033
03:15:54,600 --> 03:15:56,330
think you could ever do basic science
without the funding of the US government

11034
03:15:56,330 --> 03:15:56,340
without the funding of the US government
 

11035
03:15:56,340 --> 03:15:58,429
without the funding of the US government
has it not developed all basic science

11036
03:15:58,429 --> 03:15:58,439
has it not developed all basic science
 

11037
03:15:58,439 --> 03:16:01,309
has it not developed all basic science
right and the answer to this is actually

11038
03:16:01,309 --> 03:16:01,319
right and the answer to this is actually
 

11039
03:16:01,319 --> 03:16:03,410
right and the answer to this is actually

and they both were stimulated by and
 

11055
03:16:20,040 --> 03:16:21,290
and they both were stimulated by and
stimulated development of pure science

11059
03:16:23,580 --> 03:16:26,690
did they were they funded by NSF no they
were not right therefore NSF is not

American oh let me find the exact
it's actually Less Old than people think

11074
03:16:41,330 --> 03:16:41,340
it's actually Less Old than people think
 

11075
03:16:41,340 --> 03:16:44,450
it's actually Less Old than people think
okay so Newton died 1727 right so I knew

11076
03:16:44,450 --> 03:16:44,460
okay so Newton died 1727 right so I knew
 

11077
03:16:44,460 --> 03:16:45,530
okay so Newton died 1727 right so I knew
that

11078
03:16:45,530 --> 03:16:45,540
that
 

11079
03:16:45,540 --> 03:16:47,929
that
um you know it was like in the 1700s so

11080
03:16:47,929 --> 03:16:47,939
um you know it was like in the 1700s so
 

11081
03:16:47,939 --> 03:16:50,389
um you know it was like in the 1700s so
noon was before the American Revolution

11082
03:16:50,389 --> 03:16:50,399
noon was before the American Revolution
 

11083
03:16:50,399 --> 03:16:53,150
noon was before the American Revolution
right obviously that meant huge

11084
03:16:53,150 --> 03:16:53,160
right obviously that meant huge
 

11085
03:16:53,160 --> 03:16:54,769
right obviously that meant huge
Innovations could happen before the US

11086
03:16:54,769 --> 03:16:54,779
Innovations could happen before the US
 

11087
03:16:54,779 --> 03:16:58,370

government before NIH before NSF right

11088
03:16:58,370 --> 03:16:58,380
government before NIH before NSF right
 

11089
03:16:58,380 --> 03:17:01,309
government before NIH before NSF right
which means they are not a necessary

11090
03:17:01,309 --> 03:17:01,319
which means they are not a necessary
 

11091
03:17:01,319 --> 03:17:03,469

condition number one that itself is

11092
03:17:03,469 --> 03:17:03,479
condition number one that itself is
 

11093
03:17:03,479 --> 03:17:05,210
condition number one that itself is
crucial because a lot of people say the

11094
03:17:05,210 --> 03:17:05,220
crucial because a lot of people say the
 

11095
03:17:05,220 --> 03:17:06,950

basic science it is not necessary for

11098
03:17:08,269 --> 03:17:08,279
basic science it is not necessary for
 

11099
03:17:08,279 --> 03:17:09,410

it is one possible Catalyst and I would

11102
03:17:12,710 --> 03:17:12,720
it is one possible Catalyst and I would
 

11103
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:14,570
it is one possible Catalyst and I would
argue that mid-century it was okay

11104
03:17:14,570 --> 03:17:14,580
argue that mid-century it was okay
 

11105
03:17:14,580 --> 03:17:17,030
argue that mid-century it was okay
because mid-century was the time when

11106
03:17:17,030 --> 03:17:17,040
because mid-century was the time when
 

11107
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:18,710
because mid-century was the time when

Project you have Apollo that generation

11114
03:17:26,650 --> 03:17:26,660
Project you have Apollo that generation
 

11115
03:17:26,660 --> 03:17:30,170

was acclimatized to a centralized U.S

11116
03:17:30,170 --> 03:17:30,180
was acclimatized to a centralized U.S
 

11117
03:17:30,180 --> 03:17:31,309
was acclimatized to a centralized U.S
government that could accomplish great

11118
03:17:31,309 --> 03:17:31,319
government that could accomplish great
 

11119
03:17:31,319 --> 03:17:33,349
government that could accomplish great
things probably because technology

11120
03:17:33,349 --> 03:17:33,359
things probably because technology
 

11121
03:17:33,359 --> 03:17:35,389

favored centralization going into 1950

11122
03:17:35,389 --> 03:17:35,399
favored centralization going into 1950
 

11123
03:17:35,399 --> 03:17:36,349
favored centralization going into 1950
and then started favoring

11124
03:17:36,349 --> 03:17:36,359
and then started favoring
 

11125
03:17:36,359 --> 03:17:38,090
and then started favoring
decentralization going out of it I've

11126
03:17:38,090 --> 03:17:38,100
decentralization going out of it I've
 

11127
03:17:38,100 --> 03:17:39,349
decentralization going out of it I've
talked about this in the book Sovereign

11128
03:17:39,349 --> 03:17:39,359
talked about this in the book Sovereign
 

11129
03:17:39,359 --> 03:17:40,490
talked about this in the book Sovereign
and digital has talked about this but

11130
03:17:40,490 --> 03:17:40,500
and digital has talked about this but
 

11131
03:17:40,500 --> 03:17:43,490
and digital has talked about this but
very roughly you know you go up into

11132
03:17:43,490 --> 03:17:43,500
very roughly you know you go up into
 

11133
03:17:43,500 --> 03:17:46,190
very roughly you know you go up into
1950 and you have mass media and mass

11134
03:17:46,190 --> 03:17:46,200
1950 and you have mass media and mass
 

11135

um and just centralization of all kinds

11138
03:17:49,190 --> 03:17:49,200
um and just centralization of all kinds
 

11139
03:17:49,200 --> 03:17:50,750

giant nation states slugging it out on

03:17:50,750 --> 03:17:50,760
giant nation states slugging it out on
 

11141
03:17:50,760 --> 03:17:52,910
giant nation states slugging it out on
the world stage and you go out in 1950

11142
03:17:52,910 --> 03:17:52,920
the world stage and you go out in 1950
 

11143
03:17:52,920 --> 03:17:55,670
the world stage and you go out in 1950
and you get cable news and personal

11144
03:17:55,670 --> 03:17:55,680
and you get cable news and personal
 

11145
03:17:55,680 --> 03:17:58,010

03:17:59,510 --> 03:17:59,520
and cryptocurrency and you have the
 

11149
03:17:59,520 --> 03:18:01,790
and cryptocurrency and you have the
decentralization and so

11150
03:18:01,790 --> 03:18:01,800
decentralization and so
 

11151
03:18:01,800 --> 03:18:03,590
decentralization and so
this entire centralized scientific

11152
03:18:03,590 --> 03:18:03,600
this entire centralized scientific
 

11153
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:06,050
this entire centralized scientific
establishment was set up at the peak of

11154
03:18:06,050 --> 03:18:06,060
establishment was set up at the peak of
 

11155
03:18:06,060 --> 03:18:07,670
establishment was set up at the peak of
the centralized century and it might

11156
03:18:07,670 --> 03:18:07,680
the centralized century and it might
 

11157
03:18:07,680 --> 03:18:08,809
the centralized century and it might
have been the right thing to do at that

11158
03:18:08,809 --> 03:18:08,819
have been the right thing to do at that
 

11159
03:18:08,819 --> 03:18:11,690
have been the right thing to do at that
time but is now showing its age and it's

11160
03:18:11,690 --> 03:18:11,700
time but is now showing its age and it's
 

11161
03:18:11,700 --> 03:18:13,309
time but is now showing its age and it's
no longer actually geared up for what we

11162
03:18:13,309 --> 03:18:13,319
no longer actually geared up for what we
 

11163
03:18:13,319 --> 03:18:14,510

right that's this revolutionary thing

11170
03:18:22,010 --> 03:18:22,020
right that's this revolutionary thing
 

11171
03:18:22,020 --> 03:18:23,570
right that's this revolutionary thing
that came outside of it

11172

that came outside of it
 

11173
03:18:23,580 --> 03:18:25,130
that came outside of it
um early in the pandemic there's

11174
03:18:25,130 --> 03:18:25,140
um early in the pandemic there's
 

11175
03:18:25,140 --> 03:18:26,710
um early in the pandemic there's
something called project Dash

11176
03:18:26,710 --> 03:18:26,720
something called project Dash
 

11177
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:29,389

evidence.github.io which accumulated all

possibly having been a lab leak when
 

11183
03:18:34,319 --> 03:18:35,929
possibly having been a lab leak when
that was a very controversial thing to

11184
03:18:35,929 --> 03:18:35,939
that was a very controversial thing to
 

11185
03:18:35,939 --> 03:18:38,510
that was a very controversial thing to
discuss right Alina Chan to her credit

11186
03:18:38,510 --> 03:18:38,520
discuss right Alina Chan to her credit
 

11187
03:18:38,520 --> 03:18:40,969
discuss right Alina Chan to her credit
you know Matt Ridley and Alina Chan have

11188
03:18:40,969 --> 03:18:40,979
you know Matt Ridley and Alina Chan have
 

11189
03:18:40,979 --> 03:18:42,889
you know Matt Ridley and Alina Chan have
written this book you know on

11190
03:18:42,889 --> 03:18:42,899
written this book you know on
 

11191
03:18:42,899 --> 03:18:44,990
written this book you know on
um whether the coronavirus was a lab

11192
03:18:44,990 --> 03:18:45,000
um whether the coronavirus was a lab
 

11193
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:46,429
um whether the coronavirus was a lab
leak or not I think it's plausible that

11194
03:18:46,429 --> 03:18:46,439
leak or not I think it's plausible that
 

11195
03:18:46,439 --> 03:18:47,630
leak or not I think it's plausible that
it was

11196
03:18:47,630 --> 03:18:47,640
it was
 

11197
03:18:47,640 --> 03:18:48,290
it was
um

11198
03:18:48,290 --> 03:18:48,300
um
 

11199
03:18:48,300 --> 03:18:50,630
um
I I can't say I'm 100 sure but I think

11200
03:18:50,630 --> 03:18:50,640
I I can't say I'm 100 sure but I think
 

11201
03:18:50,640 --> 03:18:52,190
I I can't say I'm 100 sure but I think
it's at least it's certainly it is a

11202
03:18:52,190 --> 03:18:52,200
it's at least it's certainly it is a
 

11203
03:18:52,200 --> 03:18:54,769
it's at least it's certainly it is a
hypothesis worthy of discussion okay

11204
03:18:54,769 --> 03:18:54,779
hypothesis worthy of discussion okay
 

11205
03:18:54,779 --> 03:18:56,030
hypothesis worthy of discussion okay
um though of course it's got political

11206
03:18:56,030 --> 03:18:56,040
um though of course it's got political
 

11207
03:18:56,040 --> 03:18:57,769
um though of course it's got political
overtones point being that the

11208
03:18:57,769 --> 03:18:57,779
overtones point being that the
 

11209
03:18:57,779 --> 03:18:59,450
overtones point being that the
pseudonymous online publication at

pseudonymous online publication at
 

11211
03:18:59,460 --> 03:19:02,389
pseudonymous online publication at
project evidence github.io happened when

11212
03:19:02,389 --> 03:19:02,399
project evidence github.io happened when
 

11213
03:19:02,399 --> 03:19:04,429
project evidence github.io happened when
it was taboo to do so so we're back to

11214
03:19:04,429 --> 03:19:04,439
it was taboo to do so so we're back to
 

11215
03:19:04,439 --> 03:19:06,710
it was taboo to do so so we're back to
the age of pseudonymous publication

11216
03:19:06,710 --> 03:19:06,720
the age of pseudonymous publication
 

11217

um someone there's a famous story where
 

11227
03:19:18,359 --> 03:19:19,730
um someone there's a famous story where
Newton sold a problem someone said I

11228
03:19:19,730 --> 03:19:19,740
Newton sold a problem someone said I
 

11229
03:19:19,740 --> 03:19:21,590
Newton sold a problem someone said I
know the lion by his claw or something

11230
03:19:21,590 --> 03:19:21,600
know the lion by his claw or something
 

11231
03:19:21,600 --> 03:19:23,150
know the lion by his claw or something
like that right people used to do

11232
03:19:23,150 --> 03:19:23,160
like that right people used to do
 

11233
03:19:23,160 --> 03:19:24,590
like that right people used to do
pseudonymous publication in the past so

11234
03:19:24,590 --> 03:19:24,600
pseudonymous publication in the past so
 

11235
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:26,210
pseudonymous publication in the past so
that they would be judged on part by

11236
03:19:26,210 --> 03:19:26,220
that they would be judged on part by
 

11237
03:19:26,220 --> 03:19:28,130
that they would be judged on part by
their scientific ideas and not the

11238
03:19:28,130 --> 03:19:28,140
their scientific ideas and not the
 

11239
03:19:28,140 --> 03:19:31,250
their scientific ideas and not the
person themselves right and so

11240
03:19:31,250 --> 03:19:31,260
person themselves right and so
 

11241
03:19:31,260 --> 03:19:33,530
person themselves right and so
um so I do disagree that this is the

11242
03:19:33,530 --> 03:19:33,540
um so I do disagree that this is the
 

11243
03:19:33,540 --> 03:19:34,610
um so I do disagree that this is the
incremental stuff this is actually the

11244
03:19:34,610 --> 03:19:34,620
incremental stuff this is actually the
 

11245
03:19:34,620 --> 03:19:35,809
incremental stuff this is actually the
Innovative stuff the incremental stuff

11246
03:19:35,809 --> 03:19:35,819
Innovative stuff the incremental stuff
 

11247
03:19:35,819 --> 03:19:37,269
Innovative stuff the incremental stuff
is going to be the institutional

11248
03:19:37,269 --> 03:19:37,279
is going to be the institutional
 

11249
03:19:37,279 --> 03:19:40,190
is going to be the institutional
gerontocracy the that's Academia where

11250
03:19:40,190 --> 03:19:40,200
gerontocracy the that's Academia where
 

11251
03:19:40,200 --> 03:19:41,929
gerontocracy the that's Academia where
it's like you know do you know who I am

11252
03:19:41,929 --> 03:19:41,939
it's like you know do you know who I am
 

11253
03:19:41,939 --> 03:19:45,469
it's like you know do you know who I am
I'm a Harvard Professor yeah I don't I I

11254
03:19:45,469 --> 03:19:45,479
I'm a Harvard Professor yeah I don't I I
 

11255
03:19:45,479 --> 03:19:46,969
I'm a Harvard Professor yeah I don't I I
think I agree with everything you said

11256
03:19:46,969 --> 03:19:46,979
think I agree with everything you said
 

11257
03:19:46,979 --> 03:19:49,610
think I agree with everything you said
but I I

11259
03:19:49,620 --> 03:19:51,590

um I'm not I'm not going to get stuck on

11260
03:19:51,590 --> 03:19:51,600
um I'm not I'm not going to get stuck on
 

11261
03:19:51,600 --> 03:19:55,790
um I'm not I'm not going to get stuck on
technicalities because I think I was

11262
03:19:55,790 --> 03:19:55,800
technicalities because I think I was
 

11263
03:19:55,800 --> 03:19:58,370
technicalities because I think I was
referring to your vision of data sets

11264
03:19:58,370 --> 03:19:58,380
referring to your vision of data sets
 

11265
03:19:58,380 --> 03:20:01,309
referring to your vision of data sets
and importing code sure and so that

11266
03:20:01,309 --> 03:20:01,319
and importing code sure and so that
 

11267
03:20:01,319 --> 03:20:03,710
and importing code sure and so that
forces just knowing how code works it

11268
03:20:03,710 --> 03:20:03,720
forces just knowing how code works it
 

11269
03:20:03,720 --> 03:20:06,290
forces just knowing how code works it
forces a structure and structure usually

11270
03:20:06,290 --> 03:20:06,300
forces a structure and structure usually

like if you Fork code

11274
03:20:11,750 --> 03:20:11,760
like if you Fork code
 

11275
03:20:11,760 --> 03:20:16,030
like if you Fork code
you're not going to uh descent

11276

you want to go from scratch okay so I I

11280
03:20:21,889 --> 03:20:21,899
you want to go from scratch okay so I I
 

11281
03:20:21,899 --> 03:20:23,870
you want to go from scratch okay so I I
understand your point there okay

understand your point there okay
 

11283
03:20:23,880 --> 03:20:25,370
understand your point there okay
um and I also agree that some papers

11284
03:20:25,370 --> 03:20:25,380
um and I also agree that some papers
 

11285
03:20:25,380 --> 03:20:27,230
um and I also agree that some papers
like Francis Crick on the cloud stream

11286
03:20:27,230 --> 03:20:27,240
like Francis Crick on the cloud stream
 

11287
03:20:27,240 --> 03:20:29,150
like Francis Crick on the cloud stream
or there's are theoretical they're more

11288
03:20:29,150 --> 03:20:29,160
or there's are theoretical they're more
 

11289
03:20:29,160 --> 03:20:31,070
or there's are theoretical they're more
about like where to dig than the data

11290
03:20:31,070 --> 03:20:31,080
about like where to dig than the data
 

11291
03:20:31,080 --> 03:20:33,290
about like where to dig than the data
itself and so on and so forth right so I

11292
03:20:33,290 --> 03:20:33,300
itself and so on and so forth right so I
 

11293
03:20:33,300 --> 03:20:35,510
itself and so on and so forth right so I
agree with that still I don't um the

11294
03:20:35,510 --> 03:20:35,520
agree with that still I don't um the
 

11295
03:20:35,520 --> 03:20:37,190
agree with that still I don't um the
counter argument is

11296
03:20:37,190 --> 03:20:37,200
counter argument is
 

11297
03:20:37,200 --> 03:20:39,110
counter argument is
rather than a thousand people reading

11298
03:20:39,110 --> 03:20:39,120
rather than a thousand people reading
 

11299
03:20:39,120 --> 03:20:40,670

this paper to try to rebuild the whole

11300
03:20:40,670 --> 03:20:40,680
this paper to try to rebuild the whole
 

11301
03:20:40,680 --> 03:20:43,969
this paper to try to rebuild the whole
thing and uh do it with errors

11302
03:20:43,969 --> 03:20:43,979
thing and uh do it with errors
 

11303
03:20:43,979 --> 03:20:45,950
thing and uh do it with errors
when they can just import they can more

11304
03:20:45,950 --> 03:20:45,960
when they can just import they can more
 

11305
03:20:45,960 --> 03:20:47,870

easily build upon what others have done

11306
03:20:47,870 --> 03:20:47,880
easily build upon what others have done
 

11307
03:20:47,880 --> 03:20:50,030
easily build upon what others have done
right oh yeah yeah so the the paper

11308
03:20:50,030 --> 03:20:50,040
right oh yeah yeah so the the paper
 

11309
03:20:50,040 --> 03:20:52,610
right oh yeah yeah so the the paper
should be forkable but yeah yeah so

11310
03:20:52,610 --> 03:20:52,620
should be forkable but yeah yeah so
 

11311
03:20:52,620 --> 03:20:54,170
should be forkable but yeah yeah so
here's what you know like uh you know

11312
03:20:54,170 --> 03:20:54,180
here's what you know like uh you know
 

11313
03:20:54,180 --> 03:20:55,730
here's what you know like uh you know
python has this concept of batteries

11314
03:20:55,730 --> 03:20:55,740
python has this concept of batteries
 

11315
03:20:55,740 --> 03:20:57,290
python has this concept of batteries
included for the standard library right

11316
03:20:57,290 --> 03:20:57,300
included for the standard library right
 

11317
03:20:57,300 --> 03:20:59,510
included for the standard library right
because it lets you just import import

11318
03:20:59,510 --> 03:20:59,520
because it lets you just import import
 

11319
03:20:59,520 --> 03:21:02,330
because it lets you just import import
and just get to work right that means

11320
03:21:02,330 --> 03:21:02,340
and just get to work right that means
 

11321
03:21:02,340 --> 03:21:03,469
and just get to work right that means
you can fly

11322
03:21:03,469 --> 03:21:03,479
you can fly
 

11323
03:21:03,479 --> 03:21:05,090
you can fly
whereas if you couldn't do all those

11324
03:21:05,090 --> 03:21:05,100
whereas if you couldn't do all those
 

11325
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:06,710
whereas if you couldn't do all those
things and you had to rewrite string

11326
03:21:06,710 --> 03:21:06,720
things and you had to rewrite string
 

11327
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:07,790
things and you had to rewrite string
handling you would only be able to do

11328
03:21:07,790 --> 03:21:07,800
handling you would only be able to do
 

11329
03:21:07,800 --> 03:21:09,830
handling you would only be able to do
incremental things libraries actually

11330
03:21:09,830 --> 03:21:09,840
incremental things libraries actually
 

11331
03:21:09,840 --> 03:21:11,389
incremental things libraries actually
allow for greater Innovation that's my

11332
03:21:11,389 --> 03:21:11,399
allow for greater Innovation that's my
 

11333
03:21:11,399 --> 03:21:14,269
allow for greater Innovation that's my
account I I think you create I I think

11334
03:21:14,269 --> 03:21:14,279
account I I think you create I I think
 

11335
03:21:14,279 --> 03:21:16,370
account I I think you create I I think
that paints the picture I hope that's a

11336
03:21:16,370 --> 03:21:16,380
that paints the picture I hope that's a
 

11337
03:21:16,380 --> 03:21:19,250
that paints the picture I hope that's a
picture that fits with science it

11338
03:21:19,250 --> 03:21:19,260
picture that fits with science it
 

11339
03:21:19,260 --> 03:21:20,870
picture that fits with science it
certainly does it fits with code very

11340
03:21:20,870 --> 03:21:20,880
certainly does it fits with code very
 

11341
03:21:20,880 --> 03:21:22,429
certainly does it fits with code very
well I just wonder how much of science

11342
03:21:22,429 --> 03:21:22,439
well I just wonder how much of science
 

11343
03:21:22,439 --> 03:21:27,469
well I just wonder how much of science
can be that which is you import how much

11344
03:21:27,469 --> 03:21:27,479
can be that which is you import how much
 

11345
03:21:27,479 --> 03:21:29,150
can be that which is you import how much
of it is possible to do that certainly

11346
03:21:29,150 --> 03:21:29,160
of it is possible to do that certainly
 

11347
03:21:29,160 --> 03:21:31,429
of it is possible to do that certainly
for the things I work on you can which

11348
03:21:31,429 --> 03:21:31,439
for the things I work on you can which
 

11349
03:21:31,439 --> 03:21:34,670
for the things I work on you can which
is the machine learning world the uh all

11350
03:21:34,670 --> 03:21:34,680
is the machine learning world the uh all
 

11351
03:21:34,680 --> 03:21:35,990
is the machine learning world the uh all
the computer science world but whether

11352
03:21:35,990 --> 03:21:36,000
the computer science world but whether
 

11353
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:38,269
the computer science world but whether
you can do that for all right you can

11354
03:21:38,269 --> 03:21:38,279
you can do that for all right you can
 

11355
03:21:38,279 --> 03:21:42,130
you can do that for all right you can
fix biology it seems to yes I think so

11356
03:21:42,130 --> 03:21:42,140
fix biology it seems to yes I think so
 

11357
03:21:42,140 --> 03:21:45,110
fix biology it seems to yes I think so
chemistry I think so and then you start

11358
03:21:45,110 --> 03:21:45,120
chemistry I think so and then you start
 

11359
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:46,990
chemistry I think so and then you start
getting into weird stuff like psychology

11360
03:21:46,990 --> 03:21:47,000
getting into weird stuff like psychology
 

11361
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,370
getting into weird stuff like psychology
which some people don't even think is a

11362
03:21:49,370 --> 03:21:49,380
which some people don't even think is a
 

11363
03:21:49,380 --> 03:21:51,290
which some people don't even think is a
science no

11364
03:21:51,290 --> 03:21:51,300
science no
 

11365
03:21:51,300 --> 03:21:54,290
science no
um just love for my psychology friends I

11366
03:21:54,290 --> 03:21:54,300
um just love for my psychology friends I
 

11367
03:21:54,300 --> 03:21:55,610
um just love for my psychology friends I
I think

11368
03:21:55,610 --> 03:21:55,620
I think
 

11369
03:21:55,620 --> 03:21:58,190
I think
as you get farther and farther away from

11370
03:21:58,190 --> 03:21:58,200
as you get farther and farther away from
 

11371
03:21:58,200 --> 03:22:01,130
as you get farther and farther away from
things that are like hard technical

11372
03:22:01,130 --> 03:22:01,140
things that are like hard technical
 

11373
03:22:01,140 --> 03:22:03,889
things that are like hard technical
Fields it starts getting tougher and

11374
03:22:03,889 --> 03:22:03,899
Fields it starts getting tougher and
 

11375
03:22:03,899 --> 03:22:05,650
Fields it starts getting tougher and
tougher and tougher to have like

11376
03:22:05,650 --> 03:22:05,660
tougher and tougher to have like
 

11377
03:22:05,660 --> 03:22:08,929
tougher and tougher to have like
importable code Okay so

11378
03:22:08,929 --> 03:22:08,939
importable code Okay so
 

11379
03:22:08,939 --> 03:22:11,210
importable code Okay so
let me give the strong form version

11380
03:22:11,210 --> 03:22:11,220
let me give the strong form version
 

11381
03:22:11,220 --> 03:22:13,610
let me give the strong form version
right so there's a guy who I think is uh

11382
03:22:13,610 --> 03:22:13,620
right so there's a guy who I think is uh
 

11383
03:22:13,620 --> 03:22:15,410
right so there's a guy who I think is uh
you know great machine learning guy uh

11384
03:22:15,410 --> 03:22:15,420
you know great machine learning guy uh
 

11385
03:22:15,420 --> 03:22:17,450
you know great machine learning guy uh

whatever I think yes I think he does
 

11401
03:22:30,540 --> 03:22:32,210
whatever I think yes I think he does
respect and like you here is something

11402
03:22:32,210 --> 03:22:32,220
respect and like you here is something
 

11403
03:22:32,220 --> 03:22:34,370
respect and like you here is something
which I totally agree with him on and he

11404
03:22:34,370 --> 03:22:34,380
which I totally agree with him on and he
 

11405
03:22:34,380 --> 03:22:35,750
which I totally agree with him on and he
actually got like trolled or attacked

11406
03:22:35,750 --> 03:22:35,760
actually got like trolled or attacked
 

11407
03:22:35,760 --> 03:22:37,370
actually got like trolled or attacked
for this but I completely agree within

11408
03:22:37,370 --> 03:22:37,380
for this but I completely agree within
 

11409

obvious why first of all all we're doing

11428
03:22:53,690 --> 03:22:53,700
obvious why first of all all we're doing

computer right

11432
03:22:58,010 --> 03:22:58,020
computer right
 

11433
03:22:58,020 --> 03:22:59,750
computer right
and so every single one of those areas

11434
03:22:59,750 --> 03:22:59,760
and so every single one of those areas
 

11435
03:22:59,760 --> 03:23:02,269
and so every single one of those areas
can be reduced to the analog digital

11436
03:23:02,269 --> 03:23:02,279
can be reduced to the analog digital
 

11437
03:23:02,279 --> 03:23:03,830
can be reduced to the analog digital
step and then It's All Digital then

11438
03:23:03,830 --> 03:23:03,840

03:23:04,910 --> 03:23:04,920
you're flying you're in the cloud right
 

11441
03:23:04,920 --> 03:23:07,370
you're flying you're in the cloud right
you put a date do you say how long or 10

11442
03:23:07,370 --> 03:23:07,380
you put a date do you say how long or 10
 

11443
03:23:07,380 --> 03:23:10,130
you put a date do you say how long or 10
20 years I think arguably it's already

11444
03:23:10,130 --> 03:23:10,140
20 years I think arguably it's already
 

11445
03:23:10,140 --> 03:23:12,710
20 years I think arguably it's already
there right and here's the thing you you

11446
03:23:12,710 --> 03:23:12,720
there right and here's the thing you you
 

11447
03:23:12,720 --> 03:23:14,690
there right and here's the thing you you
were saying well you know you might drop

11448
03:23:14,690 --> 03:23:14,700
were saying well you know you might drop
 

11449
03:23:14,700 --> 03:23:16,550
were saying well you know you might drop
off when you hit psychology or history

11450
03:23:16,550 --> 03:23:16,560
off when you hit psychology or history
 

11451
03:23:16,560 --> 03:23:18,469
off when you hit psychology or history
actually

11452
03:23:18,469 --> 03:23:18,479
actually
 

11453
03:23:18,479 --> 03:23:21,410
actually
um I think it's the softer sciences that

11454
03:23:21,410 --> 03:23:21,420
um I think it's the softer sciences that
 

11455
03:23:21,420 --> 03:23:23,690
um I think it's the softer sciences that
are going to harden up why

11456
03:23:23,690 --> 03:23:23,700
are going to harden up why
 

11457
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:25,309
are going to harden up why
um one of the things I talk about a lot

11458
03:23:25,309 --> 03:23:25,319
um one of the things I talk about a lot
 

11459
03:23:25,319 --> 03:23:27,290
um one of the things I talk about a lot
in the book is for example with history

11460
03:23:27,290 --> 03:23:27,300
in the book is for example with history
 

11461
03:23:27,300 --> 03:23:29,870
in the book is for example with history
the concept of crypto history makes

11462
03:23:29,870 --> 03:23:29,880
the concept of crypto history makes
 

11463
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:31,969
the concept of crypto history makes
history computable one way of thinking

11464
03:23:31,969 --> 03:23:31,979
history computable one way of thinking
 

11465
03:23:31,979 --> 03:23:33,950
history computable one way of thinking
about it is remember my Britney Spears

11466
03:23:33,950 --> 03:23:33,960
about it is remember my Britney Spears
 

11467
03:23:33,960 --> 03:23:35,990
about it is remember my Britney Spears
example right where Queen Brittany right

11468
03:23:35,990 --> 03:23:36,000
example right where Queen Brittany right
 

11469
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:38,269
example right where Queen Brittany right
yeah okay so at first it's kind of a

11470
03:23:38,269 --> 03:23:38,279
yeah okay so at first it's kind of a
 

11471
03:23:38,279 --> 03:23:39,710
yeah okay so at first it's kind of a
funny thing to say a computer

11472
03:23:39,710 --> 03:23:39,720
funny thing to say a computer
 

11473
03:23:39,720 --> 03:23:41,750
funny thing to say a computer
scientist's term for history is the log

11474
03:23:41,750 --> 03:23:41,760
scientist's term for history is the log
 

11475
03:23:41,760 --> 03:23:44,929
scientist's term for history is the log
files until we realize that what would a

11476
03:23:44,929 --> 03:23:44,939
files until we realize that what would a
 

11477
03:23:44,939 --> 03:23:46,190

future historian how would they write

11478
03:23:46,190 --> 03:23:46,200
future historian how would they write
 

11479
03:23:46,200 --> 03:23:48,590
future historian how would they write
about the history of the 2010s

11480
03:23:48,590 --> 03:23:48,600
about the history of the 2010s
 

11481
03:23:48,600 --> 03:23:51,050
about the history of the 2010s
well a huge part of that history

11482
03:23:51,050 --> 03:23:51,060
well a huge part of that history
 

11483
03:23:51,060 --> 03:23:54,110
well a huge part of that history
occurred on the servers of Twitter and

11484
03:23:54,110 --> 03:23:54,120
occurred on the servers of Twitter and
 

11485
03:23:54,120 --> 03:23:57,050
occurred on the servers of Twitter and
Facebook yeah so now you go from like a

11486
03:23:57,050 --> 03:23:57,060
Facebook yeah so now you go from like a
 

11487
03:23:57,060 --> 03:23:58,370
Facebook yeah so now you go from like a
log file which is just the individual

11488
03:23:58,370 --> 03:23:58,380
log file which is just the individual
 

11489
03:23:58,380 --> 03:24:02,090
log file which is just the individual
record of like one server's action two

11490
03:24:02,090 --> 03:24:02,100
record of like one server's action two
 

11491
03:24:02,100 --> 03:24:05,150
record of like one server's action two
decade a decade worth of data on

11492
03:24:05,150 --> 03:24:05,160
decade a decade worth of data on
 

11493
03:24:05,160 --> 03:24:07,130
decade a decade worth of data on
literally billions of people

11494
03:24:07,130 --> 03:24:07,140
literally billions of people
 

11495
03:24:07,140 --> 03:24:09,410
literally billions of people
all of their online lives like arguably

11496
03:24:09,410 --> 03:24:09,420
all of their online lives like arguably
 

11497
03:24:09,420 --> 03:24:10,910
all of their online lives like arguably
that's why I say that's like actually

11498
03:24:10,910 --> 03:24:10,920
that's why I say that's like actually
 

11499
03:24:10,920 --> 03:24:13,429
that's why I say that's like actually
what the written history was of the

11500
03:24:13,429 --> 03:24:13,439
what the written history was of the
 

11501
03:24:13,439 --> 03:24:16,190
what the written history was of the
2010s was this giant digital history as

11502
03:24:16,190 --> 03:24:16,200
2010s was this giant digital history as
 

11503
03:24:16,200 --> 03:24:18,530
2010s was this giant digital history as
you go to the 2020s and 2030s more of

03:24:18,530 --> 03:24:18,540
you go to the 2020s and 2030s more of

03:24:18,540 --> 03:24:20,410
you go to the 2020s and 2030s more of
that is going to move from merely online

11506
03:24:20,410 --> 03:24:20,420
that is going to move from merely online
 

11507
03:24:20,420 --> 03:24:23,030
that is going to move from merely online
to on chain and then cryptographically

11508
03:24:23,030 --> 03:24:23,040
to on chain and then cryptographically
 

11509
03:24:23,040 --> 03:24:25,250

verifiable so that soft subject of

03:24:25,250 --> 03:24:25,260
verifiable so that soft subject of
 

11511
03:24:25,260 --> 03:24:26,809
verifiable so that soft subject of
History becomes something that you can

11512
03:24:26,809 --> 03:24:26,819
History becomes something that you can
 

11513
03:24:26,819 --> 03:24:28,790
History becomes something that you can
calculate things like Google Trends and

11514
03:24:28,790 --> 03:24:28,800
calculate things like Google Trends and
 

11515
03:24:28,800 --> 03:24:30,530
calculate things like Google Trends and
engrams and stuff like that yes

11516
03:24:30,530 --> 03:24:30,540
engrams and stuff like that yes
 

11517
03:24:30,540 --> 03:24:32,630

beautifully put

03:24:32,630 --> 03:24:32,640
beautifully put

03:24:32,640 --> 03:24:35,750
beautifully put
then I would venture to say that Donald

11520
03:24:35,750 --> 03:24:35,760
then I would venture to say that Donald
 

11521
03:24:35,760 --> 03:24:39,050
then I would venture to say that Donald
Trump was erased from history uh when he

11522
03:24:39,050 --> 03:24:39,060
Trump was erased from history uh when he
 

11523
03:24:39,060 --> 03:24:42,410
Trump was erased from history uh when he
was removed from Twitter yeah and many

11524
03:24:42,410 --> 03:24:42,420
was removed from Twitter yeah and many
 

11525
03:24:42,420 --> 03:24:44,570
was removed from Twitter yeah and many
social platforms and all his tweets were

11526
03:24:44,570 --> 03:24:44,580
social platforms and all his tweets were
 

11527
03:24:44,580 --> 03:24:45,650
social platforms and all his tweets were
gone

11528
03:24:45,650 --> 03:24:45,660
gone
 

11529
03:24:45,660 --> 03:24:47,269
gone
I think someone who has an archive of it

11530
03:24:47,269 --> 03:24:47,279
I think someone who has an archive of it
 

11531
03:24:47,279 --> 03:24:49,690
I think someone who has an archive of it
but yeah I understand your point yeah

11532
03:24:49,690 --> 03:24:49,700
but yeah I understand your point yeah
 

11533
03:24:49,700 --> 03:24:52,370
but yeah I understand your point yeah

so we're sort of retroactively granted
 

11761
03:28:57,180 --> 03:28:59,330
so we're sort of retroactively granted
immunity because nyt went and ran a

03:30:15,830 --> 03:30:15,840
represent science but in in the
 

11841
03:30:15,840 --> 03:30:18,050
represent science but in in the
quote-unquote Sciences yeah the positive

11842
03:30:18,050 --> 03:30:18,060
quote-unquote Sciences yeah the positive
 

11843
03:30:18,060 --> 03:30:19,309
quote-unquote Sciences yeah the positive
aspect of that is that there is

11844
03:30:19,309 --> 03:30:19,319
aspect of that is that there is
 

11845
03:30:19,319 --> 03:30:20,870
aspect of that is that there is
accountability when there's a face like

11846
03:30:20,870 --> 03:30:20,880
accountability when there's a face like
 

11847
03:30:20,880 --> 03:30:22,070
accountability when there's a face like
that right but you can also see the

11848
03:30:22,070 --> 03:30:22,080
that right but you can also see the
 

11849
03:30:22,080 --> 03:30:23,809
that right but you can also see the
factory example shows you why a lot of

11850
03:30:23,809 --> 03:30:23,819
factory example shows you why a lot of
 

11851
03:30:23,819 --> 03:30:25,790
factory example shows you why a lot of
these folks do not want to be public

11852
03:30:25,790 --> 03:30:25,800
these folks do not want to be public
 

11853
03:30:25,800 --> 03:30:28,309
these folks do not want to be public
because they enter a political you know

11854
03:30:28,309 --> 03:30:28,319
because they enter a political you know
 

11855
03:30:28,319 --> 03:30:29,389
because they enter a political you know
and media Minefield I'm actually

11856
03:30:29,389 --> 03:30:29,399
and media Minefield I'm actually
 

11857
03:30:29,399 --> 03:30:31,130
and media Minefield I'm actually
sympathetic to that aspect of it what

11858
03:30:31,130 --> 03:30:31,140
sympathetic to that aspect of it what
 

11859
03:30:31,140 --> 03:30:32,929
sympathetic to that aspect of it what
I'm not sympathetic to is the concept

11860
03:30:32,929 --> 03:30:32,939
I'm not sympathetic to is the concept
 

11861
03:30:32,939 --> 03:30:36,530
I'm not sympathetic to is the concept
that in 2022 that the unelected

11862
03:30:36,530 --> 03:30:36,540
that in 2022 that the unelected
 

11863
03:30:36,540 --> 03:30:39,710
that in 2022 that the unelected
unfireable anonymous American regulator

11864
03:30:39,710 --> 03:30:39,720
unfireable anonymous American regulator
 

11865
03:30:39,720 --> 03:30:42,110
unfireable anonymous American regulator
should be able to impose regulatory

11866
03:30:42,110 --> 03:30:42,120
should be able to impose regulatory
 

11867
03:30:42,120 --> 03:30:44,330
should be able to impose regulatory
policy for the entire world we are not

11868
03:30:44,330 --> 03:30:44,340
policy for the entire world we are not
 

11869
03:30:44,340 --> 03:30:47,210
policy for the entire world we are not
the world of 1945. you know it is not

11870
03:30:47,210 --> 03:30:47,220
the world of 1945. you know it is not
 

11871
03:30:47,220 --> 03:30:48,290
the world of 1945. you know it is not
something where these other countries

11872
03:30:48,290 --> 03:30:48,300
something where these other countries
 

11873
03:30:48,300 --> 03:30:49,969
something where these other countries
are even consciously consenting to that

11874
03:30:49,969 --> 03:30:49,979
are even consciously consenting to that
 

11875
03:30:49,979 --> 03:30:52,370
are even consciously consenting to that
world just as Give an example you know

11876
03:30:52,370 --> 03:30:52,380
world just as Give an example you know
 

11877
03:30:52,380 --> 03:30:53,330
world just as Give an example you know
there's a concept called challenge

11878
03:30:53,330 --> 03:30:53,340
there's a concept called challenge
 

11879
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:57,229
there's a concept called challenge
trials okay the the moderna vaccine

11880
03:30:57,229 --> 03:30:57,239
trials okay the the moderna vaccine
 

11881
03:30:57,239 --> 03:30:59,630
trials okay the the moderna vaccine
was available very very early in the

11882
03:30:59,630 --> 03:30:59,640
was available very very early in the
 

11883
03:30:59,640 --> 03:31:01,010
was available very very early in the
pandemic you can just synthesize it from

11884
03:31:01,010 --> 03:31:01,020
pandemic you can just synthesize it from
 

11885
03:31:01,020 --> 03:31:03,889
pandemic you can just synthesize it from
the sequence and challenge trials would

11886
03:31:03,889 --> 03:31:03,899
the sequence and challenge trials would
 

11887
03:31:03,899 --> 03:31:05,990
the sequence and challenge trials would
have meant that people

11888
03:31:05,990 --> 03:31:06,000
have meant that people
 

11889
03:31:06,000 --> 03:31:08,450
have meant that people
who are healthy volunteers okay they

11890
03:31:08,450 --> 03:31:08,460
who are healthy volunteers okay they
 

11891
03:31:08,460 --> 03:31:09,950
who are healthy volunteers okay they
could have been soldiers for example of

11892
03:31:09,950 --> 03:31:09,960
could have been soldiers for example of
 

11893
03:31:09,960 --> 03:31:12,110
could have been soldiers for example of
varying agents who are there to take a

11894
03:31:12,110 --> 03:31:12,120
varying agents who are there to take a
 

11895
03:31:12,120 --> 03:31:13,610
varying agents who are there to take a
risk their lives for their country

11896
03:31:13,610 --> 03:31:13,620
risk their lives for their country
 

11897
03:31:13,620 --> 03:31:15,050
risk their lives for their country
potentially okay it could have been just

11898
03:31:15,050 --> 03:31:15,060
potentially okay it could have been just
 

11899
03:31:15,060 --> 03:31:16,309
potentially okay it could have been just
healthy volunteers not necessarily

11900
03:31:16,309 --> 03:31:16,319
healthy volunteers not necessarily
 

11901
03:31:16,319 --> 03:31:17,809
healthy volunteers not necessarily
soldiers just Patriots or whatever kind

11902
03:31:17,809 --> 03:31:17,819
soldiers just Patriots or whatever kind
 

11903
03:31:17,819 --> 03:31:20,450
soldiers just Patriots or whatever kind
in any country not just the us but those

11904
03:31:20,450 --> 03:31:20,460
in any country not just the us but those
 

11905
03:31:20,460 --> 03:31:23,210
in any country not just the us but those
healthy volunteers could have gone and

11906
03:31:23,210 --> 03:31:23,220
healthy volunteers could have gone and
 

11907
03:31:23,220 --> 03:31:24,710
healthy volunteers could have gone and
in the early stages of the pandemic we

11908
03:31:24,710 --> 03:31:24,720
in the early stages of the pandemic we
 

11909
03:31:24,720 --> 03:31:26,269
in the early stages of the pandemic we
didn't know exactly how lethalu was

11910
03:31:26,269 --> 03:31:26,279
didn't know exactly how lethalu was
 

11911
03:31:26,279 --> 03:31:28,130
didn't know exactly how lethalu was
going to be because you know Lee Wen

11912
03:31:28,130 --> 03:31:28,140
going to be because you know Lee Wen
 

11913
03:31:28,140 --> 03:31:29,690
going to be because you know Lee Wen
Liang and you know 30 year old

11914
03:31:29,690 --> 03:31:29,700
Liang and you know 30 year old
 

11915
03:31:29,700 --> 03:31:31,429
Liang and you know 30 year old
30-somethings in China were dying from

11916
03:31:31,429 --> 03:31:31,439
30-somethings in China were dying from
 

11917
03:31:31,439 --> 03:31:32,750
30-somethings in China were dying from
this it seemed like it could be far

11918
03:31:32,750 --> 03:31:32,760
this it seemed like it could be far
 

11919
03:31:32,760 --> 03:31:35,510
this it seemed like it could be far
worse how lethal the the the virus would

11920
03:31:35,510 --> 03:31:35,520
worse how lethal the the the virus would
 

11921
03:31:35,520 --> 03:31:37,910
worse how lethal the the the virus would
be yeah it may be by the way that those

11922
03:31:37,910 --> 03:31:37,920
be yeah it may be by the way that those
 

11923
03:31:37,920 --> 03:31:39,349
be yeah it may be by the way that those
who are the most susceptible to the

11924
03:31:39,349 --> 03:31:39,359
who are the most susceptible to the
 

11925
03:31:39,359 --> 03:31:43,490
who are the most susceptible to the
virus died faster earlier it's as if you

11926
03:31:43,490 --> 03:31:43,500
virus died faster earlier it's as if you
 

11927
03:31:43,500 --> 03:31:46,010
virus died faster earlier it's as if you
could imagine a model where those who

11928
03:31:46,010 --> 03:31:46,020
could imagine a model where those who
 

11929
03:31:46,020 --> 03:31:48,530
could imagine a model where those who
were exposed and had the lowest

11930
03:31:48,530 --> 03:31:48,540
were exposed and had the lowest
 

11931
03:31:48,540 --> 03:31:49,849
were exposed and had the lowest
susceptibility also had the highest

11932
03:31:49,849 --> 03:31:49,859
susceptibility also had the highest
 

11933
03:31:49,859 --> 03:31:51,889
susceptibility also had the highest
severity and died in greater numbers

11934
03:31:51,889 --> 03:31:51,899
severity and died in greater numbers
 

11935
03:31:51,899 --> 03:31:53,809
severity and died in greater numbers
early on if you look at the graph like

11936
03:31:53,809 --> 03:31:53,819
early on if you look at the graph like
 

11937
03:31:53,819 --> 03:31:55,910
early on if you look at the graph like
deaths from covet were exponential going

11938
03:31:55,910 --> 03:31:55,920
deaths from covet were exponential going
 

11939
03:31:55,920 --> 03:31:57,769
deaths from covet were exponential going
into about April 2020 and then leveled

11940
03:31:57,769 --> 03:31:57,779
into about April 2020 and then leveled
 

11941
03:31:57,779 --> 03:32:00,710
into about April 2020 and then leveled
off to about 7 500 10 000 a day and then

11942
03:32:00,710 --> 03:32:00,720
off to about 7 500 10 000 a day and then
 

11943
03:32:00,720 --> 03:32:02,809
off to about 7 500 10 000 a day and then
kind of fell right but it could have

11944
03:32:02,809 --> 03:32:02,819
kind of fell right but it could have
 

11945
03:32:02,819 --> 03:32:04,370
kind of fell right but it could have
gone to 75 000 at the beginning so we

11946
03:32:04,370 --> 03:32:04,380
gone to 75 000 at the beginning so we
 

11947
03:32:04,380 --> 03:32:05,389
gone to 75 000 at the beginning so we
didn't know how serious it was so this

11948
03:32:05,389 --> 03:32:05,399
didn't know how serious it was so this
 

11949
03:32:05,399 --> 03:32:07,010
didn't know how serious it was so this
would have been a real risk that these

11950
03:32:07,010 --> 03:32:07,020
would have been a real risk that these
 

11951
03:32:07,020 --> 03:32:08,090
would have been a real risk that these
people would have been taking but here's

11952
03:32:08,090 --> 03:32:08,100
people would have been taking but here's
 

11953
03:32:08,100 --> 03:32:09,130
people would have been taking but here's
what they would have gotten for that

11954
03:32:09,130 --> 03:32:09,140
what they would have gotten for that
 

11955
03:32:09,140 --> 03:32:11,690
what they would have gotten for that
basically in a challenge trial somebody

11956
03:32:11,690 --> 03:32:11,700
basically in a challenge trial somebody
 

11957
03:32:11,700 --> 03:32:14,450
basically in a challenge trial somebody
would have been given the vaccine

11958
03:32:14,450 --> 03:32:14,460
would have been given the vaccine
 

11959
03:32:14,460 --> 03:32:17,090
would have been given the vaccine
and then exposed to the virus

11960
03:32:17,090 --> 03:32:17,100
and then exposed to the virus
 

11961
03:32:17,100 --> 03:32:20,510
and then exposed to the virus
and then put under observation and then

11962
03:32:20,510 --> 03:32:20,520
and then put under observation and then
 

11963
03:32:20,520 --> 03:32:22,070
and then put under observation and then
that would have given you all the data

11964
03:32:22,070 --> 03:32:22,080
that would have given you all the data
 

11965
03:32:22,080 --> 03:32:24,050
that would have given you all the data
because ultimately the synthesis of the

11966
03:32:24,050 --> 03:32:24,060
because ultimately the synthesis of the
 

11967
03:32:24,060 --> 03:32:25,610
because ultimately the synthesis of the
thing I mean yes you do need to scale up

11968
03:32:25,610 --> 03:32:25,620
thing I mean yes you do need to scale up
 

11969
03:32:25,620 --> 03:32:27,229
thing I mean yes you do need to scale up
synthesis and Manufacturing and what

11970
03:32:27,229 --> 03:32:27,239
synthesis and Manufacturing and what
 

11971
03:32:27,239 --> 03:32:29,750
synthesis and Manufacturing and what
have you but the information

11972
03:32:29,750 --> 03:32:29,760
have you but the information
 

11973
03:32:29,760 --> 03:32:31,790
have you but the information
of whether it worked or not and was safe

11974
03:32:31,790 --> 03:32:31,800
of whether it worked or not and was safe
 

11975
03:32:31,800 --> 03:32:33,590
of whether it worked or not and was safe
and effective and like that could have

11976
03:32:33,590 --> 03:32:33,600
and effective and like that could have
 

11977
03:32:33,600 --> 03:32:35,630
and effective and like that could have
been gathered expeditiously with

11978
03:32:35,630 --> 03:32:35,640
been gathered expeditiously with
 

11979
03:32:35,640 --> 03:32:37,190
been gathered expeditiously with
volunteers for challenge you think

11980
03:32:37,190 --> 03:32:37,200
volunteers for challenge you think
 

11981
03:32:37,200 --> 03:32:38,389
volunteers for challenge you think
there'd be a large number of volunteers

11982
03:32:38,389 --> 03:32:38,399
there'd be a large number of volunteers
 

11983
03:32:38,399 --> 03:32:40,490
there'd be a large number of volunteers
absolutely what's the concern there was

11984
03:32:40,490 --> 03:32:40,500
absolutely what's the concern there was
 

11985
03:32:40,500 --> 03:32:42,889
absolutely what's the concern there was
is there an ethical concern of taking on

11986
03:32:42,889 --> 03:32:42,899
is there an ethical concern of taking on
 

11987
03:32:42,899 --> 03:32:45,950
is there an ethical concern of taking on
volunteers well so let me put it like

11988
03:32:45,950 --> 03:32:45,960
volunteers well so let me put it like
 

11989
03:32:45,960 --> 03:32:47,990
volunteers well so let me put it like
this had we done that

11990
03:32:47,990 --> 03:32:48,000
this had we done that
 

11991
03:32:48,000 --> 03:32:50,690
this had we done that
we could have had vaccines early enough

11992
03:32:50,690 --> 03:32:50,700
we could have had vaccines early enough

this important you know task I don't
 

12029
03:33:25,439 --> 03:33:26,990
this important you know task I don't
know how many of them but I do think

12030
03:33:26,990 --> 03:33:27,000
know how many of them but I do think
 

12031
03:33:27,000 --> 03:33:28,490
know how many of them but I do think
that we the volunteers would have been

12032
03:33:28,490 --> 03:33:28,500
that we the volunteers would have been
 

12033
03:33:28,500 --> 03:33:29,929
that we the volunteers would have been
there there's probably some empirical

12034
03:33:29,929 --> 03:33:29,939
there there's probably some empirical
 

12035
03:33:29,939 --> 03:33:31,670
there there's probably some empirical
test of that which is a there's a

12036
03:33:31,670 --> 03:33:31,680
test of that which is a there's a
 

12037
03:33:31,680 --> 03:33:32,809
test of that which is a there's a
challenge trials website there's a

12038
03:33:32,809 --> 03:33:32,819
challenge trials website there's a

12040
03:33:34,250 --> 03:33:34,260
Harvard profit put out this proposal
 

12041
03:33:34,260 --> 03:33:36,290
Harvard profit put out this proposal
early in the pandemic and he could tell

12042
03:33:36,290 --> 03:33:36,300
early in the pandemic and he could tell
 

12043
03:33:36,300 --> 03:33:38,630
early in the pandemic and he could tell
you how many volunteers he got

12044
03:33:38,630 --> 03:33:38,640
you how many volunteers he got
 

12045
03:33:38,640 --> 03:33:41,090
you how many volunteers he got
um but but something like that could

12046
03:33:41,090 --> 03:33:41,100
um but but something like that could
 

12047
03:33:41,100 --> 03:33:44,050
um but but something like that could
have just shortened the the time from

12048
03:33:44,050 --> 03:33:44,060
have just shortened the the time from
 

12049
03:33:44,060 --> 03:33:48,590
have just shortened the the time from
pandemic to functional vaccine right to

pandemic to functional vaccine right to
 

12051
03:33:48,600 --> 03:33:50,929
pandemic to functional vaccine right to
today's even if you'd actually really

12052
03:33:50,929 --> 03:33:50,939
today's even if you'd actually really
 

12053
03:33:50,939 --> 03:33:52,729
today's even if you'd actually really
acted on it the fact that that didn't

12054
03:33:52,729 --> 03:33:52,739
acted on it the fact that that didn't
 

12055
03:33:52,739 --> 03:33:54,889
acted on it the fact that that didn't
happen and that the Chinese solution of

12056
03:33:54,889 --> 03:33:54,899
happen and that the Chinese solution of
 

12057
03:33:54,899 --> 03:33:56,750
happen and that the Chinese solution of
lockdown that actually you know at the

12058
03:33:56,750 --> 03:33:56,760
lockdown that actually you know at the
 

12059
03:33:56,760 --> 03:33:58,250
lockdown that actually you know at the
beginning people thought the state could

12060
03:33:58,250 --> 03:33:58,260
beginning people thought the state could
 

12061
03:33:58,260 --> 03:34:00,229
beginning people thought the state could
you know potentially stop the virus stop

non-pharmaceutical intervention really
 

12069
03:34:06,239 --> 03:34:08,210
non-pharmaceutical intervention really
turned out to work that much right

12070
03:34:08,210 --> 03:34:08,220
turned out to work that much right
 

12071
03:34:08,220 --> 03:34:09,590
turned out to work that much right
and actually at the very beginning the

12072
03:34:09,590 --> 03:34:09,600
and actually at the very beginning the
 

12073
03:34:09,600 --> 03:34:11,450
and actually at the very beginning the
pandemic I said something like look it's

12074
03:34:11,450 --> 03:34:11,460
pandemic I said something like look it's
 

12075
03:34:11,460 --> 03:34:12,769
pandemic I said something like look it's
actually February 3rd about a month

nationalism centralization and this may

12112
03:34:46,550 --> 03:34:46,560
nationalism centralization and this may
 

12113
03:34:46,560 --> 03:34:49,070
nationalism centralization and this may
actually work to stop the spread but

12114
03:34:49,070 --> 03:34:49,080
actually work to stop the spread but
 

12115
03:34:49,080 --> 03:34:50,630
actually work to stop the spread but
once under control States will not see

12116
03:34:50,630 --> 03:34:50,640
once under control States will not see
 

12117
03:34:50,640 --> 03:34:54,050
once under control States will not see
their powers so we decentralize and I

12118
03:34:54,050 --> 03:34:54,060
their powers so we decentralize and I
 

12119
03:34:54,060 --> 03:34:54,889
their powers so we decentralize and I
didn't know whether it was going to stop

12120
03:34:54,889 --> 03:34:54,899
didn't know whether it was going to stop
 

12121
03:34:54,899 --> 03:34:56,090
didn't know whether it was going to stop
the spread but I knew that they were

12122
03:34:56,090 --> 03:34:56,100
the spread but I knew that they were
 

12123
03:34:56,100 --> 03:34:58,670
the spread but I knew that they were
going to try to do it right and you know

12124
03:34:58,670 --> 03:34:58,680
going to try to do it right and you know
 

12125
03:34:58,680 --> 03:35:00,469
going to try to do it right and you know
look it's it's hard to call every single

12126
03:35:00,469 --> 03:35:00,479
look it's it's hard to call every single
 

12127
03:35:00,479 --> 03:35:02,150
look it's it's hard to call every single
thing right and you know I'm sure you

12128
03:35:02,150 --> 03:35:02,160
thing right and you know I'm sure you
 

12129
03:35:02,160 --> 03:35:03,410
thing right and you know I'm sure you
know someone will find some errors but

12130
03:35:03,410 --> 03:35:03,420
know someone will find some errors but
 

12131
03:35:03,420 --> 03:35:05,210
know someone will find some errors but
in general I think that was that was

12132
03:35:05,210 --> 03:35:05,220
in general I think that was that was
 

12133
03:35:05,220 --> 03:35:06,530
in general I think that was that was
actually pretty good for like early

12134
03:35:06,530 --> 03:35:06,540
actually pretty good for like early
 

12135
03:35:06,540 --> 03:35:08,809
actually pretty good for like early
February of 2020 right so it's my point

12136
03:35:08,809 --> 03:35:08,819
February of 2020 right so it's my point
 

12137
03:35:08,819 --> 03:35:11,809
February of 2020 right so it's my point
though the point is rather than copying

12138
03:35:11,809 --> 03:35:11,819
though the point is rather than copying

12451
03:40:52,920 --> 03:40:55,670
better than the fed that's really
difficult to do because the fed and the

12452
03:40:55,670 --> 03:40:55,680
difficult to do because the fed and the
 

12453
03:40:55,680 --> 03:40:57,290
difficult to do because the fed and the
FDA they're like the Hub of the current

12454
03:40:57,290 --> 03:40:57,300
FDA they're like the Hub of the current
 

12455
03:40:57,300 --> 03:40:59,450
FDA they're like the Hub of the current
system people rely on them for lots of

12456
03:40:59,450 --> 03:40:59,460
system people rely on them for lots of
 

12457
03:40:59,460 --> 03:41:02,030
system people rely on them for lots of
different things okay and

12458
03:41:02,030 --> 03:41:02,040
different things okay and
 

12459
03:41:02,040 --> 03:41:04,790
different things okay and
um you're going to need a better version

12460
03:41:04,790 --> 03:41:04,800
um you're going to need a better version
 

12461
03:41:04,800 --> 03:41:06,650
um you're going to need a better version
of them and how would you actually build

12462
03:41:06,650 --> 03:41:06,660
of them and how would you actually build
 

12463
03:41:06,660 --> 03:41:08,990
of them and how would you actually build
something like that so with the fed and

12464
03:41:08,990 --> 03:41:09,000
something like that so with the fed and
 

12465
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:12,650
something like that so with the fed and
with you know SEC and and the entire you

12466
03:41:12,650 --> 03:41:12,660
with you know SEC and and the entire you
 

12467
03:41:12,660 --> 03:41:15,469
with you know SEC and and the entire you
know the banks and whatnot crypto has a

12468
03:41:15,469 --> 03:41:15,479
know the banks and whatnot crypto has a
 

12469
03:41:15,479 --> 03:41:16,729
know the banks and whatnot crypto has a
pretty good set of answers for these

12470
03:41:16,729 --> 03:41:16,739
pretty good set of answers for these
 

12471
03:41:16,739 --> 03:41:19,130
pretty good set of answers for these
things and over time

12472
03:41:19,130 --> 03:41:19,140
things and over time
 

12473
03:41:19,140 --> 03:41:22,010
things and over time
all the countries that are not or all

12474
03:41:22,010 --> 03:41:22,020
all the countries that are not or all
 

12475
03:41:22,020 --> 03:41:23,210
all the countries that are not or all
the groups that are not the U.S

12476
03:41:23,210 --> 03:41:23,220
the groups that are not the U.S
 

12477
03:41:23,220 --> 03:41:25,429
the groups that are not the U.S
establishment or the CCP will find more

12478
03:41:25,429 --> 03:41:25,439
establishment or the CCP will find more
 

12479
03:41:25,439 --> 03:41:27,229
establishment or the CCP will find more
and more to their liking in the crypto

12480
03:41:27,229 --> 03:41:27,239
and more to their liking in the crypto
 

12481
03:41:27,239 --> 03:41:29,210
and more to their liking in the crypto
economy so that part I think is going

12482
03:41:29,210 --> 03:41:29,220
economy so that part I think is going
 

12483
03:41:29,220 --> 03:41:31,309
economy so that part I think is going
okay we can talk about that

12484
03:41:31,309 --> 03:41:31,319
okay we can talk about that
 

12485
03:41:31,319 --> 03:41:33,710
okay we can talk about that
what does that look like for biomedicine

12486
03:41:33,710 --> 03:41:33,720
what does that look like for biomedicine
 

12487
03:41:33,720 --> 03:41:35,690
what does that look like for biomedicine
well first what does exit the FDA look

12488
03:41:35,690 --> 03:41:35,700
well first what does exit the FDA look
 

12489
03:41:35,700 --> 03:41:38,389
well first what does exit the FDA look
like right so there actually are a bunch

12490
03:41:38,389 --> 03:41:38,399
like right so there actually are a bunch
 

12491
03:41:38,399 --> 03:41:41,809
like right so there actually are a bunch
of exits from the FDA already

12492
03:41:41,809 --> 03:41:41,819
of exits from the FDA already
 

12493
03:41:41,819 --> 03:41:44,150
of exits from the FDA already
um which is uh things like right to try

12494
03:41:44,150 --> 03:41:44,160
um which is uh things like right to try
 

12495
03:41:44,160 --> 03:41:46,670
um which is uh things like right to try
laws okay CLIA labs and laboratory

12496
03:41:46,670 --> 03:41:46,680
laws okay CLIA labs and laboratory
 

12497
03:41:46,680 --> 03:41:48,650
laws okay CLIA labs and laboratory
developed tests compounding pharmacies

12498
03:41:48,650 --> 03:41:48,660
developed tests compounding pharmacies
 

12499
03:41:48,660 --> 03:41:51,410
developed tests compounding pharmacies
off little prescription by doctors and

12500
03:41:51,410 --> 03:41:51,420
off little prescription by doctors and
 

12501
03:41:51,420 --> 03:41:52,969
off little prescription by doctors and
countries that aren't fully harmonized

12502
03:41:52,969 --> 03:41:52,979
countries that aren't fully harmonized
 

12503
03:41:52,979 --> 03:41:54,710
countries that aren't fully harmonized
with FDA for example you you know Kobe

12504
03:41:54,710 --> 03:41:54,720
with FDA for example you you know Kobe
 

12505
03:41:54,720 --> 03:41:56,990
with FDA for example you you know Kobe
Kobe Bryant before he passed away went

12506
03:41:56,990 --> 03:41:57,000
Kobe Bryant before he passed away went
 

12507
03:41:57,000 --> 03:41:58,910
Kobe Bryant before he passed away went
and did uh stem cell treatments in in

12508
03:41:58,910 --> 03:41:58,920
and did uh stem cell treatments in in
 

12509
03:41:58,920 --> 03:42:01,190
and did uh stem cell treatments in in
Germany okay stem cells have been pushed

12510
03:42:01,190 --> 03:42:01,200
Germany okay stem cells have been pushed
 

12511
03:42:01,200 --> 03:42:02,510
Germany okay stem cells have been pushed
out you know I think in part by the Bush

12512
03:42:02,510 --> 03:42:02,520
out you know I think in part by the Bush
 

12513
03:42:02,520 --> 03:42:05,630
out you know I think in part by the Bush
Administration by other things so

12514
03:42:05,630 --> 03:42:05,640
Administration by other things so
 

12515
03:42:05,640 --> 03:42:07,309
Administration by other things so
um those are different kinds of exits

12516
03:42:07,309 --> 03:42:07,319
um those are different kinds of exits
 

12517
03:42:07,319 --> 03:42:09,469
um those are different kinds of exits
right to try basically means you know at

12518
03:42:09,469 --> 03:42:09,479
right to try basically means you know at
 

12519
03:42:09,479 --> 03:42:11,630
right to try basically means you know at
the state level you can just try the

12520
03:42:11,630 --> 03:42:11,640
the state level you can just try the
 

12521
03:42:11,640 --> 03:42:13,370
the state level you can just try the
drug okay

12522
03:42:13,370 --> 03:42:13,380
drug okay
 

12523
03:42:13,380 --> 03:42:14,090
drug okay
um

12524
03:42:14,090 --> 03:42:14,100
um
 

12525
03:42:14,100 --> 03:42:17,090
um
CLIA labs and ldts that means that's a

12526
03:42:17,090 --> 03:42:17,100
CLIA labs and ldts that means that's a
 

12527
03:42:17,100 --> 03:42:18,229
CLIA labs and ldts that means that's a
path where you don't have to go through

12528
03:42:18,229 --> 03:42:18,239
path where you don't have to go through
 

12529
03:42:18,239 --> 03:42:19,910
path where you don't have to go through
FDA to get a new device approved you can

12530
03:42:19,910 --> 03:42:19,920
FDA to get a new device approved you can
 

12531
03:42:19,920 --> 03:42:21,429
FDA to get a new device approved you can
just run run it in a lab okay

12532
03:42:21,429 --> 03:42:21,439
just run run it in a lab okay
 

12533
03:42:21,439 --> 03:42:23,269
just run run it in a lab okay
compounding pharmacies these were under

12534
03:42:23,269 --> 03:42:23,279
compounding pharmacies these were under
 

12535
03:42:23,279 --> 03:42:24,710
compounding pharmacies these were under
attack I'm not sure actually where the

12536
03:42:24,710 --> 03:42:24,720
attack I'm not sure actually where the
 

12537
03:42:24,720 --> 03:42:26,150
attack I'm not sure actually where the
current you know statute is on this but

12538
03:42:26,150 --> 03:42:26,160
current you know statute is on this but
 

12539
03:42:26,160 --> 03:42:27,830
current you know statute is on this but
this is the idea that a pharmacist has

12540
03:42:27,830 --> 03:42:27,840
this is the idea that a pharmacist has
 

12541
03:42:27,840 --> 03:42:29,690
this is the idea that a pharmacist has
some discretion and how they you know

12542
03:42:29,690 --> 03:42:29,700
some discretion and how they you know
 

12543
03:42:29,700 --> 03:42:32,389
some discretion and how they you know
prepare mixtures of of drugs

12544
03:42:32,389 --> 03:42:32,399
prepare mixtures of of drugs
 

12545
03:42:32,399 --> 03:42:35,330
prepare mixtures of of drugs
um off little prescription by MDS so MDS

12546
03:42:35,330 --> 03:42:35,340
um off little prescription by MDS so MDS
 

12547
03:42:35,340 --> 03:42:36,769
um off little prescription by MDS so MDS
have enough like weight in the system

12548
03:42:36,769 --> 03:42:36,779
have enough like weight in the system
 

12549
03:42:36,779 --> 03:42:38,389
have enough like weight in the system
that they can kind of push back on FDA

12550
03:42:38,389 --> 03:42:38,399
that they can kind of push back on FDA
 

12551
03:42:38,399 --> 03:42:40,130
that they can kind of push back on FDA
an awful little prescription is the

12552
03:42:40,130 --> 03:42:40,140
an awful little prescription is the
 

12553
03:42:40,140 --> 03:42:41,510
an awful little prescription is the
concept that a drug that's approved for

12554
03:42:41,510 --> 03:42:41,520
concept that a drug that's approved for
 

12555
03:42:41,520 --> 03:42:42,950
concept that a drug that's approved for
purpose a can be prescribed for purpose

12556
03:42:42,950 --> 03:42:42,960
purpose a can be prescribed for purpose
 

12557
03:42:42,960 --> 03:42:44,809
purpose a can be prescribed for purpose
B or C or D without going through

12558
03:42:44,809 --> 03:42:44,819
B or C or D without going through
 

12559
03:42:44,819 --> 03:42:47,030
B or C or D without going through
another you know whole new drug approval

12560
03:42:47,030 --> 03:42:47,040
another you know whole new drug approval
 

12561
03:42:47,040 --> 03:42:48,229
another you know whole new drug approval
process

12562
03:42:48,229 --> 03:42:48,239
process
 

12563
03:42:48,239 --> 03:42:49,070
process
um and then countries that aren't

12564
03:42:49,070 --> 03:42:49,080
um and then countries that aren't
 

12565
03:42:49,080 --> 03:42:50,389
um and then countries that aren't
harmonized right so those are like five

12566
03:42:50,389 --> 03:42:50,399
harmonized right so those are like five
 

12567
03:42:50,399 --> 03:42:52,670
harmonized right so those are like five
different kinds of exits from the FDA on

12568
03:42:52,670 --> 03:42:52,680
different kinds of exits from the FDA on
 

12569
03:42:52,680 --> 03:42:54,290
different kinds of exits from the FDA on
different directions

12570
03:42:54,290 --> 03:42:54,300
different directions
 

12571
03:42:54,300 --> 03:42:56,210
different directions
um so first those exits exist so for

12572
03:42:56,210 --> 03:42:56,220
um so first those exits exist so for
 

12573
03:42:56,220 --> 03:42:57,469
um so first those exits exist so for
those people who are like oh my God

12574
03:42:57,469 --> 03:42:57,479
those people who are like oh my God
 

12575
03:42:57,479 --> 03:42:58,969
those people who are like oh my God
we're all going to die or he's going to

12576
03:42:58,969 --> 03:42:58,979
we're all going to die or he's going to
 

12577
03:42:58,979 --> 03:43:00,830
we're all going to die or he's going to
poison us with you non-fda approved

12578
03:43:00,830 --> 03:43:00,840
poison us with you non-fda approved
 

12579
03:43:00,840 --> 03:43:04,010
poison us with you non-fda approved
things or whatever right like uh those

12580
03:43:04,010 --> 03:43:04,020
things or whatever right like uh those
 

12581
03:43:04,020 --> 03:43:06,050
things or whatever right like uh those
eggs exists you've probably actually use

12582
03:43:06,050 --> 03:43:06,060
eggs exists you've probably actually use
 

12583
03:43:06,060 --> 03:43:08,210
eggs exists you've probably actually use
tests or treatments from those you don't

12584
03:43:08,210 --> 03:43:08,220
tests or treatments from those you don't
 

12585
03:43:08,220 --> 03:43:09,889
tests or treatments from those you don't
even realize that you have right so it's

12586
03:43:09,889 --> 03:43:09,899
even realize that you have right so it's
 

12587
03:43:09,899 --> 03:43:11,750
even realize that you have right so it's
it hasn't killed you number one number

12588
03:43:11,750 --> 03:43:11,760
it hasn't killed you number one number
 

12589
03:43:11,760 --> 03:43:14,030
it hasn't killed you number one number
two is actually testing for safety um

12590
03:43:14,030 --> 03:43:14,040
two is actually testing for safety um
 

12591
03:43:14,040 --> 03:43:16,010
two is actually testing for safety um
you know there's safety efficacy and

12592
03:43:16,010 --> 03:43:16,020
you know there's safety efficacy and
 

12593
03:43:16,020 --> 03:43:18,650
you know there's safety efficacy and
like comparative safety is uh it's

12594
03:43:18,650 --> 03:43:18,660
like comparative safety is uh it's
 

12595
03:43:18,660 --> 03:43:19,849
like comparative safety is uh it's
actually relatively easy to test for

12596
03:43:19,849 --> 03:43:19,859
actually relatively easy to test for
 

12597
03:43:19,859 --> 03:43:22,309
actually relatively easy to test for
there's very few drugs that are like

12598
03:43:22,309 --> 03:43:22,319
there's very few drugs that are like
 

12599
03:43:22,319 --> 03:43:24,290
there's very few drugs that are like
um there's tgn1412 that's a famous

12600
03:43:24,290 --> 03:43:24,300
um there's tgn1412 that's a famous
 

12601
03:43:24,300 --> 03:43:25,309
um there's tgn1412 that's a famous
example something there's actually

12602
03:43:25,309 --> 03:43:25,319
example something there's actually
 

12603
03:43:25,319 --> 03:43:27,769
example something there's actually
really dangerous to people right with an

12604
03:43:27,769 --> 03:43:27,779
really dangerous to people right with an
 

12605
03:43:27,779 --> 03:43:29,570
really dangerous to people right with an
early test so those do exist just

12606
03:43:29,570 --> 03:43:29,580
early test so those do exist just
 

12607
03:43:29,580 --> 03:43:31,130
early test so those do exist just
acknowledge they do exist but in general

12608
03:43:31,130 --> 03:43:31,140
acknowledge they do exist but in general
 

12609
03:43:31,140 --> 03:43:33,290
acknowledge they do exist but in general
testing for safety is actually not that

12610
03:43:33,290 --> 03:43:33,300
testing for safety is actually not that
 

12611
03:43:33,300 --> 03:43:36,170
testing for safety is actually not that
hard to do okay and if something is safe

12612
03:43:36,170 --> 03:43:36,180
hard to do okay and if something is safe
 

12613
03:43:36,180 --> 03:43:37,429
hard to do okay and if something is safe
then you should be able to try it

12614
03:43:37,429 --> 03:43:37,439
then you should be able to try it
 

12615
03:43:37,439 --> 03:43:39,530
then you should be able to try it
usually okay now what is that

12616
03:43:39,530 --> 03:43:39,540
usually okay now what is that
 

12617
03:43:39,540 --> 03:43:40,969
usually okay now what is that
decentralized FDA look like well

12618
03:43:40,969 --> 03:43:40,979
decentralized FDA look like well
 

12619
03:43:40,979 --> 03:43:42,950
decentralized FDA look like well
basically you take individual pieces of

12620
03:43:42,950 --> 03:43:42,960
basically you take individual pieces of
 

12621
03:43:42,960 --> 03:43:44,710
basically you take individual pieces of
it and you can often turn them into

12622
03:43:44,710 --> 03:43:44,720
it and you can often turn them into
 

12623
03:43:44,720 --> 03:43:47,809
it and you can often turn them into
vehicles and um

12624

12825
03:47:17,279 --> 03:47:19,729
phase four okay
is a huge thing is it can you comment on

12826
03:47:19,729 --> 03:47:19,739
is a huge thing is it can you comment on
 

12827
03:47:19,739 --> 03:47:22,389
is a huge thing is it can you comment on
that is there what incentive mechanism

12828
03:47:22,389 --> 03:47:22,399
that is there what incentive mechanism
 

12829
03:47:22,399 --> 03:47:26,090
that is there what incentive mechanism
forces the the modernization of that

12830
03:47:26,090 --> 03:47:26,100
forces the the modernization of that
 

12831
03:47:26,100 --> 03:47:27,229
forces the the modernization of that
kind of thing here's how it would work

12832
03:47:27,229 --> 03:47:27,239
kind of thing here's how it would work

12837
03:47:31,080 --> 03:47:34,190
yeah here's here's here's how that would
work right you go to uh you know the

12838
03:47:34,190 --> 03:47:34,200
work right you go to uh you know the
 

12839
03:47:34,200 --> 03:47:36,769
work right you go to uh you know the
pharmacy or you know wherever and you

12840
03:47:36,769 --> 03:47:36,779

hold up your phone and you scan the
barcode of the drug okay what does you

12844
03:47:39,650 --> 03:47:39,660
barcode of the drug okay what does you
 

12845
03:47:39,660 --> 03:47:42,229
barcode of the drug okay what does you
see instantly you see global reports

12846
03:47:42,229 --> 03:47:42,239
see instantly you see global reports
 

12847
03:47:42,239 --> 03:47:44,389
see instantly you see global reports
right by the way because your biology or

12848
03:47:44,389 --> 03:47:44,399
right by the way because your biology or
 

12849
03:47:44,399 --> 03:47:45,710
right by the way because your biology or
physiology that's Global right

12850
03:47:45,710 --> 03:47:45,720
physiology that's Global right
 

12851
03:47:45,720 --> 03:47:49,370
physiology that's Global right
information from Brazil or from Germany

12852
03:47:49,370 --> 03:47:49,380
information from Brazil or from Germany
 

12853
03:47:49,380 --> 03:47:53,330

03:47:53,330 --> 03:47:53,340
or uh Japan on their physiological
 

12855
03:47:53,340 --> 03:47:55,910
or uh Japan on their physiological
reaction to your the same drug you're

12856
03:47:55,910 --> 03:47:55,920
reaction to your the same drug you're
 

12857
03:47:55,920 --> 03:47:57,650
reaction to your the same drug you're
taking is useful to you it's not like a

12858
03:47:57,650 --> 03:47:57,660
taking is useful to you it's not like a
 

12859
03:47:57,660 --> 03:47:59,090
taking is useful to you it's not like a
national boundaries thing so the whole

12860
03:47:59,090 --> 03:47:59,100
national boundaries thing so the whole
 

12861
03:47:59,100 --> 03:48:00,590
national boundaries thing so the whole
nation-state model of only collecting

12862
03:48:00,590 --> 03:48:00,600
nation-state model of only collecting
 

12863
03:48:00,600 --> 03:48:02,510
nation-state model of only collecting
information on by other Americans so

12864
03:48:02,510 --> 03:48:02,520
information on by other Americans so
 

12865
03:48:02,520 --> 03:48:03,830
information on by other Americans so
really you want a global kind of thing

12866
03:48:03,830 --> 03:48:03,840
really you want a global kind of thing
 

12867
03:48:03,840 --> 03:48:05,990
really you want a global kind of thing
just like you know Amazon book reviews

12868
03:48:05,990 --> 03:48:06,000
just like you know Amazon book reviews
 

12869
03:48:06,000 --> 03:48:07,849
just like you know Amazon book reviews
that's like that's a global thing other

12870
03:48:07,849 --> 03:48:07,859
that's like that's a global thing other
 

12871
03:48:07,859 --> 03:48:09,110
that's like that's a global thing other
things are aggregate at the global level

12872
03:48:09,110 --> 03:48:09,120
things are aggregate at the global level
 

12873
03:48:09,120 --> 03:48:11,330
things are aggregate at the global level
Okay so

12874
03:48:11,330 --> 03:48:11,340
Okay so
 

12875
03:48:11,340 --> 03:48:13,910
Okay so
what you want is to see every patient

12876
03:48:13,910 --> 03:48:13,920
what you want is to see every patient
 

12877
03:48:13,920 --> 03:48:16,610
what you want is to see every patient
report and every Doctor around the world

12878
03:48:16,610 --> 03:48:16,620
report and every Doctor around the world
 

12879
03:48:16,620 --> 03:48:19,070
report and every Doctor around the world
on this drug that might be really

12880
03:48:19,070 --> 03:48:19,080
on this drug that might be really
 

12881
03:48:19,080 --> 03:48:21,530
on this drug that might be really
important to your rare or semi-rare

12882
03:48:21,530 --> 03:48:21,540
important to your rare or semi-rare
 

12883
03:48:21,540 --> 03:48:24,050
important to your rare or semi-rare
condition just that alone would be a

12884
03:48:24,050 --> 03:48:24,060
condition just that alone would be a
 

12885
03:48:24,060 --> 03:48:25,729
condition just that alone would be a
valuable site who builds that site it's

12886
03:48:25,729 --> 03:48:25,739
valuable site who builds that site it's
 

12887
03:48:25,739 --> 03:48:28,250
valuable site who builds that site it's
uh it's it sounds like something created

12888
03:48:28,250 --> 03:48:28,260
uh it's it sounds like something created
 

12889
03:48:28,260 --> 03:48:29,929
uh it's it sounds like something created
by capitalism sounds like you could do

12890
03:48:29,929 --> 03:48:29,939
by capitalism sounds like you could do
 

12891
03:48:29,939 --> 03:48:32,030
by capitalism sounds like you could do
it would have to be a company yeah you

12892
03:48:32,030 --> 03:48:32,040
it would have to be a company yeah you
 

12893
03:48:32,040 --> 03:48:33,170
it would have to be a company yeah you
can definitely do see these well we

12894
03:48:33,170 --> 03:48:33,180
can definitely do see these well we
 

12895
03:48:33,180 --> 03:48:35,150
can definitely do see these well we
don't have a world where a company is

12896
03:48:35,150 --> 03:48:35,160
don't have a world where a company is
 

12897
03:48:35,160 --> 03:48:36,469
don't have a world where a company is
allowed to be in charge of that kind of

12898
03:48:36,469 --> 03:48:36,479
allowed to be in charge of that kind of
 

12899
03:48:36,479 --> 03:48:37,849
allowed to be in charge of that kind of
thing well I don't know if Health one

12900
03:48:37,849 --> 03:48:37,859
thing well I don't know if Health one
 

12901
03:48:37,859 --> 03:48:40,010
thing well I don't know if Health one
went down it just seems like a lot of

12902
03:48:40,010 --> 03:48:40,020
went down it just seems like a lot of
 

12903
03:48:40,020 --> 03:48:40,849
went down it just seems like a lot of
the

12904
03:48:40,849 --> 03:48:40,859
the
 

12905
03:48:40,859 --> 03:48:43,309
the
so it depends right basically this is

12906
03:48:43,309 --> 03:48:43,319
so it depends right basically this is
 

12907
03:48:43,319 --> 03:48:44,690
so it depends right basically this is
why you have to pick off individual

12908
03:48:44,690 --> 03:48:44,700
why you have to pick off individual
 

12909
03:48:44,700 --> 03:48:46,610
why you have to pick off individual
elements right there's essentially a

12910
03:48:46,610 --> 03:48:46,620
elements right there's essentially a
 

12911
03:48:46,620 --> 03:48:49,849
elements right there's essentially a
combination of first recognizing that

12912
03:48:49,849 --> 03:48:49,859
combination of first recognizing that
 

12913
03:48:49,859 --> 03:48:51,410
combination of first recognizing that
um DFT is actually bad even be able to

12914
03:48:51,410 --> 03:48:51,420
um DFT is actually bad even be able to
 

12915
03:48:51,420 --> 03:48:53,510
um DFT is actually bad even be able to
say that that let me put it like this it

12916
03:48:53,510 --> 03:48:53,520
say that that let me put it like this it
 

12917
03:48:53,520 --> 03:48:55,790
say that that let me put it like this it
does a lot of bad things it is something

12918
03:48:55,790 --> 03:48:55,800
does a lot of bad things it is something
 

12919
03:48:55,800 --> 03:48:57,229
does a lot of bad things it is something
which you need to be able to criticize

12920
03:48:57,229 --> 03:48:57,239
which you need to be able to criticize
 

12921
03:48:57,239 --> 03:48:59,269
which you need to be able to criticize
you might be like well that's obvious

12922
03:48:59,269 --> 03:48:59,279
you might be like well that's obvious
 

12923
03:48:59,279 --> 03:49:01,790
you might be like well that's obvious
right well in 2010 for example there's a

12924
03:49:01,790 --> 03:49:01,800
right well in 2010 for example there's a
 

12925
03:49:01,800 --> 03:49:03,170
right well in 2010 for example there's a
book that came out if anybody wants to

12926
03:49:03,170 --> 03:49:03,180
book that came out if anybody wants to
 

12927
03:49:03,180 --> 03:49:04,790
book that came out if anybody wants to
understand FDA it's called reputation

12928
03:49:04,790 --> 03:49:04,800
understand FDA it's called reputation
 

12929
03:49:04,800 --> 03:49:07,250
understand FDA it's called reputation
and power yeah a lot of people don't

12930
03:49:07,250 --> 03:49:07,260
and power yeah a lot of people don't
 

12931
03:49:07,260 --> 03:49:09,170
and power yeah a lot of people don't
want to criticize FDA yeah because they

12932
03:49:09,170 --> 03:49:09,180
want to criticize FDA yeah because they
 

12933
03:49:09,180 --> 03:49:11,030
want to criticize FDA yeah because they
will retaliate against your biotech or

12934
03:49:11,030 --> 03:49:11,040
will retaliate against your biotech or
 

12935
03:49:11,040 --> 03:49:13,010
will retaliate against your biotech or
Pharma company yeah and that retaliation

12936
03:49:13,010 --> 03:49:13,020
Pharma company yeah and that retaliation
 

12937
03:49:13,020 --> 03:49:14,929
Pharma company yeah and that retaliation
can be initiated by a single human being

12938
03:49:14,929 --> 03:49:14,939
can be initiated by a single human being
 

12939
03:49:14,939 --> 03:49:17,929
can be initiated by a single human being
absolutely the best analogy is you think

12940
03:49:17,929 --> 03:49:17,939
absolutely the best analogy is you think
 

12941
03:49:17,939 --> 03:49:19,969
absolutely the best analogy is you think
about the TSA okay have you flown

12942
03:49:19,969 --> 03:49:19,979
about the TSA okay have you flown
 

12943
03:49:19,979 --> 03:49:22,729
about the TSA okay have you flown
recently okay do you make any jokes

12944
03:49:22,729 --> 03:49:22,739
recently okay do you make any jokes
 

12945
03:49:22,739 --> 03:49:24,050
recently okay do you make any jokes
about the TSA when you're in the TSA

12946
03:49:24,050 --> 03:49:24,060
about the TSA when you're in the TSA
 

12947
03:49:24,060 --> 03:49:25,130
about the TSA when you're in the TSA

a little more flexible you know what can

12952

a little more flexible you know what can
 

12953
03:49:29,100 --> 03:49:31,969
a little more flexible you know what can
I tell a story sure which is

12954
03:49:31,969 --> 03:49:31,979
I tell a story sure which is

13010
03:50:39,469 --> 03:50:39,479
night with friends and so on instead I'm
 

13011
03:50:39,479 --> 03:50:41,570
night with friends and so on instead I'm
standing alone crying in Vegas which is

13012
03:50:41,570 --> 03:50:41,580
standing alone crying in Vegas which is
 

13013
03:50:41,580 --> 03:50:43,250
standing alone crying in Vegas which is
not a unique Vegas experience sure

13014
03:50:43,250 --> 03:50:43,260
not a unique Vegas experience sure
 

13015
03:50:43,260 --> 03:50:45,050
not a unique Vegas experience sure
actually a fundamental Vegas experience

13016
03:50:45,050 --> 03:50:45,060
actually a fundamental Vegas experience
 

13017
03:50:45,060 --> 03:50:47,690
actually a fundamental Vegas experience
but that I'm sure that basic human

13018
03:50:47,690 --> 03:50:47,700
but that I'm sure that basic human
 

13019
03:50:47,700 --> 03:50:50,150
but that I'm sure that basic human
nature happens in the FDA as well that's

13020
03:50:50,150 --> 03:50:50,160
nature happens in the FDA as well that's
 

13021
03:50:50,160 --> 03:50:52,429
nature happens in the FDA as well that's
exactly right so just like with the TSA

13022
03:50:52,429 --> 03:50:52,439
exactly right so just like with the TSA
 

13023
03:50:52,439 --> 03:50:55,010
exactly right so just like with the TSA
you know just to extend the analogy when

13024
03:50:55,010 --> 03:50:55,020
you know just to extend the analogy when
 

13025
03:50:55,020 --> 03:50:57,590
you know just to extend the analogy when
you're in line at the TSA right you

13026
03:50:57,590 --> 03:50:57,600
you're in line at the TSA right you
 

13027
03:50:57,600 --> 03:50:58,790
you're in line at the TSA right you
don't want to miss your flight that

13028
03:50:58,790 --> 03:50:58,800
don't want to miss your flight that
 

13029
03:50:58,800 --> 03:51:00,769
don't want to miss your flight that
could cost you hundreds of dollars and

13030
03:51:00,769 --> 03:51:00,779
could cost you hundreds of dollars and
 

13031
03:51:00,779 --> 03:51:02,570
could cost you hundreds of dollars and
so you comply with apps ludicrous

13032
03:51:02,570 --> 03:51:02,580
so you comply with apps ludicrous
 

13033
03:51:02,580 --> 03:51:05,690
so you comply with apps ludicrous
regulations like oh three ounce bottles

13034
03:51:05,690 --> 03:51:05,700
regulations like oh three ounce bottles
 

13035
03:51:05,700 --> 03:51:07,070
regulations like oh three ounce bottles
well you know you can take an unlimited

13036
03:51:07,070 --> 03:51:07,080
well you know you can take an unlimited
 

13037
03:51:07,080 --> 03:51:08,990
well you know you can take an unlimited
number of three ounce bottles and you

13038
03:51:08,990 --> 03:51:09,000
number of three ounce bottles and you
 

13039
03:51:09,000 --> 03:51:11,630
number of three ounce bottles and you
can combine them into a six ounce bottle

13040
03:51:11,630 --> 03:51:11,640
can combine them into a six ounce bottle
 

13041
03:51:11,640 --> 03:51:13,010
can combine them into a six ounce bottle

think uh a security theater is is

13060
03:51:34,729 --> 03:51:34,739
think uh a security theater is is
 

13061
03:51:34,739 --> 03:51:36,290

shire's term right A lot of people know

13062
03:51:36,290 --> 03:51:36,300
shire's term right A lot of people know
 

13063
03:51:36,300 --> 03:51:37,849
shire's term right A lot of people know
this term so millions of people are

13064
03:51:37,849 --> 03:51:37,859
this term so millions of people are
 

13065
03:51:37,859 --> 03:51:40,490
this term so millions of people are
subject to it it costs Untold billions

13066
03:51:40,490 --> 03:51:40,500
subject to it it costs Untold billions
 

13067
03:51:40,500 --> 03:51:42,410
subject to it it costs Untold billions
of dollars in terms of delays and why

13068
03:51:42,410 --> 03:51:42,420
of dollars in terms of delays and why
 

13069
03:51:42,420 --> 03:51:44,870
of dollars in terms of delays and why
not if you just walk up to right it um

13070
03:51:44,870 --> 03:51:44,880
not if you just walk up to right it um
 

13071
03:51:44,880 --> 03:51:46,670
not if you just walk up to right it um
it irradiates people and there's another

13072
03:51:46,670 --> 03:51:46,680
it irradiates people and there's another
 

13073
03:51:46,680 --> 03:51:48,889
it irradiates people and there's another
FDA thing by the way this is an FDA TSA

13074
03:51:48,889 --> 03:51:48,899
FDA thing by the way this is an FDA TSA
 

13075
03:51:48,899 --> 03:51:51,830
FDA thing by the way this is an FDA TSA
team up okay in 2010 the TSA body

13076
03:51:51,830 --> 03:51:51,840
team up okay in 2010 the TSA body
 

13077
03:51:51,840 --> 03:51:53,929
team up okay in 2010 the TSA body
scanners there were concerns expressed

13078
03:51:53,929 --> 03:51:53,939
scanners there were concerns expressed
 

13079
03:51:53,939 --> 03:51:55,849
scanners there were concerns expressed
but when it's a government to government

13080
03:51:55,849 --> 03:51:55,859
but when it's a government to government
 

13081
03:51:55,859 --> 03:51:57,889
but when it's a government to government
thing see a.com is treated with extreme

13082
03:51:57,889 --> 03:51:57,899
thing see a.com is treated with extreme
 

13083
03:51:57,899 --> 03:51:59,630
thing see a.com is treated with extreme
scrutiny by FDA but it's another.gov

13084
03:51:59,630 --> 03:51:59,640
scrutiny by FDA but it's another.gov
 

13085
03:51:59,640 --> 03:52:00,769
scrutiny by FDA but it's another.gov
well they're not trying to make a profit

13086
03:52:00,769 --> 03:52:00,779
well they're not trying to make a profit
 

13087
03:52:00,779 --> 03:52:02,510
well they're not trying to make a profit
so they kind of sway them on through

13088
03:52:02,510 --> 03:52:02,520
so they kind of sway them on through
 

13089
03:52:02,520 --> 03:52:04,849
so they kind of sway them on through
okay so these body scanners were

13090
03:52:04,849 --> 03:52:04,859
okay so these body scanners were
 

13091
03:52:04,859 --> 03:52:07,250
okay so these body scanners were
basically like applied to millions and

13092
03:52:07,250 --> 03:52:07,260
basically like applied to millions and
 

13093
03:52:07,260 --> 03:52:09,889
basically like applied to millions and
millions of people and this huge kind of

13094
03:52:09,889 --> 03:52:09,899
millions of people and this huge kind of
 

13095
03:52:09,899 --> 03:52:11,389
millions of people and this huge kind of
opt-in experiment it's almost I think

13096
03:52:11,389 --> 03:52:11,399
opt-in experiment it's almost I think
 

13097
03:52:11,399 --> 03:52:13,790
opt-in experiment it's almost I think
it's quite likely by the way that

13098
03:52:13,790 --> 03:52:13,800
it's quite likely by the way that
 

13099
03:52:13,800 --> 03:52:15,469
it's quite likely by the way that
if there was even a slightly increased

13100
03:52:15,469 --> 03:52:15,479
if there was even a slightly increased
 

13101
03:52:15,479 --> 03:52:18,290
if there was even a slightly increased
cancer risk that the net you know

13102
03:52:18,290 --> 03:52:18,300
cancer risk that the net you know
 

13103
03:52:18,300 --> 03:52:19,849
cancer risk that the net you know
morbidian mortality from those would

13104
03:52:19,849 --> 03:52:19,859
morbidian mortality from those would
 

13105
03:52:19,859 --> 03:52:20,990
morbidian mortality from those would
have outweighed the deaths from

13106
03:52:20,990 --> 03:52:21,000
have outweighed the deaths from
 

13107
03:52:21,000 --> 03:52:22,130
have outweighed the deaths from
terrorism or whatever that were

13108
03:52:22,130 --> 03:52:22,140
terrorism or whatever that were
 

13109
03:52:22,140 --> 03:52:24,050
terrorism or whatever that were
prevented right you can work out the

13110
03:52:24,050 --> 03:52:24,060
prevented right you can work out the
 

13111
03:52:24,060 --> 03:52:25,429
prevented right you can work out the
numbers but under you can just get the

13112
03:52:25,429 --> 03:52:25,439
numbers but under you can just get the
 

13113
03:52:25,439 --> 03:52:26,809
numbers but under you can just get the
math under reasonable assumptions it's

13114
03:52:26,809 --> 03:52:26,819
math under reasonable assumptions it's
 

13115
03:52:26,819 --> 03:52:27,889
math under reasonable assumptions it's
probably true

13116
03:52:27,889 --> 03:52:27,899
probably true
 

13117
03:52:27,899 --> 03:52:29,510
probably true
um if it had any increased Mobility

13118
03:52:29,510 --> 03:52:29,520
um if it had any increased Mobility
 

13119
03:52:29,520 --> 03:52:30,650
um if it had any increased Mobility
mortality I've not seen the recent

13120
03:52:30,650 --> 03:52:30,660
mortality I've not seen the recent
 

13121
03:52:30,660 --> 03:52:32,269
mortality I've not seen the recent
things but I've seen that a concern

13122
03:52:32,269 --> 03:52:32,279
things but I've seen that a concern
 

13123
03:52:32,279 --> 03:52:34,670
things but I've seen that a concern
expressed you know 12 years ago

13124
03:52:34,670 --> 03:52:34,680
expressed you know 12 years ago
 

13125
03:52:34,680 --> 03:52:37,309
expressed you know 12 years ago
point being that despite the cost

13126
03:52:37,309 --> 03:52:37,319
point being that despite the cost
 

13127
03:52:37,319 --> 03:52:38,990
point being that despite the cost
despite how many people are exposed to

13128
03:52:38,990 --> 03:52:39,000
despite how many people are exposed to
 

13129
03:52:39,000 --> 03:52:40,729
despite how many people are exposed to
it despite how obviously patently

13130
03:52:40,729 --> 03:52:40,739
it despite how obviously patently
 

13131
03:52:40,739 --> 03:52:42,830
it despite how obviously patently
ludicrous it is you don't make any

13132
03:52:42,830 --> 03:52:42,840
ludicrous it is you don't make any
 

13133
03:52:42,840 --> 03:52:44,690
ludicrous it is you don't make any
trouble nor do people organize protests

13134
03:52:44,690 --> 03:52:44,700
trouble nor do people organize protests
 

13135
03:52:44,700 --> 03:52:47,630
trouble nor do people organize protests
or whatever about this because it's

or whatever about this because it's
 

13137
03:52:47,640 --> 03:52:49,010

something where
 

13139
03:52:49,020 --> 03:52:51,290
something where
um people the security theater of the

13140
03:52:51,290 --> 03:52:51,300
um people the security theater of the
 

13141
03:52:51,300 --> 03:52:53,570
um people the security theater of the
whole thing is is part of it oh well if

13142
03:52:53,570 --> 03:52:53,580
whole thing is is part of it oh well if
 

13143
03:52:53,580 --> 03:52:54,590
whole thing is is part of it oh well if
we took them away there would be more

13144
03:52:54,590 --> 03:52:54,600
we took them away there would be more
 

13145
03:52:54,600 --> 03:52:55,849
we took them away there would be more
terrorism or something like that people

13146

think right but it is fascinating to see

13148
03:52:58,969 --> 03:52:58,979
think right but it is fascinating to see
 

13149
03:52:58,979 --> 03:53:00,590
think right but it is fascinating to see
that the populace

13150
03:53:00,590 --> 03:53:00,600
that the populace
 

13151
03:53:00,600 --> 03:53:03,590
that the populace
puts up with it because it does one of

13152
03:53:03,590 --> 03:53:03,600
puts up with it because it does one of
 

13153

brings joy to my heart because I imagine

13182
03:53:37,809 --> 03:53:37,819
brings joy to my heart because I imagine
 

13183
03:53:37,819 --> 03:53:40,429
brings joy to my heart because I imagine
uh Franz Kafka and I just walking

13184
03:53:40,429 --> 03:53:40,439
uh Franz Kafka and I just walking
 

13185
03:53:40,439 --> 03:53:42,410
uh Franz Kafka and I just walking
through there because it's it's it

13186
03:53:42,410 --> 03:53:42,420
through there because it's it's it
 

13187
03:53:42,420 --> 03:53:46,010
through there because it's it's it
really is just deeply absurd but and

13188
03:53:46,010 --> 03:53:46,020
really is just deeply absurd but and
 

13189
03:53:46,020 --> 03:53:48,710
really is just deeply absurd but and
then the the whole motivation of the

13190
03:53:48,710 --> 03:53:48,720
then the the whole motivation of the
 

13191
03:53:48,720 --> 03:53:51,290
then the the whole motivation of the
mechanism becomes distorted by the

13192
03:53:51,290 --> 03:53:51,300
mechanism becomes distorted by the
 

13193
03:53:51,300 --> 03:53:53,030
mechanism becomes distorted by the
individuals involved the initial one was

13194
03:53:53,030 --> 03:53:53,040
individuals involved the initial one was
 

13195
03:53:53,040 --> 03:53:54,469
individuals involved the initial one was
to reduce the number of terrorist

13196
03:53:54,469 --> 03:53:54,479
to reduce the number of terrorist
 

13197
03:53:54,479 --> 03:53:56,330
to reduce the number of terrorist
attacks I suppose right now it's guns

13198
03:53:56,330 --> 03:53:56,340
attacks I suppose right now it's guns
 

13199
03:53:56,340 --> 03:53:57,950
attacks I suppose right now it's guns
and drugs basically it's like what they

13200
03:53:57,950 --> 03:53:57,960
and drugs basically it's like what they
 

13201
03:53:57,960 --> 03:53:58,910
and drugs basically it's like what they
essentially what they've done is they've

13202
03:53:58,910 --> 03:53:58,920
essentially what they've done is they've
 

13203
03:53:58,920 --> 03:54:00,410
essentially what they've done is they've
repealed the Fourth Amendment right

search and seizure they can do it

13206
03:54:03,050 --> 03:54:03,060
search and seizure they can do it
 

13207
03:54:03,060 --> 03:54:04,490

without probable cause everybody is
 

13209
03:54:04,500 --> 03:54:05,750
without probable cause everybody is
being searched everybody's a potential

13210

versus 10 days what's the difference in

13346
03:56:16,070 --> 03:56:16,080
versus 10 days what's the difference in

um this is one of the things that jacks

13358
03:56:25,490 --> 03:56:25,500
um this is one of the things that jacks
 

13359

13625
04:00:56,699 --> 04:00:59,389
obeying somebody else there's not a face
to it I'll be evil that's right the evil

13626
04:00:59,389 --> 04:00:59,399
to it I'll be evil that's right the evil
 

13627
04:00:59,399 --> 04:01:01,429
to it I'll be evil that's right the evil
is the entire machine that's right

13628
04:01:01,429 --> 04:01:01,439
is the entire machine that's right
 

13629
04:01:01,439 --> 04:01:02,870
is the entire machine that's right
that's what I call the school of fish

13630
04:01:02,870 --> 04:01:02,880
that's what I call the school of fish
 

13631
04:01:02,880 --> 04:01:04,910
that's what I call the school of fish
strategy by the way it's something where

04:01:04,910 --> 04:01:04,920
strategy by the way it's something where
 

13633
04:01:04,920 --> 04:01:06,830
strategy by the way it's something where
you are an individual and you can be

you are an individual and you can be
 

13635

04:01:09,290 --> 04:01:09,300
signaled out but there's more
 

13637
04:01:09,300 --> 04:01:11,090
signaled out but there's more

tweets than all the wars in the Middle
 

13641
04:01:12,660 --> 04:01:14,809
tweets than all the wars in the Middle
East right because it's a school of fish

13642

04:01:18,050 --> 04:01:18,060
yeah right so if the establishment is
 

13645
04:01:18,060 --> 04:01:19,849
yeah right so if the establishment is
wrong if the bureaucracy is wrong

13646
04:01:19,849 --> 04:01:19,859
wrong if the bureaucracy is wrong
 

13647
04:01:19,859 --> 04:01:21,469
wrong if the bureaucracy is wrong
they're all wrong at the same time who

13648
04:01:21,469 --> 04:01:21,479
they're all wrong at the same time who
 

13649
04:01:21,479 --> 04:01:24,769
they're all wrong at the same time who
could have known whereas if you deviate

13650
04:01:24,769 --> 04:01:24,779
could have known whereas if you deviate
 

13651
04:01:24,779 --> 04:01:26,929
could have known whereas if you deviate
then you are a deviation who can be

13652
04:01:26,929 --> 04:01:26,939
then you are a deviation who can be
 

13653
04:01:26,939 --> 04:01:29,389
then you are a deviation who can be
hammered down okay now the school of

13654
04:01:29,389 --> 04:01:29,399
hammered down okay now the school of
 

13655
04:01:29,399 --> 04:01:31,969
hammered down okay now the school of
fish strategy is unfortunately very

13656
04:01:31,969 --> 04:01:31,979
fish strategy is unfortunately very
 

13657
04:01:31,979 --> 04:01:34,729
fish strategy is unfortunately very
successful because uh you know truth is

13658
04:01:34,729 --> 04:01:34,739
successful because uh you know truth is
 

13659
04:01:34,739 --> 04:01:36,469
successful because uh you know truth is
whatever if you just always ride with

04:01:36,469 --> 04:01:36,479
whatever if you just always ride with
 

13661
04:01:36,479 --> 04:01:37,670
whatever if you just always ride with
the school of fish and turn when they

13662
04:01:37,670 --> 04:01:37,680
the school of fish and turn when they
 

13663
04:01:37,680 --> 04:01:40,130
the school of fish and turn when they
turn and so on unless there's a bigger

13665
04:01:40,140 --> 04:01:42,229

basically can never be proven wrong all

13668
04:01:43,790 --> 04:01:43,800
basically can never be proven wrong all
 

13669
04:01:43,800 --> 04:01:45,710
basically can never be proven wrong all

essentially the guys coming in with a
 

13703
04:02:15,779 --> 04:02:17,570
essentially the guys coming in with a
head of steam as this evil regulator

so
 

14209
04:10:50,640 --> 04:10:53,750
so
what has changed what's changed is in

two different kinds of failure modes you
 

14345
04:13:15,540 --> 04:13:17,630
two different kinds of failure modes you
could have in the marketplace right why

essentially one entry cost
and then they don't have to evaluate

14356
04:13:26,210 --> 04:13:26,220
and then they don't have to evaluate
 

14357
04:13:26,220 --> 04:13:27,410
and then they don't have to evaluate
everything separately where they may not

everything separately where they may not

04:13:28,800 --> 04:13:30,530
have the technical information to do
that yes right you don't want to go to

14362
04:13:30,530 --> 04:13:30,540
that yes right you don't want to go to

enter a Zone where you know things are
 

14373
04:13:39,000 --> 04:13:41,630
enter a Zone where you know things are
basically good and you pay that one

14374
04:13:41,630 --> 04:13:41,640
basically good and you pay that one
 

14375
04:13:41,640 --> 04:13:43,490
basically good and you pay that one
diligence cost on the Zone itself right

and then the regulator's taking care of

14380
04:13:46,550 --> 04:13:46,560
and then the regulator's taking care of
 

14381
04:13:46,560 --> 04:13:48,889
and then the regulator's taking care of
it and they've baked in the regulatory

14382
04:13:48,889 --> 04:13:48,899
it and they've baked in the regulatory
 

14383
04:13:48,899 --> 04:13:51,410
it and they've baked in the regulatory
cost into you know some subscription fee

14384
04:13:51,410 --> 04:13:51,420
cost into you know some subscription fee

and The crucial thing is it scales
 

14437
04:14:45,479 --> 04:14:47,630
and The crucial thing is it scales
across borders so you can use the data

Larry smart Okay what he was doing is he

14812
04:21:02,269 --> 04:21:02,279
Larry smart Okay what he was doing is he
 

14813
04:21:02,279 --> 04:21:03,530
Larry smart Okay what he was doing is he
was essentially doing a bunch of

14814
04:21:03,530 --> 04:21:03,540
was essentially doing a bunch of
 

14815
04:21:03,540 --> 04:21:05,450
was essentially doing a bunch of
measurements on himself

14816
04:21:05,450 --> 04:21:05,460
measurements on himself
 

14817
04:21:05,460 --> 04:21:08,929
measurements on himself
and he was finding that uh there were

14818
04:21:08,929 --> 04:21:08,939
and he was finding that uh there were
 

14819
04:21:08,939 --> 04:21:10,370
and he was finding that uh there were
predictors of inflammation that were

14820
04:21:10,370 --> 04:21:10,380
predictors of inflammation that were
 

14821
04:21:10,380 --> 04:21:11,809
predictors of inflammation that were
spiking and he went to the doctor showed

14822
04:21:11,809 --> 04:21:11,819
spiking and he went to the doctor showed
 

14823
04:21:11,819 --> 04:21:13,670
spiking and he went to the doctor showed
the charts and the doctor was like I

14824
04:21:13,670 --> 04:21:13,680
the charts and the doctor was like I
 

14825
04:21:13,680 --> 04:21:16,429
the charts and the doctor was like I
can't do anything with this then that

14826
04:21:16,429 --> 04:21:16,439
can't do anything with this then that
 

14827
04:21:16,439 --> 04:21:18,349
can't do anything with this then that
turned out to be an early warning of

14828
04:21:18,349 --> 04:21:18,359
turned out to be an early warning of
 

14829
04:21:18,359 --> 04:21:20,389
turned out to be an early warning of
like a serious condition and he had to I

14830
04:21:20,389 --> 04:21:20,399
like a serious condition and he had to I
 

14831
04:21:20,399 --> 04:21:22,309
like a serious condition and he had to I
think go for like you know surgery or or

14832
04:21:22,309 --> 04:21:22,319
think go for like you know surgery or or
 

14833
04:21:22,319 --> 04:21:24,050
think go for like you know surgery or or
something and he was starting to think

14834
04:21:24,050 --> 04:21:24,060
something and he was starting to think
 

14835
04:21:24,060 --> 04:21:25,849
something and he was starting to think
well look the way that we're doing

14836
04:21:25,849 --> 04:21:25,859
well look the way that we're doing
 

14837
04:21:25,859 --> 04:21:29,269
well look the way that we're doing
medicine right now is it's not quite

14838
04:21:29,269 --> 04:21:29,279
medicine right now is it's not quite
 

14839
04:21:29,279 --> 04:21:31,849
medicine right now is it's not quite
um like pre-germ theory of disease

14840
04:21:31,849 --> 04:21:31,859
um like pre-germ theory of disease
 

14841
04:21:31,859 --> 04:21:33,849
um like pre-germ theory of disease
but it is

14842
04:21:33,849 --> 04:21:33,859
but it is
 

14843
04:21:33,859 --> 04:21:36,590
but it is
pre- continuous Diagnostics

14844
04:21:36,590 --> 04:21:36,600
pre- continuous Diagnostics
 

14845
04:21:36,600 --> 04:21:39,290
pre- continuous Diagnostics
okay continuous Diagnostics just to talk

14846
04:21:39,290 --> 04:21:39,300
okay continuous Diagnostics just to talk
 

14847
04:21:39,300 --> 04:21:40,910
okay continuous Diagnostics just to talk
about this for a second this is I I

14848
04:21:40,910 --> 04:21:40,920
about this for a second this is I I
 

14849
04:21:40,920 --> 04:21:42,650
about this for a second this is I I
mentioned one angle on which you go

14850
04:21:42,650 --> 04:21:42,660
mentioned one angle on which you go
 

14851
04:21:42,660 --> 04:21:44,570
mentioned one angle on which you go
after FDA which is like the the better

14852
04:21:44,570 --> 04:21:44,580
after FDA which is like the the better
 

14853
04:21:44,580 --> 04:21:46,550
after FDA which is like the the better
phase four right I've mentioned the

14854
04:21:46,550 --> 04:21:46,560
phase four right I've mentioned the
 

14855
04:21:46,560 --> 04:21:48,650
phase four right I've mentioned the
concept of better reviews in general

14856
04:21:48,650 --> 04:21:48,660
concept of better reviews in general
 

14857
04:21:48,660 --> 04:21:49,790
concept of better reviews in general
okay

14858
04:21:49,790 --> 04:21:49,800
okay
 

14859
04:21:49,800 --> 04:21:51,889
okay
I mentioned Vita Dao which is like a

14860
04:21:51,889 --> 04:21:51,899
I mentioned Vita Dao which is like a
 

14861
04:21:51,899 --> 04:21:53,689
I mentioned Vita Dao which is like a
community that is going after longevity

14862
04:21:53,689 --> 04:21:53,699
community that is going after longevity
 

14863
04:21:53,699 --> 04:21:55,910
community that is going after longevity
let's talk about continuous Diagnostics

14864
04:21:55,910 --> 04:21:55,920
let's talk about continuous Diagnostics
 

14865
04:21:55,920 --> 04:21:57,110
let's talk about continuous Diagnostics
so

14866
04:21:57,110 --> 04:21:57,120
so
 

14867
04:21:57,120 --> 04:21:58,610
so
basically

14868

14873
04:22:04,199 --> 04:22:05,870
Bangalore or Budapest in our own body
that's actually kind of insane to think

14874
04:22:05,870 --> 04:22:05,880
that's actually kind of insane to think
 

14875
04:22:05,880 --> 04:22:07,550
that's actually kind of insane to think
about the stuff that you know is all the

14876
04:22:07,550 --> 04:22:07,560
about the stuff that you know is all the
 

14877
04:22:07,560 --> 04:22:08,510
about the stuff that you know is all the
other side of the world ten thousand

14878

other side of the world ten thousand
 

14879
04:22:08,520 --> 04:22:09,830
other side of the world ten thousand
miles away but you know a few

14880
04:22:09,830 --> 04:22:09,840
miles away but you know a few
 

14881
04:22:09,840 --> 04:22:10,910
miles away but you know a few
millimeters away you don't really know

14882
04:22:10,910 --> 04:22:10,920
millimeters away you don't really know
 

14883
04:22:10,920 --> 04:22:13,130
millimeters away you don't really know
what's going on right and that's

14884
04:22:13,130 --> 04:22:13,140
what's going on right and that's
 

14885
04:22:13,140 --> 04:22:14,450
what's going on right and that's
starting to change with all the

14886
04:22:14,450 --> 04:22:14,460
starting to change with all the
 

14887
04:22:14,460 --> 04:22:16,010
starting to change with all the
Quantified Self devices the hundreds of

04:22:18,420 --> 04:22:20,030
millions of Apple watches and fitbits
and stuff right you're also starting to

14892
04:22:20,030 --> 04:22:20,040
and stuff right you're also starting to
 

14893
04:22:20,040 --> 04:22:21,590
and stuff right you're also starting to
see continuous glucose meters which is

14894
04:22:21,590 --> 04:22:21,600
see continuous glucose meters which is
 

14895
04:22:21,600 --> 04:22:22,790
see continuous glucose meters which is
very important they're starting to give

14896
04:22:22,790 --> 04:22:22,800
very important they're starting to give

is spiking my insulin or rather this is

14900
04:22:27,229 --> 04:22:27,239
is spiking my insulin or rather this is
 

14901
04:22:27,239 --> 04:22:29,990
is spiking my insulin or rather this is
like my my blood sugar and uh it might

he could at himself over the period of I
 

14925
04:22:49,199 --> 04:22:50,450
he could at himself over the period of I
think a few weeks or a few months I've

14926
04:22:50,450 --> 04:22:50,460
think a few weeks or a few months I've
 

14927
04:22:50,460 --> 04:22:52,550
think a few weeks or a few months I've
got the exact duration he's able to do

14928
04:22:52,550 --> 04:22:52,560
got the exact duration he's able to do
 

14929
04:22:52,560 --> 04:22:53,990
got the exact duration he's able to do
things where you could see during that

14930
04:22:53,990 --> 04:22:54,000
things where you could see during that
 

14931
04:22:54,000 --> 04:22:55,490
things where you could see during that
period he like got a cold or something

14932
04:22:55,490 --> 04:22:55,500
period he like got a cold or something
 

14933
04:22:55,500 --> 04:22:58,309
period he like got a cold or something
and he could see in the expression day

14934
04:22:58,309 --> 04:22:58,319
and he could see in the expression day
 

14935
04:22:58,319 --> 04:22:59,809
and he could see in the expression day
the gene expression data that he was

14936
04:22:59,809 --> 04:22:59,819
the gene expression data that he was
 

14937
04:22:59,819 --> 04:23:02,269
the gene expression data that he was
getting sick before he felt sick he

14938
04:23:02,269 --> 04:23:02,279
getting sick before he felt sick he
 

14939
04:23:02,279 --> 04:23:03,769
getting sick before he felt sick he
could also see that something about that

14940
04:23:03,769 --> 04:23:03,779
could also see that something about that
 

14941
04:23:03,779 --> 04:23:06,050
could also see that something about that
like viral infection like uh

14942
04:23:06,050 --> 04:23:06,060
like viral infection like uh
 

14943
04:23:06,060 --> 04:23:07,849
like viral infection like uh
made him develop diabetes-like symptoms

14944
04:23:07,849 --> 04:23:07,859
made him develop diabetes-like symptoms
 

14945
04:23:07,859 --> 04:23:10,370
made him develop diabetes-like symptoms
if I'm remembering it accurately so you

14946
04:23:10,370 --> 04:23:10,380
if I'm remembering it accurately so you
 

14947
04:23:10,380 --> 04:23:11,689
if I'm remembering it accurately so you
could see oh wait a second these are

14948
04:23:11,689 --> 04:23:11,699
could see oh wait a second these are
 

14949
04:23:11,699 --> 04:23:13,490
could see oh wait a second these are
things that are

14950
04:23:13,490 --> 04:23:13,500
things that are
 

14951
04:23:13,500 --> 04:23:16,250
things that are
um that I can see in my readouts that I

14952
04:23:16,250 --> 04:23:16,260
um that I can see in my readouts that I
 

14953
04:23:16,260 --> 04:23:18,010
um that I can see in my readouts that I
would only have the vaguest

14954
04:23:18,010 --> 04:23:18,020
would only have the vaguest
 

14955
04:23:18,020 --> 04:23:20,929
would only have the vaguest
interpretation of as like a human being

14956
04:23:20,929 --> 04:23:20,939
interpretation of as like a human being
 

14957
04:23:20,939 --> 04:23:22,550
interpretation of as like a human being
right

14958
04:23:22,550 --> 04:23:22,560
right
 

14959
04:23:22,560 --> 04:23:25,550
right
and moreover he could take uh you know I

14960
04:23:25,550 --> 04:23:25,560
and moreover he could take uh you know I
 

14961
04:23:25,560 --> 04:23:27,349
and moreover he could take uh you know I
don't think he did this but if you took

14962
04:23:27,349 --> 04:23:27,359
don't think he did this but if you took
 

14963
04:23:27,359 --> 04:23:29,990
don't think he did this but if you took
treatments if you took drugs right

14964
04:23:29,990 --> 04:23:30,000
treatments if you took drugs right
 

14965
04:23:30,000 --> 04:23:33,710
treatments if you took drugs right
you could actually show what your steady

14966
04:23:33,710 --> 04:23:33,720
you could actually show what your steady
 

14967
04:23:33,720 --> 04:23:35,570
you could actually show what your steady
state was if you tracked over time show

14968
04:23:35,570 --> 04:23:35,580
state was if you tracked over time show
 

14969
04:23:35,580 --> 04:23:38,269
state was if you tracked over time show
what your disease state or six state was

14970
04:23:38,269 --> 04:23:38,279
what your disease state or six state was
 

14971
04:23:38,279 --> 04:23:41,469
what your disease state or six state was
and then this drug pushes you back into

14972
04:23:41,469 --> 04:23:41,479
and then this drug pushes you back into
 

14973
04:23:41,479 --> 04:23:43,910
and then this drug pushes you back into
non-disease State you can actually get a

14974
04:23:43,910 --> 04:23:43,920
non-disease State you can actually get a
 

14975
04:23:43,920 --> 04:23:46,010
non-disease State you can actually get a
quantitative readout of what you know

14976
04:23:46,010 --> 04:23:46,020
quantitative readout of what you know
 

14977
04:23:46,020 --> 04:23:48,889
quantitative readout of what you know
like steady state was right so that and

14978
04:23:48,889 --> 04:23:48,899
like steady state was right so that and
 

14979
04:23:48,899 --> 04:23:50,630
like steady state was right so that and
and that stay safe you know your

14980
04:23:50,630 --> 04:23:50,640
and that stay safe you know your
 

14981
04:23:50,640 --> 04:23:52,250
and that stay safe you know your
expression levels across all these genes

14982
04:23:52,250 --> 04:23:52,260
expression levels across all these genes
 

14983
04:23:52,260 --> 04:23:54,290
expression levels across all these genes
uh your small molecules basically

14984
04:23:54,290 --> 04:23:54,300
uh your small molecules basically
 

14985
04:23:54,300 --> 04:23:55,790
uh your small molecules basically
everything you can you could you can

14986
04:23:55,790 --> 04:23:55,800
everything you can you could you can
 

14987
04:23:55,800 --> 04:23:56,809
everything you can you could you can
measure

14988
04:23:56,809 --> 04:23:56,819
measure
 

14989
04:23:56,819 --> 04:23:58,189
measure
that's going to vary from person to

14990
04:23:58,189 --> 04:23:58,199
that's going to vary from person to
 

14991
04:23:58,199 --> 04:24:00,229
that's going to vary from person to
person right what's healthy and natural

14992
04:24:00,229 --> 04:24:00,239
person right what's healthy and natural
 

14993
04:24:00,239 --> 04:24:02,450
person right what's healthy and natural
for you may be a different Baseline than

14994
04:24:02,450 --> 04:24:02,460
for you may be a different Baseline than
 

14995
04:24:02,460 --> 04:24:04,490
for you may be a different Baseline than
for me for example people who are small

14996
04:24:04,490 --> 04:24:04,500
for me for example people who are small
 

14997
04:24:04,500 --> 04:24:06,469
for me for example people who are small
example people who are South Asian

14998
04:24:06,469 --> 04:24:06,479
example people who are South Asian
 

14999
04:24:06,479 --> 04:24:07,729
example people who are South Asian
um or have dark skin tend to have

15000
04:24:07,729 --> 04:24:07,739
um or have dark skin tend to have
 

15001
04:24:07,739 --> 04:24:10,010
um or have dark skin tend to have
vitamin D deficiency why because we need

15002
04:24:10,010 --> 04:24:10,020
vitamin D deficiency why because we need
 

15003
04:24:10,020 --> 04:24:12,830
vitamin D deficiency why because we need
a lot of sunlight so often inside you're

15004
04:24:12,830 --> 04:24:12,840
a lot of sunlight so often inside you're
 

15005
04:24:12,840 --> 04:24:15,050
a lot of sunlight so often inside you're
tapping on your screen so what do we do

15006
04:24:15,050 --> 04:24:15,060
tapping on your screen so what do we do
 

15007
04:24:15,060 --> 04:24:16,849
tapping on your screen so what do we do
take like actually significant vitamin D

15008
04:24:16,849 --> 04:24:16,859
take like actually significant vitamin D
 

15009
04:24:16,859 --> 04:24:18,410
take like actually significant vitamin D
infusions okay

15010
04:24:18,410 --> 04:24:18,420
infusions okay
 

15011
04:24:18,420 --> 04:24:19,790
infusions okay
that's like a small example of where

15012
04:24:19,790 --> 04:24:19,800
that's like a small example of where
 

15013
04:24:19,800 --> 04:24:22,750
that's like a small example of where
baselines differ between people okay so

15014
04:24:22,750 --> 04:24:22,760
baselines differ between people okay so
 

15015
04:24:22,760 --> 04:24:25,250
baselines differ between people okay so
continuous Diagnostics what could that

15016
04:24:25,250 --> 04:24:25,260
continuous Diagnostics what could that
 

15017
04:24:25,260 --> 04:24:26,630
continuous Diagnostics what could that
mean that could mean you know things

15018
04:24:26,630 --> 04:24:26,640
mean that could mean you know things
 

15019
04:24:26,640 --> 04:24:28,250
mean that could mean you know things
like the continuous glucose meter it's

15020
04:24:28,250 --> 04:24:28,260
like the continuous glucose meter it's
 

15021
04:24:28,260 --> 04:24:30,410
like the continuous glucose meter it's
Quantified Self it's like continuous

15022
04:24:30,410 --> 04:24:30,420
Quantified Self it's like continuous
 

15023
04:24:30,420 --> 04:24:32,389
Quantified Self it's like continuous
blood testing right so you have a

15024
04:24:32,389 --> 04:24:32,399
blood testing right so you have a
 

15025
04:24:32,399 --> 04:24:34,250
blood testing right so you have a
so-called mobile phlebotomist this is

15026
04:24:34,250 --> 04:24:34,260
so-called mobile phlebotomist this is
 

15027
04:24:34,260 --> 04:24:36,110
so-called mobile phlebotomist this is
something which uh phlebotomist takes

15028
04:24:36,110 --> 04:24:36,120
something which uh phlebotomist takes
 

15029
04:24:36,120 --> 04:24:37,729
something which uh phlebotomist takes
blood right mobile phlebotomy would come

15030
04:24:37,729 --> 04:24:37,739
blood right mobile phlebotomy would come
 

15031
04:24:37,739 --> 04:24:39,229
blood right mobile phlebotomy would come
to your office come to your remote

15032
04:24:39,229 --> 04:24:39,239
to your office come to your remote
 

15033
04:24:39,239 --> 04:24:40,910
to your office come to your remote
office this is a great business for

15034
04:24:40,910 --> 04:24:40,920
office this is a great business for
 

15035
04:24:40,920 --> 04:24:42,650
office this is a great business for
people I think you know you can revisit

15036
04:24:42,650 --> 04:24:42,660
people I think you know you can revisit
 

15037
04:24:42,660 --> 04:24:45,229
people I think you know you can revisit
this in in 2022 if people tried this in

15038
04:24:45,229 --> 04:24:45,239
this in in 2022 if people tried this in
 

15039
04:24:45,239 --> 04:24:46,309
this in in 2022 if people tried this in
the 2010s but I think it's worth

15040
04:24:46,309 --> 04:24:46,319
the 2010s but I think it's worth
 

15041
04:24:46,319 --> 04:24:49,070
the 2010s but I think it's worth
revisiting mole phlebotomist comes every

15042
04:24:49,070 --> 04:24:49,080
revisiting mole phlebotomist comes every
 

15043
04:24:49,080 --> 04:24:51,410
revisiting mole phlebotomist comes every
week or every month takes blood runs

15044
04:24:51,410 --> 04:24:51,420
week or every month takes blood runs
 

15045
04:24:51,420 --> 04:24:53,990
week or every month takes blood runs
every test right maybe that's you know a

15046
04:24:53,990 --> 04:24:54,000
every test right maybe that's you know a
 

15047
04:24:54,000 --> 04:24:55,309
every test right maybe that's you know a
few thousand dollars a year maybe

15048
04:24:55,309 --> 04:24:55,319
few thousand dollars a year maybe
 

15049
04:24:55,319 --> 04:24:56,809
few thousand dollars a year maybe
eventually gets to a few hundred dollars

15050
04:24:56,809 --> 04:24:56,819
eventually gets to a few hundred dollars
 

15051
04:24:56,819 --> 04:24:58,070
eventually gets to a few hundred dollars
a year

15052
04:24:58,070 --> 04:24:58,080
a year
 

15053
04:24:58,080 --> 04:24:59,990
a year
um and that's expensive in some ways but

15054
04:24:59,990 --> 04:25:00,000
um and that's expensive in some ways but
 

15055
04:25:00,000 --> 04:25:01,429
um and that's expensive in some ways but
boy that's better health insurance in

15056
04:25:01,429 --> 04:25:01,439
boy that's better health insurance in
 

15057
04:25:01,439 --> 04:25:03,349
boy that's better health insurance in
other ways yeah I mean it's amazing so

15058
04:25:03,349 --> 04:25:03,359
other ways yeah I mean it's amazing so
 

15059
04:25:03,359 --> 04:25:04,849
other ways yeah I mean it's amazing so
one there's a bunch of companies that do

15060
04:25:04,849 --> 04:25:04,859
one there's a bunch of companies that do
 

15061
04:25:04,859 --> 04:25:06,050
one there's a bunch of companies that do
this and actually would love to learn

15062
04:25:06,050 --> 04:25:06,060
this and actually would love to learn
 

15063
04:25:06,060 --> 04:25:08,210
this and actually would love to learn
more about them what what one of them

15064
04:25:08,210 --> 04:25:08,220
more about them what what one of them
 

15065
04:25:08,220 --> 04:25:09,830
more about them what what one of them
it's a company called inside tracker

15066
04:25:09,830 --> 04:25:09,840
it's a company called inside tracker
 

15067
04:25:09,840 --> 04:25:11,570
it's a company called inside tracker
that sponsors this podcast they do that

15068
04:25:11,570 --> 04:25:11,580
that sponsors this podcast they do that
 

15069
04:25:11,580 --> 04:25:13,250
that sponsors this podcast they do that
but the reason I really appreciate them

15070
04:25:13,250 --> 04:25:13,260
but the reason I really appreciate them
 

15071
04:25:13,260 --> 04:25:14,750
but the reason I really appreciate them
they're the first ones that introduced

15072
04:25:14,750 --> 04:25:14,760
they're the first ones that introduced
 

15073
04:25:14,760 --> 04:25:17,929
they're the first ones that introduced
me to like how easy it is but it's also

15074
04:25:17,929 --> 04:25:17,939
me to like how easy it is but it's also
 

15075
04:25:17,939 --> 04:25:19,910
me to like how easy it is but it's also
depressing how little information

15076
04:25:19,910 --> 04:25:19,920
depressing how little information
 

15077
04:25:19,920 --> 04:25:22,070
depressing how little information
exactly as you beautifully put once

15078
04:25:22,070 --> 04:25:22,080
exactly as you beautifully put once
 

15079
04:25:22,080 --> 04:25:23,750
exactly as you beautifully put once
again how little information we have

15080
04:25:23,750 --> 04:25:23,760
again how little information we have
 

15081
04:25:23,760 --> 04:25:25,250
again how little information we have
about our own body

15082
04:25:25,250 --> 04:25:25,260
about our own body
 

15083
04:25:25,260 --> 04:25:28,150
about our own body
in a continuous sense yes and actually

15084
04:25:28,150 --> 04:25:28,160
in a continuous sense yes and actually
 

15085
04:25:28,160 --> 04:25:31,969
in a continuous sense yes and actually
also sadly even with inside tracker as I

15086
04:25:31,969 --> 04:25:31,979
also sadly even with inside tracker as I
 

15087
04:25:31,979 --> 04:25:35,389
also sadly even with inside tracker as I
collect that data how not integrated

15088
04:25:35,389 --> 04:25:35,399
collect that data how not integrated
 

15089
04:25:35,399 --> 04:25:37,910
collect that data how not integrated
that data is with everything else right

15090
04:25:37,910 --> 04:25:37,920
that data is with everything else right
 

15091
04:25:37,920 --> 04:25:41,630
that data is with everything else right
if I wanted to opt in I would like

15092
04:25:41,630 --> 04:25:41,640
if I wanted to opt in I would like
 

15093
04:25:41,640 --> 04:25:44,030
if I wanted to opt in I would like
I I get just like Roofing off the top of

15094
04:25:44,030 --> 04:25:44,040
I I get just like Roofing off the top of
 

15095
04:25:44,040 --> 04:25:46,309
I I get just like Roofing off the top of
my head but I would like Google Maps to

15096
04:25:46,309 --> 04:25:46,319
my head but I would like Google Maps to
 

15097
04:25:46,319 --> 04:25:48,410
my head but I would like Google Maps to
know what's going on inside my body

15098
04:25:48,410 --> 04:25:48,420
know what's going on inside my body
 

15099
04:25:48,420 --> 04:25:51,590
know what's going on inside my body
maybe I can't Intuit at first why that

15100
04:25:51,590 --> 04:25:51,600
maybe I can't Intuit at first why that
 

15101
04:25:51,600 --> 04:25:53,149
maybe I can't Intuit at first why that
application is useful but there could be

15102
04:25:53,149 --> 04:25:53,159
application is useful but there could be
 

15103
04:25:53,159 --> 04:25:55,010
application is useful but there could be
an incredible like that's where the

15104
04:25:55,010 --> 04:25:55,020
an incredible like that's where the
 

15105
04:25:55,020 --> 04:25:57,769
an incredible like that's where the
entrepreneurial Spirit builds is like

15106
04:25:57,769 --> 04:25:57,779
entrepreneurial Spirit builds is like
 

15107
04:25:57,779 --> 04:25:59,450
entrepreneurial Spirit builds is like
what can I do with that data can I make

15108
04:25:59,450 --> 04:25:59,460
what can I do with that data can I make
 

15109
04:25:59,460 --> 04:26:01,729
what can I do with that data can I make
the trip more less stressful for you and

15110
04:26:01,729 --> 04:26:01,739
the trip more less stressful for you and
 

15111
04:26:01,739 --> 04:26:03,290
the trip more less stressful for you and
adjust the Google Maps thing kind of

15112
04:26:03,290 --> 04:26:03,300
adjust the Google Maps thing kind of
 

15113
04:26:03,300 --> 04:26:05,510
adjust the Google Maps thing kind of
thing that's right yeah so I mean one of

15114
04:26:05,510 --> 04:26:05,520
thing that's right yeah so I mean one of
 

15115
04:26:05,520 --> 04:26:06,530
thing that's right yeah so I mean one of
the things about this by the way is

15116
04:26:06,530 --> 04:26:06,540
the things about this by the way is
 

15117
04:26:06,540 --> 04:26:08,570
the things about this by the way is
because there are so many movies made

15118
04:26:08,570 --> 04:26:08,580
because there are so many movies made
 

15119
04:26:08,580 --> 04:26:11,570
because there are so many movies made
about darnos okay that's one of the

15120
04:26:11,570 --> 04:26:11,580
about darnos okay that's one of the
 

15121
04:26:11,580 --> 04:26:13,189
about darnos okay that's one of the
reasons why people have sort of been

15122
04:26:13,189 --> 04:26:13,199
reasons why people have sort of been
 

15123
04:26:13,199 --> 04:26:16,610
reasons why people have sort of been
scared off from doing Diagnostics uh to

15124
04:26:16,610 --> 04:26:16,620
scared off from doing Diagnostics uh to
 

15125
04:26:16,620 --> 04:26:18,649
scared off from doing Diagnostics uh to
some extent okay why because visas are

15126
04:26:18,649 --> 04:26:18,659
some extent okay why because visas are
 

15127
04:26:18,659 --> 04:26:19,969
some extent okay why because visas are
like oh this is another theranos and

15128
04:26:19,969 --> 04:26:19,979
like oh this is another theranos and
 

15129
04:26:19,979 --> 04:26:21,710
like oh this is another theranos and
like the diligence and everything

15130
04:26:21,710 --> 04:26:21,720
like the diligence and everything
 

15131
04:26:21,720 --> 04:26:23,330
like the diligence and everything
everyone's looking at it oh blood

15132
04:26:23,330 --> 04:26:23,340
everyone's looking at it oh blood
 

15133
04:26:23,340 --> 04:26:25,670
everyone's looking at it oh blood
testing one drop of blood huh hurts the

15134
04:26:25,670 --> 04:26:25,680
testing one drop of blood huh hurts the
 

15135
04:26:25,680 --> 04:26:27,469
testing one drop of blood huh hurts the
recruiting essentially

15136
04:26:27,469 --> 04:26:27,479
recruiting essentially
 

15137
04:26:27,479 --> 04:26:29,630
recruiting essentially
um a lot of the media and stuff around

15138
04:26:29,630 --> 04:26:29,640
um a lot of the media and stuff around
 

15139
04:26:29,640 --> 04:26:32,030
um a lot of the media and stuff around
that basically it's pathologized the

15140
04:26:32,030 --> 04:26:32,040
that basically it's pathologized the
 

15141
04:26:32,040 --> 04:26:33,410
that basically it's pathologized the
thing that we want to have a lot more

15142
04:26:33,410 --> 04:26:33,420
thing that we want to have a lot more
 

15143
04:26:33,420 --> 04:26:35,750
thing that we want to have a lot more
entrance in right now you know one way

15144
04:26:35,750 --> 04:26:35,760
entrance in right now you know one way
 

15145
04:26:35,760 --> 04:26:37,309
entrance in right now you know one way
of thinking about it is

15146
04:26:37,309 --> 04:26:37,319
of thinking about it is
 

15147
04:26:37,319 --> 04:26:39,710
of thinking about it is
FDA is killed way more people than

15148
04:26:39,710 --> 04:26:39,720
FDA is killed way more people than
 

15149
04:26:39,720 --> 04:26:41,809
FDA is killed way more people than
theranos has all right way more just

15150
04:26:41,809 --> 04:26:41,819
theranos has all right way more just
 

15151
04:26:41,819 --> 04:26:44,450
theranos has all right way more just
take drug lag alone okay whenever you

15152
04:26:44,450 --> 04:26:44,460
take drug lag alone okay whenever you
 

15153
04:26:44,460 --> 04:26:47,870
take drug lag alone okay whenever you
have a drug that works and reduce

15154
04:26:47,870 --> 04:26:47,880
have a drug that works and reduce
 

15155
04:26:47,880 --> 04:26:49,969
have a drug that works and reduce
morbidity and mortality after it was

15156
04:26:49,969 --> 04:26:49,979
morbidity and mortality after it was
 

15157
04:26:49,979 --> 04:26:51,469
morbidity and mortality after it was
actually generally available but was

15158
04:26:51,469 --> 04:26:51,479
actually generally available but was
 

15159
04:26:51,479 --> 04:26:53,750
actually generally available but was
delayed for months or years

15160
04:26:53,750 --> 04:26:53,760
delayed for months or years
 

15161
04:26:53,760 --> 04:26:55,550
delayed for months or years
the integral under that curve is the

15162
04:26:55,550 --> 04:26:55,560
the integral under that curve is the
 

15163
04:26:55,560 --> 04:26:57,050
the integral under that curve is the
excess morbidian mortality attributable

15164
04:26:57,050 --> 04:26:57,060
excess morbidian mortality attributable
 

15165
04:26:57,060 --> 04:26:58,910
excess morbidian mortality attributable
to fda's drug lag

15166
04:26:58,910 --> 04:26:58,920
to fda's drug lag
 

15167
04:26:58,920 --> 04:27:00,649
to fda's drug lag
you could go back and do that study

15168
04:27:00,649 --> 04:27:00,659
you could go back and do that study
 

15169
04:27:00,659 --> 04:27:02,090
you could go back and do that study
across lots and lots of different drugs

15170
04:27:02,090 --> 04:27:02,100
across lots and lots of different drugs
 

15171
04:27:02,100 --> 04:27:03,710
across lots and lots of different drugs
and you probably find quite a lot Alex

15172
04:27:03,710 --> 04:27:03,720
and you probably find quite a lot Alex
 

15173
04:27:03,720 --> 04:27:05,630
and you probably find quite a lot Alex
tabarok and others have written on this

15174
04:27:05,630 --> 04:27:05,640
tabarok and others have written on this
 

15175
04:27:05,640 --> 04:27:06,889

right Daniel Henninger is written on

15176
04:27:06,889 --> 04:27:06,899
right Daniel Henninger is written on
 

15177
04:27:06,899 --> 04:27:09,290
right Daniel Henninger is written on
this okay that's just like one example I

15178
04:27:09,290 --> 04:27:09,300
this okay that's just like one example I
 

15179
04:27:09,300 --> 04:27:10,790
this okay that's just like one example I
mean I gave the pandemic example the

15180
04:27:10,790 --> 04:27:10,800
mean I gave the pandemic example the
 

15181
04:27:10,800 --> 04:27:12,590
mean I gave the pandemic example the
fact that they held up the euas for the

15182
04:27:12,590 --> 04:27:12,600
fact that they held up the euas for the
 

15183
04:27:12,600 --> 04:27:14,870
fact that they held up the euas for the
tests and didn't do challenge trials

15184
04:27:14,870 --> 04:27:14,880
tests and didn't do challenge trials
 

15185
04:27:14,880 --> 04:27:17,090
tests and didn't do challenge trials
that's like you know they're not that's

15186
04:27:17,090 --> 04:27:17,100
that's like you know they're not that's
 

15187
04:27:17,100 --> 04:27:18,649
that's like you know they're not that's
like a million American Dead that could

15188
04:27:18,649 --> 04:27:18,659
like a million American Dead that could
 

15189
04:27:18,659 --> 04:27:20,210
like a million American Dead that could
be in order to magnitude less if we had

15190
04:27:20,210 --> 04:27:20,220
be in order to magnitude less if we had
 

15191
04:27:20,220 --> 04:27:21,830
be in order to magnitude less if we had
gotten the vaccine out to vulnerable

15192
04:27:21,830 --> 04:27:21,840
gotten the vaccine out to vulnerable
 

15193
04:27:21,840 --> 04:27:24,349
gotten the vaccine out to vulnerable
population sooner okay so you're talking

15194
04:27:24,349 --> 04:27:24,359
population sooner okay so you're talking
 

15195
04:27:24,359 --> 04:27:25,429
population sooner okay so you're talking
about something that has a total

15196
04:27:25,429 --> 04:27:25,439
about something that has a total
 

15197
04:27:25,439 --> 04:27:28,849
about something that has a total
Monopoly on global health and

15198
04:27:28,849 --> 04:27:28,859
Monopoly on global health and
 

15199
04:27:28,859 --> 04:27:31,849
Monopoly on global health and
um you know you can't know what it is

15200
04:27:31,849 --> 04:27:31,859
um you know you can't know what it is
 

15201
04:27:31,859 --> 04:27:33,889
um you know you can't know what it is
without that unless you have zones that

15202
04:27:33,889 --> 04:27:33,899
without that unless you have zones that
 

15203
04:27:33,899 --> 04:27:36,769
without that unless you have zones that
are FDA free but that have some form of

15204
04:27:36,769 --> 04:27:36,779
are FDA free but that have some form of
 

15205
04:27:36,779 --> 04:27:39,170
are FDA free but that have some form of
Regulation as I mentioned it's a V3 it's

15206
04:27:39,170 --> 04:27:39,180
Regulation as I mentioned it's a V3 it's

that has to come from the outside the
 

15241
04:28:11,939 --> 04:28:13,790
that has to come from the outside the
short answer is no and the longer answer

15242
04:28:13,790 --> 04:28:13,800
short answer is no and the longer answer
 

15243
04:28:13,800 --> 04:28:16,429
short answer is no and the longer answer
meaning they'll that'd be funny if you

15244
04:28:16,429 --> 04:28:16,439
meaning they'll that'd be funny if you
 

15245
04:28:16,439 --> 04:28:17,630
meaning they'll that'd be funny if you
like the short answer is no the long

15246
04:28:17,630 --> 04:28:17,640
like the short answer is no the long
 

15247
04:28:17,640 --> 04:28:19,030
like the short answer is no the long
answer is yes

15248
04:28:19,030 --> 04:28:19,040
answer is yes

hire and fire right so in theory they

15254
04:28:29,149 --> 04:28:29,159
hire and fire right so in theory they
 

15255
04:28:29,159 --> 04:28:31,670
hire and fire right so in theory they
can do surgery on the organism and like

15256
04:28:31,670 --> 04:28:31,680
can do surgery on the organism and like
 

15257

this and that right so that's actually
 

15737
04:36:32,340 --> 04:36:34,131
this and that right so that's actually
the back door and you can do tons of

15738
04:36:34,131 --> 04:36:34,141
the back door and you can do tons of
 

15739
04:36:34,141 --> 04:36:35,869
the back door and you can do tons of
things there where obviously being

15740
04:36:35,869 --> 04:36:35,879
things there where obviously being
 

15741
04:36:35,879 --> 04:36:37,250
things there where obviously being
healthier

15742
04:36:37,250 --> 04:36:37,260
healthier
 

15743
04:36:37,260 --> 04:36:39,230
healthier
is also protective you can actually show

15744
04:36:39,230 --> 04:36:39,240
is also protective you can actually show
 

15745
04:36:39,240 --> 04:36:40,609
is also protective you can actually show
the studies on this so this way you

15746
04:36:40,609 --> 04:36:40,619
the studies on this so this way you
 

15747
04:36:40,619 --> 04:36:42,650
the studies on this so this way you
build out all the tooling to get

15748
04:36:42,650 --> 04:36:42,660
build out all the tooling to get
 

15749
04:36:42,660 --> 04:36:44,810
build out all the tooling to get
healthier and that actually helps on

15750
04:36:44,810 --> 04:36:44,820
healthier and that actually helps on
 

15751
04:36:44,820 --> 04:36:45,830
healthier and that actually helps on
this axis

15752
04:36:45,830 --> 04:36:45,840
this axis
 

15753
04:36:45,840 --> 04:36:47,330

15759
04:36:51,180 --> 04:36:54,230
topic I love this okay so this is uh
this is the most eloquent exploration of

15760
04:36:54,230 --> 04:36:54,240
this is the most eloquent exploration of
 

15761
04:36:54,240 --> 04:36:56,570

just measures tons and tons of variables
 

16009
04:41:09,120 --> 04:41:11,330
just measures tons and tons of variables
on you right there's ways of measuring

16010
04:41:11,330 --> 04:41:11,340
on you right there's ways of measuring
 

16011
04:41:11,340 --> 04:41:13,910
on you right there's ways of measuring
some of these metabolites and you know

16012
04:41:13,910 --> 04:41:13,920
some of these metabolites and you know
 

16013
04:41:13,920 --> 04:41:15,770

ways of doing that so now you've got
 

16023
04:41:21,480 --> 04:41:22,910
ways of doing that so now you've got
something where you've got the

more and more things to ambulatory and
 

16035
04:41:34,260 --> 04:41:35,990
more and more things to ambulatory and
one of the things about this also is the

16036
04:41:35,990 --> 04:41:36,000
one of the things about this also is the
 

16037
04:41:36,000 --> 04:41:37,430
one of the things about this also is the

I mentioned the app that doesn't exist

16064
04:42:09,050 --> 04:42:09,060
I mentioned the app that doesn't exist
 

16065
04:42:09,060 --> 04:42:10,610
I mentioned the app that doesn't exist
which is like a better version of the

doesn't exist and this is one that FDA
 

16071
04:42:13,920 --> 04:42:15,948
doesn't exist and this is one that FDA
is actively quashed why can't you just

16072
04:42:15,948 --> 04:42:15,958
is actively quashed why can't you just
 

16073
04:42:15,958 --> 04:42:18,410
is actively quashed why can't you just
take an image of a mole or something

16074
04:42:18,410 --> 04:42:18,420
take an image of a mole or something
 

16075
04:42:18,420 --> 04:42:20,330
take an image of a mole or something
like that you know with the incredible

Imaging should be able to be done at

16080
04:42:25,070 --> 04:42:25,080
Imaging should be able to be done at
 

16081
04:42:25,080 --> 04:42:27,830
Imaging should be able to be done at
home and it goes to doctors whether it's

16082
04:42:27,830 --> 04:42:27,840
home and it goes to doctors whether it's
 

16083

mean tele-radiology exists right why can

16086
04:42:33,050 --> 04:42:33,060
mean tele-radiology exists right why can
 

16087
04:42:33,060 --> 04:42:35,628
mean tele-radiology exists right why can
you not do that for Dermatology for

16088
04:42:35,628 --> 04:42:35,638
you not do that for Dermatology for
 

16089
04:42:35,638 --> 04:42:36,590
you not do that for Dermatology for
everything else you should be able to

16090
04:42:36,590 --> 04:42:36,600
everything else you should be able to
 

16091
04:42:36,600 --> 04:42:38,270
everything else you should be able to
literally just hold the thing up and

16092
04:42:38,270 --> 04:42:38,280
literally just hold the thing up and
 

16093
04:42:38,280 --> 04:42:41,030
literally just hold the thing up and
with a combination of both Ai and MDS

16094
04:42:41,030 --> 04:42:41,040
with a combination of both Ai and MDS
 

16095
04:42:41,040 --> 04:42:45,110
with a combination of both Ai and MDS
just diagnose that should exist right

16096
04:42:45,110 --> 04:42:45,120
just diagnose that should exist right
 

16097
04:42:45,120 --> 04:42:46,730
just diagnose that should exist right
um answer is

16098
04:42:46,730 --> 04:42:46,740
um answer is
 

16099
04:42:46,740 --> 04:42:48,470
um answer is
there's a combination of both American

16100
04:42:48,470 --> 04:42:48,480
there's a combination of both American
 

16101
04:42:48,480 --> 04:42:50,930
there's a combination of both American
doctors and the FDA that team up to

16102
04:42:50,930 --> 04:42:50,940
doctors and the FDA that team up to
 

16103
04:42:50,940 --> 04:42:53,330
doctors and the FDA that team up to
prevent this or slow this

16104
04:42:53,330 --> 04:42:53,340
prevent this or slow this
 

16105
04:42:53,340 --> 04:42:55,970
prevent this or slow this
um and you know one argument is oh the

16106
04:42:55,970 --> 04:42:55,980
um and you know one argument is oh the
 

16107
04:42:55,980 --> 04:42:58,368
um and you know one argument is oh the
AI is not better than a human 100 of the

16108
04:42:58,368 --> 04:42:58,378
AI is not better than a human 100 of the
 

16109
04:42:58,378 --> 04:43:00,230
AI is not better than a human 100 of the
time because it's not deployed yet

16110
04:43:00,230 --> 04:43:00,240
time because it's not deployed yet
 

16111
04:43:00,240 --> 04:43:01,610
time because it's not deployed yet
therefore it could make an error

16112
04:43:01,610 --> 04:43:01,620
therefore it could make an error
 

16113
04:43:01,620 --> 04:43:02,750
therefore it could make an error
therefore it's bad even if it's better

16114
04:43:02,750 --> 04:43:02,760
therefore it's bad even if it's better
 

16115
04:43:02,760 --> 04:43:05,030
therefore it's bad even if it's better
than 99 of doctors 90 of the time

16116
04:43:05,030 --> 04:43:05,040
than 99 of doctors 90 of the time
 

16117
04:43:05,040 --> 04:43:07,730
than 99 of doctors 90 of the time
another argument is the software has to

16118
04:43:07,730 --> 04:43:07,740
another argument is the software has to
 

16119
04:43:07,740 --> 04:43:09,830
another argument is the software has to
go through design control okay now

16120
04:43:09,830 --> 04:43:09,840
go through design control okay now
 

16121
04:43:09,840 --> 04:43:12,890
go through design control okay now
basically once you understand how FDA

16122
04:43:12,890 --> 04:43:12,900
basically once you understand how FDA
 

16123
04:43:12,900 --> 04:43:15,190
basically once you understand how FDA
Works basically imagine the most

um of course the issue with this is that
 

16189
04:44:25,860 --> 04:44:29,750
um of course the issue with this is that
you'd be paying a physicist to try to

they wouldn't actually probably be able
 

16195
04:44:35,040 --> 04:44:36,770
they wouldn't actually probably be able
to do it they'd be trying real hard

16196
04:44:36,770 --> 04:44:36,780
to do it they'd be trying real hard
 

16197
04:44:36,780 --> 04:44:38,750
to do it they'd be trying real hard

04:44:41,510 --> 04:44:41,520
invasive results right cheaply attained
 

16201
04:44:41,520 --> 04:44:42,770
invasive results right cheaply attained

04:44:53,690 --> 04:44:53,700
units and this is something where
 

16213
04:44:53,700 --> 04:44:56,390

um AMA uh basically publishes a list of
 

16223
04:45:09,840 --> 04:45:12,590
um AMA uh basically publishes a list of
these so-called um the CPT codes which

04:45:12,590 --> 04:45:12,600
these so-called um the CPT codes which
 

16225
04:45:12,600 --> 04:45:14,690
these so-called um the CPT codes which
is like the coding the biomedical coding

16226
04:45:14,690 --> 04:45:14,700
is like the coding the biomedical coding
 

16227
04:45:14,700 --> 04:45:15,890
is like the coding the biomedical coding
of this

of this
 

16229
04:45:15,900 --> 04:45:18,230
of this
and what each medical process is worth

16235
04:45:23,100 --> 04:45:24,650
I don't remember all the numbers but um
it's like a five digit code and it's

it's like a five digit code and it's
 

16237
04:45:24,660 --> 04:45:26,810
it's like a five digit code and it's
like okay I got a I got a test for

um medical billing is erroneous why the

16244
04:45:35,270 --> 04:45:35,280
um medical billing is erroneous why the
 

16245
04:45:35,280 --> 04:45:37,250
um medical billing is erroneous why the
insurance company will reject it

16246

insurance company will reject it
 

16247
04:45:37,260 --> 04:45:38,330
insurance company will reject it
um because it doesn't pay for that this

16248
04:45:38,330 --> 04:45:38,340
um because it doesn't pay for that this
 

16249
04:45:38,340 --> 04:45:40,368
um because it doesn't pay for that this
is this giant process of trying to

04:45:40,368 --> 04:45:40,378
is this giant process of trying to
 

16251
04:45:40,378 --> 04:45:42,050
is this giant process of trying to

16285
04:46:15,840 --> 04:46:17,390
repo the car so patient has a treatment
now

16286
04:46:17,390 --> 04:46:17,400

company uh
you know that that treatment is perhaps

16292
04:46:22,730 --> 04:46:22,740
you know that that treatment is perhaps
 

16293
04:46:22,740 --> 04:46:24,410
you know that that treatment is perhaps
right look it's a lab test provided by a

16294
04:46:24,410 --> 04:46:24,420
right look it's a lab test provided by a
 

16295
04:46:24,420 --> 04:46:25,788
right look it's a lab test provided by a
company right the company bills the

16296
04:46:25,788 --> 04:46:25,798
company right the company bills the
 

16297
04:46:25,798 --> 04:46:26,690
company right the company bills the
patient

16298
04:46:26,690 --> 04:46:26,700
patient
 

16299
04:46:26,700 --> 04:46:28,910

has to jack up the price on everybody
else right everything boils down to the

16322
04:46:51,050 --> 04:46:51,060
else right everything boils down to the
 

16323
04:46:51,060 --> 04:46:53,510
else right everything boils down to the
fact that you don't have you know a

04:47:03,708 --> 04:47:03,718
bought uh neither party can really even
 

16335
04:47:03,718 --> 04:47:05,510
bought uh neither party can really even
set a free price because there's this

16336
04:47:05,510 --> 04:47:05,520
set a free price because there's this
 

16337
04:47:05,520 --> 04:47:08,448
set a free price because there's this
rvu system that hovers above the buyer

16338
04:47:08,448 --> 04:47:08,458
rvu system that hovers above the buyer
 

16339
04:47:08,458 --> 04:47:09,590
rvu system that hovers above the buyer
feels they've already bought it because

16340
04:47:09,590 --> 04:47:09,600
feels they've already bought it because
 

16341
04:47:09,600 --> 04:47:11,150
feels they've already bought it because
they've bought Insurance the insurance

16342
04:47:11,150 --> 04:47:11,160
they've bought Insurance the insurance
 

16343
04:47:11,160 --> 04:47:12,530
they've bought Insurance the insurance
company doesn't want to pay for it

16344
04:47:12,530 --> 04:47:12,540
company doesn't want to pay for it
 

16345
04:47:12,540 --> 04:47:14,628
company doesn't want to pay for it
everybody is trying to like push the

16346
04:47:14,628 --> 04:47:14,638
everybody is trying to like push the
 

16347
04:47:14,638 --> 04:47:17,448
everybody is trying to like push the
price onto somebody else and you know

16348
04:47:17,448 --> 04:47:17,458
price onto somebody else and you know
 

16349
04:47:17,458 --> 04:47:19,010
price onto somebody else and you know
not actually show the sticker price of

16350
04:47:19,010 --> 04:47:19,020
not actually show the sticker price of
 

16351
04:47:19,020 --> 04:47:21,470
not actually show the sticker price of
anything and hide everything and so on

16352
04:47:21,470 --> 04:47:21,480
anything and hide everything and so on
 

16353
04:47:21,480 --> 04:47:23,150
anything and hide everything and so on
and so forth oh the other thing about it

16354
04:47:23,150 --> 04:47:23,160
and so forth oh the other thing about it
 

16355
04:47:23,160 --> 04:47:24,830
and so forth oh the other thing about it
is obviously lawsuits are over

16356
04:47:24,830 --> 04:47:24,840
is obviously lawsuits are over
 

16357
04:47:24,840 --> 04:47:27,230
is obviously lawsuits are over
everything everybody's mad out about

16358
04:47:27,230 --> 04:47:27,240
everything everybody's mad out about
 

16359
04:47:27,240 --> 04:47:29,510
everything everybody's mad out about
everything it's Health people are dying

16360
04:47:29,510 --> 04:47:29,520
everything it's Health people are dying
 

16361
04:47:29,520 --> 04:47:32,150
everything it's Health people are dying
okay so everything is just optimized for

16362
04:47:32,150 --> 04:47:32,160
okay so everything is just optimized for
 

16363
04:47:32,160 --> 04:47:33,948
okay so everything is just optimized for
Optics as opposed to results right

16364
04:47:33,948 --> 04:47:33,958
Optics as opposed to results right
 

16365
04:47:33,958 --> 04:47:35,810
Optics as opposed to results right
similarly actually many drugs are

16366
04:47:35,810 --> 04:47:35,820
similarly actually many drugs are
 

16367
04:47:35,820 --> 04:47:38,570
similarly actually many drugs are
optimized for minimizing side effects

16368
04:47:38,570 --> 04:47:38,580
optimized for minimizing side effects
 

16369
04:47:38,580 --> 04:47:40,128
optimized for minimizing side effects
and Optics rather than maximizing

16370
04:47:40,128 --> 04:47:40,138
and Optics rather than maximizing
 

16371
04:47:40,138 --> 04:47:41,208
and Optics rather than maximizing
effects which are totally different

16372
04:47:41,208 --> 04:47:41,218
effects which are totally different
 

16373
04:47:41,218 --> 04:47:43,310
effects which are totally different
criteria right you might have for

16374
04:47:43,310 --> 04:47:43,320
criteria right you might have for
 

16375
04:47:43,320 --> 04:47:46,730
criteria right you might have for
example a drug that only cures a

16376
04:47:46,730 --> 04:47:46,740
example a drug that only cures a
 

16377
04:47:46,740 --> 04:47:48,410
example a drug that only cures a
thousand people but doesn't have any

16378
04:47:48,410 --> 04:47:48,420
thousand people but doesn't have any
 

16379
04:47:48,420 --> 04:47:50,810
thousand people but doesn't have any
side effects versus one that cures a

16380
04:47:50,810 --> 04:47:50,820
side effects versus one that cures a
 

16381
04:47:50,820 --> 04:47:53,510
side effects versus one that cures a
million people but that has 10 really

16382
04:47:53,510 --> 04:47:53,520
million people but that has 10 really
 

16383
04:47:53,520 --> 04:47:56,448
million people but that has 10 really
serious side effects a year right and

16384
04:47:56,448 --> 04:47:56,458
serious side effects a year right and
 

16385
04:47:56,458 --> 04:47:57,708
serious side effects a year right and
the second one would probably not happen

16386
04:47:57,708 --> 04:47:57,718
the second one would probably not happen
 

16387
04:47:57,718 --> 04:47:59,150
the second one would probably not happen
because those side effects would be so

16388
04:47:59,150 --> 04:47:59,160
because those side effects would be so
 

16389
04:47:59,160 --> 04:48:00,890
because those side effects would be so
so big okay

16390
04:48:00,890 --> 04:48:00,900
so big okay
 

16391
04:48:00,900 --> 04:48:03,230
so big okay
how do you attack this I name a few

16392
04:48:03,230 --> 04:48:03,240
how do you attack this I name a few
 

16393
04:48:03,240 --> 04:48:04,730
how do you attack this I name a few
examples but I actually think the reform

16394
04:48:04,730 --> 04:48:04,740
examples but I actually think the reform
 

16395
04:48:04,740 --> 04:48:05,810
examples but I actually think the reform
is going to come in part from outside

16396
04:48:05,810 --> 04:48:05,820
is going to come in part from outside
 

16397
04:48:05,820 --> 04:48:08,150
is going to come in part from outside
the system in particular India is coming

16398
04:48:08,150 --> 04:48:08,160
the system in particular India is coming
 

16399
04:48:08,160 --> 04:48:09,590
the system in particular India is coming
online

16400
04:48:09,590 --> 04:48:09,600
online
 

16401
04:48:09,600 --> 04:48:13,250
online
okay why is that important well

16402
04:48:13,250 --> 04:48:13,260
okay why is that important well
 

16403
04:48:13,260 --> 04:48:14,868
okay why is that important well
you may have encountered an Indian

16404
04:48:14,868 --> 04:48:14,878
you may have encountered an Indian
 

16405
04:48:14,878 --> 04:48:16,850
you may have encountered an Indian
doctor or two okay maybe an Indian

16406
04:48:16,850 --> 04:48:16,860
doctor or two okay maybe an Indian
 

16407
04:48:16,860 --> 04:48:19,910
doctor or two okay maybe an Indian
programmer one or two all right and I do

16408
04:48:19,910 --> 04:48:19,920
programmer one or two all right and I do
 

16409
04:48:19,920 --> 04:48:21,708
programmer one or two all right and I do
think telemedicine

16410
04:48:21,708 --> 04:48:21,718
think telemedicine
 

16411
04:48:21,718 --> 04:48:25,128
think telemedicine
could explode right where you could have

16412
04:48:25,128 --> 04:48:25,138
could explode right where you could have
 

16413
04:48:25,138 --> 04:48:28,190
could explode right where you could have
an Indian doctor

16414

16423
04:48:37,138 --> 04:48:39,708
these other Indian doctors behind them
they've got a telemedical app and you

16424

they've got a telemedical app and you
are now doing something where uh these

04:48:42,890 --> 04:48:42,900
are now doing something where uh these
 

16427
04:48:42,900 --> 04:48:44,868
are now doing something where uh these
relatively inexpensive Indian doctors

16428
04:48:44,868 --> 04:48:44,878
relatively inexpensive Indian doctors
 

16429
04:48:44,878 --> 04:48:46,788
relatively inexpensive Indian doctors
who are vetted by the American doctor or

04:51:29,150 --> 04:51:29,160
the United States because of all the
 

16587
04:51:29,160 --> 04:51:30,948
the United States because of all the
over the regulation that's right and I

16588
04:51:30,948 --> 04:51:30,958
over the regulation that's right and I
 

16589
04:51:30,958 --> 04:51:32,868
over the regulation that's right and I
think basically it's something where the

16590
04:51:32,868 --> 04:51:32,878
think basically it's something where the
 

16591
04:51:32,878 --> 04:51:35,270
think basically it's something where the
reason it needs that would fix the fdsr

16592
04:51:35,270 --> 04:51:35,280
reason it needs that would fix the fdsr
 

16593
04:51:35,280 --> 04:51:37,670
reason it needs that would fix the fdsr
to interrupt yes we fixed FDA by exiting

16594
04:51:37,670 --> 04:51:37,680
to interrupt yes we fixed FDA by exiting
 

16595
04:51:37,680 --> 04:51:40,070
to interrupt yes we fixed FDA by exiting
the FDA right and then the FDA would dry

16596
04:51:40,070 --> 04:51:40,080
the FDA right and then the FDA would dry
 

16597
04:51:40,080 --> 04:51:42,530
the FDA right and then the FDA would dry
out and then it would hopefully it might

16598
04:51:42,530 --> 04:51:42,540
out and then it would hopefully it might
 

16599
04:51:42,540 --> 04:51:44,868
out and then it would hopefully it might
reform it might dry out right and this

16600
04:51:44,868 --> 04:51:44,878
reform it might dry out right and this
 

16601
04:51:44,878 --> 04:51:46,430
reform it might dry out right and this
is you know why people are for example

16602
04:51:46,430 --> 04:51:46,440
is you know why people are for example
 

16603

generic industry is really important
 

16615
04:51:56,580 --> 04:51:58,610

because it just doesn't enforce American

16616

so generic drugs are cheaper right and

16620
04:52:02,810 --> 04:52:02,820
so generic drugs are cheaper right and
 

16621
04:52:02,820 --> 04:52:03,948
so generic drugs are cheaper right and
it's quite confident it's been around

16622

it's quite confident it's been around
 

16623
04:52:03,958 --> 04:52:05,810
it's quite confident it's been around
for a while so there's enough proof

16624
04:52:05,810 --> 04:52:05,820
for a while so there's enough proof
 

16625
04:52:05,820 --> 04:52:08,330
for a while so there's enough proof
points there where

um again I'm not seeing a Panacea it's

16628
04:52:10,250 --> 04:52:10,260
um again I'm not seeing a Panacea it's
 

16629

like American and Indian collaboration I
 

16633
04:52:13,320 --> 04:52:14,090
like American and Indian collaboration I
think there's gonna be a lot of other

countries and so on that are involved
 

16637
04:52:15,420 --> 04:52:17,868
countries and so on that are involved
but you can start to see another poll

16638

but you can start to see another poll
 

16639
04:52:17,878 --> 04:52:20,628
but you can start to see another poll
getting set up which is a confident

16640
04:52:20,628 --> 04:52:20,638
getting set up which is a confident
 

16641

04:55:21,230 --> 04:55:21,240
of teasing out of what that means
 

16821
04:55:21,240 --> 04:55:23,628
of teasing out of what that means
just to give you one example the US

16822
04:55:23,628 --> 04:55:23,638
just to give you one example the US
 

16823
04:55:23,638 --> 04:55:24,770
just to give you one example the US
dollar

people have seen those graphs where it's

16826
04:55:26,270 --> 04:55:26,280
people have seen those graphs where it's
 

16827
04:55:26,280 --> 04:55:28,250
people have seen those graphs where it's
like inflating and so it just like loses

16828
04:55:28,250 --> 04:55:28,260
like inflating and so it just like loses
 

16829
04:55:28,260 --> 04:55:29,810
like inflating and so it just like loses
value over time and you've seen that

16830
04:55:29,810 --> 04:55:29,820
value over time and you've seen that
 

16831
04:55:29,820 --> 04:55:30,590
value over time and you've seen that
okay

16832
04:55:30,590 --> 04:55:30,600
okay
 

16833
04:55:30,600 --> 04:55:33,770
okay
whereas uh and and most the time it's

16834
04:55:33,770 --> 04:55:33,780
whereas uh and and most the time it's
 

16835
04:55:33,780 --> 04:55:35,090
whereas uh and and most the time it's
just sort of denied that it's losing any

16836
04:55:35,090 --> 04:55:35,100
just sort of denied that it's losing any
 

16837
04:55:35,100 --> 04:55:37,190
just sort of denied that it's losing any
value the

16838
04:55:37,190 --> 04:55:37,200
value the
 

16839
04:55:37,200 --> 04:55:38,930
value the
um the most highbrow way of Defending it

16840
04:55:38,930 --> 04:55:38,940
um the most highbrow way of Defending it
 

16841
04:55:38,940 --> 04:55:42,890
um the most highbrow way of Defending it
is the US dollar trades off

16842
04:55:42,890 --> 04:55:42,900
is the US dollar trades off
 

16843
04:55:42,900 --> 04:55:46,128
is the US dollar trades off
temporary short-term price stability for

16844
04:55:46,128 --> 04:55:46,138
temporary short-term price stability for
 

16845
04:55:46,138 --> 04:55:48,170
temporary short-term price stability for
long-term depreciation

16846
04:55:48,170 --> 04:55:48,180
long-term depreciation
 

16847
04:55:48,180 --> 04:55:51,650
long-term depreciation
and Bitcoin makes the opposite trade-off

16848
04:55:51,650 --> 04:55:51,660
and Bitcoin makes the opposite trade-off
 

16849
04:55:51,660 --> 04:55:53,990
and Bitcoin makes the opposite trade-off
in theory at least long-term

16850
04:55:53,990 --> 04:55:54,000
in theory at least long-term
 

16851
04:55:54,000 --> 04:55:55,670
in theory at least long-term
appreciation at the expense of

16852
04:55:55,670 --> 04:55:55,680
appreciation at the expense of
 

16853
04:55:55,680 --> 04:55:57,830
appreciation at the expense of
short-term price instability

16854
04:55:57,830 --> 04:55:57,840
short-term price instability
 

16855
04:55:57,840 --> 04:56:00,050
short-term price instability
because like you know there's the whole

16856
04:56:00,050 --> 04:56:00,060
because like you know there's the whole
 

16857
04:56:00,060 --> 04:56:01,368
because like you know there's the whole
plunge Protection Team and so on

16858
04:56:01,368 --> 04:56:01,378
plunge Protection Team and so on
 

16859
04:56:01,378 --> 04:56:03,650
plunge Protection Team and so on
basically there's there's various ways

16860
04:56:03,650 --> 04:56:03,660
basically there's there's various ways
 

16861
04:56:03,660 --> 04:56:06,170
basically there's there's various ways
in which price stability has tried to be

16862
04:56:06,170 --> 04:56:06,180
in which price stability has tried to be
 

16863
04:56:06,180 --> 04:56:08,330
in which price stability has tried to be
maintained in a medium term at the

16864
04:56:08,330 --> 04:56:08,340
maintained in a medium term at the
 

16865
04:56:08,340 --> 04:56:09,590
maintained in a medium term at the
expense of long-term depreciation you

16866
04:56:09,590 --> 04:56:09,600
expense of long-term depreciation you
 

16867
04:56:09,600 --> 04:56:11,750
expense of long-term depreciation you
need like a reserve assets to keep you

16868
04:56:11,750 --> 04:56:11,760
need like a reserve assets to keep you
 

16869
04:56:11,760 --> 04:56:13,010
need like a reserve assets to keep you
know stabilizing the dollar against

16870
04:56:13,010 --> 04:56:13,020
know stabilizing the dollar against
 

16871
04:56:13,020 --> 04:56:14,810
know stabilizing the dollar against
various things so

16872
04:56:14,810 --> 04:56:14,820
various things so
 

16873
04:56:14,820 --> 04:56:16,850
various things so
what does crypto medicine look like

16874
04:56:16,850 --> 04:56:16,860
what does crypto medicine look like
 

16875
04:56:16,860 --> 04:56:18,470
what does crypto medicine look like
relative to Fiat medicine to make the

16876
04:56:18,470 --> 04:56:18,480
relative to Fiat medicine to make the
 

16877
04:56:18,480 --> 04:56:20,330
relative to Fiat medicine to make the
same analogy right the existing medical

16878
04:56:20,330 --> 04:56:20,340
same analogy right the existing medical
 

16879
04:56:20,340 --> 04:56:23,390
same analogy right the existing medical
system it assumes that

16880
04:56:23,390 --> 04:56:23,400
system it assumes that
 

16881
04:56:23,400 --> 04:56:25,550
system it assumes that
um a quick death is is bad and early

16882
04:56:25,550 --> 04:56:25,560
um a quick death is is bad and early
 

16883
04:56:25,560 --> 04:56:27,170
um a quick death is is bad and early
death is bad

16884
04:56:27,170 --> 04:56:27,180
death is bad
 

16885
04:56:27,180 --> 04:56:29,628
death is bad
but also that living forever is either

16886
04:56:29,628 --> 04:56:29,638
but also that living forever is either
 

16887
04:56:29,638 --> 04:56:32,090
but also that living forever is either
unrealistic or impossible or undesirable

16888
04:56:32,090 --> 04:56:32,100
unrealistic or impossible or undesirable
 

16889
04:56:32,100 --> 04:56:34,310
unrealistic or impossible or undesirable
that you should die with dignity or

16890
04:56:34,310 --> 04:56:34,320
that you should die with dignity or
 

16891
04:56:34,320 --> 04:56:36,170
that you should die with dignity or
something like that okay

16892
04:56:36,170 --> 04:56:36,180
something like that okay
 

16893
04:56:36,180 --> 04:56:38,330
something like that okay
so a little death is good that's the

16894
04:56:38,330 --> 04:56:38,340
so a little death is good that's the
 

16895
04:56:38,340 --> 04:56:39,948
so a little death is good that's the
existing medical system

16896
04:56:39,948 --> 04:56:39,958
existing medical system
 

16897
04:56:39,958 --> 04:56:42,708
existing medical system

17052
04:59:38,030 --> 04:59:38,040
like it's it's the kind of thing which
 

17053
04:59:38,040 --> 04:59:39,890
like it's it's the kind of thing which
sounds like okay yeah and when we're on

17054
04:59:39,890 --> 04:59:39,900
sounds like okay yeah and when we're on
 

17055
04:59:39,900 --> 04:59:41,810
sounds like okay yeah and when we're on
the moon we're gonna need shovels you

17056
04:59:41,810 --> 04:59:41,820
the moon we're gonna need shovels you
 

17057
04:59:41,820 --> 04:59:43,970
the moon we're gonna need shovels you
know it's it sounds like

17058
04:59:43,970 --> 04:59:43,980
know it's it sounds like
 

17059
04:59:43,980 --> 04:59:45,650
know it's it sounds like
a

17060
04:59:45,650 --> 04:59:45,660
a
 

17061
04:59:45,660 --> 04:59:48,230
a
piling a fantasy on top of a fantasy in

17062
04:59:48,230 --> 04:59:48,240
piling a fantasy on top of a fantasy in
 

17063
04:59:48,240 --> 04:59:49,490
piling a fantasy on top of a fantasy in
that sense but it's also something where

17064
04:59:49,490 --> 04:59:49,500
that sense but it's also something where
 

17065
04:59:49,500 --> 04:59:50,810
that sense but it's also something where
if you're talking about the vector of

17066
04:59:50,810 --> 04:59:50,820
if you're talking about the vector of
 

17067
04:59:50,820 --> 04:59:53,090
if you're talking about the vector of
our civilization where are we going well

17068
04:59:53,090 --> 04:59:53,100
our civilization where are we going well
 

17069
04:59:53,100 --> 04:59:55,070
our civilization where are we going well
I actually do think it's either an arc

17070
04:59:55,070 --> 04:59:55,080
I actually do think it's either an arc
 

17071
04:59:55,080 --> 04:59:57,190
I actually do think it's either an arc
of primitivism or optimalism

17072
04:59:57,190 --> 04:59:57,200
of primitivism or optimalism
 

17073
04:59:57,200 --> 04:59:59,690
of primitivism or optimalism
transhumanism either we are shutting

17074
04:59:59,690 --> 04:59:59,700
transhumanism either we are shutting
 

17075
04:59:59,700 --> 05:00:02,510
transhumanism either we are shutting
down civilization as degrowth it's you

17076
05:00:02,510 --> 05:00:02,520
down civilization as degrowth it's you
 

17077
05:00:02,520 --> 05:00:05,628
down civilization as degrowth it's you
know Unabomber Etc or it's the stars and

17078
05:00:05,628 --> 05:00:05,638
know Unabomber Etc or it's the stars and
 

17079
05:00:05,638 --> 05:00:07,550
know Unabomber Etc or it's the stars and
escaping the prime number maze it's like

17080
05:00:07,550 --> 05:00:07,560
escaping the prime number maze it's like
 

17081
05:00:07,560 --> 05:00:09,250
escaping the prime number maze it's like
to me

17082
05:00:09,250 --> 05:00:09,260
to me
 

17083
05:00:09,260 --> 05:00:13,010
to me
it's obvious that we're going to if

17084
05:00:13,010 --> 05:00:13,020
it's obvious that we're going to if
 

17085
05:00:13,020 --> 05:00:15,770
it's obvious that we're going to if
we're to survive expand out into space

17086
05:00:15,770 --> 05:00:15,780
we're to survive expand out into space
 

17087
05:00:15,780 --> 05:00:18,788
we're to survive expand out into space
yes and it's obvious

17088
05:00:18,788 --> 05:00:18,798
yes and it's obvious
 

17089
05:00:18,798 --> 05:00:22,010
yes and it's obvious
that once we do we'll look back at

17090
05:00:22,010 --> 05:00:22,020
that once we do we'll look back at
 

17091
05:00:22,020 --> 05:00:24,050
that once we do we'll look back at
anyone which is currently most people

17092
05:00:24,050 --> 05:00:24,060
anyone which is currently most people
 

17093
05:00:24,060 --> 05:00:27,830
anyone which is currently most people
that didn't think of this future didn't

17094
05:00:27,830 --> 05:00:27,840
that didn't think of this future didn't
 

17095
05:00:27,840 --> 05:00:29,750
that didn't think of this future didn't
anticipate as future work towards his

17096
05:00:29,750 --> 05:00:29,760
anticipate as future work towards his
 

17097
05:00:29,760 --> 05:00:32,810
anticipate as future work towards his
future as as luddites like as people who

17098
05:00:32,810 --> 05:00:32,820
future as as luddites like as people who
 

17099
05:00:32,820 --> 05:00:34,670
future as as luddites like as people who
did totally didn't get it it would

17100
05:00:34,670 --> 05:00:34,680
did totally didn't get it it would
 

17101
05:00:34,680 --> 05:00:36,288
did totally didn't get it it would
become obvious if right now it's

17102
05:00:36,288 --> 05:00:36,298
become obvious if right now it's
 

17103
05:00:36,298 --> 05:00:37,970
become obvious if right now it's
impossible and then it will become

17104
05:00:37,970 --> 05:00:37,980
impossible and then it will become
 

17105
05:00:37,980 --> 05:00:40,990
impossible and then it will become
obvious yes it seems like yes longevity

17106
05:00:40,990 --> 05:00:41,000
obvious yes it seems like yes longevity
 

17107
05:00:41,000 --> 05:00:43,368
obvious yes it seems like yes longevity
in some form I mean there could be a lot

17108
05:00:43,368 --> 05:00:43,378
in some form I mean there could be a lot
 

17109
05:00:43,378 --> 05:00:44,990
in some form I mean there could be a lot
of arguments of the different forms

17110
05:00:44,990 --> 05:00:45,000
of arguments of the different forms
 

17111
05:00:45,000 --> 05:00:48,050
of arguments of the different forms
longevity could take but in some form of

17112
05:00:48,050 --> 05:00:48,060
longevity could take but in some form of
 

17113
05:00:48,060 --> 05:00:50,448
longevity could take but in some form of
longevity is almost a prerequisite for

17114
05:00:50,448 --> 05:00:50,458
longevity is almost a prerequisite for
 

17115
05:00:50,458 --> 05:00:52,610
longevity is almost a prerequisite for
the expansion out into the cosmos that's

17116
05:00:52,610 --> 05:00:52,620
the expansion out into the cosmos that's
 

17117
05:00:52,620 --> 05:00:54,410
the expansion out into the cosmos that's
right expansion of longevity there's

17118
05:00:54,410 --> 05:00:54,420
right expansion of longevity there's
 

17119
05:00:54,420 --> 05:00:55,670
right expansion of longevity there's
also like a way to bring it back to

17120
05:00:55,670 --> 05:00:55,680
also like a way to bring it back to
 

17121
05:00:55,680 --> 05:00:57,770
also like a way to bring it back to
Earth to an extent which is how where

17122
05:00:57,770 --> 05:00:57,780
Earth to an extent which is how where
 

17123
05:00:57,780 --> 05:00:59,330
Earth to an extent which is how where
societies used to be judged you may

17124
05:00:59,330 --> 05:00:59,340
societies used to be judged you may
 

17125
05:00:59,340 --> 05:01:00,650
societies used to be judged you may
remember people used to talk about life

17126
05:01:00,650 --> 05:01:00,660
remember people used to talk about life
 

17127
05:01:00,660 --> 05:01:03,530
remember people used to talk about life
expectancy as a as a big thing right

17128
05:01:03,530 --> 05:01:03,540
expectancy as a as a big thing right
 

17129
05:01:03,540 --> 05:01:05,930
expectancy as a as a big thing right
life expectancy is actually a very very

17130
05:01:05,930 --> 05:01:05,940
life expectancy is actually a very very
 

17131
05:01:05,940 --> 05:01:08,330
life expectancy is actually a very very
good metric why it's a ratio scale

17132
05:01:08,330 --> 05:01:08,340
good metric why it's a ratio scale
 

17133
05:01:08,340 --> 05:01:10,250
good metric why it's a ratio scale
variable you know there's like four

17134
05:01:10,250 --> 05:01:10,260
variable you know there's like four
 

17135
05:01:10,260 --> 05:01:11,868
variable you know there's like four
different class of variables statistics

17136
05:01:11,868 --> 05:01:11,878
different class of variables statistics
 

17137
05:01:11,878 --> 05:01:13,128
different class of variables statistics
let's talk about ratio scale is like

17138
05:01:13,128 --> 05:01:13,138
let's talk about ratio scale is like
 

17139
05:01:13,138 --> 05:01:16,788
let's talk about ratio scale is like
years or meters or kilograms okay then

17140
05:01:16,788 --> 05:01:16,798
years or meters or kilograms okay then
 

17141
05:01:16,798 --> 05:01:18,948
years or meters or kilograms okay then
you have interval scale where plus and

17142
05:01:18,948 --> 05:01:18,958
you have interval scale where plus and
 

17143
05:01:18,958 --> 05:01:20,090
you have interval scale where plus and
minus means something but there's no

17144
05:01:20,090 --> 05:01:20,100
minus means something but there's no
 

17145
05:01:20,100 --> 05:01:22,070
minus means something but there's no
absolute zero then you have ordinal

17146
05:01:22,070 --> 05:01:22,080
absolute zero then you have ordinal
 

17147
05:01:22,080 --> 05:01:23,570
absolute zero then you have ordinal
where there's only ranks and plus and

17148
05:01:23,570 --> 05:01:23,580
where there's only ranks and plus and
 

17149
05:01:23,580 --> 05:01:24,590
where there's only ranks and plus and
minister of anything and then you have

17150
05:01:24,590 --> 05:01:24,600
minister of anything and then you have
 

17151
05:01:24,600 --> 05:01:27,470
minister of anything and then you have
categorical like uh the Yankees and the

17152
05:01:27,470 --> 05:01:27,480
categorical like uh the Yankees and the
 

17153
05:01:27,480 --> 05:01:29,690
categorical like uh the Yankees and the
the the Braves are categorical variables

17154
05:01:29,690 --> 05:01:29,700
the the Braves are categorical variables
 

17155
05:01:29,700 --> 05:01:31,128
the the Braves are categorical variables
they're just different but you all you

17156
05:01:31,128 --> 05:01:31,138
they're just different but you all you
 

17157
05:01:31,138 --> 05:01:32,628
they're just different but you all you
have is the comparator operator whether

17158
05:01:32,628 --> 05:01:32,638
have is the comparator operator whether
 

17159
05:01:32,638 --> 05:01:33,770
have is the comparator operator whether
you have a quality you don't have a rank

17160
05:01:33,770 --> 05:01:33,780
you have a quality you don't have a rank
 

17161
05:01:33,780 --> 05:01:37,128
you have a quality you don't have a rank
okay so ratio scale data is the best

17162
05:01:37,128 --> 05:01:37,138
okay so ratio scale data is the best
 

17163
05:01:37,138 --> 05:01:38,510
okay so ratio scale data is the best
because you can compare it across space

17164
05:01:38,510 --> 05:01:38,520
because you can compare it across space
 

17165
05:01:38,520 --> 05:01:41,628
because you can compare it across space
and time if you have a skeleton that is

17166
05:01:41,628 --> 05:01:41,638
and time if you have a skeleton that is
 

17167
05:01:41,638 --> 05:01:45,050
and time if you have a skeleton that is
like you know two meters tall

17168
05:01:45,050 --> 05:01:45,060
like you know two meters tall
 

17169
05:01:45,060 --> 05:01:46,910
like you know two meters tall
that's from 3000 years ago you can

17170
05:01:46,910 --> 05:01:46,920
that's from 3000 years ago you can
 

17171
05:01:46,920 --> 05:01:49,490
that's from 3000 years ago you can
compare the height of people from many

17172
05:01:49,490 --> 05:01:49,500
compare the height of people from many
 

17173
05:01:49,500 --> 05:01:50,868
compare the height of people from many
many years ago different cultures and

17174
05:01:50,868 --> 05:01:50,878
many years ago different cultures and
 

17175
05:01:50,878 --> 05:01:52,970
many years ago different cultures and
times right whereas their currency is

17176
05:01:52,970 --> 05:01:52,980
times right whereas their currency is
 

17177
05:01:52,980 --> 05:01:54,350
times right whereas their currency is
much harder to Value that's not like a

17178
05:01:54,350 --> 05:01:54,360
much harder to Value that's not like a
 

17179
05:01:54,360 --> 05:01:55,610
much harder to Value that's not like a
ratio scale variable other things are

17180
05:01:55,610 --> 05:01:55,620
ratio scale variable other things are
 

17181
05:01:55,620 --> 05:01:57,410
ratio scale variable other things are
harder to Value across space and time

17182
05:01:57,410 --> 05:01:57,420
harder to Value across space and time
 

17183
05:01:57,420 --> 05:02:00,350
harder to Value across space and time
right so life expectancy is good because

17184
05:02:00,350 --> 05:02:00,360
right so life expectancy is good because
 

17185
05:02:00,360 --> 05:02:02,690
right so life expectancy is good because
as a ratio scale variable is a very

17186
05:02:02,690 --> 05:02:02,700
as a ratio scale variable is a very
 

17187
05:02:02,700 --> 05:02:04,730
as a ratio scale variable is a very
clear definition right like when someone

17188
05:02:04,730 --> 05:02:04,740
clear definition right like when someone
 

17189
05:02:04,740 --> 05:02:06,050
clear definition right like when someone
born and died you know those are

17190
05:02:06,050 --> 05:02:06,060
born and died you know those are
 

17191
05:02:06,060 --> 05:02:08,270
born and died you know those are
actually relatively clear

17192
05:02:08,270 --> 05:02:08,280
actually relatively clear
 

17193
05:02:08,280 --> 05:02:08,990
actually relatively clear
um

17194
05:02:08,990 --> 05:02:09,000
um
 

17195
05:02:09,000 --> 05:02:10,788
um
by the most other things aren't like

17196
05:02:10,788 --> 05:02:10,798
by the most other things aren't like
 

17197
05:02:10,798 --> 05:02:13,310
by the most other things aren't like
that you know you uh that's why murder

17198
05:02:13,310 --> 05:02:13,320
that you know you uh that's why murder
 

17199
05:02:13,320 --> 05:02:16,368
that you know you uh that's why murder
or you know death that you know it can

17200
05:02:16,368 --> 05:02:16,378
or you know death that you know it can
 

17201
05:02:16,378 --> 05:02:18,530
or you know death that you know it can
be scored it's an ambiguous you know

17202
05:02:18,530 --> 05:02:18,540
be scored it's an ambiguous you know
 

17203
05:02:18,540 --> 05:02:20,628
be scored it's an ambiguous you know
it's done when it's done whereas when

17204
05:02:20,628 --> 05:02:20,638
it's done when it's done whereas when
 

17205
05:02:20,638 --> 05:02:22,970
it's done when it's done whereas when
did somebody get sick oh they were kind

17206
05:02:22,970 --> 05:02:22,980
did somebody get sick oh they were kind
 

17207
05:02:22,980 --> 05:02:24,288
did somebody get sick oh they were kind
of sick or they were sick today they

17208
05:02:24,288 --> 05:02:24,298
of sick or they were sick today they
 

17209
05:02:24,298 --> 05:02:25,850
of sick or they were sick today they
were sick at this hour the boundary

17210
05:02:25,850 --> 05:02:25,860
were sick at this hour the boundary
 

17211
05:02:25,860 --> 05:02:27,170
were sick at this hour the boundary
conditions many other kinds of things

17212
05:02:27,170 --> 05:02:27,180
conditions many other kinds of things
 

17213
05:02:27,180 --> 05:02:28,610
conditions many other kinds of things
are not like clear-cut like that right

17214
05:02:28,610 --> 05:02:28,620
are not like clear-cut like that right
 

17215
05:02:28,620 --> 05:02:30,470
are not like clear-cut like that right
and I should just briefly comment that

17216
05:02:30,470 --> 05:02:30,480
and I should just briefly comment that
 

17217
05:02:30,480 --> 05:02:34,128
and I should just briefly comment that
life expectancy does have this quirk

17218
05:02:34,128 --> 05:02:34,138
life expectancy does have this quirk
 

17219
05:02:34,138 --> 05:02:37,610
life expectancy does have this quirk
a dark cork that it uh when you just

17220
05:02:37,610 --> 05:02:37,620
a dark cork that it uh when you just
 

17221
05:02:37,620 --> 05:02:40,550
a dark cork that it uh when you just
crudely look at it is incorporates uh

17222
05:02:40,550 --> 05:02:40,560
crudely look at it is incorporates uh
 

17223
05:02:40,560 --> 05:02:43,128
crudely look at it is incorporates uh
child mortality or mortality yes at age

17224
05:02:43,128 --> 05:02:43,138
child mortality or mortality yes at age
 

17225
05:02:43,138 --> 05:02:46,190
child mortality or mortality yes at age
of one or age of five and

17226
05:02:46,190 --> 05:02:46,200
of one or age of five and
 

17227
05:02:46,200 --> 05:02:49,910
of one or age of five and
um maybe it's better and clearer to look

17228
05:02:49,910 --> 05:02:49,920
um maybe it's better and clearer to look
 

17229
05:02:49,920 --> 05:02:53,090
um maybe it's better and clearer to look
at mortality after after five or

17230
05:02:53,090 --> 05:02:53,100
at mortality after after five or
 

17231
05:02:53,100 --> 05:02:56,030
at mortality after after five or
whatever and that's still those metrics

17232
05:02:56,030 --> 05:02:56,040
whatever and that's still those metrics
 

17233
05:02:56,040 --> 05:02:57,650
whatever and that's still those metrics
still hold in interesting ways and

17234
05:02:57,650 --> 05:02:57,660
still hold in interesting ways and
 

17235
05:02:57,660 --> 05:02:58,910
still hold in interesting ways and
measure the progress of human

17236
05:02:58,910 --> 05:02:58,920
measure the progress of human
 

17237
05:02:58,920 --> 05:03:00,770
measure the progress of human
civilization in interesting ways yeah

17238
05:03:00,770 --> 05:03:00,780
civilization in interesting ways yeah
 

17239
05:03:00,780 --> 05:03:02,390
civilization in interesting ways yeah
that's right you actually want longevity

17240
05:03:02,390 --> 05:03:02,400
that's right you actually want longevity
 

17241
05:03:02,400 --> 05:03:03,770
that's right you actually want longevity
biomarkers a lot of people are working

17242
05:03:03,770 --> 05:03:03,780
biomarkers a lot of people are working
 

17243
05:03:03,780 --> 05:03:05,448
biomarkers a lot of people are working
on this there's a book called the

17244
05:03:05,448 --> 05:03:05,458
on this there's a book called the
 

17245
05:03:05,458 --> 05:03:07,010
on this there's a book called the
picture Dorian Gray right and the

17246
05:03:07,010 --> 05:03:07,020
picture Dorian Gray right and the
 

17247
05:03:07,020 --> 05:03:09,830
picture Dorian Gray right and the
concept is sell your soul to you know

17248
05:03:09,830 --> 05:03:09,840
concept is sell your soul to you know
 

17249
05:03:09,840 --> 05:03:11,990
concept is sell your soul to you know
ensure the picture rather than he will

17250
05:03:11,990 --> 05:03:12,000
ensure the picture rather than he will
 

17251
05:03:12,000 --> 05:03:15,350
ensure the picture rather than he will
age and fade right and uh so the concept

17252
05:03:15,350 --> 05:03:15,360
age and fade right and uh so the concept
 

17253
05:03:15,360 --> 05:03:16,610
age and fade right and uh so the concept
is that that thing on the wall just

17254
05:03:16,610 --> 05:03:16,620
is that that thing on the wall just
 

17255
05:03:16,620 --> 05:03:18,350
is that that thing on the wall just
reflects his age and you can see it okay

17256
05:03:18,350 --> 05:03:18,360
reflects his age and you can see it okay
 

17257
05:03:18,360 --> 05:03:20,868
reflects his age and you can see it okay
so there's a premise that's in bed in a

17258
05:03:20,868 --> 05:03:20,878
so there's a premise that's in bed in a
 

17259
05:03:20,878 --> 05:03:22,310
so there's a premise that's in bed in a
lot of Western culture that

17260
05:03:22,310 --> 05:03:22,320
lot of Western culture that
 

17261
05:03:22,320 --> 05:03:24,470
lot of Western culture that
to gain something you must lose if you

17262
05:03:24,470 --> 05:03:24,480
to gain something you must lose if you
 

17263
05:03:24,480 --> 05:03:27,110
to gain something you must lose if you
if you're Icarus and you try to fly then

17264
05:03:27,110 --> 05:03:27,120
if you're Icarus and you try to fly then
 

17265
05:03:27,120 --> 05:03:29,690
if you're Icarus and you try to fly then
you will you know you'll fly too high

17266
05:03:29,690 --> 05:03:29,700
you will you know you'll fly too high
 

17267
05:03:29,700 --> 05:03:31,128
you will you know you'll fly too high
and you'll melt your wings but guess

17268
05:03:31,128 --> 05:03:31,138
and you'll melt your wings but guess
 

17269
05:03:31,138 --> 05:03:32,570
and you'll melt your wings but guess
what we fly every day commercial air

17270
05:03:32,570 --> 05:03:32,580
what we fly every day commercial air
 

17271
05:03:32,580 --> 05:03:35,090
what we fly every day commercial air
flight right so the opposite of like the

17272
05:03:35,090 --> 05:03:35,100
flight right so the opposite of like the
 

17273
05:03:35,100 --> 05:03:37,670
flight right so the opposite of like the
Icarus or picture of durian gray kind of

17274
05:03:37,670 --> 05:03:37,680
Icarus or picture of durian gray kind of
 

17275
05:03:37,680 --> 05:03:39,830
Icarus or picture of durian gray kind of
thing is the movie Limitless which I

17276
05:03:39,830 --> 05:03:39,840
thing is the movie Limitless which I
 

17277
05:03:39,840 --> 05:03:42,350
thing is the movie Limitless which I
love because it's so nietzschean and so

17278
05:03:42,350 --> 05:03:42,360
love because it's so nietzschean and so
 

17279
05:03:42,360 --> 05:03:44,628
love because it's so nietzschean and so
unusual relative to the dystopian you

17280
05:03:44,628 --> 05:03:44,638
unusual relative to the dystopian you
 

17281
05:03:44,638 --> 05:03:45,890
unusual relative to the dystopian you
know Sci-Fi movies where there's a

17282
05:03:45,890 --> 05:03:45,900
know Sci-Fi movies where there's a
 

17283
05:03:45,900 --> 05:03:47,330
know Sci-Fi movies where there's a
without giving I mean the movie's kind

17284
05:03:47,330 --> 05:03:47,340
without giving I mean the movie's kind
 

17285
05:03:47,340 --> 05:03:49,128
without giving I mean the movie's kind
of old now but

17286
05:03:49,128 --> 05:03:49,138
of old now but
 

17287
05:03:49,138 --> 05:03:50,690
of old now but
um there's a drug in it that's a

17288
05:03:50,690 --> 05:03:50,700
um there's a drug in it that's a
 

17289
05:03:50,700 --> 05:03:52,430
um there's a drug in it that's a
neurotropic that boosts you know your

17290
05:03:52,430 --> 05:03:52,440
neurotropic that boosts you know your
 

17291
05:03:52,440 --> 05:03:54,110
neurotropic that boosts you know your
cognitive abilities and it's got side

17292
05:03:54,110 --> 05:03:54,120
cognitive abilities and it's got side
 

17293
05:03:54,120 --> 05:03:56,570
cognitive abilities and it's got side
effects but at the end he Engineers out

17294
05:03:56,570 --> 05:03:56,580
effects but at the end he Engineers out
 

17295
05:03:56,580 --> 05:03:58,910
effects but at the end he Engineers out
the side effects amazing just like you

17296
05:03:58,910 --> 05:03:58,920
the side effects amazing just like you
 

17297
05:03:58,920 --> 05:04:00,410
the side effects amazing just like you
know yeah their planes are crashing we

17298
05:04:00,410 --> 05:04:00,420
know yeah their planes are crashing we
 

17299
05:04:00,420 --> 05:04:02,510
know yeah their planes are crashing we
land right okay so why'd I mention the

17300
05:04:02,510 --> 05:04:02,520
land right okay so why'd I mention the
 

17301
05:04:02,520 --> 05:04:03,350
land right okay so why'd I mention the
picture during great well there's

17302
05:04:03,350 --> 05:04:03,360
picture during great well there's
 

17303
05:04:03,360 --> 05:04:05,090
picture during great well there's
another aspect of it which is

17304
05:04:05,090 --> 05:04:05,100
another aspect of it which is
 

17305
05:04:05,100 --> 05:04:07,310
another aspect of it which is
longevity biomarker the point is to kind

on somebody right one of the best

17316
05:04:18,230 --> 05:04:18,240
on somebody right one of the best
 

17317
05:04:18,240 --> 05:04:21,050
on somebody right one of the best
longevity biomarkers could be

17318
05:04:21,050 --> 05:04:21,060
longevity biomarkers could be
 

17319
05:04:21,060 --> 05:04:23,510
longevity biomarkers could be
um just your face right you image the

17320
05:04:23,510 --> 05:04:23,520
um just your face right you image the
 

17321
05:04:23,520 --> 05:04:25,490
um just your face right you image the
face and you can sort of tell oh

17322
05:04:25,490 --> 05:04:25,500
face and you can sort of tell oh
 

17323
05:04:25,500 --> 05:04:26,868

somebody looks like they've aged oh
 

17325
05:04:26,878 --> 05:04:30,590
somebody looks like they've aged oh
someone looks younger et cetera Etc and

05:04:30,590 --> 05:04:30,600
someone looks younger et cetera Etc and
 

17327
05:04:30,600 --> 05:04:31,730
someone looks younger et cetera Etc and
um this is actually data that you've got

17328
05:04:31,730 --> 05:04:31,740
um this is actually data that you've got
 

17329
05:04:31,740 --> 05:04:33,948
um this is actually data that you've got
on millions and millions of people where

17345
05:04:48,180 --> 05:04:49,788
they've already they've already passed

17347
05:04:49,798 --> 05:04:52,070

through their life right so just Imaging

17348
05:04:52,070 --> 05:04:52,080
through their life right so just Imaging

might give a reasonably good longevity

17350
05:04:54,530 --> 05:04:54,540
might give a reasonably good longevity

05:04:54,540 --> 05:04:56,448
might give a reasonably good longevity
biomarker but then you can supplement

17352
05:04:56,448 --> 05:04:56,458
biomarker but then you can supplement
 

17353
05:04:56,458 --> 05:04:58,788
biomarker but then you can supplement
that with a lot of other variables

17354
05:04:58,788 --> 05:04:58,798
that with a lot of other variables
 

17355
05:04:58,798 --> 05:05:01,250
that with a lot of other variables
and now you can start benchmarking every

17356
05:05:01,250 --> 05:05:01,260
and now you can start benchmarking every
 

17357
05:05:01,260 --> 05:05:04,490
and now you can start benchmarking every
treatment by its change and how much

17358
05:05:04,490 --> 05:05:04,500
treatment by its change and how much
 

17359
05:05:04,500 --> 05:05:06,948
treatment by its change and how much
time you have left if that treatment

17360
05:05:06,948 --> 05:05:06,958
time you have left if that treatment
 

17361
05:05:06,958 --> 05:05:08,990
time you have left if that treatment
that intervention

17362
05:05:08,990 --> 05:05:09,000
that intervention
 

17363
05:05:09,000 --> 05:05:13,190
that intervention
boosts your estimated life expectancy by

17364
05:05:13,190 --> 05:05:13,200
boosts your estimated life expectancy by
 

17365
05:05:13,200 --> 05:05:14,810
boosts your estimated life expectancy by
five years

17366
05:05:14,810 --> 05:05:14,820
five years
 

17367
05:05:14,820 --> 05:05:17,270
five years
you can see that in the data you can get

17368
05:05:17,270 --> 05:05:17,280
you can see that in the data you can get
 

17369
05:05:17,280 --> 05:05:20,330
you can see that in the data you can get
feedback on whether your longevity is

17370
05:05:20,330 --> 05:05:20,340
feedback on whether your longevity is
 

17371
05:05:20,340 --> 05:05:22,610
feedback on whether your longevity is
being boosted or not okay

17372
05:05:22,610 --> 05:05:22,620
being boosted or not okay
 

17373
05:05:22,620 --> 05:05:24,470
being boosted or not okay
and so what this does is just

17374
05:05:24,470 --> 05:05:24,480
and so what this does is just
 

17375
05:05:24,480 --> 05:05:25,910
and so what this does is just
fundamentally changes the assumptions of

17376
05:05:25,910 --> 05:05:25,920
fundamentally changes the assumptions of
 

17377
05:05:25,920 --> 05:05:28,010
fundamentally changes the assumptions of
the system now with that said

17378
05:05:28,010 --> 05:05:28,020
the system now with that said
 

17379
05:05:28,020 --> 05:05:30,590
the system now with that said
uh you know life extension may be the

17380
05:05:30,590 --> 05:05:30,600
uh you know life extension may be the
 

17381
05:05:30,600 --> 05:05:32,150
uh you know life extension may be the
kind of thing I'm not sure if it'll work

17382
05:05:32,150 --> 05:05:32,160
kind of thing I'm not sure if it'll work
 

17383
05:05:32,160 --> 05:05:34,788
kind of thing I'm not sure if it'll work
for Our Generation we may be too late it

17384
05:05:34,788 --> 05:05:34,798
for Our Generation we may be too late it
 

17385
05:05:34,798 --> 05:05:35,810
for Our Generation we may be too late it
may work for the next Generation

17386
05:05:35,810 --> 05:05:35,820
may work for the next Generation
 

17387
05:05:35,820 --> 05:05:37,550
may work for the next Generation
wouldn't that make you sad

17388
05:05:37,550 --> 05:05:37,560
wouldn't that make you sad
 

17389
05:05:37,560 --> 05:05:39,650
wouldn't that make you sad
well I've got something to the last

17390
05:05:39,650 --> 05:05:39,660
well I've got something to the last
 

17391
05:05:39,660 --> 05:05:41,510
well I've got something to the last
generation could be but I've got

17392
05:05:41,510 --> 05:05:41,520
generation could be but I've got
 

17393
05:05:41,520 --> 05:05:44,030
generation could be but I've got
something for you which is uh I call it

17394
05:05:44,030 --> 05:05:44,040
something for you which is uh I call it
 

17395
05:05:44,040 --> 05:05:45,948
something for you which is uh I call it
genomic reincarnation

okay this one you probably haven't heard

17398
05:05:47,390 --> 05:05:47,400
okay this one you probably haven't heard
 

17399
05:05:47,400 --> 05:05:50,090
okay this one you probably haven't heard
before I've tweeted about it okay so by

17400
05:05:50,090 --> 05:05:50,100
before I've tweeted about it okay so by
 

17401
05:05:50,100 --> 05:05:52,070
before I've tweeted about it okay so by
the way good uh

17402
05:05:52,070 --> 05:05:52,080
the way good uh
 

17403
05:05:52,080 --> 05:05:53,810
the way good uh
uh time to mention that your Twitter is

17404
05:05:53,810 --> 05:05:53,820
uh time to mention that your Twitter is
 

17405
05:05:53,820 --> 05:05:55,430
uh time to mention that your Twitter is
one of the greatest twitters of all time

The Lex Friedman podcast which you may
 

17415
05:06:01,920 --> 05:06:04,128
The Lex Friedman podcast which you may
be doing right which you may be doing

be doing right which you may be doing
 

17417
05:06:04,138 --> 05:06:06,590
be doing right which you may be doing
right now yes yeah uh well thank you so

right now yes yeah uh well thank you so
uh what was the term again sorry genomic

17420
05:06:09,170 --> 05:06:09,180
uh what was the term again sorry genomic
 

17421
05:06:09,180 --> 05:06:11,270
uh what was the term again sorry genomic
uh sir I call it genomic not

17422
05:06:11,270 --> 05:06:11,280
uh sir I call it genomic not

Resurrection but genomic reincarnation

17424
05:06:13,010 --> 05:06:13,020
Resurrection but genomic reincarnation
 

17425
05:06:13,020 --> 05:06:15,770
Resurrection but genomic reincarnation
okay so here's the concept you may be

17426
05:06:15,770 --> 05:06:15,780
okay so here's the concept you may be
 

17427
05:06:15,780 --> 05:06:18,410
okay so here's the concept you may be
aware that you can synthesize strands of

17428
05:06:18,410 --> 05:06:18,420
aware that you can synthesize strands of
 

17429
05:06:18,420 --> 05:06:20,390
aware that you can synthesize strands of
DNA okay

17430
05:06:20,390 --> 05:06:20,400
DNA okay
 

17431
05:06:20,400 --> 05:06:21,830
DNA okay
um there's sequencing of DNA which is

17432
05:06:21,830 --> 05:06:21,840
um there's sequencing of DNA which is
 

17433
05:06:21,840 --> 05:06:23,690
um there's sequencing of DNA which is
reading it and synthesizing DNA which is

17434
05:06:23,690 --> 05:06:23,700
reading it and synthesizing DNA which is
 

17435
05:06:23,700 --> 05:06:26,090
reading it and synthesizing DNA which is
like creating strands of DNA

17436
05:06:26,090 --> 05:06:26,100
like creating strands of DNA
 

17437
05:06:26,100 --> 05:06:27,890
like creating strands of DNA
uh what's interesting is you can

17438
05:06:27,890 --> 05:06:27,900
uh what's interesting is you can
 

17439
05:06:27,900 --> 05:06:30,470
uh what's interesting is you can
actually also do that at the full uh

17440
05:06:30,470 --> 05:06:30,480
actually also do that at the full uh
 

17441
05:06:30,480 --> 05:06:32,750
actually also do that at the full uh
chromosome level for bacterial

chromosome level for bacterial
 

17443

chromosome level for bacterial
chromosomes remember that thing I was

17444
05:06:33,948 --> 05:06:33,958
chromosomes remember that thing I was
 

17445
05:06:33,958 --> 05:06:35,570
chromosomes remember that thing I was
saying earlier about the minimum life

17446
05:06:35,570 --> 05:06:35,580
saying earlier about the minimum life

form you know that Craig Venter made so

17448
05:06:37,970 --> 05:06:37,980
form you know that Craig Venter made so
 

17449
05:06:37,980 --> 05:06:39,650

people have synthesized like entire

17450
05:06:39,650 --> 05:06:39,660
people have synthesized like entire
 

17451
05:06:39,660 --> 05:06:42,590
people have synthesized like entire
bacterial chromosomes and they work like

17452
05:06:42,590 --> 05:06:42,600
bacterial chromosomes and they work like
 

17453
05:06:42,600 --> 05:06:44,448
bacterial chromosomes and they work like
they can literally essentially print out

17454
05:06:44,448 --> 05:06:44,458
they can literally essentially print out
 

17455
05:06:44,458 --> 05:06:47,750
they can literally essentially print out
a living organism all right now when you

17456
05:06:47,750 --> 05:06:47,760
a living organism all right now when you
 

17457
05:06:47,760 --> 05:06:51,830
a living organism all right now when you
go uh from bacteria to eukaryotes which

17458
05:06:51,830 --> 05:06:51,840
go uh from bacteria to eukaryotes which
 

17459
05:06:51,840 --> 05:06:53,410
go uh from bacteria to eukaryotes which
are the the

17460
05:06:53,410 --> 05:06:53,420
are the the
 

17461
05:06:53,420 --> 05:06:56,270
are the the
kingdom of life that we're part of right

17462
05:06:56,270 --> 05:06:56,280
kingdom of life that we're part of right
 

17463
05:06:56,280 --> 05:06:58,010
kingdom of life that we're part of right
yeast are part of this Kingdom and so on

17464
05:06:58,010 --> 05:06:58,020
yeast are part of this Kingdom and so on
 

17465
05:06:58,020 --> 05:06:59,208
yeast are part of this Kingdom and so on
it becomes harder because the

17466
05:06:59,208 --> 05:06:59,218
it becomes harder because the
 

17467
05:06:59,218 --> 05:07:01,788
it becomes harder because the
chromosomes are more complicated

17468

chromosomes are more complicated
 

17469
05:07:01,798 --> 05:07:03,590
chromosomes are more complicated
but folks are working on eukaryotic

17470
05:07:03,590 --> 05:07:03,600
but folks are working on eukaryotic
 

17471
05:07:03,600 --> 05:07:05,448
but folks are working on eukaryotic
chromosome synthesis and if you spot me

17472
05:07:05,448 --> 05:07:05,458
chromosome synthesis and if you spot me
 

17473
05:07:05,458 --> 05:07:07,610
chromosome synthesis and if you spot me
that sci-fi assumption that eventually

05:07:07,610 --> 05:07:07,620
that sci-fi assumption that eventually

05:07:07,620 --> 05:07:09,708
that sci-fi assumption that eventually
we'll be able to take your genome

17476

we'll be able to take your genome
 

17477
05:07:09,718 --> 05:07:12,708
we'll be able to take your genome
sequence and just like we can synthesize

05:07:12,708 --> 05:07:12,718
sequence and just like we can synthesize
 

17479
05:07:12,718 --> 05:07:15,050
sequence and just like we can synthesize
a bacterial chromosome we can synthesize

17480
05:07:15,050 --> 05:07:15,060
a bacterial chromosome we can synthesize
 

17481
05:07:15,060 --> 05:07:17,030
a bacterial chromosome we can synthesize
not just one eukaryotic chromosome but

17482
05:07:17,030 --> 05:07:17,040
not just one eukaryotic chromosome but
 

17483
05:07:17,040 --> 05:07:18,708
not just one eukaryotic chromosome but
your entire complement of chromosomes in

17484

your entire complement of chromosomes in
 

17485
05:07:18,718 --> 05:07:19,970
your entire complement of chromosomes in
the lab right because you have you know

17486
05:07:19,970 --> 05:07:19,980
the lab right because you have you know
 

17487
05:07:19,980 --> 05:07:22,730
the lab right because you have you know
23 and you know 46 whatever you take the

17488
05:07:22,730 --> 05:07:22,740
23 and you know 46 whatever you take the
 

17489
05:07:22,740 --> 05:07:26,150
23 and you know 46 whatever you take the
pairs what you can do is potentially

17490
05:07:26,150 --> 05:07:26,160
pairs what you can do is potentially
 

17491
05:07:26,160 --> 05:07:29,050
pairs what you can do is potentially
print somebody out from disk

17492
05:07:29,050 --> 05:07:29,060
print somebody out from disk
 

17493
05:07:29,060 --> 05:07:31,368
print somebody out from disk
reincarnate them

17494
05:07:31,368 --> 05:07:31,378
reincarnate them
 

17495
05:07:31,378 --> 05:07:34,490
reincarnate them
insofar if your sequence determines you

17496
05:07:34,490 --> 05:07:34,500
insofar if your sequence determines you
 

17497
05:07:34,500 --> 05:07:36,288
insofar if your sequence determines you
and you can argue with this epigenetics

17498
05:07:36,288 --> 05:07:36,298
and you can argue with this epigenetics
 

17499
05:07:36,298 --> 05:07:38,570
and you can argue with this epigenetics
and our stuff okay but let's just say to

17500
05:07:38,570 --> 05:07:38,580
and our stuff okay but let's just say to
 

17501
05:07:38,580 --> 05:07:41,750
and our stuff okay but let's just say to
first order your DNA sequence is Lex you

17502
05:07:41,750 --> 05:07:41,760
first order your DNA sequence is Lex you
 

17503
05:07:41,760 --> 05:07:43,550
first order your DNA sequence is Lex you
can sequence that okay you can do full

17504
05:07:43,550 --> 05:07:43,560
can sequence that okay you can do full
 

17505
05:07:43,560 --> 05:07:46,970
can sequence that okay you can do full
genome sequencing and log that to a file

17506
05:07:46,970 --> 05:07:46,980
genome sequencing and log that to a file

05:08:49,200 --> 05:08:53,270
actually a process for psychology to
study if you create a blank mind what

study if you create a blank mind what
 

17563
05:08:53,280 --> 05:08:56,090
study if you create a blank mind what
would you need to show that mind to

17564
05:08:56,090 --> 05:08:56,100
would you need to show that mind to
 

17565
05:08:56,100 --> 05:08:58,730
would you need to show that mind to
align it very well

17566
05:08:58,730 --> 05:08:58,740
align it very well
 

17567
05:08:58,740 --> 05:09:01,190
align it very well

original version such that the resulting
 

17573
05:09:06,480 --> 05:09:08,990
original version such that the resulting
clone would have similar Behavior

17574

here is a study from any gym from

17654
05:10:37,368 --> 05:10:37,378
here is a study from any gym from
 

17655
05:10:37,378 --> 05:10:41,150
here is a study from any gym from
several years ago okay uh what is this

17656
05:10:41,150 --> 05:10:41,160
several years ago okay uh what is this
 

17657
05:10:41,160 --> 05:10:43,010
several years ago okay uh what is this
is like the mid-2000s

17658
05:10:43,010 --> 05:10:43,020
is like the mid-2000s
 

17659
05:10:43,020 --> 05:10:44,868
is like the mid-2000s
this was in

17660
05:10:44,868 --> 05:10:44,878
this was in
 

17661
05:10:44,878 --> 05:10:47,750
this was in
2004 okay so it's now 17 years later

17662
05:10:47,750 --> 05:10:47,760
2004 okay so it's now 17 years later
 

17663

teenager by now so this kid

17666
05:10:52,910 --> 05:10:52,920
teenager by now so this kid
 

17667
05:10:52,920 --> 05:10:55,430
teenager by now so this kid
basically was just

17668
05:10:55,430 --> 05:10:55,440
basically was just
 

17669
05:10:55,440 --> 05:10:56,990
basically was just
totally built

17670
05:10:56,990 --> 05:10:57,000
totally built
 

17671
05:10:57,000 --> 05:10:59,868
totally built
yeah okay extraordinarily most like very

17672
05:10:59,868 --> 05:10:59,878
yeah okay extraordinarily most like very
 

17673
05:10:59,878 --> 05:11:04,070
yeah okay extraordinarily most like very
muscular at a at a very young age yes so

17674
05:11:04,070 --> 05:11:04,080
muscular at a at a very young age yes so
 

17675
05:11:04,080 --> 05:11:05,570
muscular at a at a very young age yes so
the child's birth rate was in the 75th

17676
05:11:05,570 --> 05:11:05,580
the child's birth rate was in the 75th
 

17677
05:11:05,580 --> 05:11:06,948
the child's birth rate was in the 75th
percentile he appeared extraordinarily

17678
05:11:06,948 --> 05:11:06,958
percentile he appeared extraordinarily
 

17679
05:11:06,958 --> 05:11:08,390
percentile he appeared extraordinarily
muscular with protruding muscles in his

17680
05:11:08,390 --> 05:11:08,400
muscular with protruding muscles in his
 

17681
05:11:08,400 --> 05:11:09,708
muscular with protruding muscles in his
thighs motor and mental development has

17682
05:11:09,708 --> 05:11:09,718
thighs motor and mental development has
 

17683
05:11:09,718 --> 05:11:11,270
thighs motor and mental development has
been normal now at four and a half years

17684
05:11:11,270 --> 05:11:11,280
been normal now at four and a half years
 

17685

of agency continues to have increased

17686
05:11:12,650 --> 05:11:12,660
of agency continues to have increased
 

17687
05:11:12,660 --> 05:11:14,750
of agency continues to have increased
muscle ball constraint and so

17688
05:11:14,750 --> 05:11:14,760
muscle ball constraint and so
 

17689
05:11:14,760 --> 05:11:17,150
muscle ball constraint and so
essentially myostatic mutation

17690
05:11:17,150 --> 05:11:17,160
essentially myostatic mutation
 

17691
05:11:17,160 --> 05:11:18,830
essentially myostatic mutation
associated with gross muscle hypertrophy

17692
05:11:18,830 --> 05:11:18,840
associated with gross muscle hypertrophy
 

17693
05:11:18,840 --> 05:11:20,390
associated with gross muscle hypertrophy
in a child so this is like real life

17694
05:11:20,390 --> 05:11:20,400
in a child so this is like real life
 

17695

people again you go back to the Icarus
thing they think oh steroids well that's

definitely going to give you cancer

17752
05:12:23,030 --> 05:12:23,040
definitely going to give you cancer

screw up your hormones etc etc and it
 

17755
05:12:26,160 --> 05:12:28,970
screw up your hormones etc etc and it
could but you know what like have we

17756
05:12:28,970 --> 05:12:28,980
could but you know what like have we
 

17757
05:12:28,980 --> 05:12:30,650
could but you know what like have we
actually put in that much effort into

17758
05:12:30,650 --> 05:12:30,660
actually put in that much effort into
 

17759
05:12:30,660 --> 05:12:33,530
actually put in that much effort into
figuring out like the the right way of

17760
05:12:33,530 --> 05:12:33,540
figuring out like the the right way of
 

17761
05:12:33,540 --> 05:12:35,628
figuring out like the the right way of
doing testosterone supplementation or

17762
05:12:35,628 --> 05:12:35,638
doing testosterone supplementation or
 

17763
05:12:35,638 --> 05:12:38,270
doing testosterone supplementation or
the right way of doing this uh obviously

17764
05:12:38,270 --> 05:12:38,280
the right way of doing this uh obviously
 

17765
05:12:38,280 --> 05:12:40,510
the right way of doing this uh obviously
we managed to put a lot of effort into

17766
05:12:40,510 --> 05:12:40,520
we managed to put a lot of effort into
 

17767
05:12:40,520 --> 05:12:42,770
we managed to put a lot of effort into
marijuana increasing the potency of it

17768
05:12:42,770 --> 05:12:42,780
marijuana increasing the potency of it
 

17769
05:12:42,780 --> 05:12:44,390
marijuana increasing the potency of it
or what have you could we put the effort

17770
05:12:44,390 --> 05:12:44,400
or what have you could we put the effort
 

17771
05:12:44,400 --> 05:12:47,390
or what have you could we put the effort
into these kinds of drugs right or these

17772
05:12:47,390 --> 05:12:47,400
into these kinds of drugs right or these
 

17773
05:12:47,400 --> 05:12:49,490
into these kinds of drugs right or these
kinds of compounds Maybe

17774
05:12:49,490 --> 05:12:49,500
kinds of compounds Maybe
 

17775
05:12:49,500 --> 05:12:50,750
kinds of compounds Maybe
I think that would actually be a really

17776
05:12:50,750 --> 05:12:50,760
I think that would actually be a really
 

17777
05:12:50,760 --> 05:12:52,850
I think that would actually be a really
good thing the thing about this is I

17778
05:12:52,850 --> 05:12:52,860
good thing the thing about this is I
 

17779
05:12:52,860 --> 05:12:54,170
good thing the thing about this is I
feel this is just a massively

17780
05:12:54,170 --> 05:12:54,180
feel this is just a massively
 

17781
05:12:54,180 --> 05:12:56,330
feel this is just a massively
underexplored area

17782
05:12:56,330 --> 05:12:56,340
underexplored area
 

17783
05:12:56,340 --> 05:12:58,128
underexplored area
um rather than people drinking caffeine

17784
05:12:58,128 --> 05:12:58,138
um rather than people drinking caffeine
 

17785
05:12:58,138 --> 05:12:59,810
um rather than people drinking caffeine
all the time that's like a very mild

17786
05:12:59,810 --> 05:12:59,820
all the time that's like a very mild
 

17787
05:12:59,820 --> 05:13:02,990
all the time that's like a very mild
enhancing drug okay uh nicotine is also

17788
05:13:02,990 --> 05:13:03,000
enhancing drug okay uh nicotine is also
 

17789
05:13:03,000 --> 05:13:04,368
enhancing drug okay uh nicotine is also
arguably kind of like that you know some

17790
05:13:04,368 --> 05:13:04,378
arguably kind of like that you know some
 

17791
05:13:04,378 --> 05:13:05,628
arguably kind of like that you know some
people have it even without the

17792
05:13:05,628 --> 05:13:05,638
people have it even without the
 

17793
05:13:05,638 --> 05:13:07,788
people have it even without the
cigarettes right

17794
05:13:07,788 --> 05:13:07,798
cigarettes right
 

17795
05:13:07,798 --> 05:13:09,590

why can't we research this stuff one way

17796
05:13:09,590 --> 05:13:09,600
why can't we research this stuff one way
 

17797
05:13:09,600 --> 05:13:11,090
why can't we research this stuff one way
of thinking about it is you know Lancer

um so those are two are interlinked
 

17979
05:16:37,020 --> 05:16:39,948
um so those are two are interlinked
right you have to have somehow a

17980
05:16:39,948 --> 05:16:39,958

05:16:44,520 --> 05:16:47,208
enough to be worth this
you know significant step yeah it's not

17986
05:16:47,208 --> 05:16:47,218
you know significant step yeah it's not
 

17987

this moment and so got it right yeah so
that's that's a four case right now the

17996
05:16:57,110 --> 05:16:57,120
that's that's a four case right now the
 

17997
05:16:57,120 --> 05:16:58,250
that's that's a four case right now the
against case there's actually several

17998
05:16:58,250 --> 05:16:58,260
against case there's actually several
 

17999
05:16:58,260 --> 05:17:00,170
against case there's actually several
against cases right there's obviously

18000
05:17:00,170 --> 05:17:00,180

into a place that they just escaped from

18474
05:25:20,510 --> 05:25:20,520
into a place that they just escaped from
 

18475
05:25:20,520 --> 05:25:23,208
into a place that they just escaped from
you know and so that is something which

18476
05:25:23,208 --> 05:25:23,218
you know and so that is something which
 

18477
05:25:23,218 --> 05:25:25,430
you know and so that is something which
is sort of outside the American left

18478
05:25:25,430 --> 05:25:25,440
is sort of outside the American left
 

18479
05:25:25,440 --> 05:25:28,070
is sort of outside the American left
right you know tired kind of thing where

18480
05:25:28,070 --> 05:25:28,080
right you know tired kind of thing where
 

18481
05:25:28,080 --> 05:25:29,390
right you know tired kind of thing where
when you understand from that point of

18482
05:25:29,390 --> 05:25:29,400
when you understand from that point of
 

18483
05:25:29,400 --> 05:25:30,770
when you understand from that point of
view right then there's like a fourth

18484
05:25:30,770 --> 05:25:30,780
view right then there's like a fourth
 

18485
05:25:30,780 --> 05:25:32,750
view right then there's like a fourth
point of view which is like India's

18486
05:25:32,750 --> 05:25:32,760
point of view which is like India's
 

18487
05:25:32,760 --> 05:25:34,490
point of view which is like India's
point of view or like much of the

18488
05:25:34,490 --> 05:25:34,500
point of view or like much of the
 

18489
05:25:34,500 --> 05:25:36,350
point of view or like much of the
developing world or what I call you know

18490
05:25:36,350 --> 05:25:36,360
developing world or what I call you know
 

18491
05:25:36,360 --> 05:25:38,690
developing world or what I call you know
parts of it are you know ascending parts

18492
05:25:38,690 --> 05:25:38,700
parts of it are you know ascending parts
 

18493
05:25:38,700 --> 05:25:40,670
parts of it are you know ascending parts
or descending whatever but much of the

18494
05:25:40,670 --> 05:25:40,680
or descending whatever but much of the
 

18495
05:25:40,680 --> 05:25:42,708
or descending whatever but much of the
rest of the world outside of that border

18496
05:25:42,708 --> 05:25:42,718
rest of the world outside of that border
 

18497
05:25:42,718 --> 05:25:45,350
rest of the world outside of that border
region says look uh we're sympathetic to

18498
05:25:45,350 --> 05:25:45,360
region says look uh we're sympathetic to
 

18499
05:25:45,360 --> 05:25:47,390
region says look uh we're sympathetic to
the ukrainians but we can't allow our

18500
05:25:47,390 --> 05:25:47,400
the ukrainians but we can't allow our
 

18501
05:25:47,400 --> 05:25:49,788
the ukrainians but we can't allow our
people to starve so we're gonna maintain

18502
05:25:49,788 --> 05:25:49,798
people to starve so we're gonna maintain
 

18503
05:25:49,798 --> 05:25:51,410
people to starve so we're gonna maintain
trade and guess what actually you know

18504
05:25:51,410 --> 05:25:51,420
trade and guess what actually you know
 

18505
05:25:51,420 --> 05:25:53,208
trade and guess what actually you know
we've got a lot of wars in our neck of

18506
05:25:53,208 --> 05:25:53,218
we've got a lot of wars in our neck of
 

18507
05:25:53,218 --> 05:25:54,530
we've got a lot of wars in our neck of
the woods and human rights crises that

18508
05:25:54,530 --> 05:25:54,540
the woods and human rights crises that
 

18509
05:25:54,540 --> 05:25:56,330
the woods and human rights crises that
Europe just didn't even care about so it

18510
05:25:56,330 --> 05:25:56,340
Europe just didn't even care about so it
 

18511
05:25:56,340 --> 05:25:57,650
Europe just didn't even care about so it
can't be that Europe's problems are the

18512
05:25:57,650 --> 05:25:57,660
can't be that Europe's problems are the
 

18513
05:25:57,660 --> 05:25:58,670
can't be that Europe's problems are the
world's problems but the world's

18514
05:25:58,670 --> 05:25:58,680
world's problems but the world's
 

18515
05:25:58,680 --> 05:25:59,810
world's problems but the world's
problems are not Europe's problems right

18516
05:25:59,810 --> 05:25:59,820
problems are not Europe's problems right
 

18517
05:25:59,820 --> 05:26:01,070
problems are not Europe's problems right
so that's like a fourth point of view

18518
05:26:01,070 --> 05:26:01,080
so that's like a fourth point of view
 

18519
05:26:01,080 --> 05:26:02,270
so that's like a fourth point of view
then a fifth point of view is China

18520
05:26:02,270 --> 05:26:02,280
then a fifth point of view is China
 

18521
05:26:02,280 --> 05:26:04,010
then a fifth point of view is China
which is like guess what we're going to

18522
05:26:04,010 --> 05:26:04,020
which is like guess what we're going to
 

18523
05:26:04,020 --> 05:26:06,110
which is like guess what we're going to
be the Iran of the Iraq War you know

18524
05:26:06,110 --> 05:26:06,120
be the Iran of the Iraq War you know
 

18525
05:26:06,120 --> 05:26:07,910
be the Iran of the Iraq War you know
where like who won the Iraq War Iran

18526
05:26:07,910 --> 05:26:07,920
where like who won the Iraq War Iran
 

18527
05:26:07,920 --> 05:26:09,948
where like who won the Iraq War Iran
arguably extended their influence into

18528
05:26:09,948 --> 05:26:09,958
arguably extended their influence into
 

18529
05:26:09,958 --> 05:26:11,570
arguably extended their influence into
Iraq right so China's like guess what

18530
05:26:11,570 --> 05:26:11,580
Iraq right so China's like guess what
 

18531
05:26:11,580 --> 05:26:12,830
Iraq right so China's like guess what
we're going to turn Russia into our gas

18532
05:26:12,830 --> 05:26:12,840
we're going to turn Russia into our gas
 

18533
05:26:12,840 --> 05:26:14,690
we're going to turn Russia into our gas
station and build a pipeline they're

18534
05:26:14,690 --> 05:26:14,700
station and build a pipeline they're
 

18535
05:26:14,700 --> 05:26:16,128
station and build a pipeline they're
building there's a power Siberia is like

18536
05:26:16,128 --> 05:26:16,138
building there's a power Siberia is like
 

18537
05:26:16,138 --> 05:26:18,410
building there's a power Siberia is like
the name of the Eastern Russia your

18538
05:26:18,410 --> 05:26:18,420
the name of the Eastern Russia your
 

18539
05:26:18,420 --> 05:26:19,970
the name of the Eastern Russia your
pipeline just like nordstream is you

18540
05:26:19,970 --> 05:26:19,980
pipeline just like nordstream is you
 

18541
05:26:19,980 --> 05:26:21,470
pipeline just like nordstream is you
know Nordstrom one and North stream too

18542
05:26:21,470 --> 05:26:21,480
know Nordstrom one and North stream too
 

18543
05:26:21,480 --> 05:26:23,330
know Nordstrom one and North stream too
I think they're building a new pipeline

18544
05:26:23,330 --> 05:26:23,340
I think they're building a new pipeline
 

18545
05:26:23,340 --> 05:26:25,550
I think they're building a new pipeline
you know through Mongolia so Xi Jinping

18546
05:26:25,550 --> 05:26:25,560
you know through Mongolia so Xi Jinping
 

18547
05:26:25,560 --> 05:26:27,708
you know through Mongolia so Xi Jinping
and Putin and the Mongolian head of

18548
05:26:27,708 --> 05:26:27,718
and Putin and the Mongolian head of
 

18549
05:26:27,718 --> 05:26:29,390
and Putin and the Mongolian head of
state were all photographed kind of

18550
05:26:29,390 --> 05:26:29,400
state were all photographed kind of
 

18551
05:26:29,400 --> 05:26:30,890
state were all photographed kind of
thumbs upping this pipeline we'll see if

18552
05:26:30,890 --> 05:26:30,900
thumbs upping this pipeline we'll see if
 

18553
05:26:30,900 --> 05:26:33,650
thumbs upping this pipeline we'll see if
it goes through but it's ironic that you

18554
05:26:33,650 --> 05:26:33,660
it goes through but it's ironic that you
 

18555
05:26:33,660 --> 05:26:35,390
it goes through but it's ironic that you
know Russia wanted

18556
05:26:35,390 --> 05:26:35,400
know Russia wanted
 

18557
05:26:35,400 --> 05:26:38,690
know Russia wanted
to make Ukraine their you know Colony

18558
05:26:38,690 --> 05:26:38,700
to make Ukraine their you know Colony
 

18559
05:26:38,700 --> 05:26:40,788
to make Ukraine their you know Colony
but the outcome of this war may be that

18560
05:26:40,788 --> 05:26:40,798
but the outcome of this war may be that
 

18561
05:26:40,798 --> 05:26:43,250
but the outcome of this war may be that
Russia becomes China's Colony you know

18562
05:26:43,250 --> 05:26:43,260
Russia becomes China's Colony you know
 

18563
05:26:43,260 --> 05:26:44,810
Russia becomes China's Colony you know
so that's at least like five different

18564
05:26:44,810 --> 05:26:44,820
so that's at least like five different
 

18565
05:26:44,820 --> 05:26:47,030
so that's at least like five different
perspectives right there's like the U.S

18566
05:26:47,030 --> 05:26:47,040
perspectives right there's like the U.S
 

18567

perspectives right there's like the U.S
establishment perspective there's the

18568
05:26:48,650 --> 05:26:48,660
establishment perspective there's the
 

18569
05:26:48,660 --> 05:26:51,590
establishment perspective there's the
you know Tucker Maga perspective there's

18570
05:26:51,590 --> 05:26:51,600
you know Tucker Maga perspective there's
 

18571
05:26:51,600 --> 05:26:53,810
you know Tucker Maga perspective there's
the baltics and Ukrainian perspective

18572
05:26:53,810 --> 05:26:53,820
the baltics and Ukrainian perspective
 

18573
05:26:53,820 --> 05:26:55,788
the baltics and Ukrainian perspective
there's like the Indian and like poor

18574
05:26:55,788 --> 05:26:55,798
there's like the Indian and like poor
 

18575
05:26:55,798 --> 05:26:56,690
there's like the Indian and like poor
countries perspective and there's a

18576
05:26:56,690 --> 05:26:56,700
countries perspective and there's a
 

18577
05:26:56,700 --> 05:26:57,590
countries perspective and there's a
chain Spectrum then of course there's

18578
05:26:57,590 --> 05:26:57,600
chain Spectrum then of course there's
 

18579
05:26:57,600 --> 05:27:00,708
chain Spectrum then of course there's
the Russians right so

18580
05:27:00,708 --> 05:27:00,718
the Russians right so
 

18581
05:27:00,718 --> 05:27:02,150
the Russians right so
um just respect to that by the way

18582
05:27:02,150 --> 05:27:02,160
um just respect to that by the way
 

18583
05:27:02,160 --> 05:27:03,650
um just respect to that by the way
that's another example of History

18584
05:27:03,650 --> 05:27:03,660
that's another example of History
 

18585
05:27:03,660 --> 05:27:06,650
that's another example of History
happening in Reverse this is the sign of

18586
05:27:06,650 --> 05:27:06,660
happening in Reverse this is the sign of
 

18587
05:27:06,660 --> 05:27:08,448
happening in Reverse this is the sign of
Soviet partnership except this time

18588
05:27:08,448 --> 05:27:08,458
Soviet partnership except this time
 

18589
05:27:08,458 --> 05:27:10,550
Soviet partnership except this time
China is a senior partner and Russia is

18590
05:27:10,550 --> 05:27:10,560
China is a senior partner and Russia is
 

18591
05:27:10,560 --> 05:27:12,230
China is a senior partner and Russia is
a junior partner and this time they're

18592
05:27:12,230 --> 05:27:12,240
a junior partner and this time they're
 

18593
05:27:12,240 --> 05:27:13,610
a junior partner and this time they're
both nationalists rather than communist

18594
05:27:13,610 --> 05:27:13,620
both nationalists rather than communist
 

18595
05:27:13,620 --> 05:27:16,788
both nationalists rather than communist
and there's so many flips like this and

18596
05:27:16,788 --> 05:27:16,798
and there's so many flips like this and
 

18597
05:27:16,798 --> 05:27:19,128
and there's so many flips like this and
you know there's I'm going to list a few

18598
05:27:19,128 --> 05:27:19,138
you know there's I'm going to list a few
 

18599
05:27:19,138 --> 05:27:20,750
you know there's I'm going to list a few
more actually because there's so so so

18600
05:27:20,750 --> 05:27:20,760
more actually because there's so so so
 

18601
05:27:20,760 --> 05:27:22,610
more actually because there's so so so
many of them do you have an explanation

18602
05:27:22,610 --> 05:27:22,620
many of them do you have an explanation
 

18603
05:27:22,620 --> 05:27:25,430
many of them do you have an explanation
of why that happens yes let me list a

18604
05:27:25,430 --> 05:27:25,440
of why that happens yes let me list a
 

18605
05:27:25,440 --> 05:27:27,770
of why that happens yes let me list a
few of them this is in the network State

18606
05:27:27,770 --> 05:27:27,780
few of them this is in the network State
 

18607
05:27:27,780 --> 05:27:29,208
few of them this is in the network State
book it's in the chapter called

18608
05:27:29,208 --> 05:27:29,218
book it's in the chapter called
 

18609
05:27:29,218 --> 05:27:31,850
book it's in the chapter called
fragmentation Frontier fourth turning

18610
05:27:31,850 --> 05:27:31,860
fragmentation Frontier fourth turning
 

18611
05:27:31,860 --> 05:27:35,448
fragmentation Frontier fourth turning
Futures our past right so I give this

18612
05:27:35,448 --> 05:27:35,458
Futures our past right so I give this
 

18613
05:27:35,458 --> 05:27:39,708
Futures our past right so I give this
example of like a fluid unmixing all

18614
05:27:39,708 --> 05:27:39,718
example of like a fluid unmixing all
 

18615
05:27:39,718 --> 05:27:41,208
example of like a fluid unmixing all
right just watch this for a second right

18616
05:27:41,208 --> 05:27:41,218
right just watch this for a second right
 

18617
05:27:41,218 --> 05:27:44,448
right just watch this for a second right
this is from Smart every day on mixing

18618
05:27:44,448 --> 05:27:44,458
this is from Smart every day on mixing
 

18619
05:27:44,458 --> 05:27:47,150
this is from Smart every day on mixing
color machine Ultra lamina reversible

18620
05:27:47,150 --> 05:27:47,160
color machine Ultra lamina reversible
 

18621
05:27:47,160 --> 05:27:51,110
color machine Ultra lamina reversible
flow smart every day 217. and so you can

18622
05:27:51,110 --> 05:27:51,120
flow smart every day 217. and so you can
 

18623
05:27:51,120 --> 05:27:53,810
flow smart every day 217. and so you can
mix something and then like this thing

18624
05:27:53,810 --> 05:27:53,820
mix something and then like this thing
 

18625
05:27:53,820 --> 05:27:55,250
mix something and then like this thing
that you don't think of as reversible

18626
05:27:55,250 --> 05:27:55,260
that you don't think of as reversible
 

18627
05:27:55,260 --> 05:27:58,550
that you don't think of as reversible
you can unmix it which is insane right

18628
05:27:58,550 --> 05:27:58,560
you can unmix it which is insane right
 

18629
05:27:58,560 --> 05:28:00,288
you can unmix it which is insane right
that it works okay the physics of that

18630
05:28:00,288 --> 05:28:00,298
that it works okay the physics of that
 

18631
05:28:00,298 --> 05:28:02,990
that it works okay the physics of that
situation it just works right so uh for

18632
05:28:02,990 --> 05:28:03,000
situation it just works right so uh for
 

18633
05:28:03,000 --> 05:28:05,030
situation it just works right so uh for
people just listening that there is

18634
05:28:05,030 --> 05:28:05,040
people just listening that there is
 

18635
05:28:05,040 --> 05:28:07,610
people just listening that there is
whatever the mixture this is all this is

18636
05:28:07,610 --> 05:28:07,620
whatever the mixture this is all this is
 

18637
05:28:07,620 --> 05:28:10,070
whatever the mixture this is all this is
ultra laminar reversible flow so this

18638
05:28:10,070 --> 05:28:10,080
ultra laminar reversible flow so this
 

18639
05:28:10,080 --> 05:28:11,750
ultra laminar reversible flow so this
probably has to do something to do with

18640
05:28:11,750 --> 05:28:11,760
probably has to do something to do with
 

18641
05:28:11,760 --> 05:28:13,690
probably has to do something to do with
the material

18642
05:28:13,690 --> 05:28:13,700
the material
 

18643
05:28:13,700 --> 05:28:16,490
the material
we're used to mixing not being a

18644
05:28:16,490 --> 05:28:16,500
we're used to mixing not being a
 

18645
05:28:16,500 --> 05:28:18,830
we're used to mixing not being a
reversible process exactly that's what

18646
05:28:18,830 --> 05:28:18,840
reversible process exactly that's what
 

18647
05:28:18,840 --> 05:28:22,010
reversible process exactly that's what
that shows and then he he then reverses

18648
05:28:22,010 --> 05:28:22,020
that shows and then he he then reverses
 

18649
05:28:22,020 --> 05:28:23,750
that shows and then he he then reverses
the mixing and table to do it perfectly

18650
05:28:23,750 --> 05:28:23,760
the mixing and table to do it perfectly
 

18651
05:28:23,760 --> 05:28:26,690
the mixing and table to do it perfectly
that's right so that's like the Futures

18652
05:28:26,690 --> 05:28:26,700
that's right so that's like the Futures
 

18653
05:28:26,700 --> 05:28:28,490
that's right so that's like the Futures
are past these it shows that Free Will

18654
05:28:28,490 --> 05:28:28,500
are past these it shows that Free Will
 

18655
05:28:28,500 --> 05:28:30,110
are past these it shows that Free Will
is an illusion just kidding okay well

18656
05:28:30,110 --> 05:28:30,120
is an illusion just kidding okay well
 

18657
05:28:30,120 --> 05:28:32,628
is an illusion just kidding okay well
basically there's there's you know some

18658
05:28:32,628 --> 05:28:32,638
basically there's there's you know some
 

18659
05:28:32,638 --> 05:28:33,948
basically there's there's you know some
environments where you know the

18660
05:28:33,948 --> 05:28:33,958
environments where you know the
 

18661
05:28:33,958 --> 05:28:35,510
environments where you know the
equations are like time symmetrical so

18662
05:28:35,510 --> 05:28:35,520
equations are like time symmetrical so
 

18663
05:28:35,520 --> 05:28:36,830
equations are like time symmetrical so
you can right

18664
05:28:36,830 --> 05:28:36,840
you can right
 

18665
05:28:36,840 --> 05:28:39,770
you can right
um and this is one model sort of it's an

18666
05:28:39,770 --> 05:28:39,780
um and this is one model sort of it's an
 

18667
05:28:39,780 --> 05:28:40,850
um and this is one model sort of it's an
interesting visual model for what's

18668
05:28:40,850 --> 05:28:40,860
interesting visual model for what's
 

18669
05:28:40,860 --> 05:28:42,530
interesting visual model for what's
happening in the world as we

18670
05:28:42,530 --> 05:28:42,540
happening in the world as we
 

18671
05:28:42,540 --> 05:28:44,330
happening in the world as we
redecentralize after the centralized

18672
05:28:44,330 --> 05:28:44,340
redecentralize after the centralized
 

18673
05:28:44,340 --> 05:28:47,390
redecentralize after the centralized
entry right so

18674
05:28:47,390 --> 05:28:47,400
entry right so
 

18675
05:28:47,400 --> 05:28:48,890
entry right so
um basically you know I mentioned the

18676
05:28:48,890 --> 05:28:48,900
um basically you know I mentioned the
 

18677
05:28:48,900 --> 05:28:50,690
um basically you know I mentioned the
internet Frontier over opens back in the

18678
05:28:50,690 --> 05:28:50,700
internet Frontier over opens back in the
 

18679
05:28:50,700 --> 05:28:52,368
internet Frontier over opens back in the
Western frontier closed today we

18680
05:28:52,368 --> 05:28:52,378
Western frontier closed today we
 

18681
05:28:52,378 --> 05:28:53,810
Western frontier closed today we
experienced covid-19 back then we

18682
05:28:53,810 --> 05:28:53,820
experienced covid-19 back then we
 

18683
05:28:53,820 --> 05:28:55,368
experienced covid-19 back then we
experienced a Spanish Flu Tech

18684
05:28:55,368 --> 05:28:55,378
experienced a Spanish Flu Tech
 

18685
05:28:55,378 --> 05:28:56,330
experienced a Spanish Flu Tech
billionaires and the other Captain

and Dorsey
 

18691
05:29:00,298 --> 05:29:01,788
and Dorsey
are starting to win against

18692
05:29:01,788 --> 05:29:01,798
are starting to win against
 

18693
05:29:01,798 --> 05:29:04,250
are starting to win against
establishment journalists back then Ida

18694
05:29:04,250 --> 05:29:04,260
establishment journalists back then Ida
 

18695
05:29:04,260 --> 05:29:05,628
establishment journalists back then Ida
Tarbell demagogued and defeated

18696
05:29:05,628 --> 05:29:05,638
Tarbell demagogued and defeated
 

18697
05:29:05,638 --> 05:29:07,610
Tarbell demagogued and defeated
Rockefeller I think net net Founders win

18698
05:29:07,610 --> 05:29:07,620
Rockefeller I think net net Founders win
 

18699
05:29:07,620 --> 05:29:10,010
Rockefeller I think net net Founders win
this time versus the journals back then

18700
05:29:10,010 --> 05:29:10,020
this time versus the journals back then
 

18701
05:29:10,020 --> 05:29:11,448
this time versus the journals back then
the journalist won over the founders

18702
05:29:11,448 --> 05:29:11,458
the journalist won over the founders
 

18703
05:29:11,458 --> 05:29:12,650
the journalist won over the founders
okay

18704
05:29:12,650 --> 05:29:12,660
okay
 

18705
05:29:12,660 --> 05:29:14,208
okay
um today we have cryptocurrencies back

18706
05:29:14,208 --> 05:29:14,218
um today we have cryptocurrencies back
 

18707
05:29:14,218 --> 05:29:16,368
um today we have cryptocurrencies back
then we had private banking today this

18708
05:29:16,368 --> 05:29:16,378
then we had private banking today this
 

18709
05:29:16,378 --> 05:29:18,350
then we had private banking today this
is an amazing one we have a populist

18710
05:29:18,350 --> 05:29:18,360
is an amazing one we have a populist
 

18711
05:29:18,360 --> 05:29:19,910
is an amazing one we have a populist
movement movement of digital gold

18712
05:29:19,910 --> 05:29:19,920
movement movement of digital gold
 

18713
05:29:19,920 --> 05:29:21,350
movement movement of digital gold
advocates

18714
05:29:21,350 --> 05:29:21,360
advocates
 

18715
05:29:21,360 --> 05:29:23,448
advocates
back then because Bitcoin maximalists

18716
05:29:23,448 --> 05:29:23,458
back then because Bitcoin maximalists
 

18717
05:29:23,458 --> 05:29:25,610
back then because Bitcoin maximalists
and so on where gold has become populist

18718
05:29:25,610 --> 05:29:25,620
and so on where gold has become populist
 

18719
05:29:25,620 --> 05:29:27,230
and so on where gold has become populist
because it's against the printing money

18720
05:29:27,230 --> 05:29:27,240
because it's against the printing money
 

18721
05:29:27,240 --> 05:29:29,810
because it's against the printing money
and so and so forth back then we had a

18722
05:29:29,810 --> 05:29:29,820
and so and so forth back then we had a
 

18723
05:29:29,820 --> 05:29:32,090
and so and so forth back then we had a
populist movement against gold in the

18724
05:29:32,090 --> 05:29:32,100
populist movement against gold in the
 

18725
05:29:32,100 --> 05:29:33,350
populist movement against gold in the
form of William Jennings Bryan in the

18726
05:29:33,350 --> 05:29:33,360
form of William Jennings Bryan in the
 

18727
05:29:33,360 --> 05:29:35,208
form of William Jennings Bryan in the
cross of gold speech gold was considered

18728
05:29:35,208 --> 05:29:35,218
cross of gold speech gold was considered
 

18729
05:29:35,218 --> 05:29:38,090
cross of gold speech gold was considered
a tool of big business now gold is the

18730
05:29:38,090 --> 05:29:38,100
a tool of big business now gold is the
 

18731
05:29:38,100 --> 05:29:39,650
a tool of big business now gold is the
tool against big business and big

18732
05:29:39,650 --> 05:29:39,660
tool against big business and big
 

18733
05:29:39,660 --> 05:29:41,930
tool against big business and big
government right uh digital gold yeah

18734
05:29:41,930 --> 05:29:41,940
government right uh digital gold yeah
 

18735
05:29:41,940 --> 05:29:43,430
government right uh digital gold yeah
digital gold right

18736
05:29:43,430 --> 05:29:43,440
digital gold right
 

18737
05:29:43,440 --> 05:29:45,110
digital gold right
say we have the inflation and cultural

18738
05:29:45,110 --> 05:29:45,120
say we have the inflation and cultural
 

18739
05:29:45,120 --> 05:29:47,690
say we have the inflation and cultural
conflict of Weimar like America back

18740
05:29:47,690 --> 05:29:47,700
conflict of Weimar like America back
 

18741
05:29:47,700 --> 05:29:48,830
conflict of Weimar like America back
then we had the inflation and cultural

on and so forth okay more examples the
 

18811
05:30:50,218 --> 05:30:51,590
on and so forth okay more examples the
one I just mentioned where the Chinese

18812
05:30:51,590 --> 05:30:51,600
one I just mentioned where the Chinese
 

18813
05:30:51,600 --> 05:30:53,270

and Russians are again lining up against

18814
05:30:53,270 --> 05:30:53,280
and Russians are again lining up against
 

18815
05:30:53,280 --> 05:30:54,590
and Russians are again lining up against
the West except this time the Chinese

18816

the West except this time the Chinese
 

18817
05:30:54,600 --> 05:30:56,030

are the senior partner relationship

18818
05:30:56,030 --> 05:30:56,040
are the senior partner relationship
 

18819
05:30:56,040 --> 05:30:58,190
are the senior partner relationship
rather than Junior partner today I think

18820
05:30:58,190 --> 05:30:58,200
rather than Junior partner today I think
 

18821
05:30:58,200 --> 05:31:00,170
rather than Junior partner today I think
in the second Cold War there will also

18822
05:31:00,170 --> 05:31:00,180
in the second Cold War there will also
 

18823
05:31:00,180 --> 05:31:02,208
in the second Cold War there will also
be a third world but this time I think

18824
05:31:02,208 --> 05:31:02,218
be a third world but this time I think
 

18825
05:31:02,218 --> 05:31:03,470
be a third world but this time I think
that third world might come in first

18826
05:31:03,470 --> 05:31:03,480
that third world might come in first
 

18827
05:31:03,480 --> 05:31:05,628
that third world might come in first
because it's not the non-aligned

18828
05:31:05,628 --> 05:31:05,638
because it's not the non-aligned
 

18829
05:31:05,638 --> 05:31:07,010
because it's not the non-aligned
movement it's the Align movement around

18830
05:31:07,010 --> 05:31:07,020
movement it's the Align movement around
 

18831

that's fascinating yeah that's what

18834
05:31:11,330 --> 05:31:11,340
that's fascinating yeah that's what
 

18835

18839
05:31:14,878 --> 05:31:16,250
we haven't mentioned Africa that there
could be very interesting things in

18840
05:31:16,250 --> 05:31:16,260
could be very interesting things in
 

18841
05:31:16,260 --> 05:31:17,930

um and I'm investing there I've uh and I

18846
05:31:23,270 --> 05:31:23,280
um and I'm investing there I've uh and I
 

18847

think you know it's one of these things
 

18849
05:31:24,600 --> 05:31:26,930
think you know it's one of these things
where China's risen India is like about

18850
05:31:26,930 --> 05:31:26,940
where China's risen India is like about
 

18851
05:31:26,940 --> 05:31:29,390
where China's risen India is like about
10 years behind uh you know China but I

18852
05:31:29,390 --> 05:31:29,400
10 years behind uh you know China but I
 

18853
05:31:29,400 --> 05:31:31,368
10 years behind uh you know China but I
think this is uh the Indian decade in

18854
05:31:31,368 --> 05:31:31,378
think this is uh the Indian decade in
 

18855
05:31:31,378 --> 05:31:33,590
think this is uh the Indian decade in
many ways we can come back to that point

18856
05:31:33,590 --> 05:31:33,600
many ways we can come back to that point
 

18857
05:31:33,600 --> 05:31:35,030
many ways we can come back to that point
um but there's absolutely you know

18858
05:31:35,030 --> 05:31:35,040
um but there's absolutely you know
 

18859
05:31:35,040 --> 05:31:36,410
um but there's absolutely you know
Sparks of light in Africa I mean it's a

18860
05:31:36,410 --> 05:31:36,420
Sparks of light in Africa I mean it's a
 

18861
05:31:36,420 --> 05:31:38,390
Sparks of light in Africa I mean it's a
huge continent it almost like the more

18862

huge continent it almost like the more
 

18863
05:31:38,400 --> 05:31:40,368
huge continent it almost like the more
behind side to interrupt the more behind

18864
05:31:40,368 --> 05:31:40,378
behind side to interrupt the more behind
 

18865
05:31:40,378 --> 05:31:41,570
behind side to interrupt the more behind
you are

18866
05:31:41,570 --> 05:31:41,580
you are
 

18867
05:31:41,580 --> 05:31:43,730
you are
the more opportunity you have to leap

18868
05:31:43,730 --> 05:31:43,740
the more opportunity you have to leap
 

18869
05:31:43,740 --> 05:31:45,410
the more opportunity you have to leap
for all sometimes that's right and pays

18870
05:31:45,410 --> 05:31:45,420
for all sometimes that's right and pays
 

18871
05:31:45,420 --> 05:31:47,390
for all sometimes that's right and pays
a is a classic example where they did

18872
05:31:47,390 --> 05:31:47,400
a is a classic example where they did
 

18873
05:31:47,400 --> 05:31:49,550
a is a classic example where they did
this in in East Africa but uh but I

18874
05:31:49,550 --> 05:31:49,560
this in in East Africa but uh but I
 

18875
05:31:49,560 --> 05:31:52,070
this in in East Africa but uh but I
think there's more possibility there

18876
05:31:52,070 --> 05:31:52,080
think there's more possibility there
 

18877
05:31:52,080 --> 05:31:55,850
think there's more possibility there
um so what is uh the fact this uh

18878
05:31:55,850 --> 05:31:55,860
um so what is uh the fact this uh
 

18879
05:31:55,860 --> 05:31:59,270
um so what is uh the fact this uh
there's a kind of symmetry there's a

18880
05:31:59,270 --> 05:31:59,280
there's a kind of symmetry there's a
 

18881
05:31:59,280 --> 05:32:01,970
there's a kind of symmetry there's a
history right what is that um how do how

18882
05:32:01,970 --> 05:32:01,980
history right what is that um how do how
 

18883
05:32:01,980 --> 05:32:04,970
history right what is that um how do how
did that take us from uh um

18884
05:32:04,970 --> 05:32:04,980
did that take us from uh um
 

18885
05:32:04,980 --> 05:32:07,610
did that take us from uh um
Trump the the the different perspective

18886
05:32:07,610 --> 05:32:07,620
Trump the the the different perspective
 

18887
05:32:07,620 --> 05:32:09,910
Trump the the the different perspective
you took the libertarian perspective of

18888
05:32:09,910 --> 05:32:09,920
you took the libertarian perspective of
 

18889
05:32:09,920 --> 05:32:12,948
you took the libertarian perspective of
uh it doesn't really matter yeah because

18890
05:32:12,948 --> 05:32:12,958
uh it doesn't really matter yeah because
 

18891
05:32:12,958 --> 05:32:14,570
uh it doesn't really matter yeah because
the libertarian perspective or the left

18892
05:32:14,570 --> 05:32:14,580
the libertarian perspective or the left
 

18893
05:32:14,580 --> 05:32:17,030
the libertarian perspective or the left
left libertarian perspective would say

18894
05:32:17,030 --> 05:32:17,040
left libertarian perspective would say
 

18895
05:32:17,040 --> 05:32:19,070
left libertarian perspective would say
is it really a good idea to have

18896

oligarchy and it's like the opposite

18906
05:32:30,530 --> 05:32:30,540
oligarchy and it's like the opposite
 

18907
05:32:30,540 --> 05:32:31,430
oligarchy and it's like the opposite
that's why I mentioned it's like the

18908
05:32:31,430 --> 05:32:31,440
that's why I mentioned it's like the
 

18909
05:32:31,440 --> 05:32:32,690
that's why I mentioned it's like the
opposite of business plots and they

18910
05:32:32,690 --> 05:32:32,700
opposite of business plots and they
 

18911
05:32:32,700 --> 05:32:35,750
opposite of business plots and they
pulled on that thread Okay so

18912
05:32:35,750 --> 05:32:35,760
pulled on that thread Okay so
 

18913
05:32:35,760 --> 05:32:37,730
pulled on that thread Okay so
um the the macro explanation that I have

18914
05:32:37,730 --> 05:32:37,740
um the the macro explanation that I have
 

18915
05:32:37,740 --> 05:32:39,410
um the the macro explanation that I have
for this future is our past thesis and

18916
05:32:39,410 --> 05:32:39,420
for this future is our past thesis and
 

18917
05:32:39,420 --> 05:32:40,610
for this future is our past thesis and
there's more it also gives some

18918
05:32:40,610 --> 05:32:40,620
there's more it also gives some
 

18919
05:32:40,620 --> 05:32:42,830
there's more it also gives some
predictions right if you go backwards in

18920
05:32:42,830 --> 05:32:42,840
predictions right if you go backwards in
 

18921
05:32:42,840 --> 05:32:46,368
predictions right if you go backwards in
time the U.S federalizes into many

time the U.S federalizes into many
 

18923
05:32:46,378 --> 05:32:48,288
time the U.S federalizes into many
individual states like before the Civil

and after they said the United States is
 

18929

18932
05:32:56,150 --> 05:32:56,160
rights to the states afterwards it was
 

18933
05:32:56,160 --> 05:32:57,948
rights to the states afterwards it was
just Federal Regulation of everything

just Federal Regulation of everything
 

18935
05:32:57,958 --> 05:33:00,170
just Federal Regulation of everything
as we go forwards in time you're seeing

18936
05:33:00,170 --> 05:33:00,180
as we go forwards in time you're seeing
 

18937
05:33:00,180 --> 05:33:03,110
as we go forwards in time you're seeing
States break away from the feds on gun

okay

18942
05:33:07,490 --> 05:33:07,500
okay
 

18943
05:33:07,500 --> 05:33:08,810
okay
um many other kinds of things you know

18944
05:33:08,810 --> 05:33:08,820
um many other kinds of things you know
 

18945
05:33:08,820 --> 05:33:11,628
um many other kinds of things you know
and now Florida for example has its own

18946
05:33:11,628 --> 05:33:11,638
and now Florida for example has its own
 

18947
05:33:11,638 --> 05:33:13,850
and now Florida for example has its own
guard that's like not uh a National

18948
05:33:13,850 --> 05:33:13,860
guard that's like not uh a National
 

18949
05:33:13,860 --> 05:33:15,590
guard that's like not uh a National
Guard but like a state guard other other

18950
05:33:15,590 --> 05:33:15,600
Guard but like a state guard other other
 

18951
05:33:15,600 --> 05:33:17,330
Guard but like a state guard other other
cities uh other states are doing this

18952
05:33:17,330 --> 05:33:17,340
cities uh other states are doing this
 

18953
05:33:17,340 --> 05:33:19,128
cities uh other states are doing this
and that's the force of decentralization

18954
05:33:19,128 --> 05:33:19,138
and that's the force of decentralization
 

18955
05:33:19,138 --> 05:33:21,708
and that's the force of decentralization
is saying that parallels yes in Reverse

18956
05:33:21,708 --> 05:33:21,718
is saying that parallels yes in Reverse
 

18957
05:33:21,718 --> 05:33:23,628
is saying that parallels yes in Reverse
in Reverse right so you're having before

18958
05:33:23,628 --> 05:33:23,638
in Reverse right so you're having before
 

18959
05:33:23,638 --> 05:33:25,730
in Reverse right so you're having before
make America States again

18960
05:33:25,730 --> 05:33:25,740
make America States again
 

18961
05:33:25,740 --> 05:33:27,890
make America States again
nice okay that's what's I think

18962
05:33:27,890 --> 05:33:27,900
nice okay that's what's I think
 

18963
05:33:27,900 --> 05:33:29,628
nice okay that's what's I think
happening right but I'm not saying I

18964
05:33:29,628 --> 05:33:29,638
happening right but I'm not saying I
 

18965
05:33:29,638 --> 05:33:31,190
happening right but I'm not saying I
well I think there's aspects of that

18966
05:33:31,190 --> 05:33:31,200
well I think there's aspects of that
 

18967
05:33:31,200 --> 05:33:32,270
well I think there's aspects of that
that are good there's aspects that are

18968
05:33:32,270 --> 05:33:32,280
that are good there's aspects that are
 

18969
05:33:32,280 --> 05:33:33,770
that are good there's aspects that are
bad but

18970
05:33:33,770 --> 05:33:33,780
bad but
 

18971
05:33:33,780 --> 05:33:35,270
bad but
um just like that's kind of the the

18972
05:33:35,270 --> 05:33:35,280
um just like that's kind of the the
 

18973
05:33:35,280 --> 05:33:36,410
um just like that's kind of the the
angle right

18974
05:33:36,410 --> 05:33:36,420
angle right
 

18975
05:33:36,420 --> 05:33:38,868
angle right
but then that's I mean from your

18976
05:33:38,868 --> 05:33:38,878
but then that's I mean from your
 

18977
05:33:38,878 --> 05:33:40,070
but then that's I mean from your
perspective that's probably not enough

18978
05:33:40,070 --> 05:33:40,080
perspective that's probably not enough
 

18979
05:33:40,080 --> 05:33:42,948
perspective that's probably not enough
right that's that's not um it's part of

18980
05:33:42,948 --> 05:33:42,958
right that's that's not um it's part of
 

18981
05:33:42,958 --> 05:33:44,690
right that's that's not um it's part of
the Future Let's just say whether I

18982
05:33:44,690 --> 05:33:44,700
the Future Let's just say whether I
 

18983
05:33:44,700 --> 05:33:46,310
the Future Let's just say whether I
think you said something trouble you

18984
05:33:46,310 --> 05:33:46,320
think you said something trouble you
 

18985
05:33:46,320 --> 05:33:47,810
think you said something trouble you
suggested all kinds of ways to build

18986
05:33:47,810 --> 05:33:47,820
suggested all kinds of ways to build
 

18987
05:33:47,820 --> 05:33:49,550
suggested all kinds of ways to build
different countries I think that's

18988
05:33:49,550 --> 05:33:49,560
different countries I think that's
 

18989
05:33:49,560 --> 05:33:51,230
different countries I think that's
probably one of them you said like start

18990
05:33:51,230 --> 05:33:51,240
probably one of them you said like start
 

18991
05:33:51,240 --> 05:33:53,868
probably one of them you said like start
micro micro countries or something like

18992
05:33:53,868 --> 05:33:53,878
micro micro countries or something like
 

18993
05:33:53,878 --> 05:33:55,368
micro micro countries or something like
this I forgot the terminology yeah

18994
05:33:55,368 --> 05:33:55,378
this I forgot the terminology yeah
 

18995
05:33:55,378 --> 05:33:58,070
this I forgot the terminology yeah
micronations yeah I actually think of

18996
05:33:58,070 --> 05:33:58,080
micronations yeah I actually think of
 

18997
05:33:58,080 --> 05:33:59,628
micronations yeah I actually think of
them as is better term as microstates

18998
05:33:59,628 --> 05:33:59,638
them as is better term as microstates
 

18999
05:33:59,638 --> 05:34:00,708
them as is better term as microstates
because they're actually not Nations

19000
05:34:00,708 --> 05:34:00,718
because they're actually not Nations
 

19001
05:34:00,718 --> 05:34:01,610
because they're actually not Nations
that's why they don't work but

19002
05:34:01,610 --> 05:34:01,620
that's why they don't work but
 

19003
05:34:01,620 --> 05:34:04,310
that's why they don't work but
microstates are better right uh coming

19004
05:34:04,310 --> 05:34:04,320
microstates are better right uh coming
 

19005
05:34:04,320 --> 05:34:05,270
microstates are better right uh coming
back to the difference between the

19006
05:34:05,270 --> 05:34:05,280
back to the difference between the
 

19007
05:34:05,280 --> 05:34:07,430
back to the difference between the
nation the state the nation is like

19008
05:34:07,430 --> 05:34:07,440
nation the state the nation is like
 

19009
05:34:07,440 --> 05:34:09,410
nation the state the nation is like
the nation state is a term that people

19010
05:34:09,410 --> 05:34:09,420
the nation state is a term that people
 

19011
05:34:09,420 --> 05:34:11,208
the nation state is a term that people
use without expanding it but Nation

19012
05:34:11,208 --> 05:34:11,218
use without expanding it but Nation
 

19013
05:34:11,218 --> 05:34:12,590
use without expanding it but Nation
comes from the same root word as like

19014
05:34:12,590 --> 05:34:12,600
comes from the same root word as like
 

19015
05:34:12,600 --> 05:34:14,510
comes from the same root word as like
natality so it's like common descent

19016
05:34:14,510 --> 05:34:14,520
natality so it's like common descent
 

19017
05:34:14,520 --> 05:34:16,490
natality so it's like common descent
common birth right common origin like

19018
05:34:16,490 --> 05:34:16,500
common birth right common origin like
 

19019
05:34:16,500 --> 05:34:18,288
common birth right common origin like
the Japanese Nation that's a group of

19020
05:34:18,288 --> 05:34:18,298
the Japanese Nation that's a group of
 

19021
05:34:18,298 --> 05:34:19,910
the Japanese Nation that's a group of
people that have you know come down from

19022
05:34:19,910 --> 05:34:19,920
people that have you know come down from
 

19023
05:34:19,920 --> 05:34:21,948
people that have you know come down from
history right hence nationalism yeah

19024
05:34:21,948 --> 05:34:21,958
history right hence nationalism yeah
 

19025
05:34:21,958 --> 05:34:23,270
history right hence nationalism yeah
whereas the state is like the

19026
05:34:23,270 --> 05:34:23,280
whereas the state is like the
 

19027
05:34:23,280 --> 05:34:24,470
whereas the state is like the
administrative layer above them it's

19028
05:34:24,470 --> 05:34:24,480
administrative layer above them it's
 

19029
05:34:24,480 --> 05:34:26,448
administrative layer above them it's
like labor and capital like labor and

19030
05:34:26,448 --> 05:34:26,458
like labor and capital like labor and
 

19031
05:34:26,458 --> 05:34:28,910
like labor and capital like labor and
management okay the American state stood

19032
05:34:28,910 --> 05:34:28,920
management okay the American state stood
 

19033
05:34:28,920 --> 05:34:31,610
management okay the American state stood
over the Japanese nation in 1946 after

19034
05:34:31,610 --> 05:34:31,620
over the Japanese nation in 1946 after
 

19035
05:34:31,620 --> 05:34:33,650
over the Japanese nation in 1946 after
the war right oh so you weren't talking

19036
05:34:33,650 --> 05:34:33,660
the war right oh so you weren't talking
 

19037
05:34:33,660 --> 05:34:35,030
the war right oh so you weren't talking
about traditionally you know that that

19038
05:34:35,030 --> 05:34:35,040
about traditionally you know that that
 

19039
05:34:35,040 --> 05:34:36,190
about traditionally you know that that
doesn't matter

19040
05:34:36,190 --> 05:34:36,200
doesn't matter
 

19041
05:34:36,200 --> 05:34:39,590
doesn't matter
like I thought you meant nation is a

19042
05:34:39,590 --> 05:34:39,600
like I thought you meant nation is a
 

19043
05:34:39,600 --> 05:34:40,850
like I thought you meant nation is a
thing that carries across the

19044
05:34:40,850 --> 05:34:40,860
thing that carries across the
 

19045
05:34:40,860 --> 05:34:42,288
thing that carries across the
generations that there's a tradition

19046
05:34:42,288 --> 05:34:42,298
generations that there's a tradition
 

19047
05:34:42,298 --> 05:34:44,270
generations that there's a tradition
there's a culture and so on and state is

19048
05:34:44,270 --> 05:34:44,280

19201
05:37:04,440 --> 05:37:07,250
unsuccessful calls for wealth seizures
in the U.S back then we saw FDR's

19202
05:37:07,250 --> 05:37:07,260
in the U.S back then we saw FDR's
 

19203
05:37:07,260 --> 05:37:08,810
in the U.S back then we saw FDR's
executive order 6102 which was a

19204
05:37:08,810 --> 05:37:08,820
executive order 6102 which was a
 

19205
05:37:08,820 --> 05:37:10,910
executive order 6102 which was a
successful seizure of gold I expect we

19206
05:37:10,910 --> 05:37:10,920
successful seizure of gold I expect we
 

19207
05:37:10,920 --> 05:37:12,590
successful seizure of gold I expect we
may see something like that an attempted

19208
05:37:12,590 --> 05:37:12,600
may see something like that an attempted
 

19209
05:37:12,600 --> 05:37:14,330
may see something like that an attempted
seizure of digital gold and I think

19210
05:37:14,330 --> 05:37:14,340
seizure of digital gold and I think
 

19211
05:37:14,340 --> 05:37:16,310
seizure of digital gold and I think
that'll be one of the things that

19212
05:37:16,310 --> 05:37:16,320
that'll be one of the things that
 

19213
05:37:16,320 --> 05:37:18,170
that'll be one of the things that
individual states like Florida or Texas

19214
05:37:18,170 --> 05:37:18,180
individual states like Florida or Texas
 

19215
05:37:18,180 --> 05:37:20,628
individual states like Florida or Texas
may not enforce that and I think that's

19216
05:37:20,628 --> 05:37:20,638
may not enforce that and I think that's
 

19217
05:37:20,638 --> 05:37:22,550
may not enforce that and I think that's
actually the kind of thing where you

19218
05:37:22,550 --> 05:37:22,560
actually the kind of thing where you
 

19219
05:37:22,560 --> 05:37:24,590
actually the kind of thing where you
could see you know like a breakup

19220
05:37:24,590 --> 05:37:24,600
could see you know like a breakup
 

19221
05:37:24,600 --> 05:37:27,050
could see you know like a breakup
potential in the future right one other

19222
05:37:27,050 --> 05:37:27,060
potential in the future right one other
 

19223
05:37:27,060 --> 05:37:29,810
potential in the future right one other
thing that kind of Rhymes is in many

19224
05:37:29,810 --> 05:37:29,820
thing that kind of Rhymes is in many
 

19225
05:37:29,820 --> 05:37:32,390
thing that kind of Rhymes is in many
ways like the modern U.S establishment

19226
05:37:32,390 --> 05:37:32,400
ways like the modern U.S establishment
 

19227
05:37:32,400 --> 05:37:35,390

right and that's a nice way to think

19292
05:38:45,230 --> 05:38:45,240
right and that's a nice way to think
 

19293
05:38:45,240 --> 05:38:46,310
right and that's a nice way to think
about

19299
05:38:50,878 --> 05:38:52,368
know any mental model or something like
that that's why I say as a Sci-Fi

19300
05:38:52,368 --> 05:38:52,378
that that's why I say as a Sci-Fi
 

19301
05:38:52,378 --> 05:38:53,930
that that's why I say as a Sci-Fi
scenario it's like a scenario one could

19302
05:38:53,930 --> 05:38:53,940
scenario it's like a scenario one could
 

19303
05:38:53,940 --> 05:38:56,628
scenario it's like a scenario one could
contemplate right where the new version

19304
05:38:56,628 --> 05:38:56,638
contemplate right where the new version
 

19305

has I mean the Chinese Communists do not

19306
05:38:59,030 --> 05:38:59,040

style transfer you can almost see
because the Socialist realism style of

19592

because the Socialist realism style of
 

19593
05:44:01,020 --> 05:44:03,350
because the Socialist realism style of
like the muscular brawny worker very

19594
05:44:03,350 --> 05:44:03,360
like the muscular brawny worker very
 

19595
05:44:03,360 --> 05:44:04,850
like the muscular brawny worker very
similar to like the style of the Aryan

19596

05:44:06,948 --> 05:44:06,958
Superman you know like pointing at the
 

19599
05:44:06,958 --> 05:44:08,330
Superman you know like pointing at the
Vermin or whatever and then there's the

19600
05:44:08,330 --> 05:44:08,340
Vermin or whatever and then there's the
 

19601
05:44:08,340 --> 05:44:10,548
Vermin or whatever and then there's the
crappy open source version that tries to

19602
05:44:10,548 --> 05:44:10,558
crappy open source version that tries to
 

19603
05:44:10,558 --> 05:44:13,190
crappy open source version that tries to
copy which is Mussolini yeah that's just

19604
05:44:13,190 --> 05:44:13,200
copy which is Mussolini yeah that's just
 

19605
05:44:13,200 --> 05:44:15,288
copy which is Mussolini yeah that's just
like that does the same exact thing but

19606
05:44:15,288 --> 05:44:15,298
like that does the same exact thing but
 

19607
05:44:15,298 --> 05:44:17,090
like that does the same exact thing but
does it kind of shittier so right anyway

19608
05:44:17,090 --> 05:44:17,100
does it kind of shittier so right anyway
 

19609
05:44:17,100 --> 05:44:19,190
does it kind of shittier so right anyway
so my main thing about this is basically

19610
05:44:19,190 --> 05:44:19,200
so my main thing about this is basically
 

19611
05:44:19,200 --> 05:44:22,610
so my main thing about this is basically
like trying to fight your factory in the

19612
05:44:22,610 --> 05:44:22,620
like trying to fight your factory in the
 

19613
05:44:22,620 --> 05:44:24,170
like trying to fight your factory in the
physical world is probably not going to

19614
05:44:24,170 --> 05:44:24,180
physical world is probably not going to
 

19615
05:44:24,180 --> 05:44:27,288
physical world is probably not going to
work people are I think overconfident on

19616
05:44:27,288 --> 05:44:27,298
work people are I think overconfident on
 

19617
05:44:27,298 --> 05:44:29,628
work people are I think overconfident on
this stuff right with that said I think

19618
05:44:29,628 --> 05:44:29,638
this stuff right with that said I think
 

19619
05:44:29,638 --> 05:44:31,970
this stuff right with that said I think
we want to at all you know the future is

19620
05:44:31,970 --> 05:44:31,980
we want to at all you know the future is
 

19621
05:44:31,980 --> 05:44:34,190
we want to at all you know the future is
not yet determined right at All Odds you

19622
05:44:34,190 --> 05:44:34,200
not yet determined right at All Odds you
 

19623
05:44:34,200 --> 05:44:36,410
not yet determined right at All Odds you
know we want to avoid a hot war between

19624
05:44:36,410 --> 05:44:36,420
know we want to avoid a hot war between
 

19625
05:44:36,420 --> 05:44:38,690
know we want to avoid a hot war between
like I mean a hop war between the US and

19626
05:44:38,690 --> 05:44:38,700
like I mean a hop war between the US and
 

19627
05:44:38,700 --> 05:44:40,548
like I mean a hop war between the US and
China would would be

19628
05:44:40,548 --> 05:44:40,558
China would would be
 

19629
05:44:40,558 --> 05:44:42,530
China would would be
do you think it's possible that we get a

19630
05:44:42,530 --> 05:44:42,540
do you think it's possible that we get a
 

19631
05:44:42,540 --> 05:44:44,270
do you think it's possible that we get a
war we're doing these things like Pelosi

19632
05:44:44,270 --> 05:44:44,280
war we're doing these things like Pelosi
 

19633
05:44:44,280 --> 05:44:47,690
war we're doing these things like Pelosi
going to Taiwan and trying to trying to

19634
05:44:47,690 --> 05:44:47,700
going to Taiwan and trying to trying to
 

19635
05:44:47,700 --> 05:44:50,690
going to Taiwan and trying to trying to
cause something like look again this is

19636
05:44:50,690 --> 05:44:50,700
cause something like look again this is
 

19637
05:44:50,700 --> 05:44:52,010
cause something like look again this is
one of these things which is complicated

19638
05:44:52,010 --> 05:44:52,020
one of these things which is complicated
 

19639
05:44:52,020 --> 05:44:54,708
one of these things which is complicated
because obviously if you're there's more

19640
05:44:54,708 --> 05:44:54,718
because obviously if you're there's more
 

19641
05:44:54,718 --> 05:44:56,150
because obviously if you're there's more
than one perspective on this right again

19642
05:44:56,150 --> 05:44:56,160
than one perspective on this right again
 

19643
05:44:56,160 --> 05:44:58,010
than one perspective on this right again
you've got the U.S establishment the U.S

one perspective on this okay if you're

19652
05:45:05,448 --> 05:45:05,458
one perspective on this okay if you're
 

19653
05:45:05,458 --> 05:45:07,250
one perspective on this okay if you're
you know China's one of China's many

19654
05:45:07,250 --> 05:45:07,260
you know China's one of China's many
 

19655
05:45:07,260 --> 05:45:08,330
you know China's one of China's many
neighbors

19656
05:45:08,330 --> 05:45:08,340

20381
05:58:08,940 --> 05:58:10,010
New York Times like you start to see a
pattern here where the guys who are

20382
05:58:10,010 --> 05:58:10,020
pattern here where the guys who are
 

20383
05:58:10,020 --> 05:58:12,230
pattern here where the guys who are
being platformed and given a voice are

20384
05:58:12,230 --> 05:58:12,240
being platformed and given a voice are
 

20385
05:58:12,240 --> 05:58:13,850

these guys who end up being like far
left you know lunatics right and I think

20388
05:58:16,610 --> 05:58:16,620
left you know lunatics right and I think
 

20389
05:58:16,620 --> 05:58:18,590
left you know lunatics right and I think
part of the issue here is you know the

20390
05:58:18,590 --> 05:58:18,600
part of the issue here is you know the
 

20391
05:58:18,600 --> 05:58:20,570
part of the issue here is you know the
thing about how Communists don't

20392
05:58:20,570 --> 05:58:20,580
thing about how Communists don't
 

20393
05:58:20,580 --> 05:58:22,610
thing about how Communists don't
understand self-interest nationalists

20394
05:58:22,610 --> 05:58:22,620
understand self-interest nationalists
 

20395
05:58:22,620 --> 05:58:25,128
understand self-interest nationalists
don't understand other interests

20396
05:58:25,128 --> 05:58:25,138
don't understand other interests
 

20397
05:58:25,138 --> 05:58:28,128
don't understand other interests
and so Nationals are more obvious

20398
05:58:28,128 --> 05:58:28,138
and so Nationals are more obvious
 

20399
05:58:28,138 --> 05:58:29,390
and so Nationals are more obvious
isn't that good I thought it was good

20400
05:58:29,390 --> 05:58:29,400
isn't that good I thought it was good
 

20401
05:58:29,400 --> 05:58:31,190
isn't that good I thought it was good
it's pretty good right pretty good so

20402
05:58:31,190 --> 05:58:31,200
it's pretty good right pretty good so
 

20403
05:58:31,200 --> 05:58:33,708
it's pretty good right pretty good so
the Nationalist is very obvious in the

20404
05:58:33,708 --> 05:58:33,718
the Nationalist is very obvious in the
 

20405
05:58:33,718 --> 05:58:35,510
the Nationalist is very obvious in the
sense of like they're for the Aryans

20406
05:58:35,510 --> 05:58:35,520
sense of like they're for the Aryans
 

20407
05:58:35,520 --> 05:58:37,368
sense of like they're for the Aryans
they're not even for like the Slavs or

20408

constructed a different ideology
um you know then like he might have

um you know then like he might have
 

20417

right so leaving those aside
 

20587
06:02:01,500 --> 06:02:03,350
right so leaving those aside
the point is that most your audience is

20588
06:02:03,350 --> 06:02:03,360
the point is that most your audience is
 

20589
06:02:03,360 --> 06:02:06,350
the point is that most your audience is
sort of on guard vaccinated in a sense

20590
06:02:06,350 --> 06:02:06,360
sort of on guard vaccinated in a sense
 

20591
06:02:06,360 --> 06:02:10,070
sort of on guard vaccinated in a sense
right versus Z and Putin and Trump right

20592
06:02:10,070 --> 06:02:10,080
right versus Z and Putin and Trump right
 

20593
06:02:10,080 --> 06:02:11,750
right versus Z and Putin and Trump right
like they have they know the counter

20594
06:02:11,750 --> 06:02:11,760
like they have they know the counter
 

20595
06:02:11,760 --> 06:02:14,090
like they have they know the counter
arguments and so on and so forth okay in

20596
06:02:14,090 --> 06:02:14,100
arguments and so on and so forth okay in
 

20597
06:02:14,100 --> 06:02:15,048
arguments and so on and so forth okay in
which case

20598
06:02:15,048 --> 06:02:15,058
which case
 

20599
06:02:15,058 --> 06:02:17,090
which case
I wouldn't think interviewing them would

20600
06:02:17,090 --> 06:02:17,100
I wouldn't think interviewing them would
 

20601
06:02:17,100 --> 06:02:20,510
I wouldn't think interviewing them would
be like that big a deal relatively

20602
06:02:20,510 --> 06:02:20,520
be like that big a deal relatively
 

20603
06:02:20,520 --> 06:02:21,890
be like that big a deal relatively
because there's so much other coverage

20604
06:02:21,890 --> 06:02:21,900
because there's so much other coverage
 

20605
06:02:21,900 --> 06:02:24,230
because there's so much other coverage
and so on out there it's it's I think

20606
06:02:24,230 --> 06:02:24,240
and so on out there it's it's I think
 

20607
06:02:24,240 --> 06:02:26,810
and so on out there it's it's I think
it's probably okay however for something

20608
06:02:26,810 --> 06:02:26,820
it's probably okay however for something
 

20609
06:02:26,820 --> 06:02:28,010
it's probably okay however for something
like

20610
06:02:28,010 --> 06:02:28,020
like
 

20611
06:02:28,020 --> 06:02:30,470
like
um you know when what John Reed was

20612
06:02:30,470 --> 06:02:30,480
um you know when what John Reed was
 

20613
06:02:30,480 --> 06:02:31,910
um you know when what John Reed was
doing and so on when he was a sole

20614
06:02:31,910 --> 06:02:31,920
doing and so on when he was a sole
 

20615
06:02:31,920 --> 06:02:33,350
doing and so on when he was a sole
source of information about the Russian

20616

06:02:35,218 --> 06:02:37,730
Revolution yes right that's different
that's different right so so it's

20620
06:02:37,730 --> 06:02:37,740
that's different right so so it's
 

20621
06:02:37,740 --> 06:02:39,170
that's different right so so it's
something about it kind of gets back to

20622
06:02:39,170 --> 06:02:39,180
something about it kind of gets back to
 

20623
06:02:39,180 --> 06:02:40,610
something about it kind of gets back to
the the competitive environment and so

20624
06:02:40,610 --> 06:02:40,620
the the competitive environment and so
 

20625
06:02:40,620 --> 06:02:42,890
the the competitive environment and so
on there's no dearth of folks who are

20626
06:02:42,890 --> 06:02:42,900
on there's no dearth of folks who are
 

20627
06:02:42,900 --> 06:02:45,948
on there's no dearth of folks who are
writing critical coverage of these these

20628
06:02:45,948 --> 06:02:45,958
writing critical coverage of these these
 

20629
06:02:45,958 --> 06:02:48,288
writing critical coverage of these these

that was insufficient then you might
need more of it right right

um but it's invisible right well that's
why I think studying the knowns the

20710
06:04:10,310 --> 06:04:10,320
why I think studying the knowns the
 

20711
06:04:10,320 --> 06:04:12,048
why I think studying the knowns the
people that are known can help you

20712
06:04:12,048 --> 06:04:12,058
people that are known can help you

generalize

20714
06:04:13,310 --> 06:04:13,320
generalize
 

20715
06:04:13,320 --> 06:04:16,190
generalize
uh to the way human nature is and then

20716
06:04:16,190 --> 06:04:16,200
uh to the way human nature is and then
 

20717
06:04:16,200 --> 06:04:18,350
uh to the way human nature is and then
you start to question are the same kind

20718
06:04:18,350 --> 06:04:18,360
you start to question are the same kind
 

20719
06:04:18,360 --> 06:04:21,830
you start to question are the same kind
of humans existing in places that uh

20720
06:04:21,830 --> 06:04:21,840
of humans existing in places that uh
 

20721
06:04:21,840 --> 06:04:24,830
of humans existing in places that uh
wield power and you can assume they are

20722
06:04:24,830 --> 06:04:24,840
wield power and you can assume they are
 

20723
06:04:24,840 --> 06:04:26,990
wield power and you can assume they are
they do exist there and then you can

20724
06:04:26,990 --> 06:04:27,000
they do exist there and then you can
 

20725
06:04:27,000 --> 06:04:28,670
they do exist there and then you can
start to infer that's right and ask

20726
06:04:28,670 --> 06:04:28,680
start to infer that's right and ask
 

20727
06:04:28,680 --> 06:04:31,010
start to infer that's right and ask
questions so this is kind of what I try

20728
06:04:31,010 --> 06:04:31,020
questions so this is kind of what I try
 

20729
06:04:31,020 --> 06:04:33,288
questions so this is kind of what I try
to do is I'm like what is the dark

20730
06:04:33,288 --> 06:04:33,298
to do is I'm like what is the dark
 

20731
06:04:33,298 --> 06:04:35,090
to do is I'm like what is the dark
matter what is the question that's not

20732
06:04:35,090 --> 06:04:35,100
matter what is the question that's not
 

20733
06:04:35,100 --> 06:04:38,090
matter what is the question that's not
being asked or what happens right and so

20734
06:04:38,090 --> 06:04:38,100
being asked or what happens right and so
 

20735
06:04:38,100 --> 06:04:39,650
being asked or what happens right and so
um you know that's not to say that you

20736
06:04:39,650 --> 06:04:39,660
um you know that's not to say that you
 

20737
06:04:39,660 --> 06:04:41,868
um you know that's not to say that you
you need to be so anti-memetic that you

20738
06:04:41,868 --> 06:04:41,878
you need to be so anti-memetic that you
 

20739
06:04:41,878 --> 06:04:43,670
you need to be so anti-memetic that you
only do that but I think you need to do

20740
06:04:43,670 --> 06:04:43,680
only do that but I think you need to do
 

20741
06:04:43,680 --> 06:04:45,708
only do that but I think you need to do
that as well as understand what is good

20742
06:04:45,708 --> 06:04:45,718
that as well as understand what is good
 

20743
06:04:45,718 --> 06:04:47,390
that as well as understand what is good
about the conventional wisdom and you

20744
06:04:47,390 --> 06:04:47,400
about the conventional wisdom and you
 

20745
06:04:47,400 --> 06:04:48,890
about the conventional wisdom and you
know for example if you notice a lot of

20746
06:04:48,890 --> 06:04:48,900
know for example if you notice a lot of
 

20747
06:04:48,900 --> 06:04:51,410
know for example if you notice a lot of
what I talk about is like the V1 V2 V3

20748
06:04:51,410 --> 06:04:51,420
what I talk about is like the V1 V2 V3
 

20749
06:04:51,420 --> 06:04:54,048
what I talk about is like the V1 V2 V3
or as critical as I am of let's say the

20750
06:04:54,048 --> 06:04:54,058
or as critical as I am of let's say the
 

20751
06:04:54,058 --> 06:04:56,390
or as critical as I am of let's say the
FDA I recognize that people want a

20752
06:04:56,390 --> 06:04:56,400
FDA I recognize that people want a
 

20753
06:04:56,400 --> 06:04:57,948
FDA I recognize that people want a
regulated Marketplace and how do we do

20754
06:04:57,948 --> 06:04:57,958
regulated Marketplace and how do we do
 

20755
06:04:57,958 --> 06:04:59,570
regulated Marketplace and how do we do
better as critical as I can be of the

20756
06:04:59,570 --> 06:04:59,580
better as critical as I can be of the
 

20757
06:04:59,580 --> 06:05:02,030
better as critical as I can be of the
FED I recognize that some kind of

20758
06:05:02,030 --> 06:05:02,040
FED I recognize that some kind of
 

20759
06:05:02,040 --> 06:05:04,850
FED I recognize that some kind of
monetary policy is necessary and Satoshi

20760
06:05:04,850 --> 06:05:04,860
monetary policy is necessary and Satoshi
 

20761
06:05:04,860 --> 06:05:07,368
monetary policy is necessary and Satoshi
came up with a better one right

20762
06:05:07,368 --> 06:05:07,378
came up with a better one right
 

20763
06:05:07,378 --> 06:05:09,650
came up with a better one right
um as harsh as one can be a Critic of

20764
06:05:09,650 --> 06:05:09,660
um as harsh as one can be a Critic of
 

20765
06:05:09,660 --> 06:05:11,090
um as harsh as one can be a Critic of
the current system

20766
06:05:11,090 --> 06:05:11,100
the current system
 

20767
06:05:11,100 --> 06:05:13,490
the current system
it is really incumbent as difficult as

20768
06:05:13,490 --> 06:05:13,500
it is really incumbent as difficult as
 

20769
06:05:13,500 --> 06:05:15,350
it is really incumbent as difficult as
it is upon one to come with a better

20770
06:05:15,350 --> 06:05:15,360
it is upon one to come with a better
 

20771
06:05:15,360 --> 06:05:17,090
it is upon one to come with a better
version just like Academia as much as I

20772
06:05:17,090 --> 06:05:17,100
version just like Academia as much as I
 

20773
06:05:17,100 --> 06:05:19,670
version just like Academia as much as I
think current science is corrupted what

20774
06:05:19,670 --> 06:05:19,680
think current science is corrupted what
 

20775
06:05:19,680 --> 06:05:21,410
think current science is corrupted what
I propose is a way to actually improve

20776
06:05:21,410 --> 06:05:21,420
I propose is a way to actually improve
 

20777
06:05:21,420 --> 06:05:24,170
I propose is a way to actually improve
on that and actually any any true

20778
06:05:24,170 --> 06:05:24,180
on that and actually any any true
 

20779
06:05:24,180 --> 06:05:25,610
on that and actually any any true
scientists say yes I want my work to be

20780
06:05:25,610 --> 06:05:25,620
scientists say yes I want my work to be
 

20781
06:05:25,620 --> 06:05:27,650
scientists say yes I want my work to be
reproducible yes I want citations to be

20782
06:05:27,650 --> 06:05:27,660
reproducible yes I want citations to be
 

20783
06:05:27,660 --> 06:05:28,850
reproducible yes I want citations to be
important statements and so on and so

20784
06:05:28,850 --> 06:05:28,860
important statements and so on and so
 

20785
06:05:28,860 --> 06:05:30,048
important statements and so on and so
forth and we don't have to get everybody

20786
06:05:30,048 --> 06:05:30,058
forth and we don't have to get everybody
 

20787
06:05:30,058 --> 06:05:31,430
forth and we don't have to get everybody
to agree with that but just enough to

20788
06:05:31,430 --> 06:05:31,440
to agree with that but just enough to
 

20789
06:05:31,440 --> 06:05:32,750
to agree with that but just enough to
build that better version and not

20790
06:05:32,750 --> 06:05:32,760
build that better version and not
 

20791
06:05:32,760 --> 06:05:35,030
build that better version and not
regress yeah there's a there's an

framework let me ask you at a high level

20796
06:05:41,868 --> 06:05:41,878
framework let me ask you at a high level
 

20797
06:05:41,878 --> 06:05:45,230
framework let me ask you at a high level
about social media because you are one

20798

prominent users to communicate your
 

20803
06:05:48,958 --> 06:05:51,890
prominent users to communicate your
wisdom I use Twitter I wouldn't I don't

20804
06:05:51,890 --> 06:05:51,900
wisdom I use Twitter I wouldn't I don't
 

20805
06:05:51,900 --> 06:05:52,548
wisdom I use Twitter I wouldn't I don't
really think of it as quick

20806
06:05:52,548 --> 06:05:52,558
really think of it as quick
 

20807
06:05:52,558 --> 06:05:54,288
really think of it as quick
communicating my wisdom per se or

20808
06:05:54,288 --> 06:05:54,298
communicating my wisdom per se or
 

20809
06:05:54,298 --> 06:05:56,510

might use GitHub as a scratch pad for

20812
06:05:58,910 --> 06:05:58,920
might use GitHub as a scratch pad for
 

20813
06:05:58,920 --> 06:06:01,430
might use GitHub as a scratch pad for
just kind of floating Concepts and you

20814
06:06:01,430 --> 06:06:01,440
just kind of floating Concepts and you
 

20815
06:06:01,440 --> 06:06:02,868
just kind of floating Concepts and you
know I've got okay here's a frame on

20816
06:06:02,868 --> 06:06:02,878
know I've got okay here's a frame on
 

20817
06:06:02,878 --> 06:06:04,250
know I've got okay here's a frame on
things let me kind of put it out there

20818
06:06:04,250 --> 06:06:04,260
things let me kind of put it out there
 

20819
06:06:04,260 --> 06:06:05,750
things let me kind of put it out there
and see what people think get some

20820
06:06:05,750 --> 06:06:05,760
and see what people think get some
 

20821
06:06:05,760 --> 06:06:07,310
and see what people think get some
feedback and so on don't you think it

20822
06:06:07,310 --> 06:06:07,320
feedback and so on don't you think it
 

20823
06:06:07,320 --> 06:06:09,048
feedback and so on don't you think it
has a lasting impact that the your

20824
06:06:09,048 --> 06:06:09,058
has a lasting impact that the your
 

20825
06:06:09,058 --> 06:06:11,750
has a lasting impact that the your
scratch book I think it's good but

20826
06:06:11,750 --> 06:06:11,760
scratch book I think it's good but
 

20827
06:06:11,760 --> 06:06:13,128
scratch book I think it's good but
basically like

20828
06:06:13,128 --> 06:06:13,138
basically like
 

20829
06:06:13,138 --> 06:06:14,868
basically like
um if I say that's what's my primary

20830
06:06:14,868 --> 06:06:14,878
um if I say that's what's my primary
 

20831

scratch pad for me to kind of put some

20834
06:06:19,310 --> 06:06:19,320
scratch pad for me to kind of put some
 

20835
06:06:19,320 --> 06:06:21,470
scratch pad for me to kind of put some
Concepts out there you know iterate on

20836
06:06:21,470 --> 06:06:21,480
Concepts out there you know iterate on
 

20837
06:06:21,480 --> 06:06:22,970
Concepts out there you know iterate on
them get feedback on them and so on and

20838
06:06:22,970 --> 06:06:22,980
them get feedback on them and so on and
 

20839
06:06:22,980 --> 06:06:24,650
them get feedback on them and so on and
so forth do you think it's possible that

20840
06:06:24,650 --> 06:06:24,660
so forth do you think it's possible that

on the world on the world I don't uh so
possible is it possible

20848
06:06:35,990 --> 06:06:36,000
possible is it possible
 

20849
06:06:36,000 --> 06:06:37,970
possible is it possible
um well my tweets received me it's a

20850
06:06:37,970 --> 06:06:37,980
um well my tweets received me it's a
 

20851
06:06:37,980 --> 06:06:39,530
um well my tweets received me it's a
good question I I think the network

20852
06:06:39,530 --> 06:06:39,540
good question I I think the network
 

20853
06:06:39,540 --> 06:06:43,128
good question I I think the network
state will be I think important uh or I

20854
06:06:43,128 --> 06:06:43,138
state will be I think important uh or I

fullness of time with a lot of time and
 

20869
06:06:59,400 --> 06:07:02,030
fullness of time with a lot of time and
effort to actually get a state right and

20870
06:07:02,030 --> 06:07:02,040
effort to actually get a state right and
 

20871
06:07:02,040 --> 06:07:04,010
effort to actually get a state right and
uh you know as I mentioned earlier a lot

20872
06:07:04,010 --> 06:07:04,020
uh you know as I mentioned earlier a lot
 

20873
06:07:04,020 --> 06:07:05,448
uh you know as I mentioned earlier a lot
of countries are small countries but I

20874

06:07:30,958 --> 06:07:32,570
Catalonia guys are a committed
catalonian nationalists so Catalonia is

20902
06:07:32,570 --> 06:07:32,580
catalonian nationalists so Catalonia is
 

20903
06:07:32,580 --> 06:07:34,548
catalonian nationalists so Catalonia is
region of Spain right

20904
06:07:34,548 --> 06:07:34,558
region of Spain right
 

20905
06:07:34,558 --> 06:07:37,670
region of Spain right
um the the thing is that

20906
06:07:37,670 --> 06:07:37,680
um the the thing is that
 

20907
06:07:37,680 --> 06:07:40,850
um the the thing is that
again V1 V2 V3 the nation state is V2

20908
06:07:40,850 --> 06:07:40,860
again V1 V2 V3 the nation state is V2
 

20909
06:07:40,860 --> 06:07:43,490
again V1 V2 V3 the nation state is V2
and it beat the city-state which is like

20910
06:07:43,490 --> 06:07:43,500
and it beat the city-state which is like
 

20911
06:07:43,500 --> 06:07:44,690
and it beat the city-state which is like
V1

20912
06:07:44,690 --> 06:07:44,700
V1
 

20913
06:07:44,700 --> 06:07:46,190
V1
and the network State I think of as a

20914
06:07:46,190 --> 06:07:46,200
and the network State I think of as a
 

20915
06:07:46,200 --> 06:07:47,690
and the network State I think of as a
potential V3 which combines aspects of

20916
06:07:47,690 --> 06:07:47,700
potential V3 which combines aspects of
 

20917
06:07:47,700 --> 06:07:51,470
potential V3 which combines aspects of
V1 and V2 so Catalonia or The Basque

20918
06:07:51,470 --> 06:07:51,480
V1 and V2 so Catalonia or The Basque
 

20919
06:07:51,480 --> 06:07:54,590
V1 and V2 so Catalonia or The Basque
region these are underneath the nation

right so what do they do well one answer

20948
06:08:25,190 --> 06:08:25,200
right so what do they do well one answer
 

20949
06:08:25,200 --> 06:08:27,770
right so what do they do well one answer
is they just submit to the Spanish state

20950
06:08:27,770 --> 06:08:27,780
is they just submit to the Spanish state
 

20951

but if you're parallel processing you

21038
06:09:55,548 --> 06:09:55,558
but if you're parallel processing you
 

21039
06:09:55,558 --> 06:09:58,190
but if you're parallel processing you
don't have the all-in-one bucket aspect

21040
06:09:58,190 --> 06:09:58,200
don't have the all-in-one bucket aspect
 

21041
06:09:58,200 --> 06:10:00,590
don't have the all-in-one bucket aspect
of I must win here and the guy on the

21042
06:10:00,590 --> 06:10:00,600
of I must win here and the guy on the
 

21043
06:10:00,600 --> 06:10:01,850
of I must win here and the guy on the
other side is like I must win you have

21044
06:10:01,850 --> 06:10:01,860
other side is like I must win you have
 

21045
06:10:01,860 --> 06:10:03,530
other side is like I must win you have
optionality you can you can have

21046
06:10:03,530 --> 06:10:03,540
optionality you can you can have
 

21047
06:10:03,540 --> 06:10:05,030
optionality you can you can have
multiple different nodes around the

21048
06:10:05,030 --> 06:10:05,040
multiple different nodes around the
 

21049
06:10:05,040 --> 06:10:05,930
multiple different nodes around the
world just like there's multiple

21050
06:10:05,930 --> 06:10:05,940
world just like there's multiple
 

21051
06:10:05,940 --> 06:10:07,430
world just like there's multiple
chinatowns you could have multiple

21052
06:10:07,430 --> 06:10:07,440
chinatowns you could have multiple
 

21053
06:10:07,440 --> 06:10:10,610
chinatowns you could have multiple
catalonian towns right and uh some

21054
06:10:10,610 --> 06:10:10,620
catalonian towns right and uh some
 

21055
06:10:10,620 --> 06:10:12,170
catalonian towns right and uh some
places you might be able to just buy an

21056
06:10:12,170 --> 06:10:12,180
places you might be able to just buy an
 

21057
06:10:12,180 --> 06:10:14,090
places you might be able to just buy an
island and that becomes you know the new

21058
06:10:14,090 --> 06:10:14,100
island and that becomes you know the new
 

21059
06:10:14,100 --> 06:10:15,948
island and that becomes you know the new
Catalonia right

21060
06:10:15,948 --> 06:10:15,958
Catalonia right
 

21061
06:10:15,958 --> 06:10:17,270
Catalonia right
um just like in I think there's a

21062
06:10:17,270 --> 06:10:17,280
um just like in I think there's a
 

21063
06:10:17,280 --> 06:10:20,448
um just like in I think there's a
there's a region called New Caledonia

21064
06:10:20,448 --> 06:10:20,458
there's a region called New Caledonia
 

21065
06:10:20,458 --> 06:10:22,430
there's a region called New Caledonia
um and that's in the Southwest Pacific

21066
06:10:22,430 --> 06:10:22,440
um and that's in the Southwest Pacific
 

21067
06:10:22,440 --> 06:10:24,230
um and that's in the Southwest Pacific
so maybe maybe new Catalonia is

21068
06:10:24,230 --> 06:10:24,240
so maybe maybe new Catalonia is
 

21069
06:10:24,240 --> 06:10:25,368
so maybe maybe new Catalonia is
somewhere else right so if you're

21070
06:10:25,368 --> 06:10:25,378
somewhere else right so if you're
 

21071
06:10:25,378 --> 06:10:27,230
somewhere else right so if you're
flexible in that now of course a bunch

21072
06:10:27,230 --> 06:10:27,240
flexible in that now of course a bunch
 

21073
06:10:27,240 --> 06:10:29,510
flexible in that now of course a bunch
of people will immediately say they'll

21074
06:10:29,510 --> 06:10:29,520
of people will immediately say they'll
 

21075
06:10:29,520 --> 06:10:30,948
of people will immediately say they'll
have 50 different objections to this

21076
06:10:30,948 --> 06:10:30,958
have 50 different objections to this
 

21077
06:10:30,958 --> 06:10:32,208
have 50 different objections to this
they'll say oh you don't get it the

21078
06:10:32,208 --> 06:10:32,218
they'll say oh you don't get it the
 

21079
06:10:32,218 --> 06:10:34,430
they'll say oh you don't get it the
whole point is the land and you know so

21080
06:10:34,430 --> 06:10:34,440
whole point is the land and you know so
 

21081
06:10:34,440 --> 06:10:35,868
whole point is the land and you know so
on they've been there for Generations

21082
06:10:35,868 --> 06:10:35,878
on they've been there for Generations
 

21083
06:10:35,878 --> 06:10:38,810
on they've been there for Generations
sort of say I do get it

21084
06:10:38,810 --> 06:10:38,820
sort of say I do get it
 

21085
06:10:38,820 --> 06:10:41,030
sort of say I do get it
um but this Catalan nationalist who's

21086
06:10:41,030 --> 06:10:41,040
um but this Catalan nationalist who's
 

21087
06:10:41,040 --> 06:10:44,628
um but this Catalan nationalist who's
like literally ridden in catalonian for

21088
06:10:44,628 --> 06:10:44,638
like literally ridden in catalonian for

I don't know how many years right uh is

21090
06:10:48,048 --> 06:10:48,058
I don't know how many years right uh is
 

21091
06:10:48,058 --> 06:10:50,448
I don't know how many years right uh is
basically saying this is worth thinking

21092
06:10:50,448 --> 06:10:50,458
basically saying this is worth thinking
 

21093
06:10:50,458 --> 06:10:52,490
basically saying this is worth thinking
about and so it's a peaceful Third Way

21094
06:10:52,490 --> 06:10:52,500
about and so it's a peaceful Third Way
 

21095
06:10:52,500 --> 06:10:54,470
about and so it's a peaceful Third Way
yeah but it's it's interesting I mean it

21096
06:10:54,470 --> 06:10:54,480
yeah but it's it's interesting I mean it
 

21097
06:10:54,480 --> 06:10:56,330
yeah but it's it's interesting I mean it
it to it I mean it's it's a good

21098
06:10:56,330 --> 06:10:56,340
it to it I mean it's it's a good
 

21099
06:10:56,340 --> 06:10:58,490
it to it I mean it's it's a good
question whether Elon Musk SpaceX and

21100
06:10:58,490 --> 06:10:58,500
question whether Elon Musk SpaceX and
 

21101
06:10:58,500 --> 06:10:59,930
question whether Elon Musk SpaceX and
Tesla will be successful without Twitter

21102
06:10:59,930 --> 06:10:59,940
Tesla will be successful without Twitter
 

21103
06:10:59,940 --> 06:11:03,048
Tesla will be successful without Twitter
yeah I I don't think as as successful I

21104
06:11:03,048 --> 06:11:03,058
yeah I I don't think as as successful I
 

21105
06:11:03,058 --> 06:11:05,030
yeah I I don't think as as successful I
mean I mean obviously they existed

21106
06:11:05,030 --> 06:11:05,040
mean I mean obviously they existed
 

21107
06:11:05,040 --> 06:11:07,730
mean I mean obviously they existed
before Twitter and a lot of the

21108
06:11:07,730 --> 06:11:07,740
before Twitter and a lot of the
 

21109
06:11:07,740 --> 06:11:08,810
before Twitter and a lot of the
engineering problems are obviously

21110
06:11:08,810 --> 06:11:08,820
engineering problems are obviously
 

21111
06:11:08,820 --> 06:11:10,250
engineering problems are obviously
non-twitter things right but Twitter

21112
06:11:10,250 --> 06:11:10,260
non-twitter things right but Twitter
 

21113
06:11:10,260 --> 06:11:11,750
non-twitter things right but Twitter
itself is certainly probably helped us

21114
06:11:11,750 --> 06:11:11,760
itself is certainly probably helped us
 

21115
06:11:11,760 --> 06:11:14,270
itself is certainly probably helped us
with Tesla sales the engineering no

21116

with Tesla sales the engineering no
 

21117
06:11:14,280 --> 06:11:16,430

that's not that's not what I mean the

21118
06:11:16,430 --> 06:11:16,440
that's not that's not what I mean the
 

21119

best people in the world solve the
 

21121
06:11:18,420 --> 06:11:19,970
best people in the world solve the
engineering problems yes but he hires

21122
06:11:19,970 --> 06:11:19,980
engineering problems yes but he hires
 

21123
06:11:19,980 --> 06:11:21,350
engineering problems yes but he hires
the people to solve them and he knows

21124
06:11:21,350 --> 06:11:21,360
the people to solve them and he knows
 

21125
06:11:21,360 --> 06:11:23,208
the people to solve them and he knows
enough about engineering that's the

21126
06:11:23,208 --> 06:11:23,218
enough about engineering that's the
 

21127
06:11:23,218 --> 06:11:25,730
enough about engineering that's the
point I'm making is on Twitter the

21128
06:11:25,730 --> 06:11:25,740
point I'm making is on Twitter the
 

21129
06:11:25,740 --> 06:11:28,548
point I'm making is on Twitter the

the vision
is communicated and the best engineers

21134
06:11:34,490 --> 06:11:34,500
is communicated and the best engineers
 

21135
06:11:34,500 --> 06:11:37,128
is communicated and the best engineers
in the world come to work for the vision

21136
06:11:37,128 --> 06:11:37,138
in the world come to work for the vision
 

21137

21140
06:11:42,470 --> 06:11:42,480
company pursuing a vision I think

exceptionally difficult to determine and
 

21275
06:13:51,718 --> 06:13:53,930
exceptionally difficult to determine and
that's just a really nice example the

21276
06:13:53,930 --> 06:13:53,940
that's just a really nice example the
 

21277
06:13:53,940 --> 06:13:57,048
that's just a really nice example the

21284
06:14:03,470 --> 06:14:03,480
or false problems that's right and so
 

21285
06:14:03,480 --> 06:14:04,850
or false problems that's right and so
when people are saying when they were

21286

media fact check social media the

21290
06:14:08,868 --> 06:14:08,878
media fact check social media the
 

21291
06:14:08,878 --> 06:14:10,128
media fact check social media the
assumption is that they know what is

21292
06:14:10,128 --> 06:14:10,138
assumption is that they know what is
 

21293
06:14:10,138 --> 06:14:11,510
assumption is that they know what is
true and what do they mean by that they

21294
06:14:11,510 --> 06:14:11,520
true and what do they mean by that they
 

21295
06:14:11,520 --> 06:14:13,250
true and what do they mean by that they
really mean the assertion of political

21296
06:14:13,250 --> 06:14:13,260
really mean the assertion of political
 

21297
06:14:13,260 --> 06:14:14,990
really mean the assertion of political
power right

21298
06:14:14,990 --> 06:14:15,000
power right
 

21299
06:14:15,000 --> 06:14:17,448
power right
with that said do I think it could be

21300
06:14:17,448 --> 06:14:17,458
with that said do I think it could be
 

21301
06:14:17,458 --> 06:14:19,070
with that said do I think it could be
useful to have some kind of quote factor

21302
06:14:19,070 --> 06:14:19,080
useful to have some kind of quote factor
 

21303
06:14:19,080 --> 06:14:20,330
useful to have some kind of quote factor
I can think yes but it has to be

21304
06:14:20,330 --> 06:14:20,340
I can think yes but it has to be
 

21305
06:14:20,340 --> 06:14:22,310
I can think yes but it has to be
decentralized and open source you could

21306
06:14:22,310 --> 06:14:22,320
decentralized and open source you could
 

21307
06:14:22,320 --> 06:14:24,350
decentralized and open source you could
imagine an interesting concept of coding

okay and so now anybody Stables Fusion

21318
06:14:35,690 --> 06:14:35,700
okay and so now anybody Stables Fusion
 

21319
06:14:35,700 --> 06:14:36,890
okay and so now anybody Stables Fusion
shows that it's possible to take an

21320
06:14:36,890 --> 06:14:36,900
shows that it's possible to take an
 

21321
06:14:36,900 --> 06:14:38,448
shows that it's possible to take an
expensive AI model and put it out there

expensive AI model and put it out there
 

21323
06:14:38,458 --> 06:14:40,430
expensive AI model and put it out there
right so you have you know you don't

21324
06:14:40,430 --> 06:14:40,440
right so you have you know you don't
 

21325

06:14:51,958 --> 06:14:55,910
some other representation it's like an
ontology of a is a b and you know B has

21336
06:14:55,910 --> 06:14:55,920
ontology of a is a b and you know B has
 

21337
06:14:55,920 --> 06:14:57,890
ontology of a is a b and you know B has
a c and it's got probabilities on the

21338
06:14:57,890 --> 06:14:57,900
a c and it's got probabilities on the
 

21339
06:14:57,900 --> 06:14:59,150
a c and it's got probabilities on the
edges sometimes and other kinds of

21340
06:14:59,150 --> 06:14:59,160
edges sometimes and other kinds of
 

21341
06:14:59,160 --> 06:15:01,250
edges sometimes and other kinds of
metadata and this allows Google to show

21342
06:15:01,250 --> 06:15:01,260
metadata and this allows Google to show
 

21343
06:15:01,260 --> 06:15:02,930
metadata and this allows Google to show
certain kinds of one box information

21344
06:15:02,930 --> 06:15:02,940
certain kinds of one box information
 

21345
06:15:02,940 --> 06:15:04,490
certain kinds of one box information
where it's like

21346
06:15:04,490 --> 06:15:04,500
where it's like
 

21347
06:15:04,500 --> 06:15:07,128
where it's like
um what is so what is Steve Jobs's uh

21348
06:15:07,128 --> 06:15:07,138
um what is so what is Steve Jobs's uh
 

21349
06:15:07,138 --> 06:15:08,628
um what is so what is Steve Jobs's uh
you know what is what is Laureen Powell

21350
06:15:08,628 --> 06:15:08,638
you know what is what is Laureen Powell
 

21351
06:15:08,638 --> 06:15:10,970
you know what is what is Laureen Powell
Jobs's uh age or birthday they can pull

21352
06:15:10,970 --> 06:15:10,980
Jobs's uh age or birthday they can pull
 

21353
06:15:10,980 --> 06:15:12,708
Jobs's uh age or birthday they can pull
that up out of the out of the um the

21354
06:15:12,708 --> 06:15:12,718
that up out of the out of the um the
 

21355
06:15:12,718 --> 06:15:15,470
that up out of the out of the um the
knowledge graph right and uh so you can

21356
06:15:15,470 --> 06:15:15,480
knowledge graph right and uh so you can
 

21357
06:15:15,480 --> 06:15:17,390
knowledge graph right and uh so you can
imagine the true goal would have both

21358
06:15:17,390 --> 06:15:17,400
imagine the true goal would have both
 

21359
06:15:17,400 --> 06:15:19,730
imagine the true goal would have both
deterministic and statistical components

21360
06:15:19,730 --> 06:15:19,740
deterministic and statistical components
 

21361
06:15:19,740 --> 06:15:21,708
deterministic and statistical components
and crucially it would say whether

21362
06:15:21,708 --> 06:15:21,718
and crucially it would say whether
 

21363
06:15:21,718 --> 06:15:23,868
and crucially it would say whether
something is true according to a given

21364
06:15:23,868 --> 06:15:23,878
something is true according to a given
 

21365
06:15:23,878 --> 06:15:25,490
something is true according to a given
Knowledge Graph

21366
06:15:25,490 --> 06:15:25,500
Knowledge Graph
 

21367
06:15:25,500 --> 06:15:27,830
Knowledge Graph
and so this way at least what you can do

21368
06:15:27,830 --> 06:15:27,840
and so this way at least what you can do
 

21369
06:15:27,840 --> 06:15:30,470
and so this way at least what you can do
is you can say okay here's the things

21370
06:15:30,470 --> 06:15:30,480
is you can say okay here's the things
 

21371
06:15:30,480 --> 06:15:32,990
is you can say okay here's the things
that are consensus reality like the

21372
06:15:32,990 --> 06:15:33,000
that are consensus reality like the
 

21373
06:15:33,000 --> 06:15:34,368
that are consensus reality like the
value of the gravitational constant will

21374
06:15:34,368 --> 06:15:34,378
value of the gravitational constant will
 

21375
06:15:34,378 --> 06:15:37,250
value of the gravitational constant will
be the same in the Maga Knowledge Graph

21376
06:15:37,250 --> 06:15:37,260
be the same in the Maga Knowledge Graph
 

21377
06:15:37,260 --> 06:15:39,048
be the same in the Maga Knowledge Graph
and the US establishment Knowledge Graph

21378
06:15:39,048 --> 06:15:39,058
and the US establishment Knowledge Graph
 

21379
06:15:39,058 --> 06:15:41,990
and the US establishment Knowledge Graph
and the CCP Knowledge Graph and the the

21380
06:15:41,990 --> 06:15:42,000
and the CCP Knowledge Graph and the the
 

21381
06:15:42,000 --> 06:15:44,150
and the CCP Knowledge Graph and the the
I don't know the resilient Knowledge

21382
06:15:44,150 --> 06:15:44,160
I don't know the resilient Knowledge
 

21383
06:15:44,160 --> 06:15:46,250
I don't know the resilient Knowledge
Graph and so on and so forth okay but

21384
06:15:46,250 --> 06:15:46,260
Graph and so on and so forth okay but
 

21385
06:15:46,260 --> 06:15:47,448
Graph and so on and so forth okay but
there's other things that will be quite

21386
06:15:47,448 --> 06:15:47,458
there's other things that will be quite
 

21387
06:15:47,458 --> 06:15:48,530
there's other things that will be quite
different

21388
06:15:48,530 --> 06:15:48,540
different
 

21389
06:15:48,540 --> 06:15:51,770
different
and at least now you can isolate where

21390
06:15:51,770 --> 06:15:51,780
and at least now you can isolate where
 

21391
06:15:51,780 --> 06:15:54,288
and at least now you can isolate where
the point of disagreement is and so you

21392
06:15:54,288 --> 06:15:54,298
the point of disagreement is and so you
 

21393
06:15:54,298 --> 06:15:55,730
the point of disagreement is and so you
can have a form of decentralized fact

21394
06:15:55,730 --> 06:15:55,740
can have a form of decentralized fact
 

21395
06:15:55,740 --> 06:15:58,070
can have a form of decentralized fact
checking that is like according to who

21396
06:15:58,070 --> 06:15:58,080
checking that is like according to who
 

21397
06:15:58,080 --> 06:16:00,048
checking that is like according to who
well here is the authority and it is

21398
06:16:00,048 --> 06:16:00,058
well here is the authority and it is
 

21399
06:16:00,058 --> 06:16:01,250
well here is the authority and it is
this knowledge graph right so that's

21400
06:16:01,250 --> 06:16:01,260
this knowledge graph right so that's
 

21401
06:16:01,260 --> 06:16:03,770
this knowledge graph right so that's
like a kind of thing right yeah yeah so

21402
06:16:03,770 --> 06:16:03,780
like a kind of thing right yeah yeah so
 

21403
06:16:03,780 --> 06:16:04,788
like a kind of thing right yeah yeah so
that is

21404
06:16:04,788 --> 06:16:04,798
that is
 

21405
06:16:04,798 --> 06:16:06,770
that is
um so that's one concept of like what

21406
06:16:06,770 --> 06:16:06,780
um so that's one concept of like what
 

21407
06:16:06,780 --> 06:16:08,330
um so that's one concept of like what
next social media looks like there's

21408
06:16:08,330 --> 06:16:08,340
next social media looks like there's
 

21409
06:16:08,340 --> 06:16:09,948
next social media looks like there's
there's actually so much more another

21410
06:16:09,948 --> 06:16:09,958
there's actually so much more another
 

21411
06:16:09,958 --> 06:16:12,410
there's actually so much more another
huge thing is decentralized social media

21412
06:16:12,410 --> 06:16:12,420
huge thing is decentralized social media
 

21413
06:16:12,420 --> 06:16:15,830
huge thing is decentralized social media
okay social media today is like China

21414
06:16:15,830 --> 06:16:15,840
okay social media today is like China
 

21415
06:16:15,840 --> 06:16:18,410
okay social media today is like China
under communism in a really key sense

21416
06:16:18,410 --> 06:16:18,420
under communism in a really key sense
 

21417
06:16:18,420 --> 06:16:20,628
under communism in a really key sense
there's a great article called The

21418
06:16:20,628 --> 06:16:20,638
there's a great article called The
 

21419
06:16:20,638 --> 06:16:21,948
there's a great article called The
Secret document that transformed China

21420
06:16:21,948 --> 06:16:21,958
Secret document that transformed China
 

21421
06:16:21,958 --> 06:16:23,810
Secret document that transformed China
do you know what China was like before

21422
06:16:23,810 --> 06:16:23,820
do you know what China was like before
 

21423
06:16:23,820 --> 06:16:26,750
do you know what China was like before
1978 I know about the atrocities sure so

21424
06:16:26,750 --> 06:16:26,760
1978 I know about the atrocities sure so
 

21425
06:16:26,760 --> 06:16:29,270
1978 I know about the atrocities sure so
but some flesh on the yeah bone so to

21426
06:16:29,270 --> 06:16:29,280
but some flesh on the yeah bone so to
 

21427
06:16:29,280 --> 06:16:30,590
but some flesh on the yeah bone so to
speak okay

21428
06:16:30,590 --> 06:16:30,600
speak okay
 

21429
06:16:30,600 --> 06:16:33,110
speak okay
so basically there's a good book um

21430
06:16:33,110 --> 06:16:33,120
so basically there's a good book um
 

21431
06:16:33,120 --> 06:16:34,910
so basically there's a good book um
because I think a lot of documents

21432
06:16:34,910 --> 06:16:34,920
because I think a lot of documents
 

21433
06:16:34,920 --> 06:16:37,970
because I think a lot of documents
became public recently and so there's a

21434
06:16:37,970 --> 06:16:37,980
became public recently and so there's a
 

21435
06:16:37,980 --> 06:16:39,048
became public recently and so there's a
window when it opened up now it's

21436
06:16:39,048 --> 06:16:39,058
window when it opened up now it's
 

21437
06:16:39,058 --> 06:16:40,730
window when it opened up now it's
probably closing back down again but but

21438
06:16:40,730 --> 06:16:40,740
probably closing back down again but but
 

21439
06:16:40,740 --> 06:16:42,650
probably closing back down again but but
you know great biographies because of

21440
06:16:42,650 --> 06:16:42,660
you know great biographies because of
 

21441
06:16:42,660 --> 06:16:44,448
you know great biographies because of
that were written like I'm currently

21442
06:16:44,448 --> 06:16:44,458
that were written like I'm currently
 

21443
06:16:44,458 --> 06:16:46,850
that were written like I'm currently
reading Mao's Great Famine by Frank de

21444
06:16:46,850 --> 06:16:46,860
reading Mao's Great Famine by Frank de
 

21445
06:16:46,860 --> 06:16:49,250
reading Mao's Great Famine by Frank de
Carter yeah which is uh

21446
06:16:49,250 --> 06:16:49,260
Carter yeah which is uh
 

21447
06:16:49,260 --> 06:16:50,948
Carter yeah which is uh
who boy

21448
06:16:50,948 --> 06:16:50,958
who boy
 

21449
06:16:50,958 --> 06:16:55,190
who boy
it's crazy okay yeah here's the thing is

21450
06:16:55,190 --> 06:16:55,200
it's crazy okay yeah here's the thing is
 

21451
06:16:55,200 --> 06:16:57,530
it's crazy okay yeah here's the thing is
capitalism was punishable by Death

21452
06:16:57,530 --> 06:16:57,540
capitalism was punishable by Death
 

21453
06:16:57,540 --> 06:17:00,288
capitalism was punishable by Death
in living memory in China just to

21454
06:17:00,288 --> 06:17:00,298
in living memory in China just to
 

21455
06:17:00,298 --> 06:17:01,548
in living memory in China just to
explain what that meant okay I mean

21456
06:17:01,548 --> 06:17:01,558
explain what that meant okay I mean
 

21457
06:17:01,558 --> 06:17:03,470
explain what that meant okay I mean
that's what communism was right it was

21458
06:17:03,470 --> 06:17:03,480
that's what communism was right it was
 

21459
06:17:03,480 --> 06:17:05,750
that's what communism was right it was
literally the same China that has like

21460
06:17:05,750 --> 06:17:05,760
literally the same China that has like
 

21461
06:17:05,760 --> 06:17:07,670
literally the same China that has like
the CC you know the entrepreneurs and

21462
06:17:07,670 --> 06:17:07,680
the CC you know the entrepreneurs and
 

21463
06:17:07,680 --> 06:17:09,410
the CC you know the entrepreneurs and
Jack Ma and so on and so 40 something

21464
06:17:09,410 --> 06:17:09,420
Jack Ma and so on and so 40 something
 

21465
06:17:09,420 --> 06:17:11,030
Jack Ma and so on and so 40 something
years ago capitalism was punishable by

21466
06:17:11,030 --> 06:17:11,040
years ago capitalism was punishable by
 

21467
06:17:11,040 --> 06:17:13,070
years ago capitalism was punishable by
death but to put to give in a concrete

21468
06:17:13,070 --> 06:17:13,080
death but to put to give in a concrete
 

21469
06:17:13,080 --> 06:17:14,810
death but to put to give in a concrete
example this is a famous story in China

21470
06:17:14,810 --> 06:17:14,820
example this is a famous story in China
 

21471
06:17:14,820 --> 06:17:16,910
example this is a famous story in China
maybe apocryphal but it's what you know

21472
06:17:16,910 --> 06:17:16,920
maybe apocryphal but it's what you know
 

21473
06:17:16,920 --> 06:17:18,650
maybe apocryphal but it's what you know
the folks have talked about there's a

21474
06:17:18,650 --> 06:17:18,660
the folks have talked about there's a
 

21475
06:17:18,660 --> 06:17:21,708
the folks have talked about there's a
village in xiaogang and basically all

21476
06:17:21,708 --> 06:17:21,718
village in xiaogang and basically all
 

21477
06:17:21,718 --> 06:17:23,030
village in xiaogang and basically all
the green that you were produced was

21478
06:17:23,030 --> 06:17:23,040
the green that you were produced was
 

21479
06:17:23,040 --> 06:17:24,948
the green that you were produced was
supposed to go to the collective and

21480
06:17:24,948 --> 06:17:24,958
supposed to go to the collective and
 

21481
06:17:24,958 --> 06:17:26,990
supposed to go to the collective and
even one straw belonged to the group at

21482
06:17:26,990 --> 06:17:27,000
even one straw belonged to the group at
 

21483
06:17:27,000 --> 06:17:27,948
even one straw belonged to the group at
one meeting with Communist Party

21484
06:17:27,948 --> 06:17:27,958
one meeting with Communist Party
 

21485
06:17:27,958 --> 06:17:29,690
one meeting with Communist Party
officials a farmer asked what about the

21486
06:17:29,690 --> 06:17:29,700
officials a farmer asked what about the
 

21487
06:17:29,700 --> 06:17:31,070
officials a farmer asked what about the

where the Republicans lost mortality
 

21847
06:23:51,180 --> 06:23:52,490
where the Republicans lost mortality
it's not really that was a mop-up

21848
06:23:52,490 --> 06:23:52,500
it's not really that was a mop-up
 

21849
06:23:52,500 --> 06:23:55,010
it's not really that was a mop-up
because uh 1936 30 years earlier was

21850
06:23:55,010 --> 06:23:55,020
because uh 1936 30 years earlier was
 

21851
06:23:55,020 --> 06:23:56,208
because uh 1936 30 years earlier was
when black voters switched to the

a c of your tech company anymore would
 

21871
06:24:15,120 --> 06:24:18,470

you right so by 2015 2020 now now you

21872
06:24:18,470 --> 06:24:18,480
you right so by 2015 2020 now now you
 

21873
06:24:18,480 --> 06:24:20,628
you right so by 2015 2020 now now you
have it's like two sine waves that are

21874
06:24:20,628 --> 06:24:20,638
have it's like two sine waves that are
 

21875
06:24:20,638 --> 06:24:23,030
have it's like two sine waves that are
staggered right moral Authority leads to

21876
06:24:23,030 --> 06:24:23,040
staggered right moral Authority leads to
 

21877
06:24:23,040 --> 06:24:26,390
staggered right moral Authority leads to
economic Authority leads to loss of uh

21878
06:24:26,390 --> 06:24:26,400
economic Authority leads to loss of uh
 

21879
06:24:26,400 --> 06:24:27,650
economic Authority leads to loss of uh
moral Authority leads to loss of

21880
06:24:27,650 --> 06:24:27,660
moral Authority leads to loss of
 

21881
06:24:27,660 --> 06:24:29,990
moral Authority leads to loss of
economic Authority and so now you have

21882
06:24:29,990 --> 06:24:30,000
economic Authority and so now you have
 

21883
06:24:30,000 --> 06:24:33,048
economic Authority and so now you have
the uh the Democrats you know have you

21908
06:24:57,470 --> 06:24:57,480
for example the BLM founder why do they
 

21909
06:24:57,480 --> 06:24:58,670
for example the BLM founder why do they
have this million dollar mansion right

21910
06:24:58,670 --> 06:24:58,680

21915
06:25:01,558 --> 06:25:03,110
being good and you're anti-capitalist
how come you seem to be raking in the

21916
06:25:03,110 --> 06:25:03,120
how come you seem to be raking in the
 

21917
06:25:03,120 --> 06:25:04,548
how come you seem to be raking in the
money Etc right

21918
06:25:04,548 --> 06:25:04,558
money Etc right
 

21919
06:25:04,558 --> 06:25:07,070
money Etc right
this is an argument which I'm not sure

21920
06:25:07,070 --> 06:25:07,080
this is an argument which I'm not sure
 

21921
06:25:07,080 --> 06:25:09,470
this is an argument which I'm not sure
how long it will go

21922
06:25:09,470 --> 06:25:09,480
how long it will go
 

21923
06:25:09,480 --> 06:25:11,510
how long it will go
um it might take years to play out it

21924
06:25:11,510 --> 06:25:11,520
um it might take years to play out it
 

21925
06:25:11,520 --> 06:25:13,430
um it might take years to play out it
might take decades to play out I think

21926
06:25:13,430 --> 06:25:13,440
might take decades to play out I think
 

21927
06:25:13,440 --> 06:25:14,930
might take decades to play out I think
probably on the order of a decade you're

21928
06:25:14,930 --> 06:25:14,940
probably on the order of a decade you're
 

21929
06:25:14,940 --> 06:25:16,010
probably on the order of a decade you're
going to see in my view the

21930
06:25:16,010 --> 06:25:16,020
going to see in my view the
 

21931
06:25:16,020 --> 06:25:18,770
going to see in my view the
repositioning if the Democrats are the

21932
06:25:18,770 --> 06:25:18,780
repositioning if the Democrats are the
 

21933
06:25:18,780 --> 06:25:20,270
repositioning if the Democrats are the
world capitalists the Republicans will

21934
06:25:20,270 --> 06:25:20,280
world capitalists the Republicans will
 

21935
06:25:20,280 --> 06:25:22,070
world capitalists the Republicans will
eventually become are becoming the

21936
06:25:22,070 --> 06:25:22,080
eventually become are becoming the
 

21937
06:25:22,080 --> 06:25:25,128
eventually become are becoming the
Bitcoin maximalists why because

21938
06:25:25,128 --> 06:25:25,138
Bitcoin maximalists why because
 

21939
06:25:25,138 --> 06:25:26,810
Bitcoin maximalists why because
you know if one guy picks left the other

21940
06:25:26,810 --> 06:25:26,820
you know if one guy picks left the other
 

21941
06:25:26,820 --> 06:25:27,890
you know if one guy picks left the other
guy picks right it's literally like

guy picks right it's literally like
 

21943
06:25:27,900 --> 06:25:29,510

everything's in the cloud and can be

22298
06:31:34,970 --> 06:31:34,980
everything's in the cloud and can be
 

22299
06:31:34,980 --> 06:31:36,890
everything's in the cloud and can be
deleted at any point right so each of

22300
06:31:36,890 --> 06:31:36,900
deleted at any point right so each of
 

22301
06:31:36,900 --> 06:31:39,170
deleted at any point right so each of
these is kind of has Badness when it's

22302
06:31:39,170 --> 06:31:39,180
these is kind of has Badness when it's
 

22303
06:31:39,180 --> 06:31:40,548
these is kind of has Badness when it's
there but also it's total extreme

22304
06:31:40,548 --> 06:31:40,558
there but also it's total extreme
 

22305
06:31:40,558 --> 06:31:42,470
there but also it's total extreme
opposite is bad and so you want to kind

22306
06:31:42,470 --> 06:31:42,480
opposite is bad and so you want to kind
 

22307
06:31:42,480 --> 06:31:44,570
opposite is bad and so you want to kind
of carve out like an intelligent

22308
06:31:44,570 --> 06:31:44,580
of carve out like an intelligent
 

22309
06:31:44,580 --> 06:31:46,970
of carve out like an intelligent
intermediate of these three poles and

22310
06:31:46,970 --> 06:31:46,980
intermediate of these three poles and
 

22311
06:31:46,980 --> 06:31:48,770
intermediate of these three poles and
that's the you know decentralized center

22312
06:31:48,770 --> 06:31:48,780
that's the you know decentralized center
 

22313
06:31:48,780 --> 06:31:50,510
that's the you know decentralized center
of the recentralized center I call now

22314
06:31:50,510 --> 06:31:50,520
of the recentralized center I call now
 

22315
06:31:50,520 --> 06:31:51,770
of the recentralized center I call now
with that said

22316
06:31:51,770 --> 06:31:51,780
with that said
 

22317
06:31:51,780 --> 06:31:53,270
with that said
I think there is a repositioning in

22318
06:31:53,270 --> 06:31:53,280
I think there is a repositioning in
 

22319
06:31:53,280 --> 06:31:54,708
I think there is a repositioning in
particular of vote Capital that is

22320
06:31:54,708 --> 06:31:54,718
particular of vote Capital that is
 

22321
06:31:54,718 --> 06:31:57,410
particular of vote Capital that is
happening and I think if the 2000s was

22322
06:31:57,410 --> 06:31:57,420
happening and I think if the 2000s was
 

22323
06:31:57,420 --> 06:31:59,868
happening and I think if the 2000s was
the global war on terror and then the

22324
06:31:59,868 --> 06:31:59,878
the global war on terror and then the
 

22325
06:31:59,878 --> 06:32:01,490
the global war on terror and then the
channel just changed to wokeness in the

22326
06:32:01,490 --> 06:32:01,500
channel just changed to wokeness in the
 

22327
06:32:01,500 --> 06:32:03,708
channel just changed to wokeness in the
2010s and I mean channel change have you

22328
06:32:03,708 --> 06:32:03,718
2010s and I mean channel change have you
 

22329
06:32:03,718 --> 06:32:05,868
2010s and I mean channel change have you
seen Paul Graham's graph or actually

22330
06:32:05,868 --> 06:32:05,878
seen Paul Graham's graph or actually
 

22331
06:32:05,878 --> 06:32:07,730
seen Paul Graham's graph or actually
David rosado's graph that Paul Graham

22332
06:32:07,730 --> 06:32:07,740
David rosado's graph that Paul Graham
 

22333
06:32:07,740 --> 06:32:10,610
David rosado's graph that Paul Graham
posted no but this is a good chance to

22334
06:32:10,610 --> 06:32:10,620
posted no but this is a good chance to
 

22335
06:32:10,620 --> 06:32:12,708
posted no but this is a good chance to
say that Paul Graham is awesome okay

22336
06:32:12,708 --> 06:32:12,718
say that Paul Graham is awesome okay
 

22337
06:32:12,718 --> 06:32:14,750
say that Paul Graham is awesome okay
yeah and so here is this graph okay

22338
06:32:14,750 --> 06:32:14,760
yeah and so here is this graph okay
 

22339
06:32:14,760 --> 06:32:17,090
yeah and so here is this graph okay
David rosado's data analysis I think

22340
06:32:17,090 --> 06:32:17,100
David rosado's data analysis I think
 

22341
06:32:17,100 --> 06:32:18,830
David rosado's data analysis I think
that put this together so but basically

22342
06:32:18,830 --> 06:32:18,840
that put this together so but basically
 

22343
06:32:18,840 --> 06:32:22,670
that put this together so but basically
this is a graph of the word usage

22344
06:32:22,670 --> 06:32:22,680
this is a graph of the word usage

06:41:51,240 --> 06:41:52,490
and they're against
um you know they're they're they're

22866
06:41:52,490 --> 06:41:52,500
um you know they're they're they're
 

22867
06:41:52,500 --> 06:41:54,350
um you know they're they're they're
they're pushing for burning coal and

22868
06:41:54,350 --> 06:41:54,360
they're pushing for burning coal and
 

22869
06:41:54,360 --> 06:41:56,930
they're pushing for burning coal and
wood right so a lot of prices are going

22870
06:41:56,930 --> 06:41:56,940
wood right so a lot of prices are going
 

22871
06:41:56,940 --> 06:41:58,310
wood right so a lot of prices are going
up in a really foundational and

22872
06:41:58,310 --> 06:41:58,320
up in a really foundational and
 

22873
06:41:58,320 --> 06:42:01,128
up in a really foundational and
fundamental way and um with that said

22874
06:42:01,128 --> 06:42:01,138
fundamental way and um with that said
 

22875
06:42:01,138 --> 06:42:02,628
fundamental way and um with that said
also the dollar is in some ways

22876
06:42:02,628 --> 06:42:02,638
also the dollar is in some ways
 

22877
06:42:02,638 --> 06:42:03,708
also the dollar is in some ways
strengthening against certain other

22878
06:42:03,708 --> 06:42:03,718
strengthening against certain other
 

22879
06:42:03,718 --> 06:42:04,788
strengthening against certain other
things because a lot of other countries

22880
06:42:04,788 --> 06:42:04,798
things because a lot of other countries
 

22881
06:42:04,798 --> 06:42:07,368
things because a lot of other countries
are dying harder right

22882
06:42:07,368 --> 06:42:07,378
are dying harder right
 

22883
06:42:07,378 --> 06:42:09,048
are dying harder right
um you know and you've got riots in Sri

22884
06:42:09,048 --> 06:42:09,058
um you know and you've got riots in Sri
 

22885
06:42:09,058 --> 06:42:11,090
um you know and you've got riots in Sri
Lanka and riots in Panama and riots in

22886
06:42:11,090 --> 06:42:11,100
Lanka and riots in Panama and riots in
 

22887
06:42:11,100 --> 06:42:14,330
Lanka and riots in Panama and riots in
you know all these places right so it's

22888
06:42:14,330 --> 06:42:14,340
you know all these places right so it's
 

22889
06:42:14,340 --> 06:42:15,708
you know all these places right so it's
it's very complicated because you've got

22890
06:42:15,708 --> 06:42:15,718
it's very complicated because you've got
 

22891
06:42:15,718 --> 06:42:17,448
it's very complicated because you've got
multiple different Trends going in the

22892
06:42:17,448 --> 06:42:17,458
multiple different Trends going in the
 

22893
06:42:17,458 --> 06:42:19,970
multiple different Trends going in the
same way you're you're Bitcoin Maximus

22894
06:42:19,970 --> 06:42:19,980
same way you're you're Bitcoin Maximus
 

22895
06:42:19,980 --> 06:42:21,830
same way you're you're Bitcoin Maximus
would just say infinity over 21 million

22896
06:42:21,830 --> 06:42:21,840
would just say infinity over 21 million
 

22897
06:42:21,840 --> 06:42:23,750
would just say infinity over 21 million
and so therefore you print all the

22898
06:42:23,750 --> 06:42:23,760
and so therefore you print all the
 

22899
06:42:23,760 --> 06:42:24,650
and so therefore you print all the
dollars there's only 200 million

22900
06:42:24,650 --> 06:42:24,660
dollars there's only 200 million
 

22901
06:42:24,660 --> 06:42:26,750
dollars there's only 200 million
Bitcoins so Bitcoin goes to Infinity but

22902
06:42:26,750 --> 06:42:26,760
Bitcoins so Bitcoin goes to Infinity but
 

22903
06:42:26,760 --> 06:42:29,330
Bitcoins so Bitcoin goes to Infinity but
it can be something where lots of other

22904
06:42:29,330 --> 06:42:29,340
it can be something where lots of other
 

22905
06:42:29,340 --> 06:42:30,590
it can be something where lots of other
currencies die and the dollar is

22906
06:42:30,590 --> 06:42:30,600
currencies die and the dollar is
 

22907
06:42:30,600 --> 06:42:34,250
currencies die and the dollar is
actually exported via stable coins okay

22908
06:42:34,250 --> 06:42:34,260
actually exported via stable coins okay
 

22909
06:42:34,260 --> 06:42:36,410
actually exported via stable coins okay
um but I do think it still moves Fiat

22910
06:42:36,410 --> 06:42:36,420
um but I do think it still moves Fiat
 

22911
06:42:36,420 --> 06:42:38,288
um but I do think it still moves Fiat
still moves somehow into the

22912
06:42:38,288 --> 06:42:38,298
still moves somehow into the
 

22913
06:42:38,298 --> 06:42:40,250
still moves somehow into the
cryptocurrencies yeah yeah it's I think

22914
06:42:40,250 --> 06:42:40,260
cryptocurrencies yeah yeah it's I think
 

22915
06:42:40,260 --> 06:42:42,590
cryptocurrencies yeah yeah it's I think
it's kind of like Microsoft where and

22916
06:42:42,590 --> 06:42:42,600
it's kind of like Microsoft where and
 

22917
06:42:42,600 --> 06:42:44,330
it's kind of like Microsoft where and
windows is still around right I'm

22918
06:42:44,330 --> 06:42:44,340
windows is still around right I'm
 

22919

windows is still around right I'm
actually still around still a you know

22920
06:42:46,070 --> 06:42:46,080
actually still around still a you know
 

22921
06:42:46,080 --> 06:42:47,628
actually still around still a you know
multi 100 billion dollar company it

22922
06:42:47,628 --> 06:42:47,638
multi 100 billion dollar company it
 

22923
06:42:47,638 --> 06:42:49,730
multi 100 billion dollar company it
doesn't mean it he doesn't mean it don't

22924
06:42:49,730 --> 06:42:49,740
doesn't mean it he doesn't mean it don't
 

22925
06:42:49,740 --> 06:42:51,890
doesn't mean it he doesn't mean it don't
worry all my machines are windows are

22926
06:42:51,890 --> 06:42:51,900
worry all my machines are windows are
 

22927
06:42:51,900 --> 06:42:53,810

least for hours it's not an ideology
 

22935
06:43:00,480 --> 06:43:03,350
least for hours it's not an ideology

lot of innovative things like GitHub
 

22947
06:43:12,900 --> 06:43:14,750
lot of innovative things like GitHub
yeah then we built this in acquisition

22948
06:43:14,750 --> 06:43:14,760
yeah then we built this in acquisition
 

22949
06:43:14,760 --> 06:43:16,368
yeah then we built this in acquisition
but still it's not giving credit for the

22950
06:43:16,368 --> 06:43:16,378
but still it's not giving credit for the
 

22951
06:43:16,378 --> 06:43:19,128
but still it's not giving credit for the
acquisition the pivoting of vision and

22952
06:43:19,128 --> 06:43:19,138
acquisition the pivoting of vision and
 

22953
06:43:19,138 --> 06:43:21,770
acquisition the pivoting of vision and
motivations and uh focus and all that

22954
06:43:21,770 --> 06:43:21,780
motivations and uh focus and all that

an analogy metaphor for something well

22958
06:43:26,030 --> 06:43:26,040
an analogy metaphor for something well
 

22959
06:43:26,040 --> 06:43:27,530
an analogy metaphor for something well
yeah so basically just like you know

22960
06:43:27,530 --> 06:43:27,540
yeah so basically just like you know
 

22961
06:43:27,540 --> 06:43:29,030
yeah so basically just like you know
they didn't need a turnaround but they

22962
06:43:29,030 --> 06:43:29,040
they didn't need a turnaround but they
 

22963
06:43:29,040 --> 06:43:30,410
they didn't need a turnaround but they
are they didn't endure to the present

22964
06:43:30,410 --> 06:43:30,420
are they didn't endure to the present
 

22965
06:43:30,420 --> 06:43:31,910
are they didn't endure to the present
day they didn't die from Google app I

22966
06:43:31,910 --> 06:43:31,920
day they didn't die from Google app I
 

22967
06:43:31,920 --> 06:43:33,230
day they didn't die from Google app I
mean for the massive attacks on them

22968
06:43:33,230 --> 06:43:33,240
mean for the massive attacks on them
 

22969
06:43:33,240 --> 06:43:35,330
mean for the massive attacks on them
they didn't die they are less powerful

22970
06:43:35,330 --> 06:43:35,340
they didn't die they are less powerful
 

22971
06:43:35,340 --> 06:43:37,670
they didn't die they are less powerful
but they make more money right yes and

22972
06:43:37,670 --> 06:43:37,680
but they make more money right yes and
 

22973
06:43:37,680 --> 06:43:38,390
but they make more money right yes and
um

22974
06:43:38,390 --> 06:43:38,400
um
 

22975
06:43:38,400 --> 06:43:40,368
um
I think that might be something that I

22976
06:43:40,368 --> 06:43:40,378
I think that might be something that I
 

22977
06:43:40,378 --> 06:43:42,230
I think that might be something that I
mean our best case scenario is the use

22978
06:43:42,230 --> 06:43:42,240
mean our best case scenario is the use
 

22979
06:43:42,240 --> 06:43:44,330
mean our best case scenario is the use
establishment or CCP has more power over

22980
06:43:44,330 --> 06:43:44,340
establishment or CCP has more power over
 

22981
06:43:44,340 --> 06:43:45,770
establishment or CCP has more power over
fewer people

22982
06:43:45,770 --> 06:43:45,780
fewer people
 

22983
06:43:45,780 --> 06:43:48,708
fewer people
okay I see and so you know but you can

22984
06:43:48,708 --> 06:43:48,718
okay I see and so you know but you can
 

22985
06:43:48,718 --> 06:43:50,750
okay I see and so you know but you can
exit if you if you're there you're kind

22986
06:43:50,750 --> 06:43:50,760
exit if you if you're there you're kind
 

22987
06:43:50,760 --> 06:43:52,430
exit if you if you're there you're kind
of knuckling under or whatever but you

22988
06:43:52,430 --> 06:43:52,440
of knuckling under or whatever but you
 

22989
06:43:52,440 --> 06:43:55,610
of knuckling under or whatever but you
can exit right and so I mentioned the uh

22990
06:43:55,610 --> 06:43:55,620
can exit right and so I mentioned the uh
 

22991
06:43:55,620 --> 06:43:57,470
can exit right and so I mentioned the uh
those three polls CCP is obviously a

22992
06:43:57,470 --> 06:43:57,480
those three polls CCP is obviously a
 

22993
06:43:57,480 --> 06:44:00,650
those three polls CCP is obviously a
billion people 1.4 aligned under the

22994
06:44:00,650 --> 06:44:00,660
billion people 1.4 aligned under the
 

22995
06:44:00,660 --> 06:44:03,708
billion people 1.4 aligned under the
digital Yuan and so on right nyt is the

22996
06:44:03,708 --> 06:44:03,718
digital Yuan and so on right nyt is the
 

22997
06:44:03,718 --> 06:44:05,810
digital Yuan and so on right nyt is the
entire you know it's it's the tech

22998
06:44:05,810 --> 06:44:05,820
entire you know it's it's the tech
 

22999
06:44:05,820 --> 06:44:08,868
entire you know it's it's the tech
companies it's the US dollar it is this

23000
06:44:08,868 --> 06:44:08,878
companies it's the US dollar it is this
 

23001
06:44:08,878 --> 06:44:10,190
companies it's the US dollar it is this
session and then crypto capital is

23002
06:44:10,190 --> 06:44:10,200
session and then crypto capital is
 

23003
06:44:10,200 --> 06:44:12,110
session and then crypto capital is
everybody else but I actually think that

23004
06:44:12,110 --> 06:44:12,120
everybody else but I actually think that
 

23005
06:44:12,120 --> 06:44:13,430
everybody else but I actually think that
over time

23006
06:44:13,430 --> 06:44:13,440
over time
 

23007
06:44:13,440 --> 06:44:16,788
over time
that third world is web 3 this time and

23008
06:44:16,788 --> 06:44:16,798
that third world is web 3 this time and
 

23009
06:44:16,798 --> 06:44:18,650
that third world is web 3 this time and
that's the third poll and that's India

23010
06:44:18,650 --> 06:44:18,660
that's the third poll and that's India

more and more in the digital world we

23322
06:49:32,750 --> 06:49:32,760
more and more in the digital world we
 

23323
06:49:32,760 --> 06:49:34,670
more and more in the digital world we
need to check on that power and the

23324
06:49:34,670 --> 06:49:34,680
need to check on that power and the
 

23325
06:49:34,680 --> 06:49:37,368
need to check on that power and the
check on that power is crypto and it's

23326
06:49:37,368 --> 06:49:37,378
check on that power is crypto and it's
 

23327
06:49:37,378 --> 06:49:38,570
check on that power is crypto and it's
property rights and it's

23328
06:49:38,570 --> 06:49:38,580
property rights and it's
 

23329
06:49:38,580 --> 06:49:40,010
property rights and it's
decentralization right then when I say

23330
06:49:40,010 --> 06:49:40,020
decentralization right then when I say
 

23331
06:49:40,020 --> 06:49:41,690
decentralization right then when I say
digital search and decentralization I

23332
06:49:41,690 --> 06:49:41,700
digital search and decentralization I
 

23333
06:49:41,700 --> 06:49:42,890
digital search and decentralization I
mean

23334
06:49:42,890 --> 06:49:42,900
mean
 

23335
06:49:42,900 --> 06:49:45,350
mean

thing and that if you think about in

23360
06:50:10,968 --> 06:50:10,978
thing and that if you think about in
 

23361
06:50:10,978 --> 06:50:12,350
thing and that if you think about in
terms of just abstract decentralizations

23362
06:50:12,350 --> 06:50:12,360
terms of just abstract decentralizations
 

23363
06:50:12,360 --> 06:50:13,490
terms of just abstract decentralizations
one thing but you think about in terms

23364
06:50:13,490 --> 06:50:13,500
one thing but you think about in terms
 

23365
06:50:13,500 --> 06:50:15,948
one thing but you think about in terms
of property rights it's quite another

23366
06:50:15,948 --> 06:50:15,958
of property rights it's quite another
 

23367
06:50:15,958 --> 06:50:17,750
of property rights it's quite another

and um
 

23369
06:50:17,760 --> 06:50:20,030
and um
now what that also means is once you

23370
06:50:20,030 --> 06:50:20,040
now what that also means is once you
 

23371
06:50:20,040 --> 06:50:22,070
now what that also means is once you
have property rights and you have

23372
06:50:22,070 --> 06:50:22,080
have property rights and you have
 

23373

they can get hacked or something like
 

23395

06:50:54,410 --> 06:50:54,420
Hernando de Soto sense you have
 

23405
06:50:54,420 --> 06:50:56,390
Hernando de Soto sense you have

something you own ownership digital

something you own ownership digital
ownership it's the cloud is great but

06:50:59,150 --> 06:50:59,160
ownership it's the cloud is great but

06:50:59,160 --> 06:51:00,530
ownership it's the cloud is great but
crypto gives you some of the

23410
06:51:00,530 --> 06:51:00,540
crypto gives you some of the
 

23411
06:51:00,540 --> 06:51:02,150
crypto gives you some of the
functionality of the cloud

23412
06:51:02,150 --> 06:51:02,160
functionality of the cloud
 

23413
06:51:02,160 --> 06:51:03,530
functionality of the cloud
while also having some of the

23414
06:51:03,530 --> 06:51:03,540
while also having some of the
 

23415
06:51:03,540 --> 06:51:04,788
while also having some of the
functionality offline world where you

23416
06:51:04,788 --> 06:51:04,798
functionality offline world where you
 

23417
06:51:04,798 --> 06:51:06,468
functionality offline world where you
have the keys so it's a v it's a V3

23418
06:51:06,468 --> 06:51:06,478
have the keys so it's a v it's a V3
 

23419
06:51:06,478 --> 06:51:08,090
have the keys so it's a v it's a V3
right it's you know it's continuous

23420
06:51:08,090 --> 06:51:08,100
right it's you know it's continuous
 

23421
06:51:08,100 --> 06:51:10,010
right it's you know it's continuous
theme right the V1 was offline I've got

23422
06:51:10,010 --> 06:51:10,020
theme right the V1 was offline I've got
 

23423
06:51:10,020 --> 06:51:11,690
theme right the V1 was offline I've got
a key I own it I have de facto control

23424
06:51:11,690 --> 06:51:11,700
a key I own it I have de facto control

V2 is a cloud someone else manages it

23426
06:51:13,850 --> 06:51:13,860
V2 is a cloud someone else manages it
 

23427
06:51:13,860 --> 06:51:15,350
V2 is a cloud someone else manages it
for me it's hosted I get collaboration

23428
06:51:15,350 --> 06:51:15,360
for me it's hosted I get collaboration
 

23429
06:51:15,360 --> 06:51:17,750
for me it's hosted I get collaboration
and so on V3 is the chain where you

23430
06:51:17,750 --> 06:51:17,760
and so on V3 is the chain where you
 

23431
06:51:17,760 --> 06:51:19,070
and so on V3 is the chain where you
combine aspects of those right you have

23432
06:51:19,070 --> 06:51:19,080
combine aspects of those right you have
 

23433
06:51:19,080 --> 06:51:20,868
combine aspects of those right you have
the global state of the cloud but you

23434
06:51:20,868 --> 06:51:20,878
the global state of the cloud but you
 

23435
06:51:20,878 --> 06:51:21,948
the global state of the cloud but you
have the local permission and

23436
06:51:21,948 --> 06:51:21,958
have the local permission and
 

23437
06:51:21,958 --> 06:51:24,170
have the local permission and
controlling of the private key okay so

23438
06:51:24,170 --> 06:51:24,180
controlling of the private key okay so
 

23439
06:51:24,180 --> 06:51:25,490
controlling of the private key okay so
that's why I'm a medium to long term

23440
06:51:25,490 --> 06:51:25,500
that's why I'm a medium to long term
 

23441
06:51:25,500 --> 06:51:26,990
that's why I'm a medium to long term
Ultra Bull on crypto and I've actually

23442
06:51:26,990 --> 06:51:27,000
Ultra Bull on crypto and I've actually
 

23443
06:51:27,000 --> 06:51:28,788
Ultra Bull on crypto and I've actually
there's a podcast I gave with a Simco

23444
06:51:28,788 --> 06:51:28,798
there's a podcast I gave with a Simco
 

23445
06:51:28,798 --> 06:51:30,530
there's a podcast I gave with a Simco
where I talked through how crypto

23446
06:51:30,530 --> 06:51:30,540
where I talked through how crypto
 

23447
06:51:30,540 --> 06:51:33,048
where I talked through how crypto
actually doesn't just go after Finance

23448
06:51:33,048 --> 06:51:33,058
actually doesn't just go after Finance
 

23449
06:51:33,058 --> 06:51:35,510
actually doesn't just go after Finance
so it's gold and it's wire transfers and

23450
06:51:35,510 --> 06:51:35,520
so it's gold and it's wire transfers and
 

23451
06:51:35,520 --> 06:51:36,948
so it's gold and it's wire transfers and
it's crowdfunding and it's all a finance

23452
06:51:36,948 --> 06:51:36,958
it's crowdfunding and it's all a finance
 

23453
06:51:36,958 --> 06:51:39,230
it's crowdfunding and it's all a finance
with D5 but it's actually also search

23454
06:51:39,230 --> 06:51:39,240
with D5 but it's actually also search
 

23455
06:51:39,240 --> 06:51:41,868
with D5 but it's actually also search
and it's social and it's messaging it's

23456
06:51:41,868 --> 06:51:41,878
and it's social and it's messaging it's
 

23457
06:51:41,878 --> 06:51:44,150
and it's social and it's messaging it's
actually even operating systems

23458
06:51:44,150 --> 06:51:44,160
actually even operating systems
 

23459
06:51:44,160 --> 06:51:46,368
actually even operating systems
um and uh and eventually cloud and

23460
06:51:46,368 --> 06:51:46,378
um and uh and eventually cloud and
 

23461
06:51:46,378 --> 06:51:47,750
um and uh and eventually cloud and
whatnot do you want me to talk about

23462
06:51:47,750 --> 06:51:47,760
whatnot do you want me to talk about
 

23463
06:51:47,760 --> 06:51:49,788
whatnot do you want me to talk about
that briefly yeah yeah if you can proof

23464
06:51:49,788 --> 06:51:49,798
that briefly yeah yeah if you can proof
 

23465
06:51:49,798 --> 06:51:51,190
that briefly yeah yeah if you can proof
you see social

23466
06:51:51,190 --> 06:51:51,200
you see social
 

23467
06:51:51,200 --> 06:51:55,070
you see social
how broad you see the effect of crypto

23468
06:51:55,070 --> 06:51:55,080
how broad you see the effect of crypto
 

23469
06:51:55,080 --> 06:51:57,110
how broad you see the effect of crypto
so first crypto is fundamentally a new

23470
06:51:57,110 --> 06:51:57,120
so first crypto is fundamentally a new
 

23471
06:51:57,120 --> 06:51:58,670
so first crypto is fundamentally a new
way of building back-end systems right

23472
06:51:58,670 --> 06:51:58,680
way of building back-end systems right

okay so now you suddenly see oh the

23630
06:54:38,330 --> 06:54:38,340
okay so now you suddenly see oh the
 

23631
06:54:38,340 --> 06:54:39,890
okay so now you suddenly see oh the
entire Social Web that Google couldn't

23632
06:54:39,890 --> 06:54:39,900
entire Social Web that Google couldn't
 

23633
06:54:39,900 --> 06:54:41,390
entire Social Web that Google couldn't
index It could only index a worldwide

23634
06:54:41,390 --> 06:54:41,400
index It could only index a worldwide
 

23635
06:54:41,400 --> 06:54:43,788
index It could only index a worldwide
web and not the Social Web now it's

23636
06:54:43,788 --> 06:54:43,798
web and not the Social Web now it's
 

23637
06:54:43,798 --> 06:54:46,788
web and not the Social Web now it's
actually the on-chain signed web

23638
06:54:46,788 --> 06:54:46,798
actually the on-chain signed web
 

23639
06:54:46,798 --> 06:54:48,590
actually the on-chain signed web
remember because every post is digitally

23640
06:54:48,590 --> 06:54:48,600
remember because every post is digitally
 

23641
06:54:48,600 --> 06:54:50,448
remember because every post is digitally
signed it's a new set of signals it's

23642
06:54:50,448 --> 06:54:50,458
signed it's a new set of signals it's
 

23643
06:54:50,458 --> 06:54:52,490
signed it's a new set of signals it's
way easier to index than either the

23644
06:54:52,490 --> 06:54:52,500
way easier to index than either the
 

23645
06:54:52,500 --> 06:54:53,868
way easier to index than either the
worldwide web or the Social Web because

23646
06:54:53,868 --> 06:54:53,878
worldwide web or the Social Web because
 

23647
06:54:53,878 --> 06:54:55,968
worldwide web or the Social Web because
it's open in public so this is a total

23648
06:54:55,968 --> 06:54:55,978
it's open in public so this is a total
 

23649
06:54:55,978 --> 06:54:57,708
it's open in public so this is a total
disruptive thing to search in the medium

23650
06:54:57,708 --> 06:54:57,718
disruptive thing to search in the medium
 

23651
06:54:57,718 --> 06:54:59,750
disruptive thing to search in the medium
term because the new kind of data sets

23652
06:54:59,750 --> 06:54:59,760
term because the new kind of data sets
 

23653
06:54:59,760 --> 06:55:01,310
term because the new kind of data sets
Index right

23654
06:55:01,310 --> 06:55:01,320
Index right
 

23655
06:55:01,320 --> 06:55:03,530
Index right
so that's how it's a threat to social to

23656
06:55:03,530 --> 06:55:03,540
so that's how it's a threat to social to
 

23657
06:55:03,540 --> 06:55:07,010
so that's how it's a threat to social to
search it is a threat to messaging why

23658
06:55:07,010 --> 06:55:07,020
search it is a threat to messaging why
 

23659
06:55:07,020 --> 06:55:08,990
search it is a threat to messaging why
because or it's disrupt eventually

23660
06:55:08,990 --> 06:55:09,000
because or it's disrupt eventually
 

23661
06:55:09,000 --> 06:55:10,490
because or it's disrupt eventually
because the ens name as I mentioned is

23662
06:55:10,490 --> 06:55:10,500
because the ens name as I mentioned is
 

23663
06:55:10,500 --> 06:55:12,350
because the ens name as I mentioned is
like a universal identifier you can send

23664
06:55:12,350 --> 06:55:12,360
like a universal identifier you can send
 

23665
06:55:12,360 --> 06:55:14,270
like a universal identifier you can send
encrypted messages between people that's

06:55:14,270 --> 06:55:14,280
encrypted messages between people that's
 

23667
06:55:14,280 --> 06:55:16,670
encrypted messages between people that's
a better primitive to base it on you

23668
06:55:16,670 --> 06:55:16,680
a better primitive to base it on you
 

23669
06:55:16,680 --> 06:55:18,830
a better primitive to base it on you
know WhatsApp is just claiming that

23670
06:55:18,830 --> 06:55:18,840
know WhatsApp is just claiming that
 

23671
06:55:18,840 --> 06:55:21,230
know WhatsApp is just claiming that
they're end to end encrypted but with an

they're end to end encrypted but with an
 

23673
06:55:21,240 --> 06:55:23,810
they're end to end encrypted but with an
ens name or with a crypto name you can

06:55:23,810 --> 06:55:23,820
ens name or with a crypto name you can
 

23675
06:55:23,820 --> 06:55:26,208
ens name or with a crypto name you can
be provably auditably and encrypted

23676
06:55:26,208 --> 06:55:26,218
be provably auditably and encrypted
 

23677
06:55:26,218 --> 06:55:27,230
be provably auditably and encrypted
because you're actually sending it back

23678
06:55:27,230 --> 06:55:27,240
because you're actually sending it back
 

23679
06:55:27,240 --> 06:55:28,548
because you're actually sending it back
and forth right because the private key

23680
06:55:28,548 --> 06:55:28,558
and forth right because the private key
 

23681
06:55:28,558 --> 06:55:30,468

important that is right you know you
 

23685
06:55:32,638 --> 06:55:34,850
important that is right you know you
could man in the middle signal or

23686
06:55:34,850 --> 06:55:34,860
could man in the middle signal or
 

23687
06:55:34,860 --> 06:55:36,230
could man in the middle signal or
Whatsapp because there's a server there

23688
06:55:36,230 --> 06:55:36,240
Whatsapp because there's a server there
 

23689
06:55:36,240 --> 06:55:38,090
Whatsapp because there's a server there
right if you have you know so n10

23690
06:55:38,090 --> 06:55:38,100
right if you have you know so n10
 

23691
06:55:38,100 --> 06:55:39,948
right if you have you know so n10
encrypted messaging will happen and with

06:55:39,948 --> 06:55:39,958
encrypted messaging will happen and with
 

23693
06:55:39,958 --> 06:55:41,208
encrypted messaging will happen and with
payments and all this other stuff okay

23694
06:55:41,208 --> 06:55:41,218
payments and all this other stuff okay
 

23695
06:55:41,218 --> 06:55:43,610
payments and all this other stuff okay
so you get the crypto messaging apps you

23696
06:55:43,610 --> 06:55:43,620
so you get the crypto messaging apps you
 

23697
06:55:43,620 --> 06:55:45,948
so you get the crypto messaging apps you
get uh operating systems why well the

23698
06:55:45,948 --> 06:55:45,958
get uh operating systems why well the
 

23699
06:55:45,958 --> 06:55:47,390
get uh operating systems why well the
frontier of operating systems I mean

23700
06:55:47,390 --> 06:55:47,400
frontier of operating systems I mean
 

23701
06:55:47,400 --> 06:55:49,910
frontier of operating systems I mean
look you know Windows uh Linux and Mac

23702
06:55:49,910 --> 06:55:49,920
look you know Windows uh Linux and Mac
 

23703
06:55:49,920 --> 06:55:52,490
look you know Windows uh Linux and Mac
OS have been around forever but if you

23705
06:55:52,500 --> 06:55:54,288
OS have been around forever but if you
actually think about you know what is a

actually think about you know what is a
 

23707
06:55:54,298 --> 06:55:55,490
actually think about you know what is a

blockchain
 

23709
06:55:55,500 --> 06:55:56,930

06:55:56,930 --> 06:55:56,940
well there's operating systems there's
 

23711

well there's operating systems there's
web browsers a blockchain is the most

it's got a programming language it's got

23722
06:56:07,430 --> 06:56:07,440
it's got a programming language it's got
 

23723
06:56:07,440 --> 06:56:09,350
it's got a programming language it's got
an ecosystem where people monetize on it

06:56:14,628 --> 06:56:14,638
each other this is a frontier of
 

23731
06:56:14,638 --> 06:56:16,128
each other this is a frontier of
operating systems research people

23732
06:56:16,128 --> 06:56:16,138
operating systems research people
 

23733
06:56:16,138 --> 06:56:17,330
operating systems research people
haven't thought of it that way right

23734
06:56:17,330 --> 06:56:17,340
haven't thought of it that way right
 

23735
06:56:17,340 --> 06:56:19,430
haven't thought of it that way right
it's also the frontier of a lot of

06:56:19,430 --> 06:56:19,440
it's also the frontier of a lot of
 

23737

24049
07:01:41,040 --> 07:01:43,250
ideology it's like this kind of back and
forth sometimes right now you think of

24050
07:01:43,250 --> 07:01:43,260
forth sometimes right now you think of
 

24051
07:01:43,260 --> 07:01:44,510
forth sometimes right now you think of
those as independent things but then

24052
07:01:44,510 --> 07:01:44,520
those as independent things but then
 

24053
07:01:44,520 --> 07:01:47,990
those as independent things but then
they fuse okay and so that's very clear

24054
07:01:47,990 --> 07:01:48,000
they fuse okay and so that's very clear
 

24055
07:01:48,000 --> 07:01:50,390
they fuse okay and so that's very clear
with the AI bias arguments where it just

24056
07:01:50,390 --> 07:01:50,400
with the AI bias arguments where it just
 

24057
07:01:50,400 --> 07:01:53,750
with the AI bias arguments where it just
so happens that it's so powerful Lex

24058
07:01:53,750 --> 07:01:53,760
so happens that it's so powerful Lex
 

24059

24061
07:01:55,620 --> 07:01:57,468
this technology is so powerful in the
wrong hands it could be used so we will

24062
07:01:57,468 --> 07:01:57,478
wrong hands it could be used so we will
 

24063
07:01:57,478 --> 07:01:59,690

07:02:17,150 --> 07:02:17,160
representation why is it centralized
 

24087
07:02:17,160 --> 07:02:18,468
representation why is it centralized
answer they're not actually concerned

24088
07:02:18,468 --> 07:02:18,478
answer they're not actually concerned
 

24089
07:02:18,478 --> 07:02:20,030
answer they're not actually concerned
about it they're making money right okay

24090
07:02:20,030 --> 07:02:20,040
about it they're making money right okay
 

24091
07:02:20,040 --> 07:02:23,150
about it they're making money right okay
so that is I think in a few words blows

24092
07:02:23,150 --> 07:02:23,160
so that is I think in a few words blows
 

24093
07:02:23,160 --> 07:02:26,208
so that is I think in a few words blows
up a lot of the AI bias type stuff right

24094
07:02:26,208 --> 07:02:26,218
up a lot of the AI bias type stuff right
 

24095
07:02:26,218 --> 07:02:28,070
up a lot of the AI bias type stuff right
okay

24096
07:02:28,070 --> 07:02:28,080
okay
 

24097
07:02:28,080 --> 07:02:29,570
okay
um they're basically they're biasing AI

24098
07:02:29,570 --> 07:02:29,580
um they're basically they're biasing AI
 

24099
07:02:29,580 --> 07:02:31,610
um they're basically they're biasing AI
all right so the amount of stuff that

24100
07:02:31,610 --> 07:02:31,620
all right so the amount of stuff that
 

24101
07:02:31,620 --> 07:02:33,350
all right so the amount of stuff that
can be done with AI now like it also

24102
07:02:33,350 --> 07:02:33,360
can be done with AI now like it also
 

24103
07:02:33,360 --> 07:02:34,548
can be done with AI now like it also
helps the pseudonymous economy as I was

24104
07:02:34,548 --> 07:02:34,558
helps the pseudonymous economy as I was
 

24105
07:02:34,558 --> 07:02:36,170
helps the pseudonymous economy as I was
talking about with the AI Zoom so you

24106
07:02:36,170 --> 07:02:36,180
talking about with the AI Zoom so you
 

24107
07:02:36,180 --> 07:02:38,628
talking about with the AI Zoom so you
have totally new sites uh totally new

24108
07:02:38,628 --> 07:02:38,638
have totally new sites uh totally new
 

24109
07:02:38,638 --> 07:02:40,490
have totally new sites uh totally new
apps that are based on that

24110
07:02:40,490 --> 07:02:40,500
apps that are based on that
 

24111
07:02:40,500 --> 07:02:44,448
apps that are based on that
um it uh I think it may

24112
07:02:44,448 --> 07:02:44,458
um it uh I think it may
 

24113
07:02:44,458 --> 07:02:45,770
um it uh I think it may
um

24114
07:02:45,770 --> 07:02:45,780
um
 

24115
07:02:45,780 --> 07:02:47,510
um
I mean it changes you're going to have

24116
07:02:47,510 --> 07:02:47,520
I mean it changes you're going to have
 

24117
07:02:47,520 --> 07:02:49,250
I mean it changes you're going to have
new Google Docs you know all these kinds

24118
07:02:49,250 --> 07:02:49,260
new Google Docs you know all these kinds
 

24119
07:02:49,260 --> 07:02:50,750
new Google Docs you know all these kinds
of things you might have

24120
07:02:50,750 --> 07:02:50,760
of things you might have
 

24121
07:02:50,760 --> 07:02:52,070
of things you might have
um you know once you can do things with

24122
07:02:52,070 --> 07:02:52,080
um you know once you can do things with
 

24123
07:02:52,080 --> 07:02:54,230
um you know once you can do things with
just a few Taps you might have sites

24124
07:02:54,230 --> 07:02:54,240
just a few Taps you might have sites
 

24125
07:02:54,240 --> 07:02:55,670
just a few Taps you might have sites
that are focused more on producing

24126
07:02:55,670 --> 07:02:55,680
that are focused more on producing
 

24127
07:02:55,680 --> 07:02:58,190
that are focused more on producing
rather than just consuming because you

24128
07:02:58,190 --> 07:02:58,200
rather than just consuming because you
 

24129
07:02:58,200 --> 07:02:59,990
rather than just consuming because you
know you might with AI you can change

24130
07:02:59,990 --> 07:03:00,000
know you might with AI you can change
 

24131
07:03:00,000 --> 07:03:01,968
know you might with AI you can change
the productivity of gestures you know

24132
07:03:01,968 --> 07:03:01,978
the productivity of gestures you know
 

24133
07:03:01,978 --> 07:03:04,430
the productivity of gestures you know
you can have a few gestures like like a

24134
07:03:04,430 --> 07:03:04,440
you can have a few gestures like like a
 

24135

with the Seattle diffusion where you

24138
07:03:08,090 --> 07:03:08,100
with the Seattle diffusion where you
 

24139
07:03:08,100 --> 07:03:10,368
with the Seattle diffusion where you
make a little cartoon third graders

24140
07:03:10,368 --> 07:03:10,378
make a little cartoon third graders
 

24141
07:03:10,378 --> 07:03:12,048

painting and it becomes a real painting
 

24143
07:03:12,058 --> 07:03:14,150

a lot of user interfaces will be

24144
07:03:14,150 --> 07:03:14,160
a lot of user interfaces will be
 

24145
07:03:14,160 --> 07:03:16,070
a lot of user interfaces will be
rethought now that you can actually do

24146
07:03:16,070 --> 07:03:16,080
rethought now that you can actually do
 

24147
07:03:16,080 --> 07:03:17,628
rethought now that you can actually do
this incredible stuff with that it knows

24148
07:03:17,628 --> 07:03:17,638
this incredible stuff with that it knows
 

24149
07:03:17,638 --> 07:03:19,610
this incredible stuff with that it knows
what you want it to do right

24150
07:03:19,610 --> 07:03:19,620
what you want it to do right
 

24151
07:03:19,620 --> 07:03:22,190
what you want it to do right
so um and I saw this funny thing which

24152
07:03:22,190 --> 07:03:22,200
so um and I saw this funny thing which
 

24153
07:03:22,200 --> 07:03:24,708
so um and I saw this funny thing which
was a riff on Peter thiel's line which

24154
07:03:24,708 --> 07:03:24,718
was a riff on Peter thiel's line which
 

24155
07:03:24,718 --> 07:03:26,208
was a riff on Peter thiel's line which
is AI centralized and crypto is

24156
07:03:26,208 --> 07:03:26,218
is AI centralized and crypto is
 

24157
07:03:26,218 --> 07:03:28,190
is AI centralized and crypto is
decentralized and and somebody was

24158
07:03:28,190 --> 07:03:28,200
decentralized and and somebody was
 

24159
07:03:28,200 --> 07:03:29,628
decentralized and and somebody was
saying actually it turns out crypto

24160
07:03:29,628 --> 07:03:29,638
saying actually it turns out crypto
 

24161
07:03:29,638 --> 07:03:31,788
saying actually it turns out crypto
centralized with the cbdc's and stable

24162
07:03:31,788 --> 07:03:31,798
centralized with the cbdc's and stable
 

24163
07:03:31,798 --> 07:03:33,410
centralized with the cbdc's and stable
coin and so on but AI is getting

24164
07:03:33,410 --> 07:03:33,420
coin and so on but AI is getting
 

24165
07:03:33,420 --> 07:03:35,030
coin and so on but AI is getting
decentralized with civil diffusion haha

24166
07:03:35,030 --> 07:03:35,040
decentralized with civil diffusion haha
 

24167
07:03:35,040 --> 07:03:36,530
decentralized with civil diffusion haha
right which is funny and I think there's

24168
07:03:36,530 --> 07:03:36,540
right which is funny and I think there's
 

24169
07:03:36,540 --> 07:03:37,788
right which is funny and I think there's
centralized and decentralized versions

24170
07:03:37,788 --> 07:03:37,798
centralized and decentralized versions
 

24171
07:03:37,798 --> 07:03:39,948
centralized and decentralized versions
of each of these right and finally the

24172
07:03:39,948 --> 07:03:39,958
of each of these right and finally the
 

24173
07:03:39,958 --> 07:03:42,170
of each of these right and finally the
third poll that actually you know teal

24174
07:03:42,170 --> 07:03:42,180
third poll that actually you know teal
 

24175
07:03:42,180 --> 07:03:43,730
third poll that actually you know teal
uh you know he talks about Ai and crypto

24176
07:03:43,730 --> 07:03:43,740
uh you know he talks about Ai and crypto
 

24177
07:03:43,740 --> 07:03:44,930
uh you know he talks about Ai and crypto
but the third poll is actually that's

24178
07:03:44,930 --> 07:03:44,940
but the third poll is actually that's
 

24179
07:03:44,940 --> 07:03:46,128
but the third poll is actually that's
sort of underappreciated because people

24180
07:03:46,128 --> 07:03:46,138
sort of underappreciated because people
 

24181
07:03:46,138 --> 07:03:47,868
sort of underappreciated because people
think it already exists is social that

24182
07:03:47,868 --> 07:03:47,878
think it already exists is social that
 

24183
07:03:47,878 --> 07:03:49,850
think it already exists is social that
just keeping on going right and

24184
07:03:49,850 --> 07:03:49,860
just keeping on going right and
 

24185
07:03:49,860 --> 07:03:52,250
just keeping on going right and
obviously the next step in Social is AR

24186
07:03:52,250 --> 07:03:52,260
obviously the next step in Social is AR
 

24187
07:03:52,260 --> 07:03:53,810
obviously the next step in Social is AR
and VR and why is it so obvious because

24188
07:03:53,810 --> 07:03:53,820
and VR and why is it so obvious because
 

24189
07:03:53,820 --> 07:03:55,788
and VR and why is it so obvious because
it's meta you know it's Facebook now I

24190
07:03:55,788 --> 07:03:55,798
it's meta you know it's Facebook now I
 

24191
07:03:55,798 --> 07:03:57,770
it's meta you know it's Facebook now I
saw this very silly article it's like oh

24192
07:03:57,770 --> 07:03:57,780
saw this very silly article it's like oh
 

24193
07:03:57,780 --> 07:03:59,390
saw this very silly article it's like oh
my God Facebook is so dumb for putting a

24194
07:03:59,390 --> 07:03:59,400
my God Facebook is so dumb for putting a
 

24195
07:03:59,400 --> 07:04:01,250

10 billion dollars into you know virtual

24196
07:04:01,250 --> 07:04:01,260
10 billion dollars into you know virtual
 

24197
07:04:01,260 --> 07:04:03,890

reality right and I'm like

24198
07:04:03,890 --> 07:04:03,900
reality right and I'm like
 

24199
07:04:03,900 --> 07:04:06,170

okay the most predictable innovation in

24200
07:04:06,170 --> 07:04:06,180
okay the most predictable innovation in
 

24201
07:04:06,180 --> 07:04:08,330
okay the most predictable innovation in
the world in my view is the AR glasses

24202
07:04:08,330 --> 07:04:08,340
the world in my view is the AR glasses
 

24203
07:04:08,340 --> 07:04:09,948
the world in my view is the AR glasses
have you talked about this on the

24204
07:04:09,948 --> 07:04:09,958
have you talked about this on the
 

24205
07:04:09,958 --> 07:04:13,190
have you talked about this on the
podcast before AR VR um of course a lot

24206
07:04:13,190 --> 07:04:13,200
podcast before AR VR um of course a lot
 

24207
07:04:13,200 --> 07:04:14,990
podcast before AR VR um of course a lot
but the AR is not as obvious actually

24208
07:04:14,990 --> 07:04:15,000
but the AR is not as obvious actually
 

24209
07:04:15,000 --> 07:04:17,510
but the AR is not as obvious actually
okay so AR glasses what what are AR

24210
07:04:17,510 --> 07:04:17,520
okay so AR glasses what what are AR
 

24211
07:04:17,520 --> 07:04:19,788
okay so AR glasses what what are AR
glasses so you take Stamp Set spectacles

24212
07:04:19,788 --> 07:04:19,798
glasses so you take Stamp Set spectacles

so only you have a window into this
 

24285
07:05:45,120 --> 07:05:47,628
so only you have a window into this
artificial world that's right and then

24286
07:05:47,628 --> 07:05:47,638
artificial world that's right and then
 

24287
07:05:47,638 --> 07:05:49,670
artificial world that's right and then
here's another thing which shows you

24288
07:05:49,670 --> 07:05:49,680
here's another thing which shows you
 

24289
07:05:49,680 --> 07:05:51,468
here's another thing which shows you
another piece of it

24290
07:05:51,468 --> 07:05:51,478
another piece of it
 

24291
07:05:51,478 --> 07:05:55,548
another piece of it
and this is using ens to unlock a door

24292
07:05:55,548 --> 07:05:55,558
and this is using ens to unlock a door
 

24293
07:05:55,558 --> 07:05:57,048
and this is using ens to unlock a door
so this is an nft use for something

24294
07:05:57,048 --> 07:05:57,058
so this is an nft use for something
 

24295
07:05:57,058 --> 07:05:58,190
so this is an nft use for something
different so the first one was using the

24296
07:05:58,190 --> 07:05:58,200
different so the first one was using the
 

24297
07:05:58,200 --> 07:06:00,830
different so the first one was using the
nft effectively to see something and the

24298
07:06:00,830 --> 07:06:00,840
nft effectively to see something and the
 

24299
07:06:00,840 --> 07:06:02,350
nft effectively to see something and the
second is using the nft to do something

24300
07:06:02,350 --> 07:06:02,360
second is using the nft to do something
 

24301
07:06:02,360 --> 07:06:05,990
second is using the nft to do something
okay so based on your on-chain

24302
07:06:05,990 --> 07:06:06,000
okay so based on your on-chain
 

24303
07:06:06,000 --> 07:06:08,448
okay so based on your on-chain
communication right

24304
07:06:08,448 --> 07:06:08,458
communication right

07:07:41,750 --> 07:07:41,760
have a keyboard outside or just even
 

24393
07:07:41,760 --> 07:07:43,310
have a keyboard outside or just even
like a

24394
07:07:43,310 --> 07:07:43,320
like a
 

24395
07:07:43,320 --> 07:07:45,770
like a
um you could even have a desk like this

24396
07:07:45,770 --> 07:07:45,780
um you could even have a desk like this
 

24397
07:07:45,780 --> 07:07:47,750
um you could even have a desk like this
you know if you had

24398
07:07:47,750 --> 07:07:47,760
you know if you had
 

24399
07:07:47,760 --> 07:07:49,430
you know if you had
um if you can touch type you could

24400
07:07:49,430 --> 07:07:49,440
um if you can touch type you could
 

24401
07:07:49,440 --> 07:07:50,570
um if you can touch type you could
imagine something where you look down

24402
07:07:50,570 --> 07:07:50,580
imagine something where you look down
 

24403
07:07:50,580 --> 07:07:52,850
imagine something where you look down
and you can see a keyboard with your AR

24404
07:07:52,850 --> 07:07:52,860
and you can see a keyboard with your AR
 

24405
07:07:52,860 --> 07:07:55,010
and you can see a keyboard with your AR
glasses and it registers it and then you

24406
07:07:55,010 --> 07:07:55,020
glasses and it registers it and then you
 

24407
07:07:55,020 --> 07:07:56,750
glasses and it registers it and then you
can type like this right and probably

24408
07:07:56,750 --> 07:07:56,760
can type like this right and probably
 

24409
07:07:56,760 --> 07:07:58,610
can type like this right and probably
you could have some AI that could you

24410
07:07:58,610 --> 07:07:58,620
you could have some AI that could you
 

24411
07:07:58,620 --> 07:08:00,048
you could have some AI that could you
know figure out what you meant rather

24412
07:08:00,048 --> 07:08:00,058
know figure out what you meant rather
 

24413
07:08:00,058 --> 07:08:03,288
know figure out what you meant rather
than what you were doing right okay so

24414
07:08:03,288 --> 07:08:03,298
than what you were doing right okay so
 

24415
07:08:03,298 --> 07:08:05,330
than what you were doing right okay so
that's Ai and social media that's AR and

24416
07:08:05,330 --> 07:08:05,340
that's Ai and social media that's AR and
 

24417
07:08:05,340 --> 07:08:07,610
that's Ai and social media that's AR and
social media but really

24418
07:08:07,610 --> 07:08:07,620
social media but really
 

24419
07:08:07,620 --> 07:08:08,930
social media but really
um one last thing I'll say which is a

24420
07:08:08,930 --> 07:08:08,940
um one last thing I'll say which is a
 

24421
07:08:08,940 --> 07:08:11,150
um one last thing I'll say which is a
non-obvious non-techological part is I

24422
07:08:11,150 --> 07:08:11,160
non-obvious non-techological part is I
 

24423
07:08:11,160 --> 07:08:13,310
non-obvious non-techological part is I
think we'll go from

24424
07:08:13,310 --> 07:08:13,320
think we'll go from
 

24425
07:08:13,320 --> 07:08:15,708
think we'll go from
very broad networks which are hundreds

24426

07:08:58,920 --> 07:08:59,868
problem with Facebook or Twitter is it's
a bunch of different communities that

07:10:26,868 --> 07:10:26,878
can have but let me just ask you
 

24545
07:10:26,878 --> 07:10:29,030
can have but let me just ask you
uh there's a lot of people that look up

24546
07:10:29,030 --> 07:10:29,040
uh there's a lot of people that look up
 

24547
07:10:29,040 --> 07:10:30,410
uh there's a lot of people that look up
to you so if there's somebody who's

24548
07:10:30,410 --> 07:10:30,420
to you so if there's somebody who's
 

24549
07:10:30,420 --> 07:10:33,948
to you so if there's somebody who's
young in high school early college

24550
07:10:33,948 --> 07:10:33,958
young in high school early college
 

24551
07:10:33,958 --> 07:10:35,930
young in high school early college
trying to figure out what the heck to do

24552
07:10:35,930 --> 07:10:35,940
trying to figure out what the heck to do
 

24553
07:10:35,940 --> 07:10:37,788
trying to figure out what the heck to do
with their life what to do with their

24554
07:10:37,788 --> 07:10:37,798
with their life what to do with their
 

24555
07:10:37,798 --> 07:10:39,650
with their life what to do with their
career what advice could you give them

24556
07:10:39,650 --> 07:10:39,660
career what advice could you give them
 

24557
07:10:39,660 --> 07:10:42,468
career what advice could you give them
how they could have a career they can be

24558
07:10:42,468 --> 07:10:42,478
how they could have a career they can be
 

24559
07:10:42,478 --> 07:10:44,750
how they could have a career they can be
proud of or how they can have a life

24560
07:10:44,750 --> 07:10:44,760
proud of or how they can have a life
 

24561
07:10:44,760 --> 07:10:46,548
proud of or how they can have a life
they can be proud of at least what I

24562
07:10:46,548 --> 07:10:46,558
they can be proud of at least what I
 

24563
07:10:46,558 --> 07:10:47,990
they can be proud of at least what I
would do and then it can take it or

24564
07:10:47,990 --> 07:10:48,000
would do and then it can take it or
 

24565
07:10:48,000 --> 07:10:50,708
would do and then it can take it or
leave it or what have you but uh so

24566
07:10:50,708 --> 07:10:50,718
leave it or what have you but uh so
 

24567
07:10:50,718 --> 07:10:53,510
leave it or what have you but uh so
yeah to maybe to your younger self

24568
07:10:53,510 --> 07:10:53,520
yeah to maybe to your younger self
 

24569
07:10:53,520 --> 07:10:55,548
yeah to maybe to your younger self
advice to your younger self you know my

24570
07:10:55,548 --> 07:10:55,558
advice to your younger self you know my
 

24571
07:10:55,558 --> 07:10:59,390
advice to your younger self you know my
friend novel is uh you know he this is a

24572
07:10:59,390 --> 07:10:59,400
friend novel is uh you know he this is a
 

24573
07:10:59,400 --> 07:11:01,070
friend novel is uh you know he this is a
lot of what he puts out is the very

24574
07:11:01,070 --> 07:11:01,080
lot of what he puts out is the very
 

24575
07:11:01,080 --> 07:11:03,590
lot of what he puts out is the very
practical you know brass tax next steps

24576
07:11:03,590 --> 07:11:03,600
practical you know brass tax next steps
 

24577
07:11:03,600 --> 07:11:07,310
practical you know brass tax next steps
and I tend towards the you know macro of

24578
07:11:07,310 --> 07:11:07,320
and I tend towards the you know macro of
 

24579
07:11:07,320 --> 07:11:09,048
and I tend towards the you know macro of
course we both do sort of you know both

24580
07:11:09,048 --> 07:11:09,058
course we both do sort of you know both
 

24581
07:11:09,058 --> 07:11:10,610
course we both do sort of you know both
kind of thing right

24582
07:11:10,610 --> 07:11:10,620
kind of thing right
 

24583
07:11:10,620 --> 07:11:12,048
kind of thing right
um but let's talk brass tack's next

24584
07:11:12,048 --> 07:11:12,058
um but let's talk brass tack's next
 

24585
07:11:12,058 --> 07:11:14,628
um but let's talk brass tack's next
steps because I actually am practical uh

24586
07:11:14,628 --> 07:11:14,638
steps because I actually am practical uh
 

24587
07:11:14,638 --> 07:11:16,368
steps because I actually am practical uh
or at least practical enough you know to

24588
07:11:16,368 --> 07:11:16,378
or at least practical enough you know to
 

24589
07:11:16,378 --> 07:11:18,410
or at least practical enough you know to
get things done I think it's just like

24590
07:11:18,410 --> 07:11:18,420
get things done I think it's just like
 

24591
07:11:18,420 --> 07:11:20,750
get things done I think it's just like
you said you're breaking up the new book

24592
07:11:20,750 --> 07:11:20,760
you said you're breaking up the new book
 

24593
07:11:20,760 --> 07:11:23,390
you said you're breaking up the new book
into three yes is motivation theory and

24594
07:11:23,390 --> 07:11:23,400
into three yes is motivation theory and
 

24595
07:11:23,400 --> 07:11:25,128
into three yes is motivation theory and
practice motivation theory and practice

24596
07:11:25,128 --> 07:11:25,138
practice motivation theory and practice
 

24597
07:11:25,138 --> 07:11:27,890
practice motivation theory and practice
that's right and social practice so

24598
07:11:27,890 --> 07:11:27,900
that's right and social practice so
 

24599
07:11:27,900 --> 07:11:29,930
that's right and social practice so
let's talk practice okay in visual scale

24600
07:11:29,930 --> 07:11:29,940
let's talk practice okay in visual scale
 

24601
07:11:29,940 --> 07:11:32,810
let's talk practice okay in visual scale
right so first what skill do you learn

24602
07:11:32,810 --> 07:11:32,820
right so first what skill do you learn
 

24603
07:11:32,820 --> 07:11:35,690
right so first what skill do you learn
as you know young kid right

24604
07:11:35,690 --> 07:11:35,700
as you know young kid right
 

24605
07:11:35,700 --> 07:11:38,270
as you know young kid right
um so let me let me just give what the

24606
07:11:38,270 --> 07:11:38,280
um so let me let me just give what the
 

24607
07:11:38,280 --> 07:11:40,190
um so let me let me just give what the
the ideal full stack thing is and then

24608
07:11:40,190 --> 07:11:40,200
the ideal full stack thing is and then
 

24609
07:11:40,200 --> 07:11:41,448
the ideal full stack thing is and then
you have to say okay I'm good

24610
07:11:41,448 --> 07:11:41,458
you have to say okay I'm good
 

24611
07:11:41,458 --> 07:11:43,490
you have to say okay I'm good
quantitatively I'm good verbally I'm

24612
07:11:43,490 --> 07:11:43,500
quantitatively I'm good verbally I'm
 

24613
07:11:43,500 --> 07:11:45,468
quantitatively I'm good verbally I'm
good at this I'm good that right so the

24614
07:11:45,468 --> 07:11:45,478
good at this I'm good that right so the
 

24615
07:11:45,478 --> 07:11:48,530
good at this I'm good that right so the
ideal is you are full stack engineer and

24616
07:11:48,530 --> 07:11:48,540
ideal is you are full stack engineer and
 

24617
07:11:48,540 --> 07:11:50,330
ideal is you are full stack engineer and
full stack influencer or full stack

24618
07:11:50,330 --> 07:11:50,340
full stack influencer or full stack
 

24619
07:11:50,340 --> 07:11:52,070
full stack influencer or full stack
engineer full stack Creator okay so

24620
07:11:52,070 --> 07:11:52,080
engineer full stack Creator okay so
 

24621
07:11:52,080 --> 07:11:53,690
engineer full stack Creator okay so
that's both right brain and you know

24622
07:11:53,690 --> 07:11:53,700
that's both right brain and you know
 

24623
07:11:53,700 --> 07:11:56,090
that's both right brain and you know
left brain all right so what does that

24624
07:11:56,090 --> 07:11:56,100
left brain all right so what does that
 

24625
07:11:56,100 --> 07:11:57,288
left brain all right so what does that
mean with engineering that means you

24626
07:11:57,288 --> 07:11:57,298
mean with engineering that means you
 

24627
07:11:57,298 --> 07:12:00,230
mean with engineering that means you
master computer science and statistics

24628
07:12:00,230 --> 07:12:00,240
master computer science and statistics
 

24629
07:12:00,240 --> 07:12:02,448
master computer science and statistics
okay and of course it's also good to

24630
07:12:02,448 --> 07:12:02,458
okay and of course it's also good to
 

24631
07:12:02,458 --> 07:12:04,250
okay and of course it's also good to
know physics and continuous math and so

24632
07:12:04,250 --> 07:12:04,260
know physics and continuous math and so
 

24633
07:12:04,260 --> 07:12:05,390
know physics and continuous math and so
on that's actually quite valuable to

24634
07:12:05,390 --> 07:12:05,400
on that's actually quite valuable to
 

24635
07:12:05,400 --> 07:12:07,128
on that's actually quite valuable to
know and you might need to use a lot of

24636
07:12:07,128 --> 07:12:07,138
know and you might need to use a lot of
 

24637
07:12:07,138 --> 07:12:09,468
know and you might need to use a lot of
that continuous math with AI nowadays

24638
07:12:09,468 --> 07:12:09,478
that continuous math with AI nowadays
 

24639
07:12:09,478 --> 07:12:10,490
that continuous math with AI nowadays
right because a lot of that is actually

24640
07:12:10,490 --> 07:12:10,500
right because a lot of that is actually
 

24641
07:12:10,500 --> 07:12:11,930
right because a lot of that is actually
helpful right

24642
07:12:11,930 --> 07:12:11,940
helpful right
 

24643
07:12:11,940 --> 07:12:14,208
helpful right
um great descent and whatnot but

24644
07:12:14,208 --> 07:12:14,218
um great descent and whatnot but
 

24645
07:12:14,218 --> 07:12:17,090
um great descent and whatnot but
computer science and stats are to this

24646
07:12:17,090 --> 07:12:17,100
computer science and stats are to this
 

24647
07:12:17,100 --> 07:12:19,968
computer science and stats are to this
Century what physics was to the last why

24648
07:12:19,968 --> 07:12:19,978
Century what physics was to the last why
 

24649
07:12:19,978 --> 07:12:22,730
Century what physics was to the last why
because for example what percentage of

24650
07:12:22,730 --> 07:12:22,740
because for example what percentage of
 

24651
07:12:22,740 --> 07:12:24,350
because for example what percentage of
your time do you spend looking at a

24652
07:12:24,350 --> 07:12:24,360
your time do you spend looking at a
 

24653
07:12:24,360 --> 07:12:26,150
your time do you spend looking at a
screen of some kind

24654
07:12:26,150 --> 07:12:26,160
screen of some kind
 

24655
07:12:26,160 --> 07:12:28,070
screen of some kind
large processors at the time a large

24656
07:12:28,070 --> 07:12:28,080
large processors at the time a large
 

24657
07:12:28,080 --> 07:12:29,030
large processors at the time a large
percentage of the time right probably

24658
07:12:29,030 --> 07:12:29,040
percentage of the time right probably
 

24659
07:12:29,040 --> 07:12:31,368
percentage of the time right probably
more than you know for many people it's

24660
07:12:31,368 --> 07:12:31,378
more than you know for many people it's
 

24661
07:12:31,378 --> 07:12:33,230
more than you know for many people it's
more than 50 of their waking hours if

24662
07:12:33,230 --> 07:12:33,240
more than 50 of their waking hours if
 

24663
07:12:33,240 --> 07:12:35,270
more than 50 of their waking hours if
you include laptop you include cell

24664
07:12:35,270 --> 07:12:35,280
you include laptop you include cell
 

24665
07:12:35,280 --> 07:12:38,030
you include laptop you include cell
phone tablet you know your watch you

24666
07:12:38,030 --> 07:12:38,040
phone tablet you know your watch you
 

24667
07:12:38,040 --> 07:12:39,650
phone tablet you know your watch you
know maybe monitor of some kind right

24668
07:12:39,650 --> 07:12:39,660
know maybe monitor of some kind right
 

24669
07:12:39,660 --> 07:12:41,330
know maybe monitor of some kind right
all those together is probably it's a

24670
07:12:41,330 --> 07:12:41,340
all those together is probably it's a
 

24671
07:12:41,340 --> 07:12:43,548
all those together is probably it's a
lot okay which means and then that's

24672
07:12:43,548 --> 07:12:43,558
lot okay which means and then that's
 

24673
07:12:43,558 --> 07:12:45,048
lot okay which means and then that's
going to only increase with ar glasses

24674
07:12:45,048 --> 07:12:45,058
going to only increase with ar glasses
 

24675
07:12:45,058 --> 07:12:48,288
going to only increase with ar glasses
okay which means most of the rest of

24676
07:12:48,288 --> 07:12:48,298
okay which means most of the rest of
 

24677
07:12:48,298 --> 07:12:49,730
okay which means most of the rest of
your life will be spent in a sense in

24678
07:12:49,730 --> 07:12:49,740
your life will be spent in a sense in
 

24679
07:12:49,740 --> 07:12:51,110
your life will be spent in a sense in
The Matrix

24680
07:12:51,110 --> 07:12:51,120
The Matrix
 

24681
07:12:51,120 --> 07:12:53,750
The Matrix
okay in a constructed Digital World

24682
07:12:53,750 --> 07:12:53,760
okay in a constructed Digital World
 

24683
07:12:53,760 --> 07:12:56,628
okay in a constructed Digital World
which is more interesting in some sense

24684
07:12:56,628 --> 07:12:56,638
which is more interesting in some sense
 

24685
07:12:56,638 --> 07:12:58,368
which is more interesting in some sense
in the offline world it's because we

24686
07:12:58,368 --> 07:12:58,378
in the offline world it's because we
 

24687
07:12:58,378 --> 07:12:59,750
in the offline world it's because we
look at it more it changes faster it's

24688
07:12:59,750 --> 07:12:59,760
look at it more it changes faster it's
 

24689
07:12:59,760 --> 07:13:02,090
look at it more it changes faster it's
right and where the physics are set by

24690
07:13:02,090 --> 07:13:02,100
right and where the physics are set by
 

24691
07:13:02,100 --> 07:13:06,048
right and where the physics are set by
programmers okay and uh what that means

24692
07:13:06,048 --> 07:13:06,058
programmers okay and uh what that means
 

24693
07:13:06,058 --> 07:13:08,448
programmers okay and uh what that means
is you know physics itself is obviously

24694
07:13:08,448 --> 07:13:08,458
is you know physics itself is obviously
 

24695
07:13:08,458 --> 07:13:09,770
is you know physics itself is obviously
very important for the natural world

24696
07:13:09,770 --> 07:13:09,780
very important for the natural world
 

24697
07:13:09,780 --> 07:13:11,990
very important for the natural world
computer science and stats are for the

24698
07:13:11,990 --> 07:13:12,000
computer science and stats are for the
 

24699
07:13:12,000 --> 07:13:14,628
computer science and stats are for the
artificial world right and uh why is

24700
07:13:14,628 --> 07:13:14,638
artificial world right and uh why is
 

24701
07:13:14,638 --> 07:13:16,968
artificial world right and uh why is
that because every domain

24702
07:13:16,968 --> 07:13:16,978
that because every domain
 

24703
07:13:16,978 --> 07:13:19,368
that because every domain
has algorithms and data structures

24704
07:13:19,368 --> 07:13:19,378
has algorithms and data structures
 

24705
07:13:19,378 --> 07:13:22,128
has algorithms and data structures
whether it's you Aviation okay you go to

24706
07:13:22,128 --> 07:13:22,138
whether it's you Aviation okay you go to
 

24707
07:13:22,138 --> 07:13:24,350
whether it's you Aviation okay you go to
American Airlines right they're gonna

24708
07:13:24,350 --> 07:13:24,360
American Airlines right they're gonna
 

24709
07:13:24,360 --> 07:13:28,368
American Airlines right they're gonna
have you know uh planes and seats and

24710
07:13:28,368 --> 07:13:28,378
have you know uh planes and seats and
 

24711
07:13:28,378 --> 07:13:30,230
have you know uh planes and seats and
tickets and so on such as data

24712
07:13:30,230 --> 07:13:30,240
tickets and so on such as data
 

24713
07:13:30,240 --> 07:13:31,128
tickets and so on such as data
structures and you're gonna have

24714
07:13:31,128 --> 07:13:31,138
structures and you're gonna have
 

24715
07:13:31,138 --> 07:13:32,510
structures and you're gonna have
algorithms and functions that connect

24716
07:13:32,510 --> 07:13:32,520
algorithms and functions that connect
 

24717
07:13:32,520 --> 07:13:33,890
algorithms and functions that connect
them you're gonna have tables that those

24718
07:13:33,890 --> 07:13:33,900
them you're gonna have tables that those
 

24719
07:13:33,900 --> 07:13:36,110
them you're gonna have tables that those
data is run to if it's Walmart you're

24720
07:13:36,110 --> 07:13:36,120
data is run to if it's Walmart you're
 

24721
07:13:36,120 --> 07:13:38,330
data is run to if it's Walmart you're
going to have skus and you're going to

24722
07:13:38,330 --> 07:13:38,340
going to have skus and you're going to
 

24723
07:13:38,340 --> 07:13:39,830
going to have skus and you're going to
have shelves you're going to have so you

24724
07:13:39,830 --> 07:13:39,840
have shelves you're going to have so you
 

24725
07:13:39,840 --> 07:13:40,730
have shelves you're going to have so you
have data structures and you have

24726
07:13:40,730 --> 07:13:40,740
have data structures and you have
 

24727
07:13:40,740 --> 07:13:42,708
have data structures and you have
algorithms connect them so every single

24728
07:13:42,708 --> 07:13:42,718
algorithms connect them so every single
 

24729
07:13:42,718 --> 07:13:44,990
algorithms connect them so every single
area you have algorithms and data

24730
07:13:44,990 --> 07:13:45,000
area you have algorithms and data
 

24731
07:13:45,000 --> 07:13:46,490
area you have algorithms and data
structures which is computer science and

24732
07:13:46,490 --> 07:13:46,500
structures which is computer science and
 

24733
07:13:46,500 --> 07:13:49,548
structures which is computer science and
stats and so you're going to

24734
07:13:49,548 --> 07:13:49,558
stats and so you're going to
 

24735
07:13:49,558 --> 07:13:51,708
stats and so you're going to
um collect the data and analyze it right

24736
07:13:51,708 --> 07:13:51,718
um collect the data and analyze it right
 

24737
07:13:51,718 --> 07:13:53,390
um collect the data and analyze it right
and so that means if you have that base

24738
07:13:53,390 --> 07:13:53,400
and so that means if you have that base
 

24739
07:13:53,400 --> 07:13:55,430
and so that means if you have that base
of Cs and stats where you're really

24740
07:13:55,430 --> 07:13:55,440
of Cs and stats where you're really
 

24741
07:13:55,440 --> 07:13:58,010
of Cs and stats where you're really
strong and you understand you know the

24742
07:13:58,010 --> 07:13:58,020
strong and you understand you know the
 

24743
07:13:58,020 --> 07:13:59,810
strong and you understand you know the
theory as well as the practice right and

24744
07:13:59,810 --> 07:13:59,820
theory as well as the practice right and
 

24745
07:13:59,820 --> 07:14:01,250
theory as well as the practice right and
you need both okay because you need to

24746
07:14:01,250 --> 07:14:01,260
you need both okay because you need to
 

24747
07:14:01,260 --> 07:14:04,310
you need both okay because you need to
understand you know obviously basic

24748
07:14:04,310 --> 07:14:04,320
understand you know obviously basic
 

24749
07:14:04,320 --> 07:14:06,350
understand you know obviously basic
stuff like Big O notation and whatnot

24750
07:14:06,350 --> 07:14:06,360
stuff like Big O notation and whatnot
 

24751
07:14:06,360 --> 07:14:08,030
stuff like Big O notation and whatnot
and uh you need to understand all your

24752
07:14:08,030 --> 07:14:08,040
and uh you need to understand all your
 

24753
07:14:08,040 --> 07:14:10,310
and uh you need to understand all your
probability distributions okay

24754
07:14:10,310 --> 07:14:10,320
probability distributions okay
 

24755
07:14:10,320 --> 07:14:11,810
probability distributions okay
um you know good exercise by the way is

24756
07:14:11,810 --> 07:14:11,820
um you know good exercise by the way is
 

24757
07:14:11,820 --> 07:14:14,208
um you know good exercise by the way is
to go from the

24758
07:14:14,208 --> 07:14:14,218
to go from the
 

24759
07:14:14,218 --> 07:14:16,910
to go from the
um Bernoulli trials right to everything

24760
07:14:16,910 --> 07:14:16,920
um Bernoulli trials right to everything
 

24761
07:14:16,920 --> 07:14:18,708
um Bernoulli trials right to everything
else because you can go Bernoulli trials

24762
07:14:18,708 --> 07:14:18,718
else because you can go Bernoulli trials
 

24763
07:14:18,718 --> 07:14:20,868
else because you can go Bernoulli trials
to the binomial distribution to the

24764
07:14:20,868 --> 07:14:20,878
to the binomial distribution to the
 

24765
07:14:20,878 --> 07:14:23,208
to the binomial distribution to the
gaussian you can also from you know

24766
07:14:23,208 --> 07:14:23,218
gaussian you can also from you know
 

24767
07:14:23,218 --> 07:14:24,708
gaussian you can also from you know
Bernoulli trials to the geometric

24768
07:14:24,708 --> 07:14:24,718
Bernoulli trials to the geometric
 

24769
07:14:24,718 --> 07:14:26,570
Bernoulli trials to the geometric
distribution and so on you can drive

24770
07:14:26,570 --> 07:14:26,580
distribution and so on you can drive
 

24771
07:14:26,580 --> 07:14:28,368
distribution and so on you can drive
everything from this right and computer

24772
07:14:28,368 --> 07:14:28,378
everything from this right and computer
 

24773
07:14:28,378 --> 07:14:30,770
everything from this right and computer
science includes not just Big O but

24774
07:14:30,770 --> 07:14:30,780
science includes not just Big O but
 

24775
07:14:30,780 --> 07:14:32,570
science includes not just Big O but
software engineering well computer

24776
07:14:32,570 --> 07:14:32,580
software engineering well computer
 

24777
07:14:32,580 --> 07:14:33,890
software engineering well computer
science is Theory software engineering

24778
07:14:33,890 --> 07:14:33,900
science is Theory software engineering
 

24779
07:14:33,900 --> 07:14:37,030
science is Theory software engineering
is practice right yeah you could argue

24780
07:14:37,030 --> 07:14:37,040
is practice right yeah you could argue
 

24781
07:14:37,040 --> 07:14:39,230
is practice right yeah you could argue
probability and stats is theory and then

24782
07:14:39,230 --> 07:14:39,240
probability and stats is theory and then
 

24783
07:14:39,240 --> 07:14:40,670
probability and stats is theory and then
data science is practice

24784
07:14:40,670 --> 07:14:40,680
data science is practice
 

24785
07:14:40,680 --> 07:14:43,070
data science is practice
sure right and so you include all of

24786
07:14:43,070 --> 07:14:43,080
sure right and so you include all of
 

24787
07:14:43,080 --> 07:14:45,288
sure right and so you include all of
that together as a package that's theory

24788
07:14:45,288 --> 07:14:45,298
that together as a package that's theory
 

24789
07:14:45,298 --> 07:14:47,150
that together as a package that's theory
in practice right I mean look it's okay

24790
07:14:47,150 --> 07:14:47,160
in practice right I mean look it's okay
 

24791
07:14:47,160 --> 07:14:49,190
in practice right I mean look it's okay
to use

24792
07:14:49,190 --> 07:14:49,200
to use
 

24793
07:14:49,200 --> 07:14:51,288
to use
um libraries once you know what's going

24794
07:14:51,288 --> 07:14:51,298
um libraries once you know what's going
 

24795
07:14:51,298 --> 07:14:53,330
um libraries once you know what's going
on under the hood right that's fine but

24796
07:14:53,330 --> 07:14:53,340
on under the hood right that's fine but
 

24797
07:14:53,340 --> 07:14:54,650
on under the hood right that's fine but
you need to be able to kind of write out

24798
07:14:54,650 --> 07:14:54,660
you need to be able to kind of write out
 

24799
07:14:54,660 --> 07:14:59,390
you need to be able to kind of write out
the whole thing yourself I mean it's

24800
07:14:59,390 --> 07:14:59,400

 

24801
07:14:59,400 --> 07:15:01,610

uh that could be true could not be true

24802
07:15:01,610 --> 07:15:01,620
uh that could be true could not be true
 

24803
07:15:01,620 --> 07:15:03,770
uh that could be true could not be true
I don't know are you sure about that

24804
07:15:03,770 --> 07:15:03,780
I don't know are you sure about that
 

24805
07:15:03,780 --> 07:15:06,170
I don't know are you sure about that
because well you shouldn't you could you

24806
07:15:06,170 --> 07:15:06,180
because well you shouldn't you could you
 

24807
07:15:06,180 --> 07:15:09,230
because well you shouldn't you could you
could you might be able to uh get quite

24808
07:15:09,230 --> 07:15:09,240
could you might be able to uh get quite
 

24809
07:15:09,240 --> 07:15:11,150
could you might be able to uh get quite
far standing on the shoulders of giants

24810
07:15:11,150 --> 07:15:11,160
far standing on the shoulders of giants
 

24811
07:15:11,160 --> 07:15:14,448
far standing on the shoulders of giants
you can but it depends like you couldn't

24812
07:15:14,448 --> 07:15:14,458
you can but it depends like you couldn't
 

24813
07:15:14,458 --> 07:15:15,830
you can but it depends like you couldn't
build

24814
07:15:15,830 --> 07:15:15,840
build
 

24815
07:15:15,840 --> 07:15:19,250
build
well okay somebody if you could however

24816
07:15:19,250 --> 07:15:19,260
well okay somebody if you could however
 

24817
07:15:19,260 --> 07:15:21,468
well okay somebody if you could however
you were going to finish that sentence I

24818
07:15:21,468 --> 07:15:21,478
you were going to finish that sentence I
 

24819
07:15:21,478 --> 07:15:22,730
you were going to finish that sentence I
could push back but you could probably

24820
07:15:22,730 --> 07:15:22,740
could push back but you could probably
 

24821
07:15:22,740 --> 07:15:24,230
could push back but you could probably
push back right but here's what I was

24822
07:15:24,230 --> 07:15:24,240
push back right but here's what I was
 

24823
07:15:24,240 --> 07:15:25,670
push back right but here's what I was
going to say I was going to say you

24824
07:15:25,670 --> 07:15:25,680
going to say I was going to say you
 

24825
07:15:25,680 --> 07:15:27,230
going to say I was going to say you
couldn't really you couldn't build

24826
07:15:27,230 --> 07:15:27,240
couldn't really you couldn't build
 

24827
07:15:27,240 --> 07:15:30,890
couldn't really you couldn't build

understood
 

24833
07:15:34,500 --> 07:15:38,990
understood
like computer architecture and you know

24834
07:15:38,990 --> 07:15:39,000
like computer architecture and you know
 

24835
07:15:39,000 --> 07:15:41,930
like computer architecture and you know
layout of memory and you know theory of

24836
07:15:41,930 --> 07:15:41,940
layout of memory and you know theory of
 

24837
07:15:41,940 --> 07:15:43,850
layout of memory and you know theory of
compilers but you might want to see the

24838
07:15:43,850 --> 07:15:43,860
compilers but you might want to see the
 

24839
07:15:43,860 --> 07:15:45,350
compilers but you might want to see the
thing is if you just look at libraries

24840
07:15:45,350 --> 07:15:45,360
thing is if you just look at libraries
 

24841
07:15:45,360 --> 07:15:47,208
thing is if you just look at libraries
you might be able to understand the

24842
07:15:47,208 --> 07:15:47,218
you might be able to understand the
 

24843
07:15:47,218 --> 07:15:49,730
you might be able to understand the
capabilities and you can build up the

24844
07:15:49,730 --> 07:15:49,740
capabilities and you can build up the
 

24845
07:15:49,740 --> 07:15:52,788
capabilities and you can build up the
intuition of like what a great

24846
07:15:52,788 --> 07:15:52,798
intuition of like what a great
 

24847
07:15:52,798 --> 07:15:55,250
intuition of like what a great
specialized engineer could do that you

24848
07:15:55,250 --> 07:15:55,260
specialized engineer could do that you
 

24849
07:15:55,260 --> 07:15:56,810
specialized engineer could do that you
can't like you know for example you know

24850
07:15:56,810 --> 07:15:56,820
can't like you know for example you know
 

24851
07:15:56,820 --> 07:15:59,330
can't like you know for example you know
at least a while back facebook.com like

24852
07:15:59,330 --> 07:15:59,340
at least a while back facebook.com like
 

24853
07:15:59,340 --> 07:16:01,010
at least a while back facebook.com like
was literally it's just a single C plus

24854
07:16:01,010 --> 07:16:01,020
was literally it's just a single C plus
 

24855
07:16:01,020 --> 07:16:03,410
was literally it's just a single C plus
plus compiled binary or so it's not

24856
07:16:03,410 --> 07:16:03,420
plus compiled binary or so it's not
 

24857
07:16:03,420 --> 07:16:06,468
plus compiled binary or so it's not
super close it was like hip-hop they had

24858
07:16:06,468 --> 07:16:06,478
super close it was like hip-hop they had
 

24859
07:16:06,478 --> 07:16:09,948
super close it was like hip-hop they had
a PHP uh compiler where they had just

24860
07:16:09,948 --> 07:16:09,958
a PHP uh compiler where they had just
 

24861
07:16:09,958 --> 07:16:11,810
a PHP uh compiler where they had just
one giant binary I think I may be

24862
07:16:11,810 --> 07:16:11,820
one giant binary I think I may be
 

24863
07:16:11,820 --> 07:16:12,650
one giant binary I think I may be
getting this wrong but that's what I

24864
07:16:12,650 --> 07:16:12,660
getting this wrong but that's what I
 

24865
07:16:12,660 --> 07:16:14,628
getting this wrong but that's what I
recall right yeah yeah I mean that's

24866
07:16:14,628 --> 07:16:14,638
recall right yeah yeah I mean that's
 

24867
07:16:14,638 --> 07:16:16,310
recall right yeah yeah I mean that's
that's it should be simple it should be

24868
07:16:16,310 --> 07:16:16,320
that's it should be simple it should be
 

24869
07:16:16,320 --> 07:16:18,468
that's it should be simple it should be
simple and then you have guys like uh

24870
07:16:18,468 --> 07:16:18,478
simple and then you have guys like uh
 

24871
07:16:18,478 --> 07:16:21,230
simple and then you have guys like uh
John Carmack who comes in

24872
07:16:21,230 --> 07:16:21,240
John Carmack who comes in
 

24873
07:16:21,240 --> 07:16:24,048
John Carmack who comes in
and does an incredibly optimized

24874
07:16:24,048 --> 07:16:24,058
and does an incredibly optimized
 

24875
07:16:24,058 --> 07:16:26,628
and does an incredibly optimized
implementation that actually well yeah

24876
07:16:26,628 --> 07:16:26,638
implementation that actually well yeah
 

24877
07:16:26,638 --> 07:16:28,490
implementation that actually well yeah
more than that right like he's I mean

24878
07:16:28,490 --> 07:16:28,500
more than that right like he's I mean
 

24879
07:16:28,500 --> 07:16:31,190
more than that right like he's I mean
yes right go ahead I mean there's some

24880
07:16:31,190 --> 07:16:31,200
yes right go ahead I mean there's some
 

24881
07:16:31,200 --> 07:16:34,850
yes right go ahead I mean there's some
cases with John Carmack by being an

24882
07:16:34,850 --> 07:16:34,860
cases with John Carmack by being an
 

24883
07:16:34,860 --> 07:16:37,548
cases with John Carmack by being an
incredible engineer is able to bring to

24884
07:16:37,548 --> 07:16:37,558
incredible engineer is able to bring to
 

24885
07:16:37,558 --> 07:16:39,468
incredible engineer is able to bring to
reality things that otherwise would have

24886
07:16:39,468 --> 07:16:39,478
reality things that otherwise would have
 

24887
07:16:39,478 --> 07:16:41,990
reality things that otherwise would have
taken an extra five to ten years yeah or

24888
07:16:41,990 --> 07:16:42,000
taken an extra five to ten years yeah or
 

24889
07:16:42,000 --> 07:16:43,310
taken an extra five to ten years yeah or
maybe even more than that like so you

24890
07:16:43,310 --> 07:16:43,320
maybe even more than that like so you
 

24891
07:16:43,320 --> 07:16:44,750
maybe even more than that like so you
know this is the great man theory of

24892
07:16:44,750 --> 07:16:44,760
know this is the great man theory of
 

24893
07:16:44,760 --> 07:16:48,410
know this is the great man theory of
History versus like sort of the

24894
07:16:48,410 --> 07:16:48,420
History versus like sort of the
 

24895
07:16:48,420 --> 07:16:50,930
History versus like sort of the
um kind of the determinist like you know

24896
07:16:50,930 --> 07:16:50,940
um kind of the determinist like you know
 

24897
07:16:50,940 --> 07:16:52,190
um kind of the determinist like you know
waves of History are pushing things

24898
07:16:52,190 --> 07:16:52,200
waves of History are pushing things
 

24899
07:16:52,200 --> 07:16:54,350
waves of History are pushing things
along the way I reconcile those is the

24900
07:16:54,350 --> 07:16:54,360
along the way I reconcile those is the
 

24901
07:16:54,360 --> 07:16:55,788
along the way I reconcile those is the
tech tree model of History you know like

24902
07:16:55,788 --> 07:16:55,798
tech tree model of History you know like
 

24903
07:16:55,798 --> 07:16:56,810
tech tree model of History you know like
Civilization you're a play game

24904
07:16:56,810 --> 07:16:56,820
Civilization you're a play game
 

24905
07:16:56,820 --> 07:16:58,788
Civilization you're a play game
civilization yeah so like Civilization

24906
07:16:58,788 --> 07:16:58,798
civilization yeah so like Civilization
 

24907
07:16:58,798 --> 07:17:00,170
civilization yeah so like Civilization
you got the tech tree and you can go and

24908
07:17:00,170 --> 07:17:00,180
you got the tech tree and you can go and
 

24909
07:17:00,180 --> 07:17:01,730
you got the tech tree and you can go and
be like okay I'm gonna get Spearman or

24910
07:17:01,730 --> 07:17:01,740
be like okay I'm gonna get Spearman or
 

24911
07:17:01,740 --> 07:17:02,990
be like okay I'm gonna get Spearman or
I'm gonna do

24912
07:17:02,990 --> 07:17:03,000
I'm gonna do
 

24913
07:17:03,000 --> 07:17:05,750
I'm gonna do
greeneries and pottery right and so you

24914
07:17:05,750 --> 07:17:05,760
greeneries and pottery right and so you
 

24915
07:17:05,760 --> 07:17:07,490
greeneries and pottery right and so you
can think of it as something where

24916
07:17:07,490 --> 07:17:07,500
can think of it as something where
 

24917
07:17:07,500 --> 07:17:08,930
can think of it as something where
here's everything that Humanity has

24918
07:17:08,930 --> 07:17:08,940
here's everything that Humanity has
 

24919
07:17:08,940 --> 07:17:11,150
here's everything that Humanity has
right now and then Satoshi can push on

24920
07:17:11,150 --> 07:17:11,160
right now and then Satoshi can push on
 

24921
07:17:11,160 --> 07:17:13,070
right now and then Satoshi can push on
this dimension of the tech tree so he's

24922
07:17:13,070 --> 07:17:13,080
this dimension of the tech tree so he's
 

24923
07:17:13,080 --> 07:17:14,628
this dimension of the tech tree so he's
a great man because there was weren't

24924
07:17:14,628 --> 07:17:14,638
a great man because there was weren't
 

24925
07:17:14,638 --> 07:17:16,910
a great man because there was weren't
other there wasn't a leadness leibniz to

24926
07:17:16,910 --> 07:17:16,920
other there wasn't a leadness leibniz to
 

24927
07:17:16,920 --> 07:17:19,910
other there wasn't a leadness leibniz to
satoshi's Newton right like vitalik as

24928
07:17:19,910 --> 07:17:19,920
satoshi's Newton right like vitalik as
 

24929
07:17:19,920 --> 07:17:21,468
satoshi's Newton right like vitalik as
you know amazing as he is was five years

24930
07:17:21,468 --> 07:17:21,478
you know amazing as he is was five years
 

24931
07:17:21,478 --> 07:17:23,270
you know amazing as he is was five years
later or thereabouts right there wasn't

24932
07:17:23,270 --> 07:17:23,280
later or thereabouts right there wasn't
 

24933
07:17:23,280 --> 07:17:25,310
later or thereabouts right there wasn't
contemporaneous

24934
07:17:25,310 --> 07:17:25,320
contemporaneous
 

24935
07:17:25,320 --> 07:17:27,770
contemporaneous
um like you know another person that was

24936
07:17:27,770 --> 07:17:27,780
um like you know another person that was
 

24937
07:17:27,780 --> 07:17:29,090
um like you know another person that was
doing what Satoshi was doing is truly

24938
07:17:29,090 --> 07:17:29,100
doing what Satoshi was doing is truly
 

24939
07:17:29,100 --> 07:17:32,208
doing what Satoshi was doing is truly
swedenours right and that shows you know

24940
07:17:32,208 --> 07:17:32,218
swedenours right and that shows you know
 

24941
07:17:32,218 --> 07:17:33,590
swedenours right and that shows you know
what one person can do like probably

24942
07:17:33,590 --> 07:17:33,600
what one person can do like probably
 

24943
07:17:33,600 --> 07:17:35,570
what one person can do like probably
Steve Jobs with apple you know given how

24944
07:17:35,570 --> 07:17:35,580
Steve Jobs with apple you know given how
 

24945
07:17:35,580 --> 07:17:36,830
Steve Jobs with apple you know given how
the company was dying before he got

24946
07:17:36,830 --> 07:17:36,840
the company was dying before he got
 

24947
07:17:36,840 --> 07:17:38,030
the company was dying before he got
there and he built it into the most

24948
07:17:38,030 --> 07:17:38,040
there and he built it into the most
 

24949
07:17:38,040 --> 07:17:39,530
there and he built it into the most
valuable or put on the directory becomes

24950
07:17:39,530 --> 07:17:39,540
valuable or put on the directory becomes
 

24951
07:17:39,540 --> 07:17:40,490
valuable or put on the directory becomes
the most valuable company in the world

24952
07:17:40,490 --> 07:17:40,500
the most valuable company in the world
 

24953
07:17:40,500 --> 07:17:42,350
the most valuable company in the world
it shows that there is quote great man

24954
07:17:42,350 --> 07:17:42,360
it shows that there is quote great man
 

24955
07:17:42,360 --> 07:17:43,490
it shows that there is quote great man
right

24956
07:17:43,490 --> 07:17:43,500
right
 

24957
07:17:43,500 --> 07:17:45,048
right
um maybe more than just being five or

24958
07:17:45,048 --> 07:17:45,058
um maybe more than just being five or
 

24959
07:17:45,058 --> 07:17:46,910
um maybe more than just being five or
ten years ahead like truly shaping where

24960
07:17:46,910 --> 07:17:46,920
ten years ahead like truly shaping where
 

24961
07:17:46,920 --> 07:17:49,190
ten years ahead like truly shaping where
history goes right yeah but on their

24962
07:17:49,190 --> 07:17:49,200
history goes right yeah but on their
 

24963
07:17:49,200 --> 07:17:50,690
history goes right yeah but on their
hand of course that person Steve Jobs

24964
07:17:50,690 --> 07:17:50,700
hand of course that person Steve Jobs
 

24965
07:17:50,700 --> 07:17:52,670
hand of course that person Steve Jobs
himself wrote that email that prison was

24966
07:17:52,670 --> 07:17:52,680
himself wrote that email that prison was
 

24967
07:17:52,680 --> 07:17:54,110
himself wrote that email that prison was
searching saying that you know he

24968
07:17:54,110 --> 07:17:54,120
searching saying that you know he
 

24969
07:17:54,120 --> 07:17:55,570
searching saying that you know he
doesn't grow his own food and he doesn't

24970
07:17:55,570 --> 07:17:55,580
doesn't grow his own food and he doesn't
 

24971
07:17:55,580 --> 07:17:58,788
doesn't grow his own food and he doesn't
uh you know he didn't even think of the

24972
07:17:58,788 --> 07:17:58,798
uh you know he didn't even think of the
 

24973
07:17:58,798 --> 07:17:59,990
uh you know he didn't even think of the
rights that he's got someone else

24974
07:17:59,990 --> 07:18:00,000
rights that he's got someone else
 

24975
07:18:00,000 --> 07:18:02,090
rights that he's got someone else
thought of those and whatnot and so he

24976
07:18:02,090 --> 07:18:02,100
thought of those and whatnot and so he
 

24977
07:18:02,100 --> 07:18:04,010
thought of those and whatnot and so he
kind of it is always a tension between

24978
07:18:04,010 --> 07:18:04,020
kind of it is always a tension between
 

24979
07:18:04,020 --> 07:18:05,510
kind of it is always a tension between
the individual and Society on this right

24980
07:18:05,510 --> 07:18:05,520
the individual and Society on this right
 

24981
07:18:05,520 --> 07:18:06,830
the individual and Society on this right
but

24982
07:18:06,830 --> 07:18:06,840
but
 

24983
07:18:06,840 --> 07:18:08,930
but
coming back so Cs and stats that's what

24984
07:18:08,930 --> 07:18:08,940
coming back so Cs and stats that's what
 

24985
07:18:08,940 --> 07:18:10,070
coming back so Cs and stats that's what
you want to learn

24986
07:18:10,070 --> 07:18:10,080
you want to learn
 

24987
07:18:10,080 --> 07:18:11,510
you want to learn
um I think physics is also good to know

24988
07:18:11,510 --> 07:18:11,520
um I think physics is also good to know
 

24989
07:18:11,520 --> 07:18:12,890
um I think physics is also good to know
because you go one level deeper and of

24990
07:18:12,890 --> 07:18:12,900
because you go one level deeper and of
 

24991
07:18:12,900 --> 07:18:14,390
because you go one level deeper and of
course all these devices you're not

24992
07:18:14,390 --> 07:18:14,400
course all these devices you're not
 

24993
07:18:14,400 --> 07:18:16,368
course all these devices you're not
gonna be able to build

24994
07:18:16,368 --> 07:18:16,378
gonna be able to build
 

24995
07:18:16,378 --> 07:18:19,010
gonna be able to build
um you know uh lidar or things like that

24996
07:18:19,010 --> 07:18:19,020
um you know uh lidar or things like that
 

24997
07:18:19,020 --> 07:18:20,628
um you know uh lidar or things like that
without understanding physics right you

24998
07:18:20,628 --> 07:18:20,638
without understanding physics right you
 

24999
07:18:20,638 --> 07:18:22,190
without understanding physics right you
mentioned that as one side of the brain

25000
07:18:22,190 --> 07:18:22,200
mentioned that as one side of the brain
 

25001
07:18:22,200 --> 07:18:24,830
mentioned that as one side of the brain
what about the other right so CSS is is

25002
07:18:24,830 --> 07:18:24,840
what about the other right so CSS is is

was all these people in the US and
 

25635
07:30:00,058 --> 07:30:01,490
was all these people in the US and
around the world suddenly got voices and

25636
07:30:01,490 --> 07:30:01,500
around the world suddenly got voices and
 

25637
07:30:01,500 --> 07:30:02,448
around the world suddenly got voices and
they were suddenly saying things that

25638
07:30:02,448 --> 07:30:02,458
they were suddenly saying things that
 

25639
07:30:02,458 --> 07:30:04,368

the establishment didn't want them to
 

25641
07:30:04,378 --> 07:30:06,350
the establishment didn't want them to
say and so that's what this counter

25642
07:30:06,350 --> 07:30:06,360
say and so that's what this counter
 

25643
07:30:06,360 --> 07:30:07,788
say and so that's what this counter
decentralization has meant both in the

US and in China this Crackdown
 

25647
07:30:10,138 --> 07:30:12,468
US and in China this Crackdown
but it's as if like a stock went up like

25648
07:30:12,468 --> 07:30:12,478
but it's as if like a stock went up like
 

25649
07:30:12,478 --> 07:30:14,650
but it's as if like a stock went up like
100 x and then dropped like 30 percent

07:30:14,650 --> 07:30:14,660
100 x and then dropped like 30 percent

all the Deep platforming stuff yes it's
 

25653
07:30:17,580 --> 07:30:20,270
all the Deep platforming stuff yes it's
bad okay it's

bad okay it's
 

25655
07:30:20,280 --> 07:30:22,910
bad okay it's
um it's it's a it's a rear root move but

25656
07:30:22,910 --> 07:30:22,920
um it's it's a it's a rear root move but
 

25657
07:30:22,920 --> 07:30:25,788
um it's it's a it's a rear root move but
in the long Arc I think we're going to

25658
07:30:25,788 --> 07:30:25,798
in the long Arc I think we're going to
 

25659
07:30:25,798 --> 07:30:27,530
in the long Arc I think we're going to
have more speech I think the counter

25660
07:30:27,530 --> 07:30:27,540
have more speech I think the counter
 

25661
07:30:27,540 --> 07:30:29,150
have more speech I think the counter
decentralization May succeed in China

25662
07:30:29,150 --> 07:30:29,160
decentralization May succeed in China
 

25663
07:30:29,160 --> 07:30:30,590
decentralization May succeed in China
but I don't think it's going to succeed

25664
07:30:30,590 --> 07:30:30,600
but I don't think it's going to succeed
 

25665
07:30:30,600 --> 07:30:32,150
but I don't think it's going to succeed

Outsourcing that voice to somebody else
 

25727
07:31:41,280 --> 07:31:43,490
Outsourcing that voice to somebody else
and having it put through the distorting

25728
07:31:43,490 --> 07:31:43,500
and having it put through the distorting
 

25729
07:31:43,500 --> 07:31:46,070
and having it put through the distorting
filter which maximizes the clicks of the

07:31:46,070 --> 07:31:46,080
filter which maximizes the clicks of the
 

25731
07:31:46,080 --> 07:31:48,288
filter which maximizes the clicks of the
distorting kind of thing it's just not

25732
07:31:48,288 --> 07:31:48,298
distorting kind of thing it's just not
 

25733
07:31:48,298 --> 07:31:49,910
distorting kind of thing it's just not
going to be in one its own interest you

25734
07:31:49,910 --> 07:31:49,920
going to be in one its own interest you
 

25735
07:31:49,920 --> 07:31:51,830
going to be in one its own interest you
don't have to you know even agree with

25736
07:31:51,830 --> 07:31:51,840
don't have to you know even agree with
 

25737
07:31:51,840 --> 07:31:53,270
don't have to you know even agree with
everything I'm saying or even all of it

25738
07:31:53,270 --> 07:31:53,280
everything I'm saying or even all of it
 

25739
07:31:53,280 --> 07:31:54,350
everything I'm saying or even all of it
to just be like well look I'd rather

25740
07:31:54,350 --> 07:31:54,360
to just be like well look I'd rather
 

25741
07:31:54,360 --> 07:31:56,270
to just be like well look I'd rather
speak for myself I'd rather go direct if

25742
07:31:56,270 --> 07:31:56,280
speak for myself I'd rather go direct if
 

25743
07:31:56,280 --> 07:31:57,948
speak for myself I'd rather go direct if
I could speak unmediated in my own words

25744
07:31:57,948 --> 07:31:57,958
I could speak unmediated in my own words
 

25745
07:31:57,958 --> 07:31:59,628
I could speak unmediated in my own words
right because the choice for word is

25746
07:31:59,628 --> 07:31:59,638
right because the choice for word is
 

25747
07:31:59,638 --> 07:32:01,968
right because the choice for word is
actually very important right so that's

25748
07:32:01,968 --> 07:32:01,978
actually very important right so that's
 

25749
07:32:01,978 --> 07:32:03,410
actually very important right so that's
the second big thing you need to and

25750
07:32:03,410 --> 07:32:03,420
the second big thing you need to and
 

25751
07:32:03,420 --> 07:32:04,430
the second big thing you need to and
this is the thing that took me a long

25752
07:32:04,430 --> 07:32:04,440
this is the thing that took me a long
 

25753
07:32:04,440 --> 07:32:06,350
this is the thing that took me a long
time to understand okay

25754
07:32:06,350 --> 07:32:06,360
time to understand okay
 

25755
07:32:06,360 --> 07:32:07,910
time to understand okay
um because I always got the importance

25756
07:32:07,910 --> 07:32:07,920
um because I always got the importance
 

25757
07:32:07,920 --> 07:32:09,530
um because I always got the importance
of math and science and in fact I would

25758
07:32:09,530 --> 07:32:09,540
of math and science and in fact I would
 

25759
07:32:09,540 --> 07:32:10,850
of math and science and in fact I would
have been

25760
07:32:10,850 --> 07:32:10,860
have been
 

25761
07:32:10,860 --> 07:32:13,250
have been
probably just a career academic or

25762
07:32:13,250 --> 07:32:13,260
probably just a career academic or
 

25763
07:32:13,260 --> 07:32:14,930
probably just a career academic or
mathematician in another life you know

25764
07:32:14,930 --> 07:32:14,940

and that in the fullness time people
 

26041
07:36:53,638 --> 07:36:56,690
and that in the fullness time people
will look at the internet as being too

of your waking hours looking at a screen
20 you're spending all this time

26056
07:37:12,350 --> 07:37:12,360
20 you're spending all this time
 

26057
07:37:12,360 --> 07:37:13,788
20 you're spending all this time
commuting up to the cloud in the morning

26058
07:37:13,788 --> 07:37:13,798
commuting up to the cloud in the morning
 

26059
07:37:13,798 --> 07:37:15,110
commuting up to the cloud in the morning
and coming back down you're doing these

26060
07:37:15,110 --> 07:37:15,120
and coming back down you're doing these
 

26061
07:37:15,120 --> 07:37:16,430
and coming back down you're doing these
day trips and it's got a different

26062
07:37:16,430 --> 07:37:16,440
day trips and it's got a different
 

26063
07:37:16,440 --> 07:37:17,990
day trips and it's got a different
geography and all these people are near

26064
07:37:17,990 --> 07:37:18,000
geography and all these people are near
 

26065
07:37:18,000 --> 07:37:19,310
geography and all these people are near
each other's ever far in the physical

26066
07:37:19,310 --> 07:37:19,320
each other's ever far in the physical
 

26067
07:37:19,320 --> 07:37:22,910
each other's ever far in the physical
world and vice versa right and so this

26068
07:37:22,910 --> 07:37:22,920
world and vice versa right and so this
 

26069
07:37:22,920 --> 07:37:25,730
world and vice versa right and so this
will because it's this new domain it

26070
07:37:25,730 --> 07:37:25,740
will because it's this new domain it
 

26071
07:37:25,740 --> 07:37:27,048
will because it's this new domain it
gives rise to Virtual Worlds that

26072
07:37:27,048 --> 07:37:27,058

things around the world which should be
 

26347
07:42:03,360 --> 07:42:05,090
things around the world which should be
able to exist on their own and you

26348
07:42:05,090 --> 07:42:05,100
able to exist on their own and you
 

26349

axis and new States and new countries
 

26363
07:42:19,260 --> 07:42:21,890
axis and new States and new countries
should be able to exist uh that do not

26364

totally possible to do and we've got
 

26375
07:42:30,540 --> 07:42:32,448

um first cut that's something that I
 

26409
07:43:02,878 --> 07:43:04,430
um first cut that's something that I
might want to include I credit him of

26410
07:43:04,430 --> 07:43:04,440
might want to include I credit him of
