I think I've been trying to figure this

84
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,360
I think I've been trying to figure this
 

85
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,370

out for a while but I've always liked
 

87
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,719
out for a while but I've always liked

building things with Legos and when I
 

89
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,460
building things with Legos and when I
was really really young I wanted the

90
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:40,470
was really really young I wanted the
 

91

Legos I had motors and other things and
 

93
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,780
Legos I had motors and other things and
then you know Lego Mindstorms came out

94
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:44,790
then you know Lego Mindstorms came out
 

95
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,420
then you know Lego Mindstorms came out
and for the first time you could program

96
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,430
and for the first time you could program
 

97
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,700
and for the first time you could program
Lego contraptions and I think things

98
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:49,710
Lego contraptions and I think things
 

99
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,730
Lego contraptions and I think things
just sort of snowballed from that but I

100
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:52,740
just sort of snowballed from that but I
 

101
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,240
just sort of snowballed from that but I
remember seeing you know the battle bots

110
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:03,570
knowing a whole lot about how to build
 

111
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,040

these 200-pound fighting robots so I

112
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,050
these 200-pound fighting robots so I
 

113
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,469
these 200-pound fighting robots so I
sort of obsessively pored over the

internet forums where all the creator's
 

117
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,309
internet forums where all the creator's
for battle bots would sort of hang out

118
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:13,319
for battle bots would sort of hang out
 

119
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,290
for battle bots would sort of hang out
and talk about you know document their

120
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:15,300
and talk about you know document their
 

121
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,660

build progress and everything and I

122
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:17,670
build progress and everything and I
 

123
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,300
build progress and everything and I
think I read I must have read like you

124
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,310
think I read I must have read like you
 

125
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,340
think I read I must have read like you
know tens of thousands of forum posts

126
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,350
know tens of thousands of forum posts
 

127
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,470
know tens of thousands of forum posts
from from basically everything that was

128
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
from from basically everything that was
 

129
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,610
from from basically everything that was
out there on what these people were

130
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,620
out there on what these people were
 

131
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,440
out there on what these people were
doing and eventually like sort of

132
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,450
doing and eventually like sort of
 

133
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,120
doing and eventually like sort of
triangulated how to how to put some of

134
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,130
triangulated how to how to put some of
 

135
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,300
triangulated how to how to put some of
these things together and and ended up

136
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,310
these things together and and ended up
 

137
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,740
these things together and and ended up
doing battle bots which was you know I

138
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,750
doing battle bots which was you know I
 

139
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,240
doing battle bots which was you know I
was like 13 or 14 which is pretty

140
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,250
was like 13 or 14 which is pretty
 

141
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,860
was like 13 or 14 which is pretty
awesome I'm not sure if the show is

142
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:36,870
awesome I'm not sure if the show is
 

143
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,730
awesome I'm not sure if the show is
still running but the battle bots is

144
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:39,740
still running but the battle bots is
 

145
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,990
still running but the battle bots is
there's not an artificial intelligence

146
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
there's not an artificial intelligence
 

147
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,180
there's not an artificial intelligence
component it's remotely controlled and

148
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,190
component it's remotely controlled and
 

149
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,770
component it's remotely controlled and
yeah it's an almost like a mechanical

150
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:45,780
yeah it's an almost like a mechanical
 

151
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,510
yeah it's an almost like a mechanical
generic challenge yeah I think things

152
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:47,520
generic challenge yeah I think things
 

153
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,880
generic challenge yeah I think things
that can be broken they're

154
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:49,890
that can be broken they're
 

155
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,800
that can be broken they're
radio-controlled so and I think that

156
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:51,810
radio-controlled so and I think that
 

157
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,720
radio-controlled so and I think that
they allowed some limited form of

158
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:53,730
they allowed some limited form of
 

159
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,970
they allowed some limited form of
autonomy but you know in a two-minute

160
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:55,980
autonomy but you know in a two-minute
 

161
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,130
autonomy but you know in a two-minute
match you're in and the way these things

yeah well I remember I think maybe when
 

321
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,590
yeah well I remember I think maybe when
I was in third or fourth grade school I

322
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
I was in third or fourth grade school I
 

323
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,880
I was in third or fourth grade school I
was at elementary school had a bunch of

324
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:52,890
was at elementary school had a bunch of
 

325
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,210
was at elementary school had a bunch of
Apple 2 computers and we'd play games on

326
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,220
Apple 2 computers and we'd play games on
 

327
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,590
Apple 2 computers and we'd play games on
those and I remember every once in a

328
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
those and I remember every once in a
 

329
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,230
those and I remember every once in a
while something mood would would crash

330
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
while something mood would would crash
 

331
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,460
while something mood would would crash
it wouldn't start up correctly and it

332
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:01,470
it wouldn't start up correctly and it
 

333
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,320
it wouldn't start up correctly and it
would dump you out to what I later

334
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,330
would dump you out to what I later
 

335
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,970
would dump you out to what I later
learned was like sort of a command

336
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:04,980
learned was like sort of a command
 

337
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,920
learned was like sort of a command
prompt and my teacher would come over

338
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:06,930
prompt and my teacher would come over
 

339
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,360
prompt and my teacher would come over
and type actually remember this to this

340
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,370
and type actually remember this to this
 

341
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,820
and type actually remember this to this
day for some reason like PR number six

342
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:10,830
day for some reason like PR number six
 

343
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,040
day for some reason like PR number six
or PR pound six which is peripheral 6

344
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,050
or PR pound six which is peripheral 6
 

345
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,270
or PR pound six which is peripheral 6
which is the disk drive which would fire

346
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,280
which is the disk drive which would fire
 

347
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,070
which is the disk drive which would fire
up the disk and load the program and I

348
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
up the disk and load the program and I
 

349
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,420
up the disk and load the program and I
just remember thinking wow she's like a

350
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:17,430
just remember thinking wow she's like a
 

351
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,760
just remember thinking wow she's like a
hacker like teach me these these codes

352
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:19,770
hacker like teach me these these codes
 

353
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,560
hacker like teach me these these codes
these error codes what I called him at

354
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:21,570
these error codes what I called him at
 

355
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,570
these error codes what I called him at
the time but she had no interest in that

356
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:23,580
the time but she had no interest in that
 

357
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,160
the time but she had no interest in that
so it wasn't until I think about fifth

358
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,170
so it wasn't until I think about fifth
 

359
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,190
so it wasn't until I think about fifth
grade that I had a school where you

360
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,200
grade that I had a school where you
 

361
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,900
grade that I had a school where you
could actually go on these Apple twos

362
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:29,910
could actually go on these Apple twos
 

363
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,070
could actually go on these Apple twos
and learn to program and so it's all in

364
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,080
and learn to program and so it's all in
 

365
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,230
and learn to program and so it's all in
basic you know where every line you know

366
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,240
basic you know where every line you know
 

367
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,490
basic you know where every line you know
the line numbers are all number that

368
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:34,500
the line numbers are all number that
 

369
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,160
the line numbers are all number that
every line is numbered and you have to

370
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,170
every line is numbered and you have to
 

371
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,360
every line is numbered and you have to
like leave enough space between the

372
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,370
like leave enough space between the
 

373
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,340
like leave enough space between the
numbers so that if you want to tweak

374
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,350
numbers so that if you want to tweak
 

375
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,200
numbers so that if you want to tweak
your code you go back and the first line

376
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,210
your code you go back and the first line
 

377
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,210
your code you go back and the first line
was 10 and the second line is 20 now you

378
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,220
was 10 and the second line is 20 now you
 

379
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,460
was 10 and the second line is 20 now you
have to go back and insert and 15 and if

380
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:46,470
have to go back and insert and 15 and if
 

381
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,540
have to go back and insert and 15 and if
you need to add code in front of that

382
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:47,550
you need to add code in front of that
 

383
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,460
you need to add code in front of that
you know 11 or 12 and you hope you don't

384
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:49,470
you know 11 or 12 and you hope you don't
 

385
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,570
you know 11 or 12 and you hope you don't
run out of line numbers and have to redo

386
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:50,580
run out of line numbers and have to redo
 

387
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,110
run out of line numbers and have to redo
the whole thing

388
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
the whole thing
 

389
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,350
the whole thing
there's go-to statements yeah go to and

390
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,360
there's go-to statements yeah go to and
 

391
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,230
there's go-to statements yeah go to and
it's very basic maybe it's a name but a

392
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,240
it's very basic maybe it's a name but a
 

393
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,110
it's very basic maybe it's a name but a
lot of fun and that was like that was

394
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
lot of fun and that was like that was
 

395
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,880
lot of fun and that was like that was
you know it's fun that's when you know

396
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:01,890
you know it's fun that's when you know
 

397
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,870
you know it's fun that's when you know
when your first program you see the

398
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
when your first program you see the
 

399
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
when your first program you see the
magic of it it's like it just just like

400
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:04,890
magic of it it's like it just just like
 

401
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,800
magic of it it's like it just just like

classes in high school not not where I
 

417
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,000
classes in high school not not where I
went so it was a self-taught but I did a

418
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,010
went so it was a self-taught but I did a
 

419
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,129
went so it was a self-taught but I did a
lot of programming the thing that

420
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:27,139
lot of programming the thing that
 

421
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,450
lot of programming the thing that
you know sort of pushed me in the path

422
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:28,460
you know sort of pushed me in the path
 

423
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,129
you know sort of pushed me in the path
of eventually working on self-driving

ones and then you know progress to what
 

479
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,050

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,060
we're doing now so what was your view of
 

481
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,459
we're doing now so what was your view of
artificial intelligence at that point

artificial intelligence at that point
 

483
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,579
artificial intelligence at that point
what did you think so this is uh before

00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:33,589
what did you think so this is uh before
 

485
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,380

00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:17,809
be able to use that do the same kind of
 

635
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:18,999
be able to use that do the same kind of
thing when you're on that's and that

636
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:19,009
thing when you're on that's and that
 

637
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,579
thing when you're on that's and that
that kind of thinking you don't want to

638
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:21,589
that kind of thinking you don't want to
 

639
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:23,139
that kind of thinking you don't want to
criticize that kind of thinking because

640
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:23,149
criticize that kind of thinking because
 

641
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,999
criticize that kind of thinking because
eventually they will be right yeah and

642
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:25,009
eventually they will be right yeah and
 

643
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,979
eventually they will be right yeah and
so it's exciting and especially when

644
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:26,989
so it's exciting and especially when
 

645
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:29,169
so it's exciting and especially when
they're younger to explore that is a

646
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:29,179
they're younger to explore that is a
 

647
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:31,179
they're younger to explore that is a
really exciting approach but yeah it's

648
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:31,189
really exciting approach but yeah it's
 

649
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:35,829
really exciting approach but yeah it's
it's changed the the language the kind

650
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
it's changed the the language the kind
 

651
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,419
it's changed the the language the kind
of stuff you turned green with it it's

652
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:37,429
of stuff you turned green with it it's
 

653
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:38,979
of stuff you turned green with it it's
kind of exciting to see when they

654
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:38,989
kind of exciting to see when they
 

655
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,649
kind of exciting to see when they
seniors grow up yeah I can only imagine

656
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:41,659
seniors grow up yeah I can only imagine
 

657
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,349
seniors grow up yeah I can only imagine
if you if your starting point is you

658
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:44,359
if you if your starting point is you
 

659
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,299
if you if your starting point is you
know Python and tensorflow at age 13

660
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:46,309
know Python and tensorflow at age 13
 

661
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,699
know Python and tensorflow at age 13
where you end up you know after 10 or 15

662
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:48,709
where you end up you know after 10 or 15
 

663
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,829
where you end up you know after 10 or 15
years of that that's that's pretty cool

664
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:50,839
years of that that's that's pretty cool
 

665
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,840
years of that that's that's pretty cool
because of github because this

666
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,850
because of github because this
 

667
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,699
because of github because this
they're tools for solving most of the

668
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:54,709
they're tools for solving most of the
 

669
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:55,870
they're tools for solving most of the
major problems and artificial

670
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:55,880
major problems and artificial
 

671
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,420
major problems and artificial
intelligence are within a few lines of

672
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,430
intelligence are within a few lines of
 

673
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,509
intelligence are within a few lines of
code for most kids and that's incredible

674
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
code for most kids and that's incredible
 

675
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,800
code for most kids and that's incredible
to think about also on the

676
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:02,810
to think about also on the
 

677
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,170
to think about also on the
entrepreneurial side and and and at that

678
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,180
entrepreneurial side and and and at that
 

679
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,730
entrepreneurial side and and and at that
point was there any thought about

680
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:08,740
point was there any thought about
 

681
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,199
point was there any thought about
entrepreneurship before you came to

682
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:11,209
entrepreneurship before you came to
 

683
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,410
entrepreneurship before you came to
college is sort of doing your building

684
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:14,420
college is sort of doing your building
 

685
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,999
college is sort of doing your building
this into a thing that impacts the world

686
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,009
this into a thing that impacts the world
 

687
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:18,519
this into a thing that impacts the world
on the large scale yeah I've always

688
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:18,529
on the large scale yeah I've always
 

689
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,230
on the large scale yeah I've always
wanted to start a company I think that's

690
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
wanted to start a company I think that's
 

691
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,139
wanted to start a company I think that's
you know just a cool concept of creating

692
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:23,149
you know just a cool concept of creating
 

693
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,990
you know just a cool concept of creating
something and exchanging it for value or

694
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
something and exchanging it for value or
 

695
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,720
something and exchanging it for value or
creating value I guess so in high school

696
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:28,730
creating value I guess so in high school
 

697
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,210
creating value I guess so in high school
I was I was so trying to build like you

698
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:31,220
I was I was so trying to build like you
 

699
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,009
I was I was so trying to build like you
know a servo motor drivers little

700
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:33,019
know a servo motor drivers little
 

701
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,710
know a servo motor drivers little
circuit boards and sell them online or

702
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
circuit boards and sell them online or
 

703
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,559
circuit boards and sell them online or
other other things like that and

704
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:37,569
other other things like that and
 

705
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,550
other other things like that and
certainly knew at some point I wanted to

706
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:39,560
certainly knew at some point I wanted to
 

707
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,650
certainly knew at some point I wanted to
do a startup but it wasn't really I'd

708
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:41,660
do a startup but it wasn't really I'd
 

709
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,030
do a startup but it wasn't really I'd
say until college until I felt like I

710
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
say until college until I felt like I
 

711
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,300
say until college until I felt like I
had the

712
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,310
had the
 

713
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,920
had the
I guess the right combination of the

714
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:46,930
I guess the right combination of the
 

715
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,720
I guess the right combination of the
environment the smart people around you

716
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:48,730
environment the smart people around you
 

717
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,210
environment the smart people around you
and some free time and a lot of free

718
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,220
and some free time and a lot of free
 

719
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,970
and some free time and a lot of free
time at MIT so you came to MIT as an

720
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:53,980
time at MIT so you came to MIT as an
 

721
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,330
time at MIT so you came to MIT as an
undergrad 2004 that's right and that's

722
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:57,340
undergrad 2004 that's right and that's
 

723
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,130
undergrad 2004 that's right and that's
when the first DARPA Grand Challenge was

724
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,140
when the first DARPA Grand Challenge was
 

725
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,640
when the first DARPA Grand Challenge was
happening yeah the the timing of that is

726
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:01,650
happening yeah the the timing of that is
 

727
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,080
happening yeah the the timing of that is
beautifully poetic so how did you get

728
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,090
beautifully poetic so how did you get
 

729
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,090
beautifully poetic so how did you get
yourself involved in that one originally

730
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,100
yourself involved in that one originally
 

731
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,950
yourself involved in that one originally
there wasn't a official entry yeah

732
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:07,960
there wasn't a official entry yeah
 

733
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,080
there wasn't a official entry yeah
faculty sponsored thing and so a bunch

734
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,090
faculty sponsored thing and so a bunch
 

735
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,110
faculty sponsored thing and so a bunch
of undergrads myself included I started

736
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
of undergrads myself included I started
 

737
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,500
of undergrads myself included I started
meeting and got together and tried to

738
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,510
meeting and got together and tried to
 

739
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,970
meeting and got together and tried to
haggle together some sponsorships we got

740
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:17,980
haggle together some sponsorships we got
 

741
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,800
haggle together some sponsorships we got
a vehicle donated a bunch of sensors and

742
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:19,810
a vehicle donated a bunch of sensors and
 

743
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,840
a vehicle donated a bunch of sensors and
tried to put something together and so

744
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:21,850
tried to put something together and so
 

745
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,090
tried to put something together and so
we had our team was probably mostly

746
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:24,100
we had our team was probably mostly
 

747
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,950
we had our team was probably mostly
freshmen and sophomores you know which

748
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:25,960
freshmen and sophomores you know which
 

749
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,230
freshmen and sophomores you know which
was not really a fair fair fight against

750
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
was not really a fair fair fight against
 

751
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,050
was not really a fair fair fight against
maybe the you know postdoc and

752
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,060
maybe the you know postdoc and
 

753
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,940
maybe the you know postdoc and
faculty-led teams from other schools but

754
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:32,950
faculty-led teams from other schools but
 

755
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,100
faculty-led teams from other schools but
we we got something up and running we

756
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,110
we we got something up and running we
 

757
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,140
we we got something up and running we
had our vehicle drive by a wire and you

758
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,150
had our vehicle drive by a wire and you
 

759
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,390
had our vehicle drive by a wire and you
know very very basic control and things

760
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:39,400
know very very basic control and things
 

761
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,540
know very very basic control and things
but on the day of the qualifying for pre

762
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:45,550
but on the day of the qualifying for pre
 

763
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,020
but on the day of the qualifying for pre
qualifying round the one and only

764
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,030
qualifying round the one and only
 

765
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,940
qualifying round the one and only
steering motor that we had purchased the

766
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:50,950
steering motor that we had purchased the
 

767
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,320
steering motor that we had purchased the
thing that we had you know retrofitted

768
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,330
thing that we had you know retrofitted
 

769
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,410
thing that we had you know retrofitted
to turn the steering wheel on the truck

770
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,420
to turn the steering wheel on the truck
 

771
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,360
to turn the steering wheel on the truck
died and so our vehicle was just dead in

772
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,370
died and so our vehicle was just dead in
 

773
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,220
died and so our vehicle was just dead in
the water couldn't steer so we didn't

774
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,230
the water couldn't steer so we didn't
 

775
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,140
the water couldn't steer so we didn't
make it very far on the hardware side so

776
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,150
make it very far on the hardware side so
 

777
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,470
make it very far on the hardware side so
was there a software component was there

778
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:03,480
was there a software component was there
 

779
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,730
was there a software component was there
like how did your view of autonomous

780
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:05,740
like how did your view of autonomous
 

781
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,990
like how did your view of autonomous
vehicles in terms of artificial

782
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,000
vehicles in terms of artificial
 

783
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,770
vehicles in terms of artificial
intelligence evolve in this moment I

784
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:10,780
intelligence evolve in this moment I
 

785
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,960
intelligence evolve in this moment I
mean you know like you said from the 80s

786
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:12,970
mean you know like you said from the 80s
 

787
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,460
mean you know like you said from the 80s
has been autonomous vehicles but really

788
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:14,470
has been autonomous vehicles but really
 

789
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,200
has been autonomous vehicles but really
that was the birth of the modern wave

790
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,210
that was the birth of the modern wave
 

791
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,380
that was the birth of the modern wave
the the thing that captivated everyone's

792
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,390
the the thing that captivated everyone's
 

793
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,970
the the thing that captivated everyone's
imagination that we can actually do this

794
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:20,980
imagination that we can actually do this
 

795
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,110
imagination that we can actually do this
so what how were you captivated in that

796
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
so what how were you captivated in that
 

797
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,270
so what how were you captivated in that
way so how did your view of autonomous

798
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,280
way so how did your view of autonomous
 

799
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,460
way so how did your view of autonomous
vehicles change at that point I'd say at

800
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:29,470
vehicles change at that point I'd say at
 

801
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,629
vehicles change at that point I'd say at
that point in time it was it was a

802
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639

 

803
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,119

the curiosity as in like is this really

804
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:35,129
the curiosity as in like is this really
 

805
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:37,729
the curiosity as in like is this really
possible and I think that was generally

806
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:37,739
possible and I think that was generally
 

807
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:41,169
possible and I think that was generally
the spirit and the the purpose of that

808
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:41,179
the spirit and the the purpose of that
 

809
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:43,639
the spirit and the the purpose of that
original DARPA Grand Challenge which was

810
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:43,649
original DARPA Grand Challenge which was
 

811
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,799
original DARPA Grand Challenge which was
to just get a whole bunch of really

812
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:45,809
to just get a whole bunch of really
 

813
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,799
to just get a whole bunch of really
brilliant people exploring the space and

814
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:48,809
brilliant people exploring the space and
 

815
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,900
brilliant people exploring the space and
pushing the limits and and I think like

816
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:50,910
pushing the limits and and I think like
 

817
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,299
pushing the limits and and I think like
to this day that DARPA challenge with

818
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:53,309
to this day that DARPA challenge with
 

819
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,519
to this day that DARPA challenge with
its you know million dollar prize pool

820
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:55,529
its you know million dollar prize pool
 

821
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,129
its you know million dollar prize pool
was probably one of the most effective

822
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:58,139
was probably one of the most effective
 

823
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,069
was probably one of the most effective
you know uses of taxpayer money dollar

824
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:01,079
you know uses of taxpayer money dollar
 

825
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,289
you know uses of taxpayer money dollar
for dollar that I've seen you know

826
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:03,299
for dollar that I've seen you know
 

827
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:06,350
for dollar that I've seen you know
because that that small sort of

828
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:06,360
because that that small sort of
 

829
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,350
because that that small sort of
initiative that DARPA put put out sort

830
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
initiative that DARPA put put out sort
 

831
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,840
initiative that DARPA put put out sort
of in my view was the catalyst or the

832
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,850
of in my view was the catalyst or the
 

833
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,479
of in my view was the catalyst or the
tipping point for this this whole next

834
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:14,489
tipping point for this this whole next
 

835
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:15,979
tipping point for this this whole next
wave of autonomous vehicle development

836
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:15,989
wave of autonomous vehicle development
 

837
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:17,749
wave of autonomous vehicle development
so that was pretty cool so let me jump

838
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:17,759
so that was pretty cool so let me jump
 

839
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,389
so that was pretty cool so let me jump
around a little bit on that point they

840
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
around a little bit on that point they
 

841
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,729
around a little bit on that point they
also did the urban challenge where I was

842
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:22,739
also did the urban challenge where I was
 

843
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,350
also did the urban challenge where I was
in the city but it was very artificial

844
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:24,360
in the city but it was very artificial
 

845
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,299
in the city but it was very artificial
and there's no pedestrians and there's

846
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:26,309
and there's no pedestrians and there's
 

847
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:28,419
and there's no pedestrians and there's
very little human involvement except a

848
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:28,429
very little human involvement except a
 

849
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,910
very little human involvement except a
few professional drivers yeah do you

850
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
few professional drivers yeah do you
 

851
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,530
few professional drivers yeah do you
think there's room and then there was

852
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:33,540
think there's room and then there was
 

853
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,879
think there's room and then there was
the Robotics Challenge with humanoid

854
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:34,889
the Robotics Challenge with humanoid
 

855
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,699
the Robotics Challenge with humanoid
robots right so in your now role is

856
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:37,709
robots right so in your now role is
 

857
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,409
robots right so in your now role is
looking at this you're trying to solve

858
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:39,419
looking at this you're trying to solve
 

859
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:42,319
looking at this you're trying to solve
one of the you know autonomous driving

860
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:42,329
one of the you know autonomous driving
 

861
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:43,999
one of the you know autonomous driving
one of the harder more difficult places

862
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:44,009
one of the harder more difficult places
 

863
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,159
one of the harder more difficult places
of San Francisco is there a role for

864
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:46,169
of San Francisco is there a role for
 

865
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,289
of San Francisco is there a role for
DARPA to step in to also kind of help

866
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:48,299
DARPA to step in to also kind of help
 

867
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,030
DARPA to step in to also kind of help
out they challenge with new ideas

868
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,040
out they challenge with new ideas
 

869
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,530
out they challenge with new ideas
specifically a pedestrians and so on all

870
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:54,540
specifically a pedestrians and so on all
 

871
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,030
specifically a pedestrians and so on all
these kinds of interesting things well I

872
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,040
these kinds of interesting things well I
 

873
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,049
these kinds of interesting things well I
haven't I haven't thought about it from

874
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:57,059
haven't I haven't thought about it from
 

875
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,460
haven't I haven't thought about it from
that perspective is there anything DARPA

876
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:58,470
that perspective is there anything DARPA
 

877
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,109
that perspective is there anything DARPA
could do today to further accelerate

878
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:00,119
could do today to further accelerate
 

879
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:03,499
could do today to further accelerate
things and I would say my instinct is

880
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:03,509
things and I would say my instinct is
 

881
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,329
things and I would say my instinct is
that that's maybe not the highest and

882
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:05,339
that that's maybe not the highest and
 

883
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,799
that that's maybe not the highest and
best use of their resources in time

884
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:06,809
best use of their resources in time
 

885
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:09,979
best use of their resources in time
because like kick starting and spinning

886
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:09,989
because like kick starting and spinning
 

887
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,600
because like kick starting and spinning
up the flywheel is I think what what

888
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,610
up the flywheel is I think what what
 

889
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,400
up the flywheel is I think what what
they did in this case for a very very

890
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:13,410
they did in this case for a very very
 

891
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,909
they did in this case for a very very
little money but today this has become

892
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:15,919
little money but today this has become
 

893
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,259
little money but today this has become
this has become like commercially

894
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:18,269
this has become like commercially
 

895
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,030
this has become like commercially
interesting to very large companies and

896
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,040
interesting to very large companies and
 

897
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,499
interesting to very large companies and
the amount of money going into it and

898
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:21,509
the amount of money going into it and
 

899
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:23,900
the amount of money going into it and
the amount of people like going through

900
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:23,910
the amount of people like going through
 

901
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,189
the amount of people like going through
your class and learning about these

902
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
your class and learning about these
 

903
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,960
your class and learning about these
things and developing these skills is

904
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:26,970
things and developing these skills is
 

905
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,150
things and developing these skills is
just you know orders of magnitude more

906
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,160
just you know orders of magnitude more
 

907
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,309
just you know orders of magnitude more
than it was back then and so there's

908
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:31,319
than it was back then and so there's
 

909
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,489
than it was back then and so there's
enough momentum and inertia and energy

910
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:34,499
enough momentum and inertia and energy
 

911
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:36,019
enough momentum and inertia and energy
and investment dollars into this space

912
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:36,029
and investment dollars into this space
 

913
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,229
and investment dollars into this space
right now that I don't I don't I think

914
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:39,239
right now that I don't I don't I think
 

915
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,299
right now that I don't I don't I think
they're I think they're they can just

916
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:41,309
they're I think they're they can just
 

917
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,679
they're I think they're they can just
say mission accomplished and move on to

918
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:42,689
say mission accomplished and move on to
 

919
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:44,569
say mission accomplished and move on to
the next area of technology that that

920
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:44,579
the next area of technology that that
 

921
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:45,630
the next area of technology that that
needs help

922
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:45,640
needs help
 

923
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,470
needs help
so then stepping back to MIT you left on

924
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:49,480
so then stepping back to MIT you left on
 

925
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,300
so then stepping back to MIT you left on
my teaching a junior year what was that

926
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,310
my teaching a junior year what was that
 

927
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,030
my teaching a junior year what was that
decision like as I said I always wanted

928
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,040
decision like as I said I always wanted
 

929
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,280
decision like as I said I always wanted
to do a company in or start a company

930
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,290
to do a company in or start a company
 

931
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,710
to do a company in or start a company
and this opportunity landed in my lap

932
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
and this opportunity landed in my lap
 

933
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,009
and this opportunity landed in my lap
which was a couple guys from Yale we're

934
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:02,019
which was a couple guys from Yale we're
 

935
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,870
which was a couple guys from Yale we're
starting a new company and I googled

936
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:03,880
starting a new company and I googled
 

937
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,699
starting a new company and I googled
them and found that they had started a

938
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:05,709
them and found that they had started a
 

939
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:08,010
them and found that they had started a
company previously and sold it actually

940
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,020
company previously and sold it actually
 

941
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,140
company previously and sold it actually
on eBay for about a quarter million

942
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,150
on eBay for about a quarter million
 

943
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,240
on eBay for about a quarter million
bucks which was a pretty interesting

944
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,250
bucks which was a pretty interesting
 

945
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,309
bucks which was a pretty interesting
story but so I thought to myself these

946
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
story but so I thought to myself these
 

947
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,199
story but so I thought to myself these
guys are you know rock star

948
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:16,209
guys are you know rock star
 

949
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,169
guys are you know rock star
entrepreneurs they've done this before

991
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,250
that was quite a an unexpected journey
so no regrets no looking back it was

992
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,260
so no regrets no looking back it was
 

993
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,970
so no regrets no looking back it was
just an obvious

994
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:08,980
just an obvious
 

995
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,130
just an obvious
I mean one-way ticket I mean if we just

996
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,140
I mean one-way ticket I mean if we just
 

997
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,690
I mean one-way ticket I mean if we just
pause on that for a second

998
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:12,700
pause on that for a second
 

999
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,799
pause on that for a second
there was no how did you know these were

1000
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:16,809
there was no how did you know these were
 

1001
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,150
there was no how did you know these were
the right guys this is the right

1002
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
the right guys this is the right
 

1003
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,299
the right guys this is the right
decision you didn't think it was just

1004
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:21,309
decision you didn't think it was just
 

1005
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,770
decision you didn't think it was just
follow the heart kind of thing well I

1006
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:22,780
follow the heart kind of thing well I
 

1007
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,840
follow the heart kind of thing well I
didn't know but you know just trying

1008
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:24,850
didn't know but you know just trying
 

1009
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,490
didn't know but you know just trying
something for a month during IEP he

1010
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:26,500
something for a month during IEP he
 

1011
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,020
something for a month during IEP he
seems pretty little risk right right and

1012
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,030
seems pretty little risk right right and
 

1013
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,940
seems pretty little risk right right and
then you know well maybe I'll take a

1014
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:29,950
then you know well maybe I'll take a
 

1015
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,500
then you know well maybe I'll take a
semester off and my teas pretty flexible

1016
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:31,510
semester off and my teas pretty flexible
 

1017
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,270
semester off and my teas pretty flexible
about that you can always go back right

1018
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
about that you can always go back right
 

1019
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,430
about that you can always go back right
and then after two or three cycles of

1020
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
and then after two or three cycles of
 

1021
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,110
and then after two or three cycles of
that I eventually threw in the towel but

1022
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
that I eventually threw in the towel but
 

1023
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,480
that I eventually threw in the towel but
you know I think it's

1024
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,490

 

1025
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,549

I guess in that case I felt like I could

1026
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
I guess in that case I felt like I could
 

1027
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,470
I guess in that case I felt like I could
always hit the undo button if I had to

1028
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
always hit the undo button if I had to
 

1029
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,560
always hit the undo button if I had to
right but it never lasts from from when

1030
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:47,570
right but it never lasts from from when
 

1031
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,409
right but it never lasts from from when
you look in retrospect I mean it seems

1032
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:50,419
you look in retrospect I mean it seems
 

1033
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,299
you look in retrospect I mean it seems
like a brave decision that you know it's

1034
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:52,309
like a brave decision that you know it's
 

1035
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:53,379
like a brave decision that you know it's
difficult it would be difficult for a

1036
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:53,389
difficult it would be difficult for a
 

1037
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:54,999
difficult it would be difficult for a
lot of people to make it wasn't as

1038
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:55,009
lot of people to make it wasn't as
 

1039
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,970
lot of people to make it wasn't as
popular I'd say that the general you

1040
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:57,980
popular I'd say that the general you
 

1041
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,460
popular I'd say that the general you
know flux of people out of MIT at the

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:00,470
know flux of people out of MIT at the
 

1043
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,310
know flux of people out of MIT at the
time was mostly into you know financier

1044
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:03,320
time was mostly into you know financier
 

1045
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,899

I'd say that's it's probably inverted
 

1053

maybe twenty-one years old then and not
very experienced at programming but as

1106
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,170
very experienced at programming but as
 

1107
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,610
very experienced at programming but as
with with everything in a start-up

1108
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:22,620
with with everything in a start-up
 

1109
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,170
with with everything in a start-up
you're sort of racing against the clock

1110
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:24,180
you're sort of racing against the clock
 

1111
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,500
you're sort of racing against the clock
and so our plan was the second we had

1112
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:27,510
and so our plan was the second we had
 

1113
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,910
and so our plan was the second we had
this live streaming camera backpack up

1114
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:31,920
this live streaming camera backpack up
 

1115
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,560
this live streaming camera backpack up
and running where Justin could wear it

1116
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:33,570
and running where Justin could wear it
 

1117
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,360
and running where Justin could wear it
and no matter where he went in a city it

1118
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,370
and no matter where he went in a city it
 

1119
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,530
and no matter where he went in a city it
would be streaming live video and this

1120
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:36,540
would be streaming live video and this
 

1121
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,240
would be streaming live video and this
is even before the iPhones this is like

1122
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,250
is even before the iPhones this is like
 

1123
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,720
is even before the iPhones this is like
hard to do back then we would launch and

1124
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:41,730
hard to do back then we would launch and
 

1125
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,150
hard to do back then we would launch and
so we thought we were there and and the

1126
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,160
so we thought we were there and and the
 

1127
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,280
so we thought we were there and and the
backpack was working and then we sent

1128
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,290
backpack was working and then we sent
 

1129
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,140
backpack was working and then we sent
out all the emails to launch the launch

1130
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,150
out all the emails to launch the launch
 

1131
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,610
out all the emails to launch the launch
the company and do the press thing and

1132
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:49,620
the company and do the press thing and
 

1133
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,160
the company and do the press thing and
then you know we weren't quite actually

1134
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,170
then you know we weren't quite actually
 

1135
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,670
then you know we weren't quite actually
there and then we thought oh well you

1136
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:55,680
there and then we thought oh well you
 

1137
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,600
there and then we thought oh well you
know they're not going to announce it

1138
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:56,610
know they're not going to announce it
 

1139
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,260
know they're not going to announce it
until maybe 10 a.m. the next morning and

1140
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,270
until maybe 10 a.m. the next morning and
 

1141
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,600
until maybe 10 a.m. the next morning and
it's I don't know it's 5 p.m. now so how

1142
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:02,610
it's I don't know it's 5 p.m. now so how
 

1143
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,010
it's I don't know it's 5 p.m. now so how
many hours do we have left what is that

1144
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,020
many hours do we have left what is that
 

1145
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,360
many hours do we have left what is that
like you have 17 hours to go and and and

1146
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,370
like you have 17 hours to go and and and
 

1147
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,670
like you have 17 hours to go and and and
that was that was gonna be fine was the

1148
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:10,680
that was that was gonna be fine was the
 

1149
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,530
that was that was gonna be fine was the
problem obvious did you understand what

1150
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:12,540
problem obvious did you understand what
 

1151
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,150
problem obvious did you understand what
could possibly like how complicated was

1152
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,160
could possibly like how complicated was
 

1153
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,630
could possibly like how complicated was
the system at that point it was it was

1154
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:17,640
the system at that point it was it was
 

1155
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,140
the system at that point it was it was
pretty messy so to get a live video feed

1156
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,150
pretty messy so to get a live video feed
 

1157
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,150
pretty messy so to get a live video feed
that looked decent working from anywhere

1158
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,160
that looked decent working from anywhere
 

1159
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,210
that looked decent working from anywhere
in San Francisco I put together the

1160
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:26,220
in San Francisco I put together the
 

1161
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,040
in San Francisco I put together the
system where we had like three or four

1162
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,050
system where we had like three or four
 

1163
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,170
system where we had like three or four
cell phone data modems and they were

1164
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:30,180
cell phone data modems and they were
 

1165
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,930
cell phone data modems and they were
like we take the video stream and you

1166
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:32,940
like we take the video stream and you
 

1167
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,850
like we take the video stream and you
know sort of spray it across these three

1168
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:34,860
know sort of spray it across these three
 

1169
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,440
know sort of spray it across these three
or four modems and then try to catch all

1170
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,450
or four modems and then try to catch all
 

1171
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,030
or four modems and then try to catch all
the packets on the other side you know

1172
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,040
the packets on the other side you know
 

1173
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,380
the packets on the other side you know
with unreliable cell phone networks

1174
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,390
with unreliable cell phone networks
 

1175
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,230
with unreliable cell phone networks
pretty low level networking yeah and and

1176
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
pretty low level networking yeah and and
 

1177
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,790
pretty low level networking yeah and and
putting his like you know sort of

1178
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:43,800
putting his like you know sort of
 

1179
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,650
putting his like you know sort of
protocols on top of all that to

1180
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:45,660
protocols on top of all that to
 

1181
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660
protocols on top of all that to
reassemble and reorder the packets and

1182
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:47,670
reassemble and reorder the packets and
 

1183
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,370
reassemble and reorder the packets and
have time buffers and error correction

1184
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:49,380
have time buffers and error correction
 

1185
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,150
have time buffers and error correction
and all that kind of stuff and the night

1186
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,160
and all that kind of stuff and the night
 

1187
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,800
and all that kind of stuff and the night
before it was just staticky every once

1188
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:54,810
before it was just staticky every once
 

1189
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,180
before it was just staticky every once
in while the image would would go

1190
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,190
in while the image would would go
 

1191
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,560
in while the image would would go
staticky and there would be this

1192
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:57,570
staticky and there would be this
 

1193
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,140
staticky and there would be this
horrible like screeching audio noise

1194
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,150
horrible like screeching audio noise
 

1195
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,790
horrible like screeching audio noise
because the audio was also corrupted and

1196
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:01,800
because the audio was also corrupted and
 

1197
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,980
because the audio was also corrupted and
this would happen like every five to ten

1198
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:03,990
this would happen like every five to ten
 

1199
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,500
this would happen like every five to ten
minutes or so and it was a really you

1200
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:06,510
minutes or so and it was a really you
 

1201
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,390
minutes or so and it was a really you
know off-putting to the viewers

1202
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
know off-putting to the viewers
 

1203
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,490
know off-putting to the viewers
how do you tackle that problem what was

1204
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:10,500
how do you tackle that problem what was
 

1205
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,920
how do you tackle that problem what was
the just freaking out behind a computer

1206
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:12,930
the just freaking out behind a computer
 

1207
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,530
the just freaking out behind a computer
there's the word are there other other

1208
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:15,540
there's the word are there other other
 

1209
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,180
there's the word are there other other
folks working on this problem like we

1210
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,190
folks working on this problem like we
 

1211
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,799
folks working on this problem like we
behind a whiteboard were you doing uh

1212
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:18,809
behind a whiteboard were you doing uh
 

1213
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:22,460
behind a whiteboard were you doing uh
yes a little hair coding it has a little

1214
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:22,470
yes a little hair coding it has a little
 

1215
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,990
yes a little hair coding it has a little
only because there's four of us working

1216
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,000
only because there's four of us working
 

1217
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,520
only because there's four of us working
on the company and only two people

1218
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,530
on the company and only two people
 

1219
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,860
on the company and only two people
really wrote code and Emmett wrote the

1220
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:27,870
really wrote code and Emmett wrote the
 

1221
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,570
really wrote code and Emmett wrote the
website in the chat system and I wrote

1222
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:29,580
website in the chat system and I wrote
 

1223
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,670
website in the chat system and I wrote
the software for this video streaming

1224
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:31,680
the software for this video streaming
 

1225
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,760
the software for this video streaming
device and video server and so I you

1226
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:34,770
device and video server and so I you
 

1227
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,290
device and video server and so I you
know it's my sole responsibility to

1228
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:36,300
know it's my sole responsibility to
 

1229
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,090
know it's my sole responsibility to
figure that out yeah and I think I think

1230
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,100
figure that out yeah and I think I think
 

1231
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,669
figure that out yeah and I think I think
it's those you know setting setting

1232
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:40,679
it's those you know setting setting
 

1233
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:41,780
it's those you know setting setting
deadlines trying to move quickly and

1234
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:41,790
deadlines trying to move quickly and
 

1235
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,220
deadlines trying to move quickly and
everything where you're in that moment

1236
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,230
everything where you're in that moment
 

1237
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,690
everything where you're in that moment
of intense pressure that sometimes

1238
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:44,700
of intense pressure that sometimes
 

1239
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,100
of intense pressure that sometimes
people do their best and most

1240
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,110
people do their best and most
 

1241
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,840
people do their best and most
interesting work and so even though that

1242
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:47,850
interesting work and so even though that
 

1243
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,400
interesting work and so even though that
was a terrible moment I look back on it

1244
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,410
was a terrible moment I look back on it
 

1245
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,720
was a terrible moment I look back on it
fondly because that's like you know

1246
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:50,730
fondly because that's like you know
 

1247
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,070
fondly because that's like you know
that's one of those character defining

1248
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
that's one of those character defining
 

1249
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,960
that's one of those character defining
moments I think

1250
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:53,970
moments I think
 

1251
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,580
moments I think
so in 2013 October you founded cruise

1252
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:58,590
so in 2013 October you founded cruise
 

1253
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,720
so in 2013 October you founded cruise
automation yeah so progressing forward

1254
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:01,730
automation yeah so progressing forward
 

1255
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,909
automation yeah so progressing forward
another exception successful company was

1256
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:04,919
another exception successful company was
 

1257
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,299
another exception successful company was
acquired by GM in 16 for 1 billion

1258
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:08,309
acquired by GM in 16 for 1 billion
 

1259

dollars but in October 2013 what was on

1260
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:13,620
dollars but in October 2013 what was on
 

1261
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,950

your mind what was the plan how does one

1262
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:17,960
your mind what was the plan how does one
 

1263
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,240
your mind what was the plan how does one
seriously start to tackle one of the

1264
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,250
seriously start to tackle one of the
 

1265
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,529
seriously start to tackle one of the
hardest robotics

1266
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:21,539
hardest robotics
 

1267
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,029
hardest robotics
most important impact for robotics

1268
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
most important impact for robotics
 

1269
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,060
most important impact for robotics
problems of our age after going through

1270
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,070
problems of our age after going through
 

1271
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,299
problems of our age after going through
twitch twitch was was and it is today

1272
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:29,309
twitch twitch was was and it is today
 

1273
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:34,490
twitch twitch was was and it is today
pretty successful but the the work was

1274
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:34,500
pretty successful but the the work was
 

1275
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,980
pretty successful but the the work was
the result was entertainment mostly like

1276
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:36,990
the result was entertainment mostly like
 

1277
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,019
the result was entertainment mostly like
the the better the product was the more

1278
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:39,029
the the better the product was the more
 

1279
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:41,029
the the better the product was the more
we would entertain people and then you

1280
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
we would entertain people and then you
 

1281
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,769
we would entertain people and then you
know make money on them ad revenues and

1282
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:42,779
know make money on them ad revenues and
 

1283
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:44,629
know make money on them ad revenues and
other things and that was that was a

1284
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:44,639
other things and that was that was a
 

1285
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:45,680
other things and that was that was a
good thing it felt felt good to

1286
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:45,690
good thing it felt felt good to
 

1287
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,869
good thing it felt felt good to
entertain people but I figured like you

1288
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:47,879
entertain people but I figured like you
 

1289
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,129
entertain people but I figured like you
know what is really the point of

1290
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:49,139
know what is really the point of
 

1291
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:51,049
know what is really the point of
becoming a really good engineer and

1292
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:51,059
becoming a really good engineer and
 

1293
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,029
becoming a really good engineer and
developing these skills other than you

1294
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
developing these skills other than you
 

1295
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,710
developing these skills other than you
know my own enjoyment and I realized I

1296
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
know my own enjoyment and I realized I
 

1297
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,970
know my own enjoyment and I realized I
wanted something that scratched more of

1298
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:55,980
wanted something that scratched more of
 

1299
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,649
wanted something that scratched more of
an existential itch like something that

1300
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:57,659
an existential itch like something that
 

1301
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,139
an existential itch like something that
that truly matters and so I basically

1302
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:00,149
that truly matters and so I basically
 

1303
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:04,279
that truly matters and so I basically
made this list of requirements for a new

1304
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:04,289
made this list of requirements for a new
 

1305
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,049
made this list of requirements for a new
if I was going to do another company and

1306
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:06,059
if I was going to do another company and
 

1307
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,759
if I was going to do another company and
the one thing I knew in the back of my

1308
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:07,769
the one thing I knew in the back of my
 

1309
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:10,249
the one thing I knew in the back of my
head that twitch took like eight years

1310
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:10,259
head that twitch took like eight years
 

1311
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:13,070
head that twitch took like eight years
to become successful and so whatever I

1312
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,080
to become successful and so whatever I
 

1313
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,899
to become successful and so whatever I
do I better be willing to commit you

1314
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:14,909
do I better be willing to commit you
 

1315
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:17,090
do I better be willing to commit you
know at least ten years to something and

1316
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:17,100
know at least ten years to something and
 

1317
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,259
know at least ten years to something and
when you think about things from that

1318
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:18,269
when you think about things from that
 

1319
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,230
when you think about things from that
perspective

1320
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240
perspective
 

1321
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,670
perspective
you certainly I think raised the bar on

1322
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:21,680
you certainly I think raised the bar on
 

1323
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,590
you certainly I think raised the bar on
weight you choose to work on so for me

1324
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
weight you choose to work on so for me
 

1325
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,450
weight you choose to work on so for me
the three things where it had to be

1326
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:25,460
the three things where it had to be
 

1327
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,010
the three things where it had to be
something where the technology itself

1328
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,020
something where the technology itself
 

1329
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,660
something where the technology itself
determines the success of the product

1330
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:28,670
determines the success of the product
 

1331
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,030
determines the success of the product
like hard really juicy technology

1332
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,040
like hard really juicy technology
 

1333
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,920
like hard really juicy technology
problems because that's what motivates

1334
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:32,930
problems because that's what motivates
 

1335
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,620
problems because that's what motivates
me and then it had to have a direct and

1336
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:35,630
me and then it had to have a direct and
 

1337
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,360
me and then it had to have a direct and
positive impact on society in some way

1338
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:37,370
positive impact on society in some way
 

1339
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,190
positive impact on society in some way
so an example would be like you know

1340
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
so an example would be like you know
 

1341
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,930
so an example would be like you know
healthcare self-driving cars because

1342
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:40,940
healthcare self-driving cars because
 

1343
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,070
healthcare self-driving cars because
they save lives other things where

1344
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
they save lives other things where
 

1345
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,570
they save lives other things where
there's a clear connection to somehow

1346
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:43,580
there's a clear connection to somehow
 

1347
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,400
there's a clear connection to somehow
improving other people's lives and the

1348
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,410
improving other people's lives and the
 

1349
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,810
improving other people's lives and the
last one is it had to be a big business

1350
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:46,820
last one is it had to be a big business
 

1351
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,810
last one is it had to be a big business
because for the positive impact to

1352
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:49,820
because for the positive impact to
 

1353
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,040
because for the positive impact to
matter it's got to be a large scale

1354
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,050
matter it's got to be a large scale
 

1355
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,230
matter it's got to be a large scale
scale yeah and I was thinking about that

1356
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:53,240
scale yeah and I was thinking about that
 

1357
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,670
scale yeah and I was thinking about that
for a while and I made like I tried

1358
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:54,680
for a while and I made like I tried
 

1359
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,410
for a while and I made like I tried
writing a gmail clone and looked at some

1360
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:56,420
writing a gmail clone and looked at some
 

1361
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,690
writing a gmail clone and looked at some
other ideas and then it just sort of

1362
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:58,700
other ideas and then it just sort of
 

1363
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,920
other ideas and then it just sort of
light bulb went off like self-driving

1364
00:24:59,920 --> 00:24:59,930
light bulb went off like self-driving
 

1365
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,840
light bulb went off like self-driving
cars like that was the most fun I had

1366
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:01,850
cars like that was the most fun I had
 

1367
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,760
cars like that was the most fun I had
ever had in college working on that and

1368
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:03,770
ever had in college working on that and
 

1369
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,500
ever had in college working on that and
like well what's the state of the

1370
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:05,510
like well what's the state of the
 

1371
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,940
like well what's the state of the
technology has been ten years maybe

1372
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:06,950
technology has been ten years maybe
 

1373
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,890
technology has been ten years maybe
maybe times have changed and maybe now

1374
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:08,900
maybe times have changed and maybe now
 

1375
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,050
maybe times have changed and maybe now
is the time to make this work and I

1376
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,060
is the time to make this work and I
 

1377
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,940
is the time to make this work and I
poked around and looked at the only

1378
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:12,950
poked around and looked at the only
 

1379
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,200
poked around and looked at the only
other thing out there really at the time

1380
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,210
other thing out there really at the time
 

1381
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,780
other thing out there really at the time
was the Google self-driving car project

1382
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:15,790
was the Google self-driving car project
 

1383
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,450
was the Google self-driving car project
and I thought surely there's a way to

1384
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:18,460
and I thought surely there's a way to
 

1385
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,590
and I thought surely there's a way to
you know have an entrepreneur mindset

1386
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:20,600
you know have an entrepreneur mindset
 

1387
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,030
you know have an entrepreneur mindset
and sort of solve the Minimum Viable

1388
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,040
and sort of solve the Minimum Viable
 

1389
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,430
and sort of solve the Minimum Viable
Product here and so I just took the

1390
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:24,440
Product here and so I just took the
 

1391
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,480
Product here and so I just took the
plunge right then in there and said this

1392
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:25,490
plunge right then in there and said this
 

1393
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,130
plunge right then in there and said this
this is something I know I can commit

1394
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,140
this is something I know I can commit
 

1395
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,750
this is something I know I can commit
ten years to it's the probably the

1396
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:28,760
ten years to it's the probably the
 

1397
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,970
ten years to it's the probably the
greatest applied AI problem of our

1398
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:30,980
greatest applied AI problem of our
 

1399
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,590
greatest applied AI problem of our
generation it's right and if it works

1400
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:32,600
generation it's right and if it works
 

1401
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,090
generation it's right and if it works
it's going to be both a huge business

1402
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:34,100
it's going to be both a huge business
 

1403
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,280
it's going to be both a huge business
and therefore like probably the most

1404
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,290
and therefore like probably the most
 

1405
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,780
and therefore like probably the most
positive impact I can possibly have on

1406
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:37,790
positive impact I can possibly have on
 

1407
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,540
positive impact I can possibly have on
the world so after that light bulb went

1408
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:40,550
the world so after that light bulb went
 

1409
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,910
the world so after that light bulb went
off I went all in on crews immediately

1410
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:42,920
off I went all in on crews immediately
 

1411
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,600
off I went all in on crews immediately
and got to work did you have an idea how

1412
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:46,610
and got to work did you have an idea how
 

1413
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,860
and got to work did you have an idea how
to solve this problem which aspect of

1414
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:47,870
to solve this problem which aspect of

driving highway driving did you have

1422
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
driving highway driving did you have
 

1423
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,000
driving highway driving did you have
like did you have a vision of the city

1424
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,010
like did you have a vision of the city
 

1425
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,610
like did you have a vision of the city
of the future or you know the

00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:03,620
of the future or you know the

transportation is largely automated that

1428
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:06,470
transportation is largely automated that
 

1429
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,000
transportation is largely automated that
kind of thing or was it sort of more

1430
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,010
kind of thing or was it sort of more
 

1431
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,570
kind of thing or was it sort of more
fuzzy and gray area than that my

1432
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:12,580
fuzzy and gray area than that my
 

1433
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,060
fuzzy and gray area than that my
analysis of the situation is that Google

1434
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,070
analysis of the situation is that Google
 

1435
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,230
analysis of the situation is that Google
is putting a lot it had been putting a

1436
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:17,240
is putting a lot it had been putting a
 

1437
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,360
is putting a lot it had been putting a
lot of money into that project that a

1438
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,370
lot of money into that project that a
 

1439
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,380
lot of money into that project that a
lot more resources and so

1440
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,390
lot more resources and so
 

1441
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,480
lot more resources and so
and they still hadn't cracked the fully

1442
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,490
and they still hadn't cracked the fully
 

1443
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,990
and they still hadn't cracked the fully
driverless car you know this is 20 2013

1444
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
driverless car you know this is 20 2013
 

1445
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,530
driverless car you know this is 20 2013
I guess so I thought what what can I do

1446
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:31,540
I guess so I thought what what can I do
 

1447
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,650
I guess so I thought what what can I do
to sort of go from zero to you know

1448
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:34,660
to sort of go from zero to you know
 

1449
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,360
to sort of go from zero to you know
significant scale so I can actually

1450
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,370
significant scale so I can actually
 

1451
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,680
significant scale so I can actually
solve the real problem which is the

1452
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:37,690
solve the real problem which is the
 

1453
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,110
solve the real problem which is the
driverless cars and I thought here's the

1454
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,120
driverless cars and I thought here's the
 

1455
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,450
driverless cars and I thought here's the
strategy we'll start by doing a really

1456
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:42,460
strategy we'll start by doing a really
 

1457
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,730
strategy we'll start by doing a really
simple problem or solving a really

1458
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:44,740
simple problem or solving a really
 

1459
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,640
simple problem or solving a really
simple problem that creates value for

1460
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:47,650
simple problem that creates value for
 

1461
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,950
simple problem that creates value for
people so eventually ended up deciding

1462
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:49,960
people so eventually ended up deciding
 

1463
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,020
people so eventually ended up deciding
on automating highway driving which is

1464
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,030
on automating highway driving which is
 

1465
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,510
on automating highway driving which is
relatively more straightforward as long

1466
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:54,520
relatively more straightforward as long
 

1467
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,360
relatively more straightforward as long
as there's a backup driver there and

1468
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,370
as there's a backup driver there and
 

1469
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,710
as there's a backup driver there and
I'll you know the go-to-market will be

1470
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
I'll you know the go-to-market will be
 

1471
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,840
I'll you know the go-to-market will be
able retrofit people's cars and just

1472
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:00,850
able retrofit people's cars and just
 

1473
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,550
able retrofit people's cars and just
sell these products directly and the

1474
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:02,560
sell these products directly and the
 

1475
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,680
sell these products directly and the
idea was we'll take all the revenue and

1476
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:04,690
idea was we'll take all the revenue and
 

1477
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,550
idea was we'll take all the revenue and
profits from that and use it to do the

1478
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:07,560
profits from that and use it to do the
 

1479
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,290
profits from that and use it to do the
social reinvest that in research for

1480
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:10,300
social reinvest that in research for
 

1481
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,470
social reinvest that in research for
doing fully fabulous cars and that was

1482
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:13,480
doing fully fabulous cars and that was
 

1483
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:13,980
doing fully fabulous cars and that was
the plan

1484
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:13,990
the plan
 

1485
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,420
the plan
the only thing that really changed along

1486
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:15,430
the only thing that really changed along
 

1487
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,670
the only thing that really changed along
the way between then and now is we never

1488
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:17,680
the way between then and now is we never
 

1489
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,430
the way between then and now is we never
really launched the first product we had

1490
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:20,440
really launched the first product we had
 

1491
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,050
really launched the first product we had
enough interest from investors in enough

1492
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:22,060
enough interest from investors in enough
 

1493
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,150
enough interest from investors in enough
of a signal that this was something that

1494
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,160
of a signal that this was something that
 

1495
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,070
of a signal that this was something that
we should be working on that after about

1496
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
we should be working on that after about
 

1497
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,330
we should be working on that after about
a year of working on the highway

1498
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:27,340
a year of working on the highway
 

1499
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,640
a year of working on the highway
autopilot we had it working you know on

1500
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:29,650
autopilot we had it working you know on
 

1501
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,980
autopilot we had it working you know on
a prototype stage but we just completely

1502
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:31,990
a prototype stage but we just completely
 

1503
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,780
a prototype stage but we just completely
abandoned that and said we're gonna go

1504
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:33,790
abandoned that and said we're gonna go
 

1505
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,340
abandoned that and said we're gonna go
all in on driverless cars now is the

1506
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,350
all in on driverless cars now is the
 

1507
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,590
all in on driverless cars now is the
time can't think of anything that's more

1508
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:37,600
time can't think of anything that's more
 

1509
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,660
time can't think of anything that's more
exciting and if it works more impactful

1510
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:39,670
exciting and if it works more impactful
 

1511
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,910
exciting and if it works more impactful
so we're just gonna go for it the idea

1512
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:41,920
so we're just gonna go for it the idea
 

1513
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,650
so we're just gonna go for it the idea
of retrofit is kind of interesting yeah

1514
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:43,660
of retrofit is kind of interesting yeah
 

1515
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,350
of retrofit is kind of interesting yeah
being able to it's how you achieve scale

1516
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:46,360
being able to it's how you achieve scale
 

1517
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,150
being able to it's how you achieve scale
it's a really interesting idea is it's

1518
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,160
it's a really interesting idea is it's
 

1519
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,890
it's a really interesting idea is it's
something that's still in the in the

1520
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:49,900
something that's still in the in the
 

1521
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,980
something that's still in the in the
back of your mind as a possibility not

1522
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:52,990
back of your mind as a possibility not
 

1523
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,490
back of your mind as a possibility not
at all I've come full circle on that one

1524
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:56,500
at all I've come full circle on that one
 

1525
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,890
at all I've come full circle on that one
trying to build a retrofit product and

1526
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:58,900
trying to build a retrofit product and
 

1527
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,690
trying to build a retrofit product and
I'll touch on some of the complexities

1528
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:00,700
I'll touch on some of the complexities
 

1529
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,760
I'll touch on some of the complexities
of that and then also having been inside

1530
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,770
of that and then also having been inside
 

1531
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,580
of that and then also having been inside
in OEM and seeing how things work and

1532
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:05,590
in OEM and seeing how things work and
 

1533
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,460
in OEM and seeing how things work and
how a vehicle is developed and validated

1534
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,470
how a vehicle is developed and validated
 

1535
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,690
how a vehicle is developed and validated
when it comes to something that has

1536
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:09,700
when it comes to something that has
 

1537
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,400
when it comes to something that has
safety critical implications like

1538
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,410
safety critical implications like
 

1539
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,440
safety critical implications like
controlling the steering and the other

1540
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,450
controlling the steering and the other
 

1541
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,480
controlling the steering and the other
control inputs on your car it's pretty

1542
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:15,490
control inputs on your car it's pretty
 

1543
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,670
control inputs on your car it's pretty
hard to get there with with a retrofit

1544
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:17,680
hard to get there with with a retrofit
 

1545
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,730
hard to get there with with a retrofit
or if you did even if you did it it

1546
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:20,740
or if you did even if you did it it
 

1547
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,600
or if you did even if you did it it
creates a whole bunch of new

1548
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:21,610
creates a whole bunch of new
 

1549
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,210
creates a whole bunch of new
complications around liability or how

1550
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:24,220
complications around liability or how
 

1551
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,010
complications around liability or how
did you truly validate that or you know

1552
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,020
did you truly validate that or you know
 

1553
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,600
did you truly validate that or you know
something in the base vehicle fails and

1554
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:27,610
something in the base vehicle fails and
 

1555
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,010
something in the base vehicle fails and
causes your system to fail whose fault

1556
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,020
causes your system to fail whose fault
 

1557
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,040
causes your system to fail whose fault
is it

1558
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,050
is it
 

1559
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,950
is it
or if the cars anti-lock brake systems

1560
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:33,960
or if the cars anti-lock brake systems
 

1561
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,780
or if the cars anti-lock brake systems
or other things kick in or the software

00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:54,840
but I didn't at the time so we tried it
 

1585
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,930
but I didn't at the time so we tried it
anyway but it's a pitch also at the time

anyway but it's a pitch also at the time
 

1587
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,669
anyway but it's a pitch also at the time
it's a really strong one yes that's how

1588
00:28:58,669 --> 00:28:58,679
it's a really strong one yes that's how
 

1589
00:28:58,679 --> 00:28:59,960
it's a really strong one yes that's how
you achieve scale and that's how you

from a business model perspective is we

1600
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:11,580
from a business model perspective is we
 

1601
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,520
from a business model perspective is we
had kind of assumed that we'd we started

1602

had kind of assumed that we'd we started

had kind of assumed that we'd we started
with an Audi s4 as the vehicle we

with an Audi s4 as the vehicle we
 

1605
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,600
with an Audi s4 as the vehicle we
retrofitted with his highway driving

retrofitted with his highway driving
 

1607

capability and we had kind of assumed
 

1609
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,680
capability and we had kind of assumed
that if we just knock out like three

1610
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:21,690
that if we just knock out like three
 

1611
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,870
that if we just knock out like three

1619
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,919
don't know a BMW or a Honda Civic or one
of these three cars and then we surveyed

1620
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:30,929
of these three cars and then we surveyed
 

1621
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:32,540
of these three cars and then we surveyed
our users we found out that it's all

1622
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:32,550
our users we found out that it's all
 

1623
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,880
our users we found out that it's all
over the place we would to get even a

over the place we would to get even a

00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,130
over the place we would to get even a
decent number of units sold we'd have to

decent number of units sold we'd have to

support like you know 20 or 50 different
models and each one is a little

1630
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:40,710
models and each one is a little
 

1631
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,590
models and each one is a little
butterfly that takes time and effort to

1632
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:42,600
butterfly that takes time and effort to
 

1633
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,060
butterfly that takes time and effort to
maintain you know that retrofit

1634
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,070
maintain you know that retrofit
 

1635
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,890
maintain you know that retrofit
integration and custom hardware and all

1636

integration and custom hardware and all
 

1637
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,340
integration and custom hardware and all
this so is it there's a tough business

1638
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,350
this so is it there's a tough business
 

1639
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,490
this so is it there's a tough business
so GM manufactures and sells over nine

1640
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:52,500
so GM manufactures and sells over nine
 

1641
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,850
so GM manufactures and sells over nine
million cars a year and what you with

1642
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:55,860
million cars a year and what you with
 

1643
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,240
million cars a year and what you with
crews are trying to do some of the most

1644
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,250
crews are trying to do some of the most
 

1645
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,580
crews are trying to do some of the most
cutting-edge innovation in terms of

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:01,590
cutting-edge innovation in terms of
 

1647
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,280
cutting-edge innovation in terms of
applying AI and so hot out of those

1648
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,290
applying AI and so hot out of those
 

1649
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,380
applying AI and so hot out of those
you've talked about a little bit before

1650
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,390
you've talked about a little bit before
 

1651
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,640
you've talked about a little bit before
but it's also just fascinating to me

1652
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:07,650
but it's also just fascinating to me
 

1653
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,130
but it's also just fascinating to me
we'll work a lot of automakers you know

1654
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,140
we'll work a lot of automakers you know
 

1655
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,960
we'll work a lot of automakers you know
the difference between the gap between

1656
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:11,970
the difference between the gap between
 

1657
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,210
the difference between the gap between
Detroit and Silicon Valley

1658
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:14,220
Detroit and Silicon Valley
 

1659
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,590
Detroit and Silicon Valley
let's say just to be sort of poetic

1660
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
let's say just to be sort of poetic
 

1661
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,810
let's say just to be sort of poetic
about it I guess what how do you close

1662
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:17,820
about it I guess what how do you close
 

1663
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,870
about it I guess what how do you close
that gap how do you take GM into the

1664
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:20,880
that gap how do you take GM into the
 

1665
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,760
that gap how do you take GM into the
future where a large part of the fleet

1666
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:22,770
future where a large part of the fleet
 

1667
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,190
future where a large part of the fleet
would be autonomous perhaps I want to

1668
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
would be autonomous perhaps I want to
 

1669
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,590
would be autonomous perhaps I want to
start by acknowledging that that GM is

1670
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
start by acknowledging that that GM is
 

1671
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,330
start by acknowledging that that GM is
made up of you know tens of thousands of

1672
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:29,340
made up of you know tens of thousands of
 

1673
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,100
made up of you know tens of thousands of
really brilliant motivated people who

1674
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,110
really brilliant motivated people who
 

1675
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,410
really brilliant motivated people who
want to be a part of the future and so

1676
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:33,420
want to be a part of the future and so
 

1677
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,299
want to be a part of the future and so
it's pretty fun to work within the

1678
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:35,309
it's pretty fun to work within the
 

1679
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:37,400
it's pretty fun to work within the
attitude inside a car company like that

1680
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,410
attitude inside a car company like that
 

1681
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,070
attitude inside a car company like that
is you know embracing this this

1682
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
is you know embracing this this
 

1683
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,510
is you know embracing this this
transformation and change rather than

1684
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
transformation and change rather than
 

1685
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,649
transformation and change rather than
fearing it and I

1686
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:42,659
fearing it and I
 

1687
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,629
fearing it and I
think that's a testament to the

1688
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:44,639
think that's a testament to the
 

1689
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:45,979
think that's a testament to the
leadership at GM and that's flown all

1690
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:45,989
leadership at GM and that's flown all
 

1691
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:47,899
leadership at GM and that's flown all
the way through to to everyone you talk

1692
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:47,909
the way through to to everyone you talk
 

1693
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:48,979
the way through to to everyone you talk
to even the people in this in blue

1694
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:48,989
to even the people in this in blue
 

1695
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:51,349
to even the people in this in blue
plants working on these cars so that's

1696
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:51,359
plants working on these cars so that's
 

1697
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,359
plants working on these cars so that's
really great so that starting from that

1698
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:53,369
really great so that starting from that
 

1699
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:56,589
really great so that starting from that
position makes a lot easier so then when

1700
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:56,599
position makes a lot easier so then when
 

1701
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:59,479
position makes a lot easier so then when
the the people in San Francisco at Cruz

1702
00:30:59,479 --> 00:30:59,489
the the people in San Francisco at Cruz
 

1703
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:01,549
the the people in San Francisco at Cruz
interact with the people at GM at least

1704
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:01,559
interact with the people at GM at least
 

1705
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,869
interact with the people at GM at least
we have this common set of values which

1706
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:02,879
we have this common set of values which
 

1707
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:04,159
we have this common set of values which
is that we really want this stuff to

1708
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:04,169
is that we really want this stuff to
 

1709
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:06,019
is that we really want this stuff to
work because we think it's important and

1710
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:06,029
work because we think it's important and
 

1711
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:08,440
work because we think it's important and
we think it's the future

1712
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,450
we think it's the future
 

1713
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,750
we think it's the future
not to say you know those two cultures

not to say you know those two cultures
 

1715
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,550
not to say you know those two cultures
don't clash they absolutely do there's

1716
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:12,560
don't clash they absolutely do there's
 

1717
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,170
don't clash they absolutely do there's
different different sort of value

1718

different different sort of value
 

1719
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,020

systems like in a car company the thing

1720
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,030
systems like in a car company the thing
 

1721
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,150
systems like in a car company the thing
that gets you promoted and so the reward

1722
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:19,160
that gets you promoted and so the reward
 

1723
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,360
that gets you promoted and so the reward
system is following the processes

1724
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,370
system is following the processes
 

1725
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,970
system is following the processes
delivering the the program on-time and

1726
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:24,980
delivering the the program on-time and
 

1727
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,590
delivering the the program on-time and
on-budget so any sort of risk-taking is

1728
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:28,600
on-budget so any sort of risk-taking is
 

1729
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,740
on-budget so any sort of risk-taking is
discouraged in many ways because if a

1730
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:32,750
discouraged in many ways because if a
 

1731
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,750
discouraged in many ways because if a
program is late or if you shut down the

1732
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:34,760
program is late or if you shut down the
 

1733
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,280
program is late or if you shut down the
plant for a day it's you know you can

1734
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,290
plant for a day it's you know you can
 

1735
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,260
plant for a day it's you know you can
count the millions of dollars that burn

1736
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,270
count the millions of dollars that burn
 

1737
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,560
count the millions of dollars that burn
by pretty quickly whereas I think you

1738
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:41,570
by pretty quickly whereas I think you
 

1739
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,220
by pretty quickly whereas I think you
know most Silicon Valley companies and

1740
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,230
know most Silicon Valley companies and
 

1741
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,410
know most Silicon Valley companies and
crews in the methodology we were

1742
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:47,420
crews in the methodology we were
 

1743
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,970
crews in the methodology we were
employing especially around the time of

1744
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:48,980
employing especially around the time of
 

1745
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,160
employing especially around the time of
the acquisition the reward structure is

1746
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,170
the acquisition the reward structure is
 

1747
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,100
the acquisition the reward structure is
about trying to solve these complex

1748
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,110
about trying to solve these complex
 

1749
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,110
about trying to solve these complex
problems in any way shape or form or

1750
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,120
problems in any way shape or form or
 

1751
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,000
problems in any way shape or form or
coming up with crazy ideas that you know

1752
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,010
coming up with crazy ideas that you know
 

1753
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,300
coming up with crazy ideas that you know
90% of them won't work and and so so

1754
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,310
90% of them won't work and and so so
 

1755
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,250
90% of them won't work and and so so
meshing that culture of sort of

1756
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,260
meshing that culture of sort of
 

1757
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,300
meshing that culture of sort of
continuous improvement and

1758
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:04,310
continuous improvement and
 

1759
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,010
continuous improvement and
experimentation with one where

1760
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,020
experimentation with one where
 

1761
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,330
experimentation with one where
everything needs to be you know

1762
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:07,340
everything needs to be you know
 

1763
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,220
everything needs to be you know
rigorously defined upfront so that you

1764
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,230
rigorously defined upfront so that you
 

1765
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,850
rigorously defined upfront so that you
never slip a deadline or miss a budget

1766
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,860
never slip a deadline or miss a budget
 

1767
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,310
never slip a deadline or miss a budget
was a pretty big challenge and that

1768
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,320
was a pretty big challenge and that
 

1769
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,320
was a pretty big challenge and that
we're over three years in now after the

1770
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,330
we're over three years in now after the
 

1771
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,480
we're over three years in now after the
acquisition and I'd say like you know

1772
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:19,490
acquisition and I'd say like you know
 

1773
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,040
acquisition and I'd say like you know
the investment we made in figuring out

1774
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,050
the investment we made in figuring out
 

1775
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,650
the investment we made in figuring out
how to work together successfully and

1776
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:23,660
how to work together successfully and
 

1777
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,080
how to work together successfully and
who should do what and how we bridge the

1778
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,090
who should do what and how we bridge the
 

1779
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,070
who should do what and how we bridge the
gaps between these very different

1780
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,080
gaps between these very different
 

1781
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,780
gaps between these very different
systems and way of doing engineering

1782
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:28,790
systems and way of doing engineering
 

1783
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,760
systems and way of doing engineering
work is now one of our greatest assets

1784
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:30,770
work is now one of our greatest assets
 

1785
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,600
work is now one of our greatest assets
because I think we have this really

1786
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:31,610
because I think we have this really
 

1787
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,600
because I think we have this really
powerful thing but for a while it was

1788
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:33,610
powerful thing but for a while it was
 

1789
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,340
powerful thing but for a while it was
both both GM and crews were very steep

1790
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,350
both both GM and crews were very steep
 

1791
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,110
both both GM and crews were very steep
on the learning curve yes I'm sure it

1792
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,120
on the learning curve yes I'm sure it
 

1793
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,640
on the learning curve yes I'm sure it
was very stressful it's really important

1794
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:39,650
was very stressful it's really important
 

1795
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,100
was very stressful it's really important
work because that's that's how to

1796
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,110
work because that's that's how to
 

1797
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,570
work because that's that's how to
revolutionize the transportation it

1798
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:43,580
revolutionize the transportation it
 

1799
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,180
revolutionize the transportation it
really to revolutionize any system you

1800
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,190
really to revolutionize any system you
 

1801
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,100
really to revolutionize any system you
know you look at the healthcare system

1802
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,110
know you look at the healthcare system
 

1803
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,810
know you look at the healthcare system
or you look at the legal system I have

1804
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:49,820
or you look at the legal system I have
 

1805
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,520
or you look at the legal system I have
people like lawyers come up to me all

1806
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:51,530
people like lawyers come up to me all
 

1807
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,650
people like lawyers come up to me all
the time like everything they're working

1808
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:53,660
the time like everything they're working
 

1809
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,380
the time like everything they're working
on can easily be automated but then

1810
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:56,390
on can easily be automated but then
 

1811
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,000
on can easily be automated but then
that's not a good feeling yeah that was

1812
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,010
that's not a good feeling yeah that was
 

1813
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,070
that's not a good feeling yeah that was
it's not a good feeling but also there's

1814
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
it's not a good feeling but also there's
 

1815
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,740
it's not a good feeling but also there's
no way to automate because the the the

1816
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:02,750
no way to automate because the the the
 

1817
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,410
no way to automate because the the the
entire infrastructure is really you know

1818
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:05,420
entire infrastructure is really you know
 

1819
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,080
entire infrastructure is really you know
based is older and it moves very slowly

1820
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,090
based is older and it moves very slowly
 

1821
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,960
based is older and it moves very slowly
and so how do you close the gap between

1822
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:10,970
and so how do you close the gap between
 

1823
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,230
and so how do you close the gap between
I haven't how can I replace of course

1824
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,240
I haven't how can I replace of course
 

1825
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,340
I haven't how can I replace of course
lawyers don't wanna be replaced with an

1826
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,350
lawyers don't wanna be replaced with an
 

1827
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,020
lawyers don't wanna be replaced with an
app but you could replace a lot of

1828
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,030
app but you could replace a lot of
 

1829
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,390
app but you could replace a lot of
aspect when most of the data is still on

1830
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:19,400
aspect when most of the data is still on
 

1831
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,170
aspect when most of the data is still on
paper

1832
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:20,180
paper
 

1833
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,580
paper
and so the same thing was with

1834
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:21,590
and so the same thing was with
 

1835
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,460
and so the same thing was with
automotive I mean it's fundamentally

1836
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,470
automotive I mean it's fundamentally
 

1837
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,460
automotive I mean it's fundamentally
software so it's is basically hiring

1838
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,470
software so it's is basically hiring
 

1839
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,110
software so it's is basically hiring
software engineers it's thinking a

1840
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
software engineers it's thinking a
 

1841
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,000
software engineers it's thinking a
software world I mean I'm pretty sure

1842
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,010
software world I mean I'm pretty sure
 

1843
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,220
software world I mean I'm pretty sure
nobody in Silicon Valley's ever hit a

1844
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,230
nobody in Silicon Valley's ever hit a
 

1845
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,670
nobody in Silicon Valley's ever hit a
deadline so and then it's probably true

1846
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:36,680
deadline so and then it's probably true
 

1847
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,040
deadline so and then it's probably true
yeah and GSI is probably the opposite

1848
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,050
yeah and GSI is probably the opposite
 

1849
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,620
yeah and GSI is probably the opposite
yeah so that's that culture gap is

1850
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:41,630
yeah so that's that culture gap is
 

1851
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,420
yeah so that's that culture gap is
really fascinating so you're optimistic

1852
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,430
really fascinating so you're optimistic
 

1853
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,670
really fascinating so you're optimistic
about the future of that yeah I mean

1854
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:45,680
about the future of that yeah I mean
 

1855
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,560
about the future of that yeah I mean
from what I've seen it's impressive and

1856
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:47,570
from what I've seen it's impressive and
 

1857
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,150
from what I've seen it's impressive and
I think like especially in Silicon

1858
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,160
I think like especially in Silicon
 

1859
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,010
I think like especially in Silicon
Valley it's easy to write off building

1860
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:51,020
Valley it's easy to write off building
 

1861
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,750
Valley it's easy to write off building
cars because you know people have been

1862
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:52,760
cars because you know people have been
 

1863
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,220
cars because you know people have been
doing that for over a hundred years now

1864
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,230
doing that for over a hundred years now
 

1865
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,080
doing that for over a hundred years now
in this country and so it seems like

1866
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,090
in this country and so it seems like
 

1867
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,520
in this country and so it seems like
that's a solved problem but that doesn't

1868
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:57,530
that's a solved problem but that doesn't
 

1869
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,130
that's a solved problem but that doesn't
mean it's an easy problem and I think it

1870
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:00,140
mean it's an easy problem and I think it
 

1871
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,810
mean it's an easy problem and I think it
would be easy to sort of overlook that

1872
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:01,820
would be easy to sort of overlook that
 

1873
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,410
would be easy to sort of overlook that
and think that you know we're Silicon

1874
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:05,420
and think that you know we're Silicon
 

1875
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,270
and think that you know we're Silicon
Valley engineers we can solve any

1876
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,280
Valley engineers we can solve any
 

1877
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,040
Valley engineers we can solve any
problem you know building a car it's

1878
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,050
problem you know building a car it's
 

1879
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,139
problem you know building a car it's
been done therefore it's you know it's

1880
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:11,149
been done therefore it's you know it's
 

1881
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,610
been done therefore it's you know it's
it's it's not it's not a real

1882
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:12,620
it's it's not it's not a real
 

1883
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,130
it's it's not it's not a real
engineering challenge but after having

1884
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:15,140
engineering challenge but after having
 

1885
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,100
engineering challenge but after having
seen just the sheer scale and magnitude

1886
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,110
seen just the sheer scale and magnitude
 

1887
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,520
seen just the sheer scale and magnitude
and industrialization that occurs inside

1888
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:21,530
and industrialization that occurs inside
 

1889
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,649
and industrialization that occurs inside
of an automotive assembly plant that is

1890
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:23,659
of an automotive assembly plant that is
 

1891
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,720
of an automotive assembly plant that is
a lot of work that I am very glad that

1892
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:25,730
a lot of work that I am very glad that
 

1893
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,389
a lot of work that I am very glad that
we don't have to reinvent to make

1894
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
we don't have to reinvent to make
 

1895
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,980
we don't have to reinvent to make
self-driving cars work and so to have

1896
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:29,990
self-driving cars work and so to have
 

1897
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,360
self-driving cars work and so to have
you know partners who have done that for

1898
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,370
you know partners who have done that for
 

1899
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,260
you know partners who have done that for
a hundred years now these great

1900
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,270
a hundred years now these great
 

1901
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,820
a hundred years now these great
processes and this huge infrastructure

1902
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:33,830
processes and this huge infrastructure
 

1903
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,940
processes and this huge infrastructure
and supply base that we can tap into is

1904
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,950
and supply base that we can tap into is
 

1905
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,790
and supply base that we can tap into is
just remarkable because the scope in

1906
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:41,800
just remarkable because the scope in
 

1907
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,950
just remarkable because the scope in
surface area of the problem of deploying

1908
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:44,960
surface area of the problem of deploying
 

1909
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,750
surface area of the problem of deploying
fleets of self-driving cars is so large

1910
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:46,760
fleets of self-driving cars is so large
 

1911
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,820
fleets of self-driving cars is so large
that we're constantly looking for ways

1912
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:48,830
that we're constantly looking for ways
 

1913
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,460
that we're constantly looking for ways
to do less so we can focus on the things

1914
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:51,470
to do less so we can focus on the things
 

1915
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,470
to do less so we can focus on the things
that really matter more and if we had to

1916
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:53,480
that really matter more and if we had to
 

1917
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,060
that really matter more and if we had to
figure out how to build an assemble in

1918
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,070
figure out how to build an assemble in
 

1919
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,340
figure out how to build an assemble in
you know test and build the cars

1920
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,350
you know test and build the cars
 

1921
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,140
you know test and build the cars
themselves I mean we work closely with

1922
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,150
themselves I mean we work closely with
 

1923
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,460
themselves I mean we work closely with
Jim on that but if we had to develop all

1924
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:02,470
Jim on that but if we had to develop all
 

1925
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,250
Jim on that but if we had to develop all
that capability in-house as well you

1926
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:05,260
that capability in-house as well you
 

1927
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,980
that capability in-house as well you
know that that would just make make the

1928
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:07,990
know that that would just make make the
 

1929
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,840
know that that would just make make the
problem really intractable I think mmm

1930
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:09,850
problem really intractable I think mmm
 

1931
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:14,430
problem really intractable I think mmm
so yeah just like your first entry mit

1932
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:14,440
so yeah just like your first entry mit
 

1933
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,470
so yeah just like your first entry mit
DARPA challenge when there was what the

1934
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:16,480
DARPA challenge when there was what the
 

1935
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,210
DARPA challenge when there was what the
motor that failed and somebody that

1936
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:18,220
motor that failed and somebody that
 

1937
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,350
motor that failed and somebody that
knows what they're doing with the motor

1938
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:19,360
knows what they're doing with the motor
 

1939
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,000
knows what they're doing with the motor
did it that would have been nice if you

1940
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,010
did it that would have been nice if you
 

1941
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,830
did it that would have been nice if you
focus on the software and not the

1942
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:22,840
focus on the software and not the
 

1943
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,830
focus on the software and not the
hardware platform yeah right so from

1944
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:25,840
hardware platform yeah right so from
 

1945
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,410
hardware platform yeah right so from
your perspective now you know there's so

1946
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:28,420
your perspective now you know there's so
 

1947
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,060
your perspective now you know there's so
many ways that autonomous vehicles can

1948
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,070
many ways that autonomous vehicles can
 

1949
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,730
many ways that autonomous vehicles can
impact Society in the next year five

1950
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:32,740
impact Society in the next year five
 

1951
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,460
impact Society in the next year five
years ten years what do you think is the

1952
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:35,470
years ten years what do you think is the
 

1953
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,040
years ten years what do you think is the
biggest opportunity to make money in

1954
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,050
biggest opportunity to make money in
 

1955
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,450
biggest opportunity to make money in
autonomous driving sort of make it a

1956
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:41,460
autonomous driving sort of make it a
 

1957
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,800
autonomous driving sort of make it a
financially viable thing in the

1958
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:43,810
financially viable thing in the
 

1959
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,330
financially viable thing in the
near-term what do you think would be the

1960
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:45,340
near-term what do you think would be the
 

1961
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,130
near-term what do you think would be the
biggest impact there well the things

1962
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,140
biggest impact there well the things
 

1963
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,620
biggest impact there well the things
that that drive the economics for fleets

1964
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:52,630
that that drive the economics for fleets
 

1965
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,600
that that drive the economics for fleets
of self-driving cars or they're sort of

1966
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:54,610
of self-driving cars or they're sort of
 

1967
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,110
of self-driving cars or they're sort of
a handful of variables one is you know

1968
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,120
a handful of variables one is you know
 

1969
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,540
a handful of variables one is you know
the cost to build the vehicle itself so

1970
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:00,550
the cost to build the vehicle itself so
 

1971
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,430
the cost to build the vehicle itself so
the material cost how many you know

1972
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:02,440
the material cost how many you know
 

1973
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,840
the material cost how many you know
what's the cost of all your sensors plus

1974
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:03,850
what's the cost of all your sensors plus
 

1975
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,640
what's the cost of all your sensors plus
the cost of the vehicle and every all

1976
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:05,650
the cost of the vehicle and every all
 

1977
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,950
the cost of the vehicle and every all
the other components on it another one

1978
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:07,960
the other components on it another one
 

1979
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,840
the other components on it another one
is the lifetime of the vehicle it's very

1980
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:09,850
is the lifetime of the vehicle it's very
 

1981
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,700
is the lifetime of the vehicle it's very
different if your vehicle drives one

1982
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:11,710
different if your vehicle drives one
 

1983
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,810
different if your vehicle drives one
hundred thousand miles and then it falls

1984
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:12,820
hundred thousand miles and then it falls
 

1985
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,100
hundred thousand miles and then it falls
apart versus you know two million

1986
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,110
apart versus you know two million
 

1987
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,740
apart versus you know two million
and then you know if you have a fleet

1988
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:18,750
and then you know if you have a fleet
 

1989
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,550
and then you know if you have a fleet
it's kind of like an airplane where or

1990
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:21,560
it's kind of like an airplane where or
 

1991
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,520
it's kind of like an airplane where or
airline where once you produce the

1992
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:25,530
airline where once you produce the
 

1993
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,260
airline where once you produce the
vehicle you want it to be in operation

1994
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,270
vehicle you want it to be in operation
 

1995
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,820
vehicle you want it to be in operation
as many hours a day as possible

1996
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:28,830
as many hours a day as possible
 

1997
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,760
as many hours a day as possible
producing revenue and then a you know

1998
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:31,770
producing revenue and then a you know
 

1999
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,460
producing revenue and then a you know
the other piece of that is how are you

2000
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:34,470
the other piece of that is how are you
 

2001
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,900
the other piece of that is how are you
generating revenue I think that's kind

2002
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:35,910
generating revenue I think that's kind
 

2003
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,130
generating revenue I think that's kind
what you're asking and I think the

2004
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:37,140
what you're asking and I think the
 

2005
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,320
what you're asking and I think the
obvious things today are you know the

2006
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:39,330
obvious things today are you know the
 

2007
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,460
obvious things today are you know the
ride-sharing business because that's

2008
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:40,470
ride-sharing business because that's
 

2009
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,870
ride-sharing business because that's
pretty clear that there's demand for

2010
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:41,880
pretty clear that there's demand for
 

2011
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,700
pretty clear that there's demand for
that there's existing markets you can

2012
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:43,710
that there's existing markets you can
 

2013
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,450
that there's existing markets you can
tap into and larger urban areas that

2014
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:47,460
tap into and larger urban areas that
 

2015
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
tap into and larger urban areas that
kind of thing yeah yeah and and and I

2016
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:49,470
kind of thing yeah yeah and and and I
 

2017
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,140
kind of thing yeah yeah and and and I
think that there are some real benefits

2018
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,150
think that there are some real benefits
 

2019
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,890
think that there are some real benefits
to having cars without drivers compared

2020
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:54,900
to having cars without drivers compared
 

2021
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,480
to having cars without drivers compared
to through the status quo for people who

2022
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,490
to through the status quo for people who
 

2023
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,670
to through the status quo for people who
use ride share services today you know

2024
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:58,680
use ride share services today you know
 

2025
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,370
use ride share services today you know
you get privacy consistency

2026
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:00,380
you get privacy consistency
 

2027
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,510
you get privacy consistency
hopefully significant improve safety all

2028
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:02,520
hopefully significant improve safety all
 

2029
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,590
hopefully significant improve safety all
these benefits versus the current

2030
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:03,600
these benefits versus the current
 

2031
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,470
these benefits versus the current
product but it's it's a crowded market

2032
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,480
product but it's it's a crowded market
 

2033
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,120
product but it's it's a crowded market
and then other opportunities which

2034
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,130
and then other opportunities which
 

2035
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,200
and then other opportunities which
you've seen a lot of activity in the

2036
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,210
you've seen a lot of activity in the
 

2037
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,700
you've seen a lot of activity in the
last really in last six to twelve months

2038
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:10,710
last really in last six to twelve months
 

2039
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,950
last really in last six to twelve months
is you know delivery whether that's

2040
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,960
is you know delivery whether that's
 

2041
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,400
is you know delivery whether that's
parcels and packages food or or

2042
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,410
parcels and packages food or or
 

2043
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,640
parcels and packages food or or
groceries those are all sort of I think

2044
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:19,650
groceries those are all sort of I think
 

2045
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,140
groceries those are all sort of I think
opportunities that are that are pretty

2046
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,150
opportunities that are that are pretty
 

2047
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,140
opportunities that are that are pretty
ripe for these you know once you have

2048
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,150
ripe for these you know once you have
 

2049
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,570
ripe for these you know once you have
this core technology which is the fleet

2050
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:26,580
this core technology which is the fleet
 

2051
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,640
this core technology which is the fleet
of autonomous vehicles there's all sorts

2052
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:28,650
of autonomous vehicles there's all sorts
 

2053
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,980
of autonomous vehicles there's all sorts
of different business opportunities you

2054
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:30,990
of different business opportunities you
 

2055
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,600
of different business opportunities you
can build on top of that but I think the

2056
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:32,610
can build on top of that but I think the
 

2057
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,850
can build on top of that but I think the
important thing of course is that

2058
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:34,860
important thing of course is that
 

2059
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,440
important thing of course is that
there's zero monetization opportunity

2060
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:36,450
there's zero monetization opportunity
 

2061
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,610
there's zero monetization opportunity
until you actually have that fleet of

2062
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:37,620
until you actually have that fleet of
 

2063
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,380
until you actually have that fleet of
very capable driverless cars that are

2064
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:39,390
very capable driverless cars that are
 

2065
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,940
very capable driverless cars that are
that are as good or better than humans

2066
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:40,950
that are as good or better than humans
 

2067
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,730
that are as good or better than humans
and that's sort of where the entire

2068
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:43,740
and that's sort of where the entire
 

2069
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,050
and that's sort of where the entire
industry is sort of in this holding

2070
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:45,060
industry is sort of in this holding
 

2071
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,580
industry is sort of in this holding
pattern right now yeah the trend

2072
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:46,590
pattern right now yeah the trend
 

2073
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,380
pattern right now yeah the trend
achieved that baseline so but you said

2074
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:48,390
achieved that baseline so but you said
 

2075
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,990
achieved that baseline so but you said
sort of rely not reliability consistency

2076
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,000
sort of rely not reliability consistency
 

2077
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,940
sort of rely not reliability consistency
it's kind of interesting I think I heard

2078
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:52,950
it's kind of interesting I think I heard
 

2079
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,890
it's kind of interesting I think I heard
you say somewhere I'm not sure if that's

2080
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:54,900
you say somewhere I'm not sure if that's
 

2081
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,930
you say somewhere I'm not sure if that's
what you meant but you know I can

2082
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:56,940
what you meant but you know I can
 

2083
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,850
what you meant but you know I can
imagine a situation where you would get

2084
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:58,860
imagine a situation where you would get
 

2085
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,570
imagine a situation where you would get
an autonomous vehicle and you know when

2086
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:02,580
an autonomous vehicle and you know when
 

2087
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,830
an autonomous vehicle and you know when
you get into an uber or lyft

2088
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:03,840
you get into an uber or lyft
 

2089
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,170
you get into an uber or lyft
you don't get to choose the driver in a

2090
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,180
you don't get to choose the driver in a
 

2091
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,400
you don't get to choose the driver in a
sense that you don't get to choose the

2092
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,410
sense that you don't get to choose the
 

2093
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,410
sense that you don't get to choose the
personality of the driving do you think

2094
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:09,420
personality of the driving do you think
 

2095
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,860
personality of the driving do you think
there's a there's room to define the

2096
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:12,870
there's a there's room to define the
 

2097
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,690
there's a there's room to define the
personality of the car the way drives

2098
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:14,700
personality of the car the way drives
 

2099
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,400
personality of the car the way drives
you in terms of aggressiveness for

2100
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,410
you in terms of aggressiveness for
 

2101
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,790
you in terms of aggressiveness for
example in terms of sort of pushing the

2102
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:19,800
example in terms of sort of pushing the
 

2103
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,010
example in terms of sort of pushing the
bomb the one of the biggest challenges

2104
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,020
bomb the one of the biggest challenges
 

2105
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,930
bomb the one of the biggest challenges
in Toms driving is the is a trade-off

2106
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:23,940
in Toms driving is the is a trade-off
 

2107
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,370
in Toms driving is the is a trade-off
between sort of safety and

2108
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:27,380
between sort of safety and
 

2109
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,789
between sort of safety and
and do you think there's any room for

2110
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:30,799
and do you think there's any room for
 

2111
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:34,509
and do you think there's any room for
the human to take a role in that

2112
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:34,519
the human to take a role in that
 

2113
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,749
the human to take a role in that
decision to accept the liability I guess

2114
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:37,759
decision to accept the liability I guess
 

2115
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:39,880
decision to accept the liability I guess
we III wouldn't it no I'd say within

2116
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:39,890
we III wouldn't it no I'd say within
 

2117
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,859
we III wouldn't it no I'd say within
reasonable bounds as in we're not gonna

2118
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:41,869
reasonable bounds as in we're not gonna
 

2119
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,529
reasonable bounds as in we're not gonna
I think it'd be highly unlikely we did

2120
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:44,539
I think it'd be highly unlikely we did
 

2121
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,359
I think it'd be highly unlikely we did
expose any nob that would let you you

2122
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:46,369
expose any nob that would let you you
 

2123
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:49,539
expose any nob that would let you you
know significantly increase safety risk

2124
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:49,549
know significantly increase safety risk
 

2125
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:51,549
know significantly increase safety risk
I think that's that's just not something

2126
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:51,559
I think that's that's just not something
 

2127
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,120
I think that's that's just not something
we'd be willing to do but I think

2128
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,130
we'd be willing to do but I think
 

2129
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,829
we'd be willing to do but I think
driving style or like you know are you

2130
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:56,839
driving style or like you know are you
 

2131
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:58,630
driving style or like you know are you
gonna relax the comfort constraints

2132
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:58,640
gonna relax the comfort constraints
 

2133
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,370
gonna relax the comfort constraints
slightly or things like that all of

2134
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:00,380
slightly or things like that all of
 

2135
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,450
slightly or things like that all of
those things make sense and are

2136
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:01,460
those things make sense and are
 

2137
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,370
those things make sense and are
plausible I see all those is you know

2138
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:03,380
plausible I see all those is you know
 

2139
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,440
plausible I see all those is you know
nice optimizations once again we get the

2140
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:05,450
nice optimizations once again we get the
 

2141
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,329
nice optimizations once again we get the
core problem solved and these fleets out

2142
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:07,339
core problem solved and these fleets out
 

2143
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:09,880
core problem solved and these fleets out
there but the other thing we've sort of

2144
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:09,890
there but the other thing we've sort of
 

2145
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,279
there but the other thing we've sort of
observed is that you have this intuition

2146
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:12,289
observed is that you have this intuition
 

2147
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,920
observed is that you have this intuition
that if you sort of slam your foot on

2148
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:14,930
that if you sort of slam your foot on
 

2149
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,150
that if you sort of slam your foot on
the gas right after the light turns

2150
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
the gas right after the light turns
 

2151
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,220
the gas right after the light turns
green and aggressively accelerate you're

2152
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,230
green and aggressively accelerate you're
 

2153
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,170
green and aggressively accelerate you're
gonna get there faster but the actual

2154
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:20,180
gonna get there faster but the actual
 

2155
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,059
gonna get there faster but the actual
impact of doing that is pretty small you

2156
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:22,069
impact of doing that is pretty small you
 

2157
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,559
impact of doing that is pretty small you
feel like you're getting there faster

2158
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:23,569
feel like you're getting there faster
 

2159
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,809
feel like you're getting there faster
but so that so the same would be true

2160
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:25,819
but so that so the same would be true
 

2161
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:28,180
but so that so the same would be true
for ABS even if they don't slam there

2162
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,190
for ABS even if they don't slam there

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,799
for ABS even if they don't slam there
you know the pedal to the floor when the

2164
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:29,809
you know the pedal to the floor when the
 

2165
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,660
you know the pedal to the floor when the
light turns green they're gonna get you

2166
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,670
light turns green they're gonna get you
 

2167
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,740
light turns green they're gonna get you
they're within you know if it's a

2168
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:32,750
they're within you know if it's a
 

2169
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,809
they're within you know if it's a
15-minute trip within 30 seconds of what

2170
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:34,819
15-minute trip within 30 seconds of what
 

2171
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:36,579
15-minute trip within 30 seconds of what
you would have done otherwise if you

2172
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:36,589
you would have done otherwise if you
 

2173
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:37,960
you would have done otherwise if you
were going really aggressively so I

2174
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:37,970
were going really aggressively so I
 

2175
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,420
were going really aggressively so I
think there's this sort of

2176
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:39,430
think there's this sort of
 

2177
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,700
think there's this sort of
self-deception that that my aggressive

2178
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:42,710
self-deception that that my aggressive
 

2179
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,900
self-deception that that my aggressive
driving style is getting me there faster

2180
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:43,910
driving style is getting me there faster
 

2181
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,910
driving style is getting me there faster
well so that's you know some of the

2182
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:45,920
well so that's you know some of the
 

2183
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,200
well so that's you know some of the
things I study some things I'm

2184
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,210
things I study some things I'm
 

2185
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,700
things I study some things I'm
fascinated by the psychology of that I

2186
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:48,710
fascinated by the psychology of that I
 

2187
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,220
fascinated by the psychology of that I
don't think it matters that it doesn't

2188
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,230
don't think it matters that it doesn't
 

2189
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,410
don't think it matters that it doesn't
get you there faster it's it's the

2190
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:53,420
get you there faster it's it's the
 

2191
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,980
get you there faster it's it's the
emotional release driving is is a place

2192
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:56,990
emotional release driving is is a place
 

2193
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,740
emotional release driving is is a place
being inside or a car somebody said it's

2194
00:39:59,740 --> 00:39:59,750
being inside or a car somebody said it's
 

2195
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,509
being inside or a car somebody said it's
like the real world version of being a

2196
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:01,519
like the real world version of being a
 

2197
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,210
like the real world version of being a
troll so you have this protection this

2198
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:04,220
troll so you have this protection this
 

2199
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,769
troll so you have this protection this
mental protection you're able to sort of

2200
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:05,779
mental protection you're able to sort of
 

2201
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,450
mental protection you're able to sort of
yell at the world like release your

2202
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:07,460
yell at the world like release your
 

2203
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,039
yell at the world like release your
anger whatever is but so there's an

2204
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,049
anger whatever is but so there's an
 

2205
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:11,650
anger whatever is but so there's an
element of that that I think autonomous

2206
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:11,660
element of that that I think autonomous
 

2207
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,269
element of that that I think autonomous
vehicles would also have to you know

2208
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:13,279
vehicles would also have to you know
 

2209
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:15,609
vehicles would also have to you know
have giving an outlet to people but it

2210
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:15,619
have giving an outlet to people but it
 

2211
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:17,319
have giving an outlet to people but it
doesn't have to be through through

2212
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:17,329
doesn't have to be through through
 

2213
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:19,390
doesn't have to be through through
through driving or honking or so on

2214
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:19,400
through driving or honking or so on
 

2215
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,759
through driving or honking or so on
there might be other outlets but I think

2216
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:21,769
there might be other outlets but I think
 

2217
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:23,710
there might be other outlets but I think
to just sort of even just put that aside

2218
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:23,720
to just sort of even just put that aside
 

2219
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,079
to just sort of even just put that aside
the baseline is really you know that's

2220
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:26,089
the baseline is really you know that's
 

2221
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:27,819
the baseline is really you know that's
the focus that's the thing you need to

2222
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:27,829
the focus that's the thing you need to
 

2223
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:29,440
the focus that's the thing you need to
solve and then the fun human things can

2224
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,450
solve and then the fun human things can
 

2225
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,259
solve and then the fun human things can
be solved after but so from the baseline

2226
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:32,269
be solved after but so from the baseline
 

2227
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:34,690
be solved after but so from the baseline
of just solving autonomous driving and

2228
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:34,700
of just solving autonomous driving and
 

2229

go to that though I just wanted I like
what you said about the psychology

2258
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:06,880
what you said about the psychology
 

2259
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,130
what you said about the psychology
aspect of this because I think one

2260
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:08,140
aspect of this because I think one
 

2261
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,140

2263
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,940
observation I made is I think I read
somewhere that I think it's maybe

00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:11,950
somewhere that I think it's maybe

Americans on average spend you know over

00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,110
Americans on average spend you know over
 

2267
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,650
Americans on average spend you know over
an hour a day on social media like

2268
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:16,660
an hour a day on social media like
 

2269
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,930
an hour a day on social media like
staring at Facebook and so that's just

2270
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:18,940
staring at Facebook and so that's just
 

2271
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,030
staring at Facebook and so that's just
you know 60 minutes of your life you're

2272
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040
you know 60 minutes of your life you're
 

2273
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,140
you know 60 minutes of your life you're
not getting back and it's probably not

2274
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,150
not getting back and it's probably not
 

2275
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,930
not getting back and it's probably not
super productive and so that's 3,600

2276
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:24,940
super productive and so that's 3,600
 

2277
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,070
super productive and so that's 3,600
seconds right and that's that's time you

2278
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,080
seconds right and that's that's time you
 

2279
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,240
seconds right and that's that's time you
know it's a lot of time you're giving up

2280
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,250
know it's a lot of time you're giving up
 

2281
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,880
know it's a lot of time you're giving up
and if you compare that to people being

2282
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:32,890
and if you compare that to people being
 

2283
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,550
and if you compare that to people being
on the road if another vehicle whether

2284
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:35,560
on the road if another vehicle whether
 

2285
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,840
on the road if another vehicle whether
it's a human driver or autonomous

2286
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:36,850
it's a human driver or autonomous
 

2287
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,940
it's a human driver or autonomous
vehicle delays them by even three

2288
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:38,950
vehicle delays them by even three
 

2289
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,280
vehicle delays them by even three
seconds they're laying in on the horn

2290
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,290
seconds they're laying in on the horn
 

2291
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,200
seconds they're laying in on the horn
you know even though that's that's you

2292
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,210
you know even though that's that's you
 

2293
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,790
you know even though that's that's you
know one one thousandth of the time they

2294
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:44,800
know one one thousandth of the time they
 

2295
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,440
know one one thousandth of the time they
waste looking at Facebook every day so

2296
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:46,450
waste looking at Facebook every day so
 

2297
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,870
waste looking at Facebook every day so
there's there's definitely some you know

2298
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:48,880
there's there's definitely some you know
 

2299
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,310
there's there's definitely some you know
psychology aspects of this I think that

2300
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:50,320
psychology aspects of this I think that
 

2301
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,720
psychology aspects of this I think that
are pre interesting road rage in general

2302
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:51,730
are pre interesting road rage in general
 

2303
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,340
are pre interesting road rage in general
and then the question of course is if

2304
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:53,350
and then the question of course is if
 

2305
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,230
and then the question of course is if
everyone is in self-driving cars do they

2306
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,240
everyone is in self-driving cars do they
 

2307
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,940
everyone is in self-driving cars do they
even notice these three-second delays

2308
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:56,950
even notice these three-second delays
 

2309
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,530
even notice these three-second delays
anymore because they're doing other

2310
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:58,540
anymore because they're doing other
 

2311
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,810
anymore because they're doing other
things or reading or working or just

2312
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:00,820
things or reading or working or just
 

2313
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,100
things or reading or working or just
talking to each other so it'll be

2314
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,110
talking to each other so it'll be
 

2315
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,060
talking to each other so it'll be
interesting to see where that goes

2316
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,070
interesting to see where that goes
 

2317
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,520
interesting to see where that goes
in a certain aspect people people need

2318
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:05,530
in a certain aspect people people need
 

2319
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,900
in a certain aspect people people need
to be distracted by something

2320
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:06,910
to be distracted by something
 

2321
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,550
to be distracted by something
entertaining something useful inside the

2322
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
entertaining something useful inside the
 

2323
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,200
entertaining something useful inside the
car so they don't pay attention to the

2324
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,210
car so they don't pay attention to the
 

2325
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,210
car so they don't pay attention to the
external world and then and then and it

2326
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:12,220
external world and then and then and it
 

2327
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,060
external world and then and then and it
can take whatever psychology and bring

2328
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,070
can take whatever psychology and bring
 

2329
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,130
can take whatever psychology and bring
it back to Twitter and then focus on

2330
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:17,140
it back to Twitter and then focus on
 

2331
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,210
it back to Twitter and then focus on
that as opposed to sort of interacting

2332
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:20,220
that as opposed to sort of interacting
 

2333
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,620
that as opposed to sort of interacting
sort of putting the emotion out there

2334
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:22,630
sort of putting the emotion out there
 

2335
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,940
sort of putting the emotion out there
into the world so it's a it's an

2336
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:23,950
into the world so it's a it's an
 

2337
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,380
into the world so it's a it's an
interesting problem but baseline

2338
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:25,390
interesting problem but baseline
 

2339
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,600
interesting problem but baseline
autonomy I guess you could say

2340
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:27,610
autonomy I guess you could say
 

2341
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,790
autonomy I guess you could say
self-driving cars you know at scale will

2342
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:29,800
self-driving cars you know at scale will
 

2343
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
self-driving cars you know at scale will
lower the collective blood pressure of

2344
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:31,810
lower the collective blood pressure of
 

2345
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,900
lower the collective blood pressure of
society probably by a couple points yeah

2346
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:33,910
society probably by a couple points yeah
 

2347
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,940
society probably by a couple points yeah
without all that road rage and stress so

2348
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:35,950
without all that road rage and stress so
 

2349
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,910
without all that road rage and stress so
that's a good good externality so back

2350
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:38,920
that's a good good externality so back
 

2351
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,880
that's a good good externality so back
to your question about the technology in

2352
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:41,890
to your question about the technology in
 

2353
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,950
to your question about the technology in
the the I guess the biggest problems and

2354
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:43,960
the the I guess the biggest problems and
 

2355
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,210
the the I guess the biggest problems and
I have a hard time answering that

2356
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:45,220
I have a hard time answering that
 

2357
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,160
I have a hard time answering that
question because you know we've been at

2358
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,170
question because you know we've been at
 

2359
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,270
question because you know we've been at
this

2360
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:48,280
this
 

2361
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,670
this
like specifically focusing on driverless

2362
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:50,680
like specifically focusing on driverless
 

2363
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,710
like specifically focusing on driverless
cars and all the technology needed to

2364
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:52,720
cars and all the technology needed to
 

2365
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,359
cars and all the technology needed to
enable that for a little over four and a

2366
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:54,369
enable that for a little over four and a
 

2367
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:57,990
enable that for a little over four and a
half years now and even a year or two in

2368
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,000
half years now and even a year or two in
 

2369
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,320
half years now and even a year or two in
I felt like we had

2370
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,330
I felt like we had
 

2371
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,150
I felt like we had
completed the functionality needed to

2372
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:03,160
completed the functionality needed to
 

2373
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,830
completed the functionality needed to
get someone from point A to point B as

2374
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:04,840
get someone from point A to point B as
 

2375
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,170
get someone from point A to point B as
in if we need to do a left turn maneuver

2376
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:07,180
in if we need to do a left turn maneuver
 

2377
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,910
in if we need to do a left turn maneuver
or if we need to drive around a you know

2378
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:08,920
or if we need to drive around a you know
 

2379
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,800
or if we need to drive around a you know
a double parked vehicle into oncoming

2380
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:10,810
a double parked vehicle into oncoming
 

2381
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:11,580
a double parked vehicle into oncoming
traffic

2382
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:11,590
traffic
 

2383
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,380
traffic
or navigate through construction zones

2384
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:13,390
or navigate through construction zones
 

2385
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,450
or navigate through construction zones
the the scaffolding and the building

2386
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:15,460
the the scaffolding and the building
 

2387
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,100
the the scaffolding and the building
blocks where it was there pretty early

2388
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:17,110
blocks where it was there pretty early
 

2389
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,210
blocks where it was there pretty early
on and so the challenge is not any one

2390
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,220
on and so the challenge is not any one
 

2391
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,250
on and so the challenge is not any one
scenario or situation for which you know

2392
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:23,260
scenario or situation for which you know
 

2393
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,610
scenario or situation for which you know
we fail at 100% of those it's more you

2394
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:26,620
we fail at 100% of those it's more you
 

2395
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,320
we fail at 100% of those it's more you
know we're benchmarking against a pretty

2396
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:28,330
know we're benchmarking against a pretty
 

2397
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:30,300
know we're benchmarking against a pretty
good or pretty high standard which is

2398
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:30,310
good or pretty high standard which is
 

2399
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,130
good or pretty high standard which is
human driving all things considered

2400
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:32,140
human driving all things considered
 

2401
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,380
human driving all things considered
humans are excellent at handling the

2402
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:34,390
humans are excellent at handling the
 

2403
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,270
humans are excellent at handling the
edge cases and unexpected scenarios

2404
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:36,280
edge cases and unexpected scenarios
 

2405
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,730
edge cases and unexpected scenarios
whereas computers the opposite and so

2406
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:38,740
whereas computers the opposite and so
 

2407
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,210
whereas computers the opposite and so
beating that that baseline set by humans

2408
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:42,220
beating that that baseline set by humans
 

2409
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,310
beating that that baseline set by humans
is the challenge and so what we've been

2410
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:44,320
is the challenge and so what we've been
 

2411
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,680
is the challenge and so what we've been
doing for quite some time now is

2412
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:46,690
doing for quite some time now is
 

2413
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,950
doing for quite some time now is
basically

2414
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960
basically
 

2415
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,420
basically
it's this continuous improvement process

2416
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:50,430
it's this continuous improvement process
 

2417
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,839
it's this continuous improvement process
where we find sort of the the most you

2418
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:53,849
where we find sort of the the most you
 

2419
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:56,180
where we find sort of the the most you
know uncomfortable or the things that

2420
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:56,190
know uncomfortable or the things that
 

2421
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,990
know uncomfortable or the things that
that could lead to a safety issue other

2422
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,000
that could lead to a safety issue other
 

2423
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,520
that could lead to a safety issue other
things all these events and then we sort

2424
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:01,530
things all these events and then we sort
 

2425
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,069
things all these events and then we sort
of categorize them and rework parts of

2426
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
of categorize them and rework parts of
 

2427
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,720
of categorize them and rework parts of
our system to make incremental

2428
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:05,730
our system to make incremental
 

2429
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,099
our system to make incremental
improvements and do that over and over

2430
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:07,109
improvements and do that over and over
 

2431
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:09,140
improvements and do that over and over
and over again and we just see sort of

2432
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:09,150
and over again and we just see sort of
 

2433
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,049
and over again and we just see sort of
the overall performance of the system

2434
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:11,059
the overall performance of the system
 

2435
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:13,040
the overall performance of the system
you know actually increasing in a pretty

2436
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,050
you know actually increasing in a pretty
 

2437
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,230
you know actually increasing in a pretty
steady clip but there's no one thing

2438
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:15,240
steady clip but there's no one thing
 

2439
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,700
steady clip but there's no one thing
there's actually like thousands of

2440
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:16,710
there's actually like thousands of
 

2441
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,130
there's actually like thousands of
little things and just like polishing

2442
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:19,140
little things and just like polishing
 

2443
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,839
little things and just like polishing
functionality and making sure that it

2444
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:20,849
functionality and making sure that it
 

2445
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:22,790
functionality and making sure that it
handles you know every version

2446
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:22,800
handles you know every version
 

2447
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,359
handles you know every version
impossible permutation of a situation by

2448
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:26,369
impossible permutation of a situation by
 

2449
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:28,190
impossible permutation of a situation by
either applying more deep learning

2450
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,200
either applying more deep learning
 

2451
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,030
either applying more deep learning
systems or just by you know adding more

2452
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:32,040
systems or just by you know adding more
 

2453
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,099
systems or just by you know adding more
tests coverage or new scenarios that

2454
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:34,109
tests coverage or new scenarios that
 

2455
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:36,109
tests coverage or new scenarios that
that we develop against and just

2456
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:36,119
that we develop against and just
 

2457
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:37,760
that we develop against and just
grinding on that it's we're sort of in

2458
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:37,770
grinding on that it's we're sort of in
 

2459
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,380
grinding on that it's we're sort of in
the the unsexy phase of development

2460
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:39,390
the the unsexy phase of development
 

2461
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,059
the the unsexy phase of development
right now which is doing the real

2462
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:41,069
right now which is doing the real
 

2463
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:42,829
right now which is doing the real
engineering work that it takes to go

2464
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:42,839
engineering work that it takes to go
 

2465
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:44,000
engineering work that it takes to go
from prototype to production

2466
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,010
from prototype to production
 

2467
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,710
from prototype to production
you're basically scaling the the

2468
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:45,720
you're basically scaling the the
 

2469
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,309
you're basically scaling the the
grinding so has sort of taking seriously

2470
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:49,319
grinding so has sort of taking seriously
 

2471
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,130
grinding so has sort of taking seriously
that the process of all those edge cases

2472
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:52,140
that the process of all those edge cases
 

2473
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,440
that the process of all those edge cases
both with human experts and machine

2474
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:54,450
both with human experts and machine
 

2475
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,039
both with human experts and machine
learning methods to cover to cover all

2476
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:58,049
learning methods to cover to cover all
 

2477
00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:00,079
learning methods to cover to cover all
those situations yeah and the exciting

2478
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:00,089
those situations yeah and the exciting
 

2479
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:01,250
those situations yeah and the exciting
thing for me is I don't think that

2480
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:01,260
thing for me is I don't think that
 

2481
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,319
thing for me is I don't think that
grinding ever stops right because

2482
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:03,329
grinding ever stops right because
 

2483
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:05,870
grinding ever stops right because
there's a moment in time where you you

2484
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:05,880
there's a moment in time where you you
 

2485
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,059
there's a moment in time where you you
cross that threshold of human

2486
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:08,069
cross that threshold of human
 

2487
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:11,359
cross that threshold of human
performance and become superhuman but

2488
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:11,369
performance and become superhuman but
 

2489
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:12,680
performance and become superhuman but
there's no reason there's no first

2490
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:12,690
there's no reason there's no first
 

2491
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,289
there's no reason there's no first
principles reason that AV capability

2492
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:15,299
principles reason that AV capability
 

2493
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,690
principles reason that AV capability
will tap out anywhere near humans like

2494
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:17,700
will tap out anywhere near humans like
 

2495
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,370
will tap out anywhere near humans like
there's no reason it couldn't be 20

2496
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:19,380
there's no reason it couldn't be 20
 

2497
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,349
there's no reason it couldn't be 20
times better whether that's you know

2498
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:21,359
times better whether that's you know
 

2499
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,910
times better whether that's you know
just better driving or safer driving a

2500
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:22,920
just better driving or safer driving a
 

2501
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,710
just better driving or safer driving a
more comfortable driving or even a

2502
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
more comfortable driving or even a
 

2503
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,210
more comfortable driving or even a
thousand times better given enough time

2504
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:26,220
thousand times better given enough time
 

2505
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,789
thousand times better given enough time
and we intend to basically chase that

2506
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:28,799
and we intend to basically chase that
 

2507
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:31,940
and we intend to basically chase that
you know forever to build the best

2508
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:31,950
you know forever to build the best
 

2509
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,530
you know forever to build the best
possible product better and better and

2510
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:33,540
possible product better and better and
 

2511
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,510
possible product better and better and
better and always new educators come up

2512
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:35,520
better and always new educators come up
 

2513
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,210
better and always new educators come up
and you experiences so and you want to

2514
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:38,220
and you experiences so and you want to
 

2515
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,829
and you experiences so and you want to
automate that process as much as

2516
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:39,839
automate that process as much as
 

2517
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,760
automate that process as much as
possible mhm so what do you think in

2518
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:43,770
possible mhm so what do you think in
 

2519
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,490
possible mhm so what do you think in
general in society when do you think we

2520
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:46,500
general in society when do you think we
 

2521
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,470
general in society when do you think we
may have hundreds of thousands of fully

2522
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
may have hundreds of thousands of fully
 

2523
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,329
may have hundreds of thousands of fully
autonomous vehicles driving around so

2524
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:50,339
autonomous vehicles driving around so
 

2525
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:52,609
autonomous vehicles driving around so
first of all predictions nobody knows

2526
00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:52,619
first of all predictions nobody knows
 

2527
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,890
first of all predictions nobody knows
the future you're a part of the leading

2528
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:54,900
the future you're a part of the leading
 

2529
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,630
the future you're a part of the leading
people trying to define that future but

2530
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
people trying to define that future but
 

2531
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,089
people trying to define that future but
even then you still don't know but if

2532
00:45:59,089 --> 00:45:59,099
even then you still don't know but if
 

2533
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,280
even then you still don't know but if
you think about a hundreds of thousands

2534
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,290
you think about a hundreds of thousands
 

2535
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,090
you think about a hundreds of thousands
of heat

2536
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:02,100
of heat
 

2537
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,840
of heat
so a significant fraction of vehicles in

2538
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:05,850
so a significant fraction of vehicles in
 

2539
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,910
so a significant fraction of vehicles in
major cities are autonomous do you think

2540
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:07,920
major cities are autonomous do you think
 

2541
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,440
major cities are autonomous do you think
I would Rodney Brooks who is 2050 and

2542
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:12,450
I would Rodney Brooks who is 2050 and
 

2543
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:17,360
I would Rodney Brooks who is 2050 and
beyond are you more with Elon Musk who

2544
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,370
beyond are you more with Elon Musk who
 

2545
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,780
beyond are you more with Elon Musk who
is we should have had that two years ago

2546
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:19,790
is we should have had that two years ago
 

2547
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,120
is we should have had that two years ago
well I mean I don't want me to have it

2548
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:23,130
well I mean I don't want me to have it
 

2549
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,090
well I mean I don't want me to have it
two years ago but we're not there yet so

2550
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:26,100
two years ago but we're not there yet so
 

2551
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,100
two years ago but we're not there yet so
I guess the the way I would think about

2552
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:28,110
I guess the the way I would think about
 

2553
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,740
I guess the the way I would think about
that is let's let's flip that question

2554
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:30,750
that is let's let's flip that question
 

2555
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,590
that is let's let's flip that question
around so what would prevent you to

2556
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:33,600
around so what would prevent you to
 

2557
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,570
around so what would prevent you to
reach hundreds of thousands of vehicles

2558
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:35,580
reach hundreds of thousands of vehicles
 

2559
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,060
reach hundreds of thousands of vehicles
and that's a goodness a good rephrasing

2560
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,070
and that's a goodness a good rephrasing
 

2561
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,520
and that's a goodness a good rephrasing
yeah so the

2562
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:41,530

 

2563
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:46,420

I'd say the it seems the consensus

2564
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:46,430

 

2565
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,859

among the

2566
00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:47,869
among the
 

2567
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:49,089
among the
people developing self-driving cars

2568
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:49,099
people developing self-driving cars
 

2569
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:51,430
people developing self-driving cars
today is to sort of start with some form

2570
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:51,440
today is to sort of start with some form
 

2571
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,739
today is to sort of start with some form
of an easier environment whether it

2572
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:53,749
of an easier environment whether it
 

2573
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:55,390
of an easier environment whether it
means you know lacking inclement weather

2574
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:55,400
means you know lacking inclement weather
 

2575
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,630
means you know lacking inclement weather
or you know mostly sunny or whatever it

2576
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
or you know mostly sunny or whatever it
 

2577
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,170
or you know mostly sunny or whatever it
is and then add add capability for more

2578
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:02,180
is and then add add capability for more
 

2579
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,529
is and then add add capability for more
complex situations over time and so if

2580
00:47:05,529 --> 00:47:05,539
complex situations over time and so if
 

2581
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,339
complex situations over time and so if
you're only able to deploy in areas that

2582
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:09,349
you're only able to deploy in areas that
 

2583
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:12,190
you're only able to deploy in areas that
that meet sort of your criteria or that

2584
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:12,200
that meet sort of your criteria or that
 

2585
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,509
that meet sort of your criteria or that
the current domain you know operating

2586
00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:13,519
the current domain you know operating
 

2587
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:14,920
the current domain you know operating
domain of the software you developed

2588
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:14,930
domain of the software you developed
 

2589
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,839
domain of the software you developed
that may put a cap on how many cities

2590
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:16,849
that may put a cap on how many cities
 

2591
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:18,470
that may put a cap on how many cities
you could deploy in

2592
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:18,480
you could deploy in
 

2593
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,810
you could deploy in
but then as those restrictions start to

2594
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:20,820
but then as those restrictions start to
 

2595
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,760
but then as those restrictions start to
fall away like maybe you add you know

2596
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:22,770
fall away like maybe you add you know
 

2597
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,260
fall away like maybe you add you know
capability to drive really well and and

2598
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:24,270
capability to drive really well and and
 

2599
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:27,230
capability to drive really well and and
safely in heavy rain or snow you know

2600
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:27,240
safely in heavy rain or snow you know
 

2601
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,000
safely in heavy rain or snow you know
that that probably opens up the market

2602
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,010
that that probably opens up the market
 

2603
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,829
that that probably opens up the market
by - two or three fold in terms of the

2604
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:30,839
by - two or three fold in terms of the
 

2605
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:32,839
by - two or three fold in terms of the
cities you can expand into and so on and

2606
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:32,849
cities you can expand into and so on and
 

2607
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,120
cities you can expand into and so on and
so the real question is you know I I

2608
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,130
so the real question is you know I I
 

2609
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,550
so the real question is you know I I
know today if we wanted to we could

2610
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:37,560
know today if we wanted to we could
 

2611
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,290
know today if we wanted to we could
produce that that many autonomous

2612
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:39,300
produce that that many autonomous
 

2613
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,300
produce that that many autonomous
vehicles but we wouldn't be able to make

2614
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:41,310
vehicles but we wouldn't be able to make
 

2615
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:42,560
vehicles but we wouldn't be able to make
use of all of them yet because we would

2616
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:42,570
use of all of them yet because we would
 

2617
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,079
use of all of them yet because we would
sort of saturate the demand in the

2618
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:45,089
sort of saturate the demand in the
 

2619
00:47:45,089 --> 00:47:46,609
sort of saturate the demand in the
cities in which we would want to operate

2620
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:46,619
cities in which we would want to operate
 

2621
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:49,880
cities in which we would want to operate
initially so if I were to guess like

2622
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,890
initially so if I were to guess like
 

2623
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,260
initially so if I were to guess like
what the timeline is for those things

2624
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:51,270
what the timeline is for those things
 

2625
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,730
what the timeline is for those things
falling away and reaching hundreds of

2626
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:52,740
falling away and reaching hundreds of
 

2627
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,030
falling away and reaching hundreds of
thousands of vehicles maybe a range is

2628
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:56,040
thousands of vehicles maybe a range is
 

2629
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,200
thousands of vehicles maybe a range is
but I would I would say less than five

2630
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,210
but I would I would say less than five
 

2631
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,349
but I would I would say less than five
years that's in five years yeah and of

2632
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:00,359
years that's in five years yeah and of
 

2633
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:01,819
years that's in five years yeah and of
course you're working hard to make that

2634
00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:01,829
course you're working hard to make that
 

2635
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:02,410
course you're working hard to make that
happen

2636
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:02,420
happen
 

2637
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,060
happen
so you started two companies that were

2638
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:05,070
so you started two companies that were
 

2639
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,670
so you started two companies that were
eventually acquired for each for a

2640
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
eventually acquired for each for a
 

2641
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,250
eventually acquired for each for a
billion dollars so you're pretty good

2642
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:10,260
billion dollars so you're pretty good
 

2643
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,200
billion dollars so you're pretty good
person to ask what does it take to build

2644
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,210
person to ask what does it take to build
 

2645
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:15,440
person to ask what does it take to build
a successful startup mmm-hmm I think

2646
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:15,450
a successful startup mmm-hmm I think
 

2647
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:17,900
a successful startup mmm-hmm I think
there's there sort of survivor bias here

2648
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:17,910
there's there sort of survivor bias here
 

2649
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:20,120
there's there sort of survivor bias here
a little bit but I can try to find some

2650
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,130
a little bit but I can try to find some
 

2651
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,410
a little bit but I can try to find some
common threads for the the things that

2652
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:21,420
common threads for the the things that
 

2653
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,340
common threads for the the things that
worked for me which is

2654
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:24,350

 

2655
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,590

2683
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:53,800
just going south and it's gonna be over
tomorrow and and so I think like having

2684
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:53,810
tomorrow and and so I think like having
 

2685
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,330
tomorrow and and so I think like having
a true passion that you can fall back on

2686
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:55,340
a true passion that you can fall back on
 

2687
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,830
a true passion that you can fall back on
and knowing that you would be doing it

2688
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:56,840
and knowing that you would be doing it
 

2689
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,090
and knowing that you would be doing it
even if you weren't getting paid for it

2690
00:48:58,090 --> 00:48:58,100
even if you weren't getting paid for it
 

2691
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,740
even if you weren't getting paid for it
helps you whether those those tough

2692
00:48:59,740 --> 00:48:59,750
helps you whether those those tough
 

2693
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,140
helps you whether those those tough
times so that's one thing I think the

2694
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:02,150
times so that's one thing I think the
 

2695
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,600
times so that's one thing I think the
other one is

2696
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:04,610

 

2697
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,100

really good people so I've always been

2698
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,110
really good people so I've always been

00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:07,880
surrounded by really good co-founders
 

2701
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,510
surrounded by really good co-founders
that are logical thinkers are always

2702
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:10,520
that are logical thinkers are always
 

2703
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,040
that are logical thinkers are always

levels of integrity so that's Dan Khan

2706
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:13,880
levels of integrity so that's Dan Khan
 

2707
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,060
levels of integrity so that's Dan Khan
in my current company and actually his

2708
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:16,070
in my current company and actually his
 

2709
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:17,890
in my current company and actually his
brother and a couple other guys for

2710
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:17,900
brother and a couple other guys for
 

2711
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,320
brother and a couple other guys for
Justin TV and twitch and then I think

2712
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:20,330
Justin TV and twitch and then I think
 

2713
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,730
Justin TV and twitch and then I think
the last thing is

2714
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:22,740
the last thing is
 

2715
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,680
the last thing is
just uh I guess persistence or

2716
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:24,690
just uh I guess persistence or
 

2717
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,500
just uh I guess persistence or
perseverance like and and that that can

2718
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,510
perseverance like and and that that can

competitors destroying you but I think
most of the time it's people giving up

most of the time it's people giving up
 

2757

2785
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,580
co-founder with like self-funded do you
think Y Combinator is good it's good to

2786
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:40,590
think Y Combinator is good it's good to
 

2787

think Y Combinator is good it's good to
do VC route is there no right answer was

2788
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:42,990
do VC route is there no right answer was
 

2789
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,220
do VC route is there no right answer was
there for the Y Combinator experience

2790
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:45,230
there for the Y Combinator experience
 

2791
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,359
there for the Y Combinator experience
something that you could take away that

2792
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:47,369
something that you could take away that
 

2793
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:48,950
something that you could take away that
that was the right path to take there's

2794
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:48,960
that was the right path to take there's
 

2795
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,780
that was the right path to take there's
no one-size-fits-all answer but if your

2796
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:50,790
no one-size-fits-all answer but if your
 

2797
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,050
no one-size-fits-all answer but if your
ambition I think is to you know see how

2798
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:54,060
ambition I think is to you know see how
 

2799
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,820
ambition I think is to you know see how
big you can make something or or or

2800
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:55,830
big you can make something or or or
 

2801
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,970
big you can make something or or or
rapidly expand and capture market or

2802
00:50:58,970 --> 00:50:58,980
rapidly expand and capture market or
 

2803
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,920
rapidly expand and capture market or
solve a problem or whatever it is then

2804
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:00,930
solve a problem or whatever it is then
 

2805
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,480
solve a problem or whatever it is then
then you know going to venture back

2806
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:02,490
then you know going to venture back
 

2807
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,310
then you know going to venture back
route is probably a good approach so

2808
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:04,320
route is probably a good approach so
 

2809
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,990
route is probably a good approach so
that so that capital doesn't become your

something you need not necessarily grab
but if you go back it could do

2876

but if you go back it could do
 

2877
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,829
but if you go back it could do
differently I think I've made a lot of

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,039
everything you can screw up I think I've
screwed up at least once but I you know

2891
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,749
if they didn't go well and call it a

00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:36,759
regret because hopefully took away some
 

2893
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:42,560
regret because hopefully took away some
new knowledge or learning from that so

2894
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:42,570

 

2895
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,890

I would say there was a period yeah the

there's a period in in justin.tv I think

2900
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:49,710
there's a period in in justin.tv I think
 

2901
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:53,670
there's a period in in justin.tv I think
after seven years where

2902
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:53,680

 

2903
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,839

working on the core technology there but
 

2913
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:06,750
working on the core technology there but
my heart was no longer in it because the

2914
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:06,760
my heart was no longer in it because the
 

2915

working on that and and I'd say like I
 

2927
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:20,940
working on that and and I'd say like I
would have just tried to do something

00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,970
well maybe you needed the two years of
that existential dread to develop the

00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,720
feeling that ultimately was the fire
that created crews so you never know you

2966
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:55,730
that created crews so you never know you
 

2967
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,600
that created crews so you never know you
can be good theory yeah so last question

2968
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:58,610
can be good theory yeah so last question
 

2969
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:02,410
can be good theory yeah so last question
what does 2019 hold for crews after this

2970
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:02,420
what does 2019 hold for crews after this
 

2971
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,210
what does 2019 hold for crews after this
I guess we're gonna go and I'll talk to

2972
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:04,220
I guess we're gonna go and I'll talk to
 

2973
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,920
I guess we're gonna go and I'll talk to
your class but one of the big things is

2974
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:05,930
your class but one of the big things is
 

2975
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,290
your class but one of the big things is
going from prototype to production for

2976
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:08,300
going from prototype to production for
 

2977
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,490
going from prototype to production for
autonomous cars and what does that mean

2978
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:09,500
autonomous cars and what does that mean
 

2979
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,910
autonomous cars and what does that mean
once that look like in 2019 for us is

2980
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:12,920
once that look like in 2019 for us is
 

2981
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,470
once that look like in 2019 for us is
the year that we try to cross over that

2982
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480
the year that we try to cross over that
 

2983
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,760
the year that we try to cross over that
threshold and reach

2984
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:15,770
threshold and reach
 

2985
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,500
threshold and reach
you know superhuman level of performance

2986
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:17,510
you know superhuman level of performance
 

2987
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:18,750
you know superhuman level of performance
to some degree with the software and
