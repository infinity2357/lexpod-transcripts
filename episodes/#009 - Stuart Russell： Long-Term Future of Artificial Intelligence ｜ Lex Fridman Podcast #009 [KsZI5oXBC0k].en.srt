were you ever able to build a program

40
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,010
were you ever able to build a program
 

41
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,410
were you ever able to build a program
that beat you a chess or another board

42
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:57,420
that beat you a chess or another board
 

43
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,790
that beat you a chess or another board
game so my program never beat me at

44
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:01,800
game so my program never beat me at
 

45
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,560
game so my program never beat me at
chess I actually wrote the program at

46
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:05,570
chess I actually wrote the program at
 

47
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,850
chess I actually wrote the program at
Imperial College so I used to take the

48
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:07,860
Imperial College so I used to take the
 

49
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,210
Imperial College so I used to take the
bus every Wednesday with a box of cards

50
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,220
bus every Wednesday with a box of cards
 

51
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,750
bus every Wednesday with a box of cards
this big and shove them into the card

52
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:14,760
this big and shove them into the card
 

53
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,490
this big and shove them into the card
reader and they gave us eight seconds of

54
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:16,500
reader and they gave us eight seconds of
 

55
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,850
reader and they gave us eight seconds of
CPU time

56
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:18,860
CPU time
 

57
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,130
CPU time
it took about five seconds to read the

58
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,140
it took about five seconds to read the
 

59
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,980
it took about five seconds to read the
cards in and compile the code so we had

60
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:23,990
cards in and compile the code so we had
 

61
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,440
cards in and compile the code so we had
three seconds of CPU time which was

62
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,450
three seconds of CPU time which was
 

63
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,720
three seconds of CPU time which was
enough to make one move you know with a

64
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,730
enough to make one move you know with a
 

65
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,150
enough to make one move you know with a
not very deep search and then we would

66
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,160
not very deep search and then we would
 

67
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,470
not very deep search and then we would
print that move out and then we'd have

68
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:32,480
print that move out and then we'd have
 

69
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,420
print that move out and then we'd have
to go to the back of the queue and wait

70
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:34,430
to go to the back of the queue and wait
 

71
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,310
to go to the back of the queue and wait
to feed the cards in again how do you

72
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
to feed the cards in again how do you
 

73
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,120
to feed the cards in again how do you
post a search well I would talk to no I

74
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,130
post a search well I would talk to no I
 

75
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,150
post a search well I would talk to no I
think we got we got an eight move eight

76
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,160
think we got we got an eight move eight
 

77
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,000
think we got we got an eight move eight
you know depth eight with alpha beta and

78
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,010
you know depth eight with alpha beta and
 

79
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,930
you know depth eight with alpha beta and
we had some tricks of our own about move

80
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:49,940
we had some tricks of our own about move
 

81
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,030
we had some tricks of our own about move
ordering and some pruning of the tree

82
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,040
ordering and some pruning of the tree
 

83
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,310
ordering and some pruning of the tree
and we were still able to beat that

84
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
and we were still able to beat that
 

85
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,130
and we were still able to beat that
program yeah yeah I I was a reasonable

86
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,140
program yeah yeah I I was a reasonable
 

87
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,040
program yeah yeah I I was a reasonable
chess player in my youth I did Anna

88
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,050
chess player in my youth I did Anna
 

89
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,800
chess player in my youth I did Anna
fellow program and a backgammon program

90
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:02,810
fellow program and a backgammon program
 

91
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,749
fellow program and a backgammon program
so when I go to Berkley I worked a lot

92
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:04,759
so when I go to Berkley I worked a lot
 

93
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,060
so when I go to Berkley I worked a lot
on what we call meta reasoning which

94
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,070
on what we call meta reasoning which
 

95
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,650
on what we call meta reasoning which
really means reasoning about reasoning

96
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:11,660
really means reasoning about reasoning
 

97
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,930
really means reasoning about reasoning
and in the case of a game playing

98
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:13,940
and in the case of a game playing
 

99
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,210
and in the case of a game playing
program you need to reason about what

100
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:16,220
program you need to reason about what
 

101
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,430
program you need to reason about what
parts of the search tree you're actually

102
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,440
parts of the search tree you're actually
 

103
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,590
parts of the search tree you're actually
going to explore because the search tree

104
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:20,600
going to explore because the search tree
 

105
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,229
going to explore because the search tree
is enormous or you know bigger than the

106
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:23,239
is enormous or you know bigger than the
 

107
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,160
is enormous or you know bigger than the
number of atoms in the universe and the

108
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,170
number of atoms in the universe and the
 

109
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,890
number of atoms in the universe and the
way programs succeed and the way humans

110
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:29,900
way programs succeed and the way humans
 

111
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,810
way programs succeed and the way humans
succeed is by only looking at a small

112
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:31,820
succeed is by only looking at a small
 

113
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,720
succeed is by only looking at a small
fraction of the search tree and if you

114
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:34,730
fraction of the search tree and if you
 

115
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,190
fraction of the search tree and if you
look at the right fraction you play

116
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,200
look at the right fraction you play
 

117
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,630
look at the right fraction you play
really well if you look at the wrong

118
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:37,640
really well if you look at the wrong
 

119
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,030
really well if you look at the wrong
fraction if you waste your time thinking

120
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,040
fraction if you waste your time thinking
 

121
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,070
fraction if you waste your time thinking
about things that are never gonna happen

122
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
about things that are never gonna happen
 

123
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,949
about things that are never gonna happen
the moves that no one's ever gonna make

124
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:43,959
the moves that no one's ever gonna make
 

125
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,780
the moves that no one's ever gonna make
then you're gonna lose because you you

126
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:46,790
then you're gonna lose because you you
 

127
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,850
then you're gonna lose because you you
won't be able to figure out the right

128
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:48,860
won't be able to figure out the right
 

129
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,600
won't be able to figure out the right
decision

130
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:50,610
decision
 

131
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,810
decision
so that question of how machines can

132
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:53,820
so that question of how machines can
 

133
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,790
so that question of how machines can
manage their own computation either how

134
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:55,800
manage their own computation either how
 

135
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,330
manage their own computation either how
they decide what to think about

136
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:58,340
they decide what to think about
 

137
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,040
they decide what to think about
is the meta-reasoning question we

138
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,050
is the meta-reasoning question we
 

139
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,500
is the meta-reasoning question we
developed some methods for doing that

140
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,510
developed some methods for doing that
 

141
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,680
developed some methods for doing that
and very simply a machine should think

142
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:05,690
and very simply a machine should think
 

143
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,229
and very simply a machine should think
about whatever thoughts are going to

144
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
about whatever thoughts are going to
 

145
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,020
about whatever thoughts are going to
improve its decision quality we were

146
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,030
improve its decision quality we were
 

147
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,809
improve its decision quality we were
able to show that both for a fellow

148
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:13,819
able to show that both for a fellow
 

149
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,140
able to show that both for a fellow
which is a standard to play game and for

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,150
which is a standard to play game and for
 

151
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,869
which is a standard to play game and for
backgammon which includes dice for also

152
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:19,879
backgammon which includes dice for also
 

153
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,960
backgammon which includes dice for also
it's a two-player game with uncertainty

154
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:21,970
it's a two-player game with uncertainty
 

155
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,400
it's a two-player game with uncertainty
for both of those cases we could come up

156
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,410
for both of those cases we could come up
 

157
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,979
for both of those cases we could come up
with algorithms that were actually much

158
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:26,989
with algorithms that were actually much
 

159
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,890
with algorithms that were actually much
more efficient than the standard alpha

160
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:29,900
more efficient than the standard alpha

about how you decide what to think about
it's a combination of two things one is

it's a combination of two things one is
 

271
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,360
it's a combination of two things one is
how promising it is right so if you're

272
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,370
how promising it is right so if you're
 

273
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,710
how promising it is right so if you're
already convinced that a move is

274
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:21,720
already convinced that a move is
 

275
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,530
already convinced that a move is
terrible there's no point spending a lot

276
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:24,540
terrible there's no point spending a lot
 

277
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,270
terrible there's no point spending a lot
more time convincing yourself that it's

278
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,280
more time convincing yourself that it's
 

279
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,900
more time convincing yourself that it's
terrible because it's probably not gonna

280
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:29,910
terrible because it's probably not gonna
 

281
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,480
terrible because it's probably not gonna
change your mind so the the real reason

282
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,490
change your mind so the the real reason
 

283
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,220
change your mind so the the real reason
you think is because there's some

284
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,230
you think is because there's some
 

285
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,900
you think is because there's some
possibility of changing your mind about

286
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:35,910
possibility of changing your mind about
 

287
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,250
possibility of changing your mind about
what to do mm-hmm

288
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,260
what to do mm-hmm
 

289
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,890
what to do mm-hmm
right and is that changing your mind

290
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:39,900
right and is that changing your mind
 

291
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,580
right and is that changing your mind
that would result then in a better final

292
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:43,590
that would result then in a better final
 

293
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,200
that would result then in a better final
action in the real world so that's the

294
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,210
action in the real world so that's the
 

295
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,870
action in the real world so that's the
purpose of thinking is to improve the

296
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:47,880
purpose of thinking is to improve the
 

297
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,410
purpose of thinking is to improve the
final action in the real world and so if

298
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:51,420
final action in the real world and so if
 

299
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,610
final action in the real world and so if
you think about a move that is

300
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:52,620
you think about a move that is
 

301
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,880
you think about a move that is
guaranteed to be terrible you can

302
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:55,890
guaranteed to be terrible you can
 

303
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,230
guaranteed to be terrible you can
convince yourself is terrible and you're

304
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,240
convince yourself is terrible and you're
 

305
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,000
convince yourself is terrible and you're
still not gonna change your mind all

306
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,010
still not gonna change your mind all
 

307
00:06:59,010 --> 00:06:59,830
still not gonna change your mind all
right

308
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
right
 

309
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,910
right
but on the other hand you I suppose you

310
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:01,920
but on the other hand you I suppose you
 

311
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,010
but on the other hand you I suppose you
had a choice between two moves one of

312
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,020
had a choice between two moves one of
 

313
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,510
had a choice between two moves one of
them you've already figured out is

314
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
them you've already figured out is
 

315
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,150
them you've already figured out is
guaranteed to be a draw let's say and

316
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
guaranteed to be a draw let's say and
 

317
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,640
guaranteed to be a draw let's say and
then the other one looks a little bit

318
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:10,650
then the other one looks a little bit
 

319
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,620
then the other one looks a little bit
worse like it looks fairly likely that

320
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:12,630
worse like it looks fairly likely that
 

321
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,970
worse like it looks fairly likely that
if you make that move you're gonna lose

322
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:13,980
if you make that move you're gonna lose
 

323
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,230
if you make that move you're gonna lose
but there's still some uncertainty about

324
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,240
but there's still some uncertainty about
 

325
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,880
but there's still some uncertainty about
the value of that move there's still

326
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:19,890
the value of that move there's still
 

327
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,590
the value of that move there's still
some possibility that it will turn out

328
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:21,600
some possibility that it will turn out
 

329
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,720
some possibility that it will turn out
to be a win all right then it's worth

330
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,730
to be a win all right then it's worth
 

331
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,820
to be a win all right then it's worth
thinking about that so even though it's

332
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:25,830
thinking about that so even though it's
 

333
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,880
thinking about that so even though it's
less promising on average than the other

334
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:28,890
less promising on average than the other
 

335
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,350
less promising on average than the other
move which is guaranteed to be a draw

336
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,360
move which is guaranteed to be a draw
 

337
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,480
move which is guaranteed to be a draw
there's still some purpose in thinking

338
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:32,490
there's still some purpose in thinking
 

339
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,740
there's still some purpose in thinking
about it because there's a chance that

340
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:33,750
about it because there's a chance that
 

341
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,230
about it because there's a chance that
you will change your mind and discover

342
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
you will change your mind and discover
 

343
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
you will change your mind and discover
that in fact it's a better move so it's

344
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,250
that in fact it's a better move so it's
 

345
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,000
that in fact it's a better move so it's
a combination of how good the move

346
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,010
a combination of how good the move
 

347
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,460
a combination of how good the move
appears to be and how much I'm certainty

348
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:43,470
appears to be and how much I'm certainty
 

349
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,740
appears to be and how much I'm certainty
there is about its value the more

350
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:45,750
there is about its value the more
 

351
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,930
there is about its value the more
uncertainty the more it's worth thinking

352
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:47,940
uncertainty the more it's worth thinking
 

353
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,750
uncertainty the more it's worth thinking
about because there's a higher upside if

354
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:50,760
about because there's a higher upside if
 

355
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,460
about because there's a higher upside if
you want to think of it that way and of

356
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:52,470
you want to think of it that way and of
 

357
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,160
you want to think of it that way and of
course in the beginning especially in

358
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,170
course in the beginning especially in
 

359
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,070
course in the beginning especially in
the alphago 0 formulation it's

360
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
the alphago 0 formulation it's
 

361
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,430
the alphago 0 formulation it's
everything is shrouded in uncertainty so

362
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
everything is shrouded in uncertainty so
 

363
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,900
everything is shrouded in uncertainty so
you're really swimming in a sea of

364
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:02,910
you're really swimming in a sea of
 

365
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,940
you're really swimming in a sea of
uncertainty so it benefits you too I

366
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:06,950
uncertainty so it benefits you too I
 

367
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,990
uncertainty so it benefits you too I
mean actually following the same process

368
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
mean actually following the same process
 

369
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,760
mean actually following the same process
as you described but because you're so

370
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:10,770
as you described but because you're so
 

371
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,010
as you described but because you're so
uncertain about everything you you

372
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,020
uncertain about everything you you
 

373
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,750
uncertain about everything you you
basically have to try a lot of different

374
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:14,760
basically have to try a lot of different
 

375
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,450
basically have to try a lot of different
directions yeah so so the early parts of

376
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,460
directions yeah so so the early parts of
 

377
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,450
directions yeah so so the early parts of
the search tree a fairly bushy

378
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:20,460
the search tree a fairly bushy
 

379
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,670
the search tree a fairly bushy
that it will when looking a lot of

380
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,680
that it will when looking a lot of
 

381
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,990
that it will when looking a lot of
different possibilities but fairly

382
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
different possibilities but fairly
 

383
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,930
different possibilities but fairly
quickly the degree of certainty about

384
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:26,940
quickly the degree of certainty about
 

385
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,670
quickly the degree of certainty about
some of the moves I mean if a movies are

386
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:28,680
some of the moves I mean if a movies are
 

387
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
some of the moves I mean if a movies are
really terrible you'll pretty quickly

388
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:30,690
really terrible you'll pretty quickly
 

389
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,510
really terrible you'll pretty quickly
find out right you lose half your pieces

390
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:32,520
find out right you lose half your pieces
 

391
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,449
find out right you lose half your pieces
or half your territory and and then

392
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:35,459
or half your territory and and then
 

393
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:37,040
or half your territory and and then
you'll say okay this this is not worth

394
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,050
you'll say okay this this is not worth
 

395
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,050
you'll say okay this this is not worth
thinking about any more and then so a

396
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,060
thinking about any more and then so a
 

397
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,260
thinking about any more and then so a
further down the tree becomes very long

398
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,270
further down the tree becomes very long
 

399
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,800
further down the tree becomes very long
and narrow and you're following various

400
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:45,810
and narrow and you're following various
 

401
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,240
and narrow and you're following various
lines of play you know 10 20 30 40 50

402
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,250
lines of play you know 10 20 30 40 50
 

403
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,079
lines of play you know 10 20 30 40 50
moves into the future and you know

404
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:54,089
moves into the future and you know
 

405
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:55,579
moves into the future and you know
that's again it's something that human

406
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:55,589
that's again it's something that human
 

407
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,389
that's again it's something that human
beings have a very hard time doing

408
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
beings have a very hard time doing
 

409
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,130
beings have a very hard time doing
mainly because they just lacked the

410
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,140
mainly because they just lacked the
 

411
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,230
mainly because they just lacked the
short-term memory you just can't

412
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,240
short-term memory you just can't
 

413
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,600
short-term memory you just can't
remember a sequence of moves that's 50

414
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:05,610
remember a sequence of moves that's 50
 

415
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,480
remember a sequence of moves that's 50
movies long and you can't you can't

416
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,490
movies long and you can't you can't
 

417
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,810
movies long and you can't you can't
imagine the board correctly for that

418
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:11,820
imagine the board correctly for that
 

419
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,880
imagine the board correctly for that
money moves into the future of course

420
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:13,890
money moves into the future of course
 

421
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,300
money moves into the future of course
the top players I'm much more familiar

422
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,310
the top players I'm much more familiar
 

423
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,980
the top players I'm much more familiar
with chess but the top players probably

424
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:18,990
with chess but the top players probably
 

425
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,740
with chess but the top players probably
have they have echoes of the same kind

426
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:21,750
have they have echoes of the same kind
 

427
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,590
have they have echoes of the same kind
of intuition instinct that in a moment's

428
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:24,600
of intuition instinct that in a moment's
 

429
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:24,889
of intuition instinct that in a moment's
time

430
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:24,899
time
 

431
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,370

alphago applies when they see a board

432
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:28,380
alphago applies when they see a board
 

433
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,949
alphago applies when they see a board
I mean they've seen those patterns human

434
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
I mean they've seen those patterns human
 

435
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,360
I mean they've seen those patterns human
beings have seen those patterns before

436
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,370
beings have seen those patterns before
 

437
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,240
beings have seen those patterns before
at the top at the Grandmaster level it

438
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,250
at the top at the Grandmaster level it
 

439
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,540
at the top at the Grandmaster level it
seems that there is some similarities or

440
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:41,550
seems that there is some similarities or
 

441
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,970
seems that there is some similarities or
maybe it's it's our imagination creates

442
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:43,980
maybe it's it's our imagination creates
 

443
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,949
maybe it's it's our imagination creates
a vision of those similarities but it

444
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:45,959
a vision of those similarities but it
 

445
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,079
a vision of those similarities but it
feels like this kind of pattern

446
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:48,089
feels like this kind of pattern
 

447
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,990
feels like this kind of pattern
recognition that the alphago approaches

448
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,000
recognition that the alphago approaches
 

449
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,660
recognition that the alphago approaches
are using is similar to what human

450
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:53,670
are using is similar to what human
 

451
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,870
are using is similar to what human
beings at the top level or using I think

452
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
beings at the top level or using I think
 

453
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,000
beings at the top level or using I think
there's there's some truth to that but

454
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,010
there's there's some truth to that but
 

455
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,519
there's there's some truth to that but
not entirely yeah I mean I think the the

456
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:04,529
not entirely yeah I mean I think the the
 

457
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:08,120
not entirely yeah I mean I think the the
extent to which a human Grandmaster can

458
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,130
extent to which a human Grandmaster can
 

459
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,569
extent to which a human Grandmaster can
reliably wreak instantly recognize the

460
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:11,579
reliably wreak instantly recognize the
 

461
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:13,100
reliably wreak instantly recognize the
right move instantly recognize the value

462
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,110
right move instantly recognize the value
 

463
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,530
right move instantly recognize the value
of a position I think that's a little

464
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:15,540
of a position I think that's a little
 

465
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,319
of a position I think that's a little
bit overrated but if you sacrifice a

466
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:18,329
bit overrated but if you sacrifice a
 

467
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:19,730
bit overrated but if you sacrifice a
queen for exam I mean there's these

468
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:19,740
queen for exam I mean there's these
 

469
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,100
queen for exam I mean there's these
there's these beautiful games of chess

470
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,110
there's these beautiful games of chess
 

471
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,800
there's these beautiful games of chess
with Bobby Fischer somebody where it's

472
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:24,810
with Bobby Fischer somebody where it's
 

473
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,390
with Bobby Fischer somebody where it's
seeming to make a bad move and I'm not

474
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,400
seeming to make a bad move and I'm not
 

475
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,580
seeming to make a bad move and I'm not
sure there's a

476
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:30,590
sure there's a
 

477
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,250
sure there's a
a perfect degree of calculation involved

478
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,260
a perfect degree of calculation involved
 

479
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,800
a perfect degree of calculation involved
were they've calculated all the possible

480
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:35,810
were they've calculated all the possible
 

481
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,420
were they've calculated all the possible
things that happen but there's an

482
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:37,430
things that happen but there's an
 

483
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,730
things that happen but there's an
instinct there right that somehow adds

484
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:39,740
instinct there right that somehow adds
 

485
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,720
instinct there right that somehow adds
up to the yeah so I think what happens

486
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:43,730
up to the yeah so I think what happens
 

487
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,000
up to the yeah so I think what happens
is you you you get a sense that there's

488
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,010
is you you you get a sense that there's
 

489
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,330
is you you you get a sense that there's
some possibility in the position even if

490
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:49,340
some possibility in the position even if
 

491
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,730
some possibility in the position even if
you make a weird-looking move that it

492
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:51,740
you make a weird-looking move that it
 

493
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,520
you make a weird-looking move that it
opens up some some lines of of

494
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,530
opens up some some lines of of
 

495
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,940
opens up some some lines of of
calculation that otherwise would be

496
00:10:59,940 --> 00:10:59,950
calculation that otherwise would be
 

497
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,990
calculation that otherwise would be
definitely bad and and is that intuition

498
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,000
definitely bad and and is that intuition
 

499
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,890
definitely bad and and is that intuition
that there's something here in this

500
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:08,900
that there's something here in this
 

501
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,130
that there's something here in this
position that might might yield a win

502
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,140
position that might might yield a win
 

503
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,920
position that might might yield a win
down the side and then you follow that

504
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:14,930
down the side and then you follow that
 

505
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,440
down the side and then you follow that
right and and in some sense when when a

506
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,450
right and and in some sense when when a
 

507
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,990
right and and in some sense when when a
chess player is following a line and in

508
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
chess player is following a line and in
 

509
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,470
chess player is following a line and in
his or her mind they're they mentally

510
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:23,480
his or her mind they're they mentally
 

511
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,110
his or her mind they're they mentally
simulating what the other person is

512
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,120
simulating what the other person is
 

513
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,640
simulating what the other person is
gonna do while the opponent is gonna do

514
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:27,650
gonna do while the opponent is gonna do
 

515
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,580
gonna do while the opponent is gonna do
and they can do that as long as the

516
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:30,590
and they can do that as long as the
 

517
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,400
and they can do that as long as the
moves are kind of forced right as long

518
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,410
moves are kind of forced right as long
 

519
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,710
moves are kind of forced right as long
as there's a you know there's a fourth

520
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:35,720
as there's a you know there's a fourth
 

521
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,600
as there's a you know there's a fourth
we call a forcing variation where the

522
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:37,610
we call a forcing variation where the
 

523
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,890
we call a forcing variation where the
opponent doesn't really have much choice

524
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:38,900
opponent doesn't really have much choice
 

525
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,350
opponent doesn't really have much choice
how to respond and then you see if you

526
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
how to respond and then you see if you
 

527
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,910
how to respond and then you see if you
can force them into a situation where

528
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:42,920
can force them into a situation where
 

529
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,370
can force them into a situation where
you win you know we see plenty of

530
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:45,380
you win you know we see plenty of
 

531
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,200
you win you know we see plenty of
mistakes even even in Grandmaster games

532
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,210
mistakes even even in Grandmaster games
 

533
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,690
mistakes even even in Grandmaster games
where they just miss some simple three

534
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:52,700
where they just miss some simple three
 

535
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,410
where they just miss some simple three
four five move combination that you know

536
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:56,420
four five move combination that you know
 

537
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,930
four five move combination that you know
wasn't particularly apparent in in the

538
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:58,940
wasn't particularly apparent in in the
 

539
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,180
wasn't particularly apparent in in the
position but we're still there that's

540
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,190
position but we're still there that's
 

541
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,470
position but we're still there that's
the thing that makes us human

542
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
the thing that makes us human
 

543
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,280
the thing that makes us human
yeah so when you mentioned that in a

544
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,290
yeah so when you mentioned that in a
 

545
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,220
yeah so when you mentioned that in a
fellow those games were after some meta

546
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,230
fellow those games were after some meta
 

547
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,170
fellow those games were after some meta
reasoning improvements and research I

548
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:11,180
reasoning improvements and research I
 

549
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,780
reasoning improvements and research I
was able to beat you how did that make

550
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:13,790
was able to beat you how did that make
 

551
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,880
was able to beat you how did that make
you feel part of the meta reasoning

552
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:15,890
you feel part of the meta reasoning
 

553
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,660
you feel part of the meta reasoning
capability that it had was based on

554
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:19,670
capability that it had was based on
 

555
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,340
capability that it had was based on
learning and and you could sit down the

556
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,350
learning and and you could sit down the
 

557
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,860
learning and and you could sit down the
next day and you could just feel that it

558
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:26,870
next day and you could just feel that it
 

559
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,980
next day and you could just feel that it
had got a lot smarter boom you know and

560
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:29,990
had got a lot smarter boom you know and
 

561
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,960
had got a lot smarter boom you know and
all the sudden you really felt like you

562
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:31,970
all the sudden you really felt like you
 

563
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,170
all the sudden you really felt like you
sort of pressed against

564
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,180
sort of pressed against
 

565
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,200
sort of pressed against
the wall because it was it was much more

566
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,210
the wall because it was it was much more
 

567
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,080
the wall because it was it was much more
aggressive and was totally unforgiving

568
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,090
aggressive and was totally unforgiving
 

569
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,270
aggressive and was totally unforgiving
of any minor mistake that you might make

570
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,280
of any minor mistake that you might make
 

571
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,750
of any minor mistake that you might make
and and actually it seemed understood

572
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
and and actually it seemed understood
 

573
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,330
and and actually it seemed understood
the game better than I did and you know

574
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:48,340
the game better than I did and you know
 

575
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,380
the game better than I did and you know
Gary Kasparov has this quote weary

576
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,390
Gary Kasparov has this quote weary
 

577
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,600
Gary Kasparov has this quote weary
during his match against deep blue he

578
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:54,610
during his match against deep blue he
 

579
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,370
during his match against deep blue he
said he suddenly felt that there was a

580
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:56,380
said he suddenly felt that there was a
 

581
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,960
said he suddenly felt that there was a
new kind of intelligence across the

582
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:57,970
new kind of intelligence across the
 

583
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,890
new kind of intelligence across the
board do you think that's a scary or an

584
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:01,900
board do you think that's a scary or an
 

585
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,910
board do you think that's a scary or an
exciting possibility that's prevent for

586
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
exciting possibility that's prevent for
 

587
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,850
exciting possibility that's prevent for
yourself in in the context of chess

588
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:08,860
yourself in in the context of chess
 

589
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,960
yourself in in the context of chess
purely sort of in this like that feeling

590
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:12,970
purely sort of in this like that feeling
 

591
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,090
purely sort of in this like that feeling
whatever that is I think it's definitely

592
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,100
whatever that is I think it's definitely
 

593
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,300
whatever that is I think it's definitely
an exciting feeling you know this is

594
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,310
an exciting feeling you know this is
 

595
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,050
an exciting feeling you know this is
what made me work on AI in the first

596
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,060
what made me work on AI in the first
 

597
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,790
what made me work on AI in the first
place was as soon as I really understood

598
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:23,800
place was as soon as I really understood
 

599
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,380
place was as soon as I really understood
what a computer was I wanted to make it

600
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:25,390
what a computer was I wanted to make it
 

601
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,430
what a computer was I wanted to make it
smart you know I started out with the

602
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
smart you know I started out with the
 

603
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,840
smart you know I started out with the
first program I wrote was for the

604
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:30,850
first program I wrote was for the
 

605
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,290
first program I wrote was for the
sinclair programmable calculator and i

606
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:34,300
sinclair programmable calculator and i
 

607
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,610
sinclair programmable calculator and i
think you could write a 21 step

608
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:37,620
think you could write a 21 step
 

609
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,290
think you could write a 21 step
algorithm that was the biggest program

610
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:40,300
algorithm that was the biggest program
 

611
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,720
algorithm that was the biggest program
you could write something like that and

612
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:42,730
you could write something like that and
 

613
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,060
you could write something like that and
do little arithmetic calculations so I

614
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,070
do little arithmetic calculations so I
 

615
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,890
do little arithmetic calculations so I
say think I implemented Newton's method

616
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:46,900
say think I implemented Newton's method
 

617
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,320
say think I implemented Newton's method
for square roots and a few other things

618
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,330
for square roots and a few other things
 

619
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:49,890
for square roots and a few other things
like that

620
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:49,900
like that
 

621
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,610
like that
um but then you know I thought okay if I

622
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:53,620
um but then you know I thought okay if I
 

623
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,310
um but then you know I thought okay if I
just had more space I could make this

624
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
just had more space I could make this
 

625
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,700
just had more space I could make this
thing intelligent

626
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:58,710
thing intelligent
 

627
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:04,200
thing intelligent
and so I started thinking about AI and

628
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,210

 

629
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,040

and I think the the the thing that's

630
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,050
and I think the the the thing that's
 

631
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:13,250
and I think the the the thing that's
scary is not is not the chess program

632
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,260
scary is not is not the chess program
 

633
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,660
scary is not is not the chess program
because you know chess programs they're

634
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:15,670

they can cope with uncertainty they can

they can cope with uncertainty they can

cope with partial observability
and so each of those steps sort of

00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,100
and so each of those steps sort of
 

745
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,570
and so each of those steps sort of
magnifies by a thousand the range of

magnifies by a thousand the range of

00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,030
magnifies by a thousand the range of
things that we can do with AI systems so

00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,650

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:01,860
the mind in high school and of course
 

755
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,540
the mind in high school and of course
program and so on and then I showed up

756
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:04,550
program and so on and then I showed up
 

757
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,420
program and so on and then I showed up
University of Illinois to an AI lab and

University of Illinois to an AI lab and
 

759
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,220
University of Illinois to an AI lab and
they said okay I don't have time for you

760
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,230
they said okay I don't have time for you
 

761
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,610
they said okay I don't have time for you
but here's a book AI a modern approach I

but here's a book AI a modern approach I
 

763
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,200
but here's a book AI a modern approach I
think was the first edition at the time

incredible that we solve chess but we'll

never solve go I mean it was pretty

772
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:25,470
never solve go I mean it was pretty
 

773
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,520
never solve go I mean it was pretty
certain that go in the way we thought

certain that go in the way we thought
 

775
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,390
certain that go in the way we thought
about systems that reason was impossible

776
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
about systems that reason was impossible
 

777
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,010
about systems that reason was impossible
to solve and now we've solved this as a

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:37,860
very I think I would have said that it's
 

781
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,490
very I think I would have said that it's
unlikely we could take the kind of

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:40,500
unlikely we could take the kind of
 

783
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,970
unlikely we could take the kind of
algorithm that was used for chess and

784
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:42,980
algorithm that was used for chess and
 

785
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,160
algorithm that was used for chess and
just get it to scale up and work well

786
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,170
just get it to scale up and work well
 

787
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,480
just get it to scale up and work well
for go

788
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,490
for go
 

789
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,930
for go
and at the time what we thought was that

790
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:53,940
and at the time what we thought was that
 

791
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,030
and at the time what we thought was that
in order to solve go we would have to do

792
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,040
in order to solve go we would have to do
 

793
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,150
in order to solve go we would have to do
something similar to the way humans

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
something similar to the way humans
 

795
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,220
something similar to the way humans
manage the complexity of go which is to

796
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,230
manage the complexity of go which is to
 

797
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,100
manage the complexity of go which is to
break it down into kind of sub games so

798
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,110
break it down into kind of sub games so
 

799
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,050
break it down into kind of sub games so
when a human thinks about a go board

800
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,060
when a human thinks about a go board
 

801
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,760
when a human thinks about a go board
they think about different parts of the

802
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:08,770
they think about different parts of the
 

803
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,700
they think about different parts of the
board as sort of weakly connected to

804
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:11,710
board as sort of weakly connected to
 

805
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,440
board as sort of weakly connected to
each other and they think about okay

806
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,450
each other and they think about okay
 

807
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,540
each other and they think about okay
within this part of the board here's how

808
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:15,550
within this part of the board here's how
 

809
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,880
within this part of the board here's how
things could go and that part about his

810
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:17,890
things could go and that part about his
 

811
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,800
things could go and that part about his
how things could go and now you try to

812
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:19,810
how things could go and now you try to
 

813
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,210
how things could go and now you try to
sort of couple those two analyses

814
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,220
sort of couple those two analyses
 

815
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,360
sort of couple those two analyses
together and deal with the interactions

816
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,370
together and deal with the interactions
 

817
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,190
together and deal with the interactions
and maybe revise your views of how

818
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,200
and maybe revise your views of how
 

819
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,930
and maybe revise your views of how
things are going to go in each part and

820
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:27,940
things are going to go in each part and
 

821
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,330
things are going to go in each part and
then you've got maybe five six seven ten

822
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:30,340
then you've got maybe five six seven ten
 

823
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,230
then you've got maybe five six seven ten
parts of the board and that actually

824
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
parts of the board and that actually
 

825
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,430
parts of the board and that actually
resembles the real world much more than

826
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:38,440
resembles the real world much more than
 

827
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,430
resembles the real world much more than
chess does because in the real world you

these all are connected to each other
 

837
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,850
these all are connected to each other

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,030
me ask you sort of so you were part of
the symbolic AI world for a while like

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,040
the symbolic AI world for a while like
 

909
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,310
the symbolic AI world for a while like
whatever the AI was there's a lot of

whatever the AI was there's a lot of
 

911
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,770
whatever the AI was there's a lot of
excellent interesting ideas there that

unfortunately met a winter and so it do

914
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:38,810
unfortunately met a winter and so it do
 

915
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,710
unfortunately met a winter and so it do
you think it really emerges well I would

916
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:41,720
you think it really emerges well I would
 

917
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,680
you think it really emerges well I would
say yeah it's not quite as simple as

918
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:44,690
say yeah it's not quite as simple as
 

919
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,140
say yeah it's not quite as simple as
that so the the AI winter so for the

920
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,150
that so the the AI winter so for the
 

921
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,720
that so the the AI winter so for the
first window that was actually named as

first window that was actually named as
 

923
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,610
first window that was actually named as

and that came about because in the mid
 

927
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,140
and that came about because in the mid
80s there was a really a concerted

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,850
problems you can fudge it for small
versions of the problem but when it

954
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:41,860
versions of the problem but when it
 

955
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,950
versions of the problem but when it
starts to get larger the thing just

956
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:43,960
starts to get larger the thing just
 

957
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,320
starts to get larger the thing just
falls apart so many companies found that

958
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,330
falls apart so many companies found that
 

959
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,970
falls apart so many companies found that
the stuff just didn't work and they were

960
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:50,980
the stuff just didn't work and they were
 

961
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
the stuff just didn't work and they were
spending tons of money on consultants to

962
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:52,990
spending tons of money on consultants to
 

963
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,960
spending tons of money on consultants to
try to make it work and

964
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:55,970
try to make it work and
 

965
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,310
try to make it work and
there were you know other practical

966
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:57,320
there were you know other practical
 

967
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,260
there were you know other practical
reasons like you know they they were

968
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,270
reasons like you know they they were
 

969
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,600
reasons like you know they they were
asking the companies to buy incredibly

970
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:01,610
asking the companies to buy incredibly
 

971
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,070
asking the companies to buy incredibly
expensive lisp machine workstations

972
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,080
expensive lisp machine workstations
 

973
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,010
expensive lisp machine workstations
which were literally between fifty and a

974
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,020
which were literally between fifty and a
 

975
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,860
which were literally between fifty and a
hundred thousand dollars in you know in

976
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:11,870
hundred thousand dollars in you know in
 

977
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,290
hundred thousand dollars in you know in
1980s money which was would be like

978
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:14,300
1980s money which was would be like
 

979
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,240
1980s money which was would be like
between a hundred and fifty and three

980
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,250
between a hundred and fifty and three
 

981
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,960
between a hundred and fifty and three
hundred thousand dollars per workstation

982
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:18,970
hundred thousand dollars per workstation
 

983
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,490
hundred thousand dollars per workstation
in current prices so then the bottom

984
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:21,500
in current prices so then the bottom
 

985
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,860
in current prices so then the bottom
line they weren't seeing a profit from

986
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:23,870
line they weren't seeing a profit from
 

987
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,820
line they weren't seeing a profit from
it yeah

988
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:24,830
it yeah
 

989
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,400
it yeah
they in many cases I think there were

990
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,410
they in many cases I think there were
 

991
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,110
they in many cases I think there were
some successes there's no doubt about

992
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
some successes there's no doubt about
 

993
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,830
some successes there's no doubt about
that but people I would say over

994
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:32,840
that but people I would say over
 

995
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,040
that but people I would say over
invested every major company was

996
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,050
invested every major company was
 

997
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,090
invested every major company was
starting an AI department just like now

998
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:40,100

 

999
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,570

and I worry a bit that we might see

1000
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:42,580
and I worry a bit that we might see
 

1001
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,840
and I worry a bit that we might see
similar disappointments not because the

1002
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:45,850
similar disappointments not because the
 

1003
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,120
similar disappointments not because the
technology is invalid but it's limited

1004
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,130
technology is invalid but it's limited
 

1005
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,060
technology is invalid but it's limited
in its scope and it's almost the the

1006
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,070
in its scope and it's almost the the
 

1007
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,390
in its scope and it's almost the the
dual of the you know the scope problems

1008
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
dual of the you know the scope problems
 

1009
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,990
dual of the you know the scope problems
that expert systems had so what have you

1010
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
that expert systems had so what have you
 

1011
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,670
that expert systems had so what have you
learned from that hype cycle and what

1012
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:03,680
learned from that hype cycle and what
 

1013
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,920
learned from that hype cycle and what
can we do to prevent another winter for

1014
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:05,930
can we do to prevent another winter for
 

1015
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,520
can we do to prevent another winter for
example yeah so when I'm giving talks

1016
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,530
example yeah so when I'm giving talks
 

1017
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,560
example yeah so when I'm giving talks
these days that's one of the warnings

1018
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:11,570
these days that's one of the warnings
 

1019
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:16,480
these days that's one of the warnings
that I give to to pot warning slide one

1020
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,490
that I give to to pot warning slide one
 

1021
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,510
that I give to to pot warning slide one
is that you know rather than data being

1022
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
is that you know rather than data being
 

1023
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,930
is that you know rather than data being
the new oil data is the new snake oil

1024
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:21,940
the new oil data is the new snake oil
 

1025
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,200
the new oil data is the new snake oil
that's a good line and then and then the

1026
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,210
that's a good line and then and then the
 

1027
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:32,380
that's a good line and then and then the
other is that we might see a kind of

1028
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,390
other is that we might see a kind of
 

1029
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,330
other is that we might see a kind of
very visible failure in some of the

1030
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:34,340
very visible failure in some of the
 

1031
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,770
very visible failure in some of the
major application areas and I think

1032
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:35,780
major application areas and I think
 

1033
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,010
major application areas and I think
self-driving cars would be the flagship

1034
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,020
self-driving cars would be the flagship
 

1035
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:45,169
self-driving cars would be the flagship
and I think when you look at the history

1036
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:45,179
and I think when you look at the history
 

1037
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,230
and I think when you look at the history
so the first self-driving car was on the

1038
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
so the first self-driving car was on the
 

1039
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,700
so the first self-driving car was on the
freeway driving itself changing lanes

1040
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:52,710
freeway driving itself changing lanes
 

1041
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:59,750
freeway driving itself changing lanes
overtaking in 1987 and so it's more than

1042
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
overtaking in 1987 and so it's more than
 

1043
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,500
overtaking in 1987 and so it's more than
30 years and that kind of looks like

1044
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:03,510
30 years and that kind of looks like
 

1045
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,940
30 years and that kind of looks like
where we are today right you know

1046
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:04,950
where we are today right you know
 

1047
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,400
where we are today right you know
prototypes on the freeway changing lanes

1048
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,410
prototypes on the freeway changing lanes
 

1049
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:12,169
prototypes on the freeway changing lanes
and overtaking now I think significant

1050
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:12,179
and overtaking now I think significant
 

1051
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,000
and overtaking now I think significant
progress has been made particularly on

1052
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,010
progress has been made particularly on
 

1053
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,030
progress has been made particularly on
the perception side so we worked a lot

1054
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,040
the perception side so we worked a lot
 

1055
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,000
the perception side so we worked a lot
on autonomous vehicles in the early mid

1056
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,010
on autonomous vehicles in the early mid
 

1057
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,970
on autonomous vehicles in the early mid
90s at Berkley you know and we had our

1058
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:22,980
90s at Berkley you know and we had our
 

1059
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,370
90s at Berkley you know and we had our
own big demonstrations you know we we

1060
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:25,380
own big demonstrations you know we we
 

1061
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,919
own big demonstrations you know we we
put congressmen into yourself driving

1062
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:27,929
put congressmen into yourself driving
 

1063
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:30,140
put congressmen into yourself driving
cars and and had them zooming along the

1064
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,150
cars and and had them zooming along the
 

1065
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,190
cars and and had them zooming along the
freeway

1066
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,200
freeway
 

1067
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,259
freeway
and the problem was clearly perception

1068
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:36,269
and the problem was clearly perception
 

1069
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:39,180
and the problem was clearly perception
at the time the problem that perception

1070
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,190
at the time the problem that perception
 

1071
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,359
at the time the problem that perception
yeah so in simulation with perfect

1072
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:42,369
yeah so in simulation with perfect
 

1073
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:44,220
yeah so in simulation with perfect
perception you could actually show that

1074
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,230
perception you could actually show that
 

1075
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,080
perception you could actually show that
you can drive safely for a long time

1076
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,090
you can drive safely for a long time
 

1077
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,639
you can drive safely for a long time
even if the other cars are misbehaving

1078
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:47,649
even if the other cars are misbehaving
 

1079
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:51,749
even if the other cars are misbehaving
and and so on but simultaneously we

1080
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:51,759
and and so on but simultaneously we
 

1081
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,869
and and so on but simultaneously we
worked on machine vision for detecting

1082
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:54,879
worked on machine vision for detecting
 

1083
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:57,599
worked on machine vision for detecting
cars and tracking pedestrians and so on

1084
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:57,609
cars and tracking pedestrians and so on
 

1085
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:01,590
cars and tracking pedestrians and so on
and we couldn't get the reliability of

1086
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
and we couldn't get the reliability of
 

1087
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,779
and we couldn't get the reliability of
detection and tracking up to a high

1088
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:03,789
detection and tracking up to a high
 

1089
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:06,779
detection and tracking up to a high
enough particular level particularly in

1090
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:06,789
enough particular level particularly in
 

1091
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:10,710
enough particular level particularly in
bad weather conditions nighttime

1092
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
bad weather conditions nighttime
 

1093
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,989
bad weather conditions nighttime
rainfall good enough for demos but

1094
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:12,999
rainfall good enough for demos but
 

1095
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:14,609
rainfall good enough for demos but
perhaps not good enough to cover the

1096
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:14,619
perhaps not good enough to cover the
 

1097
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,859
perhaps not good enough to cover the
general the general yeah the thing about

1098
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:16,869
general the general yeah the thing about
 

1099
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:18,690
general the general yeah the thing about
driving is you know suppose you're a

1100
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:18,700
driving is you know suppose you're a
 

1101
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,460
driving is you know suppose you're a
taxi driver you know and you drive every

1102
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:20,470
taxi driver you know and you drive every
 

1103
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,169
taxi driver you know and you drive every
day eight hours a day for ten years

1104
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:22,179
day eight hours a day for ten years
 

1105
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:25,139
day eight hours a day for ten years
right that's a hundred million seconds

1106
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:25,149
right that's a hundred million seconds
 

1107
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,299
right that's a hundred million seconds
of driving you know and any one of those

1108
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:27,309
of driving you know and any one of those
 

1109
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:29,879
of driving you know and any one of those
seconds you can make a fatal mistake so

1110
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:29,889
seconds you can make a fatal mistake so
 

1111
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:32,580
seconds you can make a fatal mistake so
you're talking about eight nines of

1112
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:32,590
you're talking about eight nines of
 

1113
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,909
you're talking about eight nines of
reliability right now if your vision

1114
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:35,919
reliability right now if your vision
 

1115
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,029
reliability right now if your vision
system only detects ninety eight point

1116
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
system only detects ninety eight point
 

1117
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,450
system only detects ninety eight point
three percent of the vehicles right and

1118
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:42,460
three percent of the vehicles right and
 

1119
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,310
three percent of the vehicles right and
that's sort of you know one on a bit

1120
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
that's sort of you know one on a bit
 

1121
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,919
that's sort of you know one on a bit
nines and reliability so you have

1122
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:46,929
nines and reliability so you have
 

1123
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:49,200
nines and reliability so you have
another seven orders of magnitude to go

1124
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,210
another seven orders of magnitude to go
 

1125
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,399
another seven orders of magnitude to go
and and this is what people don't

1126
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:53,409
and and this is what people don't
 

1127
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:55,529
and and this is what people don't
understand they think oh because I had a

1128
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:55,539
understand they think oh because I had a
 

1129
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:59,039
understand they think oh because I had a
successful demo I'm pretty much done but

1130
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,049
successful demo I'm pretty much done but
 

1131
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:01,200
successful demo I'm pretty much done but
you know you're not even within seven

1132
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,210
you know you're not even within seven
 

1133
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,210
you know you're not even within seven
orders of magnitude of being done and

1134
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:05,220
orders of magnitude of being done and
 

1135
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,669
orders of magnitude of being done and
that's the difficulty and it's it's not

1136
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:08,679
that's the difficulty and it's it's not
 

1137
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,399
that's the difficulty and it's it's not
there can I follow a white line that's

1138
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:11,409
there can I follow a white line that's
 

1139
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:13,979
there can I follow a white line that's
not the problem right we follow a white

1140
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:13,989
not the problem right we follow a white
 

1141
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,280
not the problem right we follow a white
line all the way across the country

1142
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,290
line all the way across the country
 

1143
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,700
line all the way across the country
but it's the it's the weird stuff that

1144
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:19,710
but it's the it's the weird stuff that
 

1145
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,190
but it's the it's the weird stuff that
happens it's some of the edge cases yeah

1146
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,200
happens it's some of the edge cases yeah
 

1147
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,050
happens it's some of the edge cases yeah
the edge case other drivers doing weird

1148
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:24,060
the edge case other drivers doing weird
 

1149
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,860
the edge case other drivers doing weird
things you know so if you talk to Google

1150
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:27,870
things you know so if you talk to Google
 

1151
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,010
things you know so if you talk to Google
right so they had actually very

1152
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,020
right so they had actually very
 

1153
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,220
right so they had actually very
classical architecture where you know

1154
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,230
classical architecture where you know
 

1155
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,870
classical architecture where you know
you had machine vision which would

1156
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:35,880
you had machine vision which would
 

1157
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,210
you had machine vision which would
detect all the other cars and

1158
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,220
detect all the other cars and
 

1159
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,130
detect all the other cars and
pedestrians and the white lines and the

1160
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,140
pedestrians and the white lines and the
 

1161
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,860
pedestrians and the white lines and the
road signs and then basically that was

1162
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:42,870
road signs and then basically that was
 

1163
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,710
road signs and then basically that was
fed into a logical database and then you

1164
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:45,720
fed into a logical database and then you
 

1165
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,070
fed into a logical database and then you
had a classical 1970s rule-based expert

1166
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,080
had a classical 1970s rule-based expert
 

1167
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,510
had a classical 1970s rule-based expert
system telling you okay if you're in the

1168
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
system telling you okay if you're in the
 

1169
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,160
system telling you okay if you're in the
middle lane and there's a bicyclist in

1170
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,170
middle lane and there's a bicyclist in
 

1171
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,660
middle lane and there's a bicyclist in
the right lane who is signaling this

1172
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:56,670
the right lane who is signaling this
 

1173
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,430
the right lane who is signaling this
then then then don't need to do that

1174
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,440
then then then don't need to do that
 

1175
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,490
then then then don't need to do that
yeah right and what they found was that

1176
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:01,500
yeah right and what they found was that
 

1177
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,740
yeah right and what they found was that
every day they go out and there'd be

1178
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:03,750
every day they go out and there'd be
 

1179
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,480
every day they go out and there'd be
another situation that the rules didn't

1180
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:05,490
another situation that the rules didn't
 

1181
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,040
another situation that the rules didn't
cover you know so they they come to a

1182
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,050
cover you know so they they come to a
 

1183
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,050
cover you know so they they come to a
traffic circle and there's a little girl

1184
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,060
traffic circle and there's a little girl
 

1185
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,060
traffic circle and there's a little girl
riding a bicycle the wrong way around a

1186
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,070
riding a bicycle the wrong way around a
 

1187
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,530
riding a bicycle the wrong way around a
traffic circle okay what do you do we

1188
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:12,540
traffic circle okay what do you do we
 

1189
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,159
traffic circle okay what do you do we
don't have a rule oh my god okay stop

1190
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:16,169
don't have a rule oh my god okay stop
 

1191
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:17,899
don't have a rule oh my god okay stop
and then you know they come back and had

1192
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:17,909
and then you know they come back and had
 

1193
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:19,549
and then you know they come back and had
more rules and they just found that this

1194
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:19,559
more rules and they just found that this
 

1195
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,290
more rules and they just found that this
was not really converging

1196
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:22,300
was not really converging
 

1197
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,900
was not really converging
and and if you think about it right how

1198
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:24,910
and and if you think about it right how
 

1199
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,810
and and if you think about it right how
how do you deal with an unexpected

1200
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:27,820
how do you deal with an unexpected
 

1201
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,050
how do you deal with an unexpected
situation meaning one that you've never

1202
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,060
situation meaning one that you've never
 

1203
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,460
situation meaning one that you've never
previously encountered and the sort of

1204
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:32,470
previously encountered and the sort of
 

1205
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,360
previously encountered and the sort of
the the reasoning required to figure out

1206
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,370
the the reasoning required to figure out
 

1207
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,890
the the reasoning required to figure out
the solution for that situation has

1208
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:37,900
the solution for that situation has
 

1209
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,280
the solution for that situation has
never been done it doesn't match any

1210
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,290
never been done it doesn't match any
 

1211
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,750
never been done it doesn't match any
previous situation in terms of the kind

1212
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:42,760
previous situation in terms of the kind
 

1213
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,240
previous situation in terms of the kind
of reasoning you have to do well you

1214
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,250
of reasoning you have to do well you
 

1215
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,190
of reasoning you have to do well you
know in chess programs this happens all

1216
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
know in chess programs this happens all
 

1217
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,780
know in chess programs this happens all
the time

1218
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:47,790
the time
 

1219
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,220
the time
you're constantly coming up with

1220
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,230
you're constantly coming up with
 

1221
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,160
you're constantly coming up with
situations you haven't seen before and

1222
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,170
situations you haven't seen before and
 

1223
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,570
situations you haven't seen before and
you have to reason about them you have

1224
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:54,580
you have to reason about them you have
 

1225
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,550
you have to reason about them you have
to think about okay here are the

1226
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:56,560
to think about okay here are the
 

1227
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,500
to think about okay here are the
possible things I could do here the

1228
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,510
possible things I could do here the
 

1229
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,630
possible things I could do here the
outcomes here's how desirable the

1230
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
outcomes here's how desirable the
 

1231
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,460
outcomes here's how desirable the
outcomes are and then pick the right one

1232
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,470
outcomes are and then pick the right one
 

1233
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,650
outcomes are and then pick the right one
you know in the 90s we were saying okay

1234
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:04,660
you know in the 90s we were saying okay
 

1235
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,750
you know in the 90s we were saying okay
this is how you're gonna have to do

1236
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
this is how you're gonna have to do
 

1237
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,860
this is how you're gonna have to do
automated vehicles they're gonna have to

1238
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:07,870
automated vehicles they're gonna have to
 

1239
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,350
automated vehicles they're gonna have to
have a look ahead capability but the

1240
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:10,360
have a look ahead capability but the
 

1241
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,330
have a look ahead capability but the
look ahead for driving is more difficult

1242
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:12,340
look ahead for driving is more difficult
 

1243
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,000
look ahead for driving is more difficult
than it is for chess because Huysmans

1244
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,010
than it is for chess because Huysmans
 

1245
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,040
than it is for chess because Huysmans
the other right there's humans and

1246
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,050
the other right there's humans and
 

1247
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,680
the other right there's humans and
they're less predictable than just a

1248
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:19,690
they're less predictable than just a
 

1249
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,540
they're less predictable than just a
standard well then will you have an

1250
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:21,550
standard well then will you have an
 

1251
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,910
standard well then will you have an
opponent in chess who's also somewhat

1252
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:23,920
opponent in chess who's also somewhat
 

1253
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,260
opponent in chess who's also somewhat
unpredictable but for example in chess

1254
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,270
unpredictable but for example in chess
 

1255
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,910
unpredictable but for example in chess
you always know the opponent's intention

1256
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:29,920
you always know the opponent's intention
 

1257
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,040
you always know the opponent's intention
they're trying to beat you right whereas

1258
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,050
they're trying to beat you right whereas
 

1259
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,500
they're trying to beat you right whereas
in driving you don't know is this guy

1260
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:34,510
in driving you don't know is this guy
 

1261
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,570
in driving you don't know is this guy
trying to turn left or has he just

1262
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:36,580
trying to turn left or has he just
 

1263
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,940
trying to turn left or has he just
forgotten to turn off his tone signal or

1264
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:38,950
forgotten to turn off his tone signal or
 

1265
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,090
forgotten to turn off his tone signal or
is he drunk or is he you know changing

1266
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,100
is he drunk or is he you know changing
 

1267
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,070
is he drunk or is he you know changing
the channel on his radio or whatever it

1268
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
the channel on his radio or whatever it
 

1269
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
the channel on his radio or whatever it
might be you got to try and figure out

1270
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,090
might be you got to try and figure out
 

1271
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,160
might be you got to try and figure out
the mental state the intent of the other

1272
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,170
the mental state the intent of the other
 

1273
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,080
the mental state the intent of the other
drivers to forecast the possible

1274
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,090
drivers to forecast the possible
 

1275
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,290
drivers to forecast the possible
evolutions of their trajectories and

1276
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:54,300
evolutions of their trajectories and
 

1277
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,670
evolutions of their trajectories and
then you've got to figure out okay which

1278
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:56,680
then you've got to figure out okay which
 

1279
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,500
then you've got to figure out okay which
is the directory for me that's going to

1280
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,510
is the directory for me that's going to
 

1281
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,770
is the directory for me that's going to
be safest and those all interact with

1282
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:01,780
be safest and those all interact with
 

1283
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,780
be safest and those all interact with
each other because the other drivers

1284
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:03,790
each other because the other drivers
 

1285
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,960
each other because the other drivers
going to react to your trajectory and so

1286
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:06,970
going to react to your trajectory and so
 

1287
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,190
going to react to your trajectory and so
on so you know they've got the classic

1288
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,200
on so you know they've got the classic
 

1289
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,290
on so you know they've got the classic
merging onto the freeway a problem where

1290
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:10,300
merging onto the freeway a problem where
 

1291
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,380
merging onto the freeway a problem where
you're kind of racing a vehicle that's

1292
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:13,390
you're kind of racing a vehicle that's
 

1293
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,940
you're kind of racing a vehicle that's
already on the freeway and you are you

1294
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:14,950
already on the freeway and you are you
 

1295
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,200
already on the freeway and you are you
gonna pull ahead of them or you're gonna

1296
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,210
gonna pull ahead of them or you're gonna
 

1297
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,150
gonna pull ahead of them or you're gonna
let them go first and pull in behind and

1298
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:18,160
let them go first and pull in behind and
 

1299
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,280
let them go first and pull in behind and
you get this sort of uncertainty about

1300
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,290
you get this sort of uncertainty about
 

1301
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,740
you get this sort of uncertainty about
who's going first

1302
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:21,750
who's going first
 

1303
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,450
who's going first
so all those kinds of things

1304
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:25,460
so all those kinds of things
 

1305
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,410
so all those kinds of things
mean that you need decision-making

1306
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:29,420
mean that you need decision-making
 

1307
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,550
mean that you need decision-making
architecture that's very different from

1308
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,560
architecture that's very different from
 

1309
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,430
architecture that's very different from
either a rule-based system or it seems

1310
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:36,440
either a rule-based system or it seems
 

1311
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,050
either a rule-based system or it seems
to me a kind of an end-to-end neural

1312
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,060
to me a kind of an end-to-end neural
 

1313
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,960
to me a kind of an end-to-end neural
network system you know so just as

1314
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:40,970
network system you know so just as
 

1315
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,660
network system you know so just as
alphago is pretty good when it doesn't

1316
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:43,670
alphago is pretty good when it doesn't
 

1317
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,700
alphago is pretty good when it doesn't
do any look ahead but it's way way way

1318
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:45,710
do any look ahead but it's way way way
 

1319
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,480
do any look ahead but it's way way way
way better when it does I think the same

1320
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:49,490
way better when it does I think the same
 

1321
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,980
way better when it does I think the same
is going to be true for driving you can

1322
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:50,990
is going to be true for driving you can
 

1323
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,400
is going to be true for driving you can
have a driving system that's pretty good

1324
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,410
have a driving system that's pretty good
 

1325
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,900
have a driving system that's pretty good
when it doesn't do any look ahead but

1326
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:55,910
when it doesn't do any look ahead but
 

1327
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,690
when it doesn't do any look ahead but
that's not good enough you know and

1328
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:58,700
that's not good enough you know and
 

1329
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,790
that's not good enough you know and
we've already seen multiple deaths

1330
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:00,800
we've already seen multiple deaths
 

1331
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,140
we've already seen multiple deaths
caused by poorly designed machine

1332
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,150
caused by poorly designed machine
 

1333
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,540
caused by poorly designed machine
learning algorithms that don't really

1334
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:07,550
learning algorithms that don't really
 

1335
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,000
learning algorithms that don't really
understand what they're doing yeah and

1336
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,010
understand what they're doing yeah and
 

1337
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,790
understand what they're doing yeah and
on several levels I think it's on the

1338
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:12,800
on several levels I think it's on the
 

1339
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,760
on several levels I think it's on the
perception side there's mistakes being

1340
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:15,770
perception side there's mistakes being
 

1341
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,410
perception side there's mistakes being
made by those algorithms were the

1342
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:17,420
made by those algorithms were the
 

1343
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,540
made by those algorithms were the
perception is very shallow on the

1346
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,230
planning side to look ahead like you
 

1347
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,850
planning side to look ahead like you
said and the thing that we come come up

1348
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:24,860
said and the thing that we come come up
 

1349
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,770
said and the thing that we come come up
against that's really interesting when

1350
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:29,780
against that's really interesting when
 

1351
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,600
against that's really interesting when
you try to deploy systems in the real

1352
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:31,610
you try to deploy systems in the real
 

1353
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,120
you try to deploy systems in the real
world is you can't think of an

1354
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,130
world is you can't think of an
 

1355
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,590
world is you can't think of an
artificial intelligence system as a

1356
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
artificial intelligence system as a
 

1357
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,690
artificial intelligence system as a
thing that responds to the world always

1358
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:37,700
thing that responds to the world always
 

1359
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,150
thing that responds to the world always
you have to realize that it's an agent

1360
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,160
you have to realize that it's an agent
 

1361
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,520
you have to realize that it's an agent
that others will respond to as well so

1362
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:42,530
that others will respond to as well so
 

1363
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,920
that others will respond to as well so
in order to drive successfully you can't

1364
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:44,930
in order to drive successfully you can't
 

1365
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:48,040
in order to drive successfully you can't
just try to do obstacle avoidance you

1366
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,050
just try to do obstacle avoidance you
 

1367
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,260
just try to do obstacle avoidance you
can't pretend that you're invisible

1368
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:49,270
can't pretend that you're invisible
 

1369
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,520
can't pretend that you're invisible
thank you right you're the invisible car

1370
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:51,530
thank you right you're the invisible car
 

1371
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,400
thank you right you're the invisible car
right just look that way I mean but you

1372
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,410
right just look that way I mean but you
 

1373
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,260
right just look that way I mean but you
have to assert yet others have to be

1374
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:56,270
have to assert yet others have to be
 

1375
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,600
have to assert yet others have to be
scared of you just we're all there's

1376
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:58,610
scared of you just we're all there's
 

1377
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,050
scared of you just we're all there's
this tension there's this game so if we

1378
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,060
this tension there's this game so if we
 

1379
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,670
this tension there's this game so if we
studied a lot of work with pedestrians

1380
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:03,680
studied a lot of work with pedestrians
 

1381
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,030
studied a lot of work with pedestrians
if you approach pedestrians as purely an

1382
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,040
if you approach pedestrians as purely an
 

1383
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,100
if you approach pedestrians as purely an
obstacle avoidance so you either doing

1384
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,110
obstacle avoidance so you either doing
 

1385
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,990
obstacle avoidance so you either doing
look ahead isn't modeling the intent

1386
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,000
look ahead isn't modeling the intent
 

1387
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,720
look ahead isn't modeling the intent
that you're you they're not going to

1388
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:13,730
that you're you they're not going to
 

1389
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,130
that you're you they're not going to
they're going to take advantage of you

1390
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,140
they're going to take advantage of you
 

1391
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,450
they're going to take advantage of you
they're not going to respect you at all

1392
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:16,460
they're not going to respect you at all
 

1393
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,720
they're not going to respect you at all
there has to be a tension a fear some

1394
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:19,730
there has to be a tension a fear some
 

1395
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,900
there has to be a tension a fear some
amount of uncertainty that's how we have

1396
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:22,910
amount of uncertainty that's how we have
 

1397
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,930
amount of uncertainty that's how we have
create we or at least just a kind of a

1398
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:25,940
create we or at least just a kind of a
 

1399
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,600
create we or at least just a kind of a
resoluteness right so you have you have

1400
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:28,610
resoluteness right so you have you have
 

1401
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,920
resoluteness right so you have you have
to display a certain amount of

1402
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:29,930
to display a certain amount of
 

1403
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,540
to display a certain amount of
resoluteness you can't you can't be too

1404
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:31,550
resoluteness you can't you can't be too
 

1405
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,090
resoluteness you can't you can't be too
tentative

1406
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,100
tentative
 

1407
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,550
tentative
and yeah so the right the the solutions

1408
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:38,560
and yeah so the right the the solutions
 

1409
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,920
and yeah so the right the the solutions
then become pretty complicated right you

1410
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:40,930
then become pretty complicated right you
 

1411
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,880
then become pretty complicated right you
get into game theoretic yes analyses and

1412
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:43,890
get into game theoretic yes analyses and
 

1413
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,380
get into game theoretic yes analyses and
so we're you know Berkeley now we're

1414
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:46,390
so we're you know Berkeley now we're
 

1415
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,320
so we're you know Berkeley now we're
working a lot on this kind of

1416
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,330
working a lot on this kind of
 

1417
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,470
working a lot on this kind of
interaction between machines and humans

1418
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:51,480
interaction between machines and humans
 

1419
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,170
interaction between machines and humans
and that's exciting yeah and so my

1420
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:55,180
and that's exciting yeah and so my
 

1421
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:00,750
and that's exciting yeah and so my
colleague and could drag an actually you

1422
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:00,760
colleague and could drag an actually you
 

1423
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,330
colleague and could drag an actually you
know if you if you formulate the problem

1424
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:03,340
know if you if you formulate the problem
 

1425
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,220
know if you if you formulate the problem
game theoretically and you just let the

1426
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:05,230
game theoretically and you just let the
 

1427
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,770
game theoretically and you just let the
system figure out the solution you know

1428
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:07,780
system figure out the solution you know
 

1429
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,750
system figure out the solution you know
it does interesting unexpected things

1430
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
it does interesting unexpected things
 

1431
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,700
it does interesting unexpected things
like sometimes at a stop sign

1432
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:11,710
like sometimes at a stop sign

if no one is going first right the car

1434
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:16,390
if no one is going first right the car
 

1435
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,810
if no one is going first right the car
will actually back up a little all right

1436
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:18,820
will actually back up a little all right
 

1437
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,030
will actually back up a little all right
and just to indicate to the other cars

1438
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,040
and just to indicate to the other cars
 

1439
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,610
and just to indicate to the other cars
that they should go and that's something

1440
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:23,620
that they should go and that's something
 

1441
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,380

safety we'll talk about greater and
greater intelligence do you see that

1500
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:53,220
greater intelligence do you see that
 

1501
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,520
greater intelligence do you see that
there in when you created the earth

1502
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,530
there in when you created the earth

00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,230
there in when you created the earth

Allah program and you felt this
 

1505
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,100

excitement
 

1507
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,409

what was that excitement was it

1508
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:00,419
what was that excitement was it
 

1509
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,270
what was that excitement was it
excitement of a tinkerer who created

being born that yeah you know yeah so I
 

1517
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,669
being born that yeah you know yeah so I
mean I certainly understand that

00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:13,679
mean I certainly understand that
 

1519
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,599
mean I certainly understand that
viewpoint and if you look at the light

1520
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:17,609
viewpoint and if you look at the light

he'll report which was commit so in the
 

1523
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,510

70s there was a lot of controversy in

1524

70s there was a lot of controversy in
 

1525
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,750
70s there was a lot of controversy in
the UK about AI and you know whether it

1526
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:26,760
the UK about AI and you know whether it
 

1527
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,820
the UK about AI and you know whether it
was for real and how much the money

1528
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:28,830
was for real and how much the money
 

1529
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,080
was for real and how much the money
money the government should invest and

1530

1531
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,760

there was a lot long story but the

1532
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:34,770
there was a lot long story but the
 

1533
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,340
there was a lot long story but the
government commissioned a report by

1534
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:38,350
government commissioned a report by
 

1535
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,060
government commissioned a report by

wrote a very damning report about AI

1538
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:44,590
wrote a very damning report about AI
 

1539
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,710
wrote a very damning report about AI
which I think was the point and he said

1540
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:49,720
which I think was the point and he said
 

1541
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,220
which I think was the point and he said
that that these are you know frustrated

know which I which I think is really
 

1551
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:12,460
know which I which I think is really
pretty unfair

but there is I mean there there is a
 

1555
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,210
but there is I mean there there is a
kind of magic I would say you when you

1556
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:20,220
kind of magic I would say you when you
 

1557
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,150
kind of magic I would say you when you
you build something

1559
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,380

and what you're building in is really

1560
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,390
and what you're building in is really
 

1561
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,880
and what you're building in is really
just you're building in some

1562
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:28,890
just you're building in some
 

1563
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,620
just you're building in some
understanding of the principles of

understanding of the principles of
 

1565
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,240
understanding of the principles of
learning and decision-making and to see

1566
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,250
learning and decision-making and to see
 

1567
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,599
learning and decision-making and to see
those principles actually then turn into

1568
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:38,609
those principles actually then turn into
 

1569
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:43,130
those principles actually then turn into

intelligent behavior in in specific
 

1571
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,880
intelligent behavior in in specific
situations it's an incredible thing and

1573
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:55,880

you know that is naturally going to make
you think okay where does this end and

1576
00:35:59,690 --> 00:35:59,700
you think okay where does this end and
 

1577
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,859
you think okay where does this end and
so there's a there's magical optimistic

1578
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:03,869
so there's a there's magical optimistic
 

1579
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:07,370
so there's a there's magical optimistic
views of word and whatever your view of

1580
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:07,380
views of word and whatever your view of
 

1581
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,680
views of word and whatever your view of
optimism is whatever your view of utopia

1582
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:09,690
optimism is whatever your view of utopia
 

1583
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,480
optimism is whatever your view of utopia
is it's probably different for everybody

1584
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,490
is it's probably different for everybody
 

1585
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,950
is it's probably different for everybody
yeah but you've often talked about

1586
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:14,960
yeah but you've often talked about
 

1587
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,420
yeah but you've often talked about
concerns you have of how things might go

1588
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:17,430
concerns you have of how things might go
 

1589
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:25,059
concerns you have of how things might go
wrong so I've talked to max tegmark

1590
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:25,069
wrong so I've talked to max tegmark
 

1591
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:27,380
wrong so I've talked to max tegmark
there's a lot of interesting ways to

1592
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:27,390
there's a lot of interesting ways to
 

1593
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,510
there's a lot of interesting ways to
think about AI safety you're one of the

1594
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
think about AI safety you're one of the
 

1595
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,559
think about AI safety you're one of the
seminal people thinking about this

1596
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:33,569
seminal people thinking about this
 

1597
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:35,270
seminal people thinking about this
problem among sort of being in the weeds

1598
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
problem among sort of being in the weeds
 

1599
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,440
problem among sort of being in the weeds
of actually solving specific AI problems

1600
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,450
of actually solving specific AI problems
 

1601
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,849
of actually solving specific AI problems
you also think about the big picture of

1602
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:40,859
you also think about the big picture of
 

1603
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,940
you also think about the big picture of
where we're going so can you talk about

1604
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:43,950
where we're going so can you talk about
 

1605
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,920
where we're going so can you talk about
several elements of it let's just talk

1606
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:45,930
several elements of it let's just talk
 

1607
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,230
several elements of it let's just talk
about maybe the control problem so this

1608
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
about maybe the control problem so this
 

1609
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,089
about maybe the control problem so this
idea of losing ability to control the

1610
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:53,099
idea of losing ability to control the
 

1611
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:57,349
idea of losing ability to control the
behavior and of a AI system so how do

1612
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
behavior and of a AI system so how do
 

1613
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,299
behavior and of a AI system so how do
you see that how do you see that coming

1614
00:36:59,299 --> 00:36:59,309
you see that how do you see that coming
 

1615
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:04,069
you see that how do you see that coming
about what do you think we can do to

1616
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
about what do you think we can do to
 

1617
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,599
about what do you think we can do to
manage it well so it doesn't take a

1618
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:08,609
manage it well so it doesn't take a
 

1619
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:10,430
manage it well so it doesn't take a
genius to realize that if you make

1620
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:10,440
genius to realize that if you make
 

1621
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,720
genius to realize that if you make
something that's smarter than you you

1622
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:11,730
something that's smarter than you you
 

1623
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,460
something that's smarter than you you
might have a problem you know in Turing

1624
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:15,470
might have a problem you know in Turing
 

1625
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,270
might have a problem you know in Turing
Alan Turing you know wrote about the

1626
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,280
Alan Turing you know wrote about the
 

1627
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,700
Alan Turing you know wrote about the
gave lectures about this you know 19

1628
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:21,710
gave lectures about this you know 19
 

1629
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:27,000
gave lectures about this you know 19
1951 painted a lecture on the radio and

1630
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,010
1951 painted a lecture on the radio and
 

1631
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,700
1951 painted a lecture on the radio and
he basically says you know once the

1632
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:30,710
he basically says you know once the
 

1633
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,600
he basically says you know once the
machine thinking method stops you know

1634
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:34,610
machine thinking method stops you know
 

1635
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,240
machine thinking method stops you know
very quickly they'll outstrip humanity

1636
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:37,250
very quickly they'll outstrip humanity
 

1637
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,500
very quickly they'll outstrip humanity
and you know if we're lucky we might be

1638
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:41,510
and you know if we're lucky we might be
 

1639
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,680
and you know if we're lucky we might be
able to I think he says if we may be

1640
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:44,690
able to I think he says if we may be
 

1641
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,600
able to I think he says if we may be
able to turn off the power at strategic

1642
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:46,610
able to turn off the power at strategic
 

1643
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,330
able to turn off the power at strategic
moments but even so a species would be

1644
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:49,340
moments but even so a species would be
 

1645
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,450
moments but even so a species would be
humbled yeah you can actually I think

1646
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:52,460
humbled yeah you can actually I think
 

1647
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,980
humbled yeah you can actually I think
was wrong about that right here is you

1648
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:53,990
was wrong about that right here is you
 

1649
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,450
was wrong about that right here is you
you know if it's a sufficiently

1650
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:55,460
you know if it's a sufficiently
 

1651
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,800
you know if it's a sufficiently
intelligent machine is not gonna let you

1652
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:56,810
intelligent machine is not gonna let you
 

1653
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,260
intelligent machine is not gonna let you
switch it off so it's actually in

1654
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,270
switch it off so it's actually in
 

1655
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,820
switch it off so it's actually in
competition with you so what do you

1656
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:00,830
competition with you so what do you
 

1657
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,270
competition with you so what do you
think is meant just for a quick tangent

1658
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,280
think is meant just for a quick tangent
 

1659
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,670
think is meant just for a quick tangent
if we shut off this super intelligent

1660
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:06,680
if we shut off this super intelligent
 

1661
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,490
if we shut off this super intelligent
machine that our species will be humbled

1662
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:11,500

 

1663
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,390

I think he means that we would realize

1664
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:15,400
I think he means that we would realize
 

1665
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,230
I think he means that we would realize
that we are inferior right that we we

1666
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:19,240
that we are inferior right that we we
 

1667
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,880
that we are inferior right that we we
only survive by the skin of our teeth

1668
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:20,890
only survive by the skin of our teeth
 

1669
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,650
only survive by the skin of our teeth
because we happen to get to the off

1670
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:22,660
because we happen to get to the off
 

1671
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,040
because we happen to get to the off
switch just in time

1672
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,050
switch just in time
 

1673
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,710
switch just in time
you know and if we hadn't then we would

1674
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:28,720
you know and if we hadn't then we would
 

1675
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,890
you know and if we hadn't then we would
have lost control over the earth

1676
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:30,900
have lost control over the earth
 

1677
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,020
have lost control over the earth
so do you are you more worried when you

1678
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,030
so do you are you more worried when you
 

1679
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,820
so do you are you more worried when you
think about this stuff about super

1680
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:35,830
think about this stuff about super
 

1681
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,830
think about this stuff about super
intelligent AI or are you more worried

1682
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:37,840
intelligent AI or are you more worried
 

1683
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,610
intelligent AI or are you more worried
about super powerful AI that's not

1684
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:41,620
about super powerful AI that's not
 

1685
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,180
about super powerful AI that's not
aligned with our values so the paperclip

1686
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,190
aligned with our values so the paperclip
 

1687
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,290
aligned with our values so the paperclip
scenario is kind of I think so the main

1688
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:49,300
scenario is kind of I think so the main
 

1689
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,980
scenario is kind of I think so the main
problem I'm working on is is the control

1690
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:52,990
problem I'm working on is is the control
 

1691
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,830
problem I'm working on is is the control
problem the the problem of machines

1692
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:55,840
problem the the problem of machines
 

1693
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,160
problem the the problem of machines
pursuing objectives that are as you say

1694
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,170
pursuing objectives that are as you say
 

1695
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,620
pursuing objectives that are as you say
not aligned with human objectives and

1696
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:01,630
not aligned with human objectives and
 

1697
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,220
not aligned with human objectives and
and this has been it has been the way

1698
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:05,230
and this has been it has been the way
 

1699
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,200
and this has been it has been the way
we've thought about I eyes since the

1700
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,210
we've thought about I eyes since the
 

1701
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:12,360
we've thought about I eyes since the
beginning you you build a machine for

1702
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,370
beginning you you build a machine for
 

1703
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,310
beginning you you build a machine for
optimizing and then you put in some

1704
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,320
optimizing and then you put in some
 

1705
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,550
optimizing and then you put in some
objective and it optimizes right and and

1706
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:17,560
objective and it optimizes right and and
 

1707
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,240
objective and it optimizes right and and
you know we we can think of this as the

1708
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,250
you know we we can think of this as the
 

1709
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,390
you know we we can think of this as the
the King Midas problem right because if

1710
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,400
the King Midas problem right because if
 

1711
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,210
the King Midas problem right because if
you know so King Midas put in this

1712
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,220
you know so King Midas put in this
 

1713
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,310
you know so King Midas put in this
objective right everything I touch you

1714
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:29,320
objective right everything I touch you
 

1715
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,800
objective right everything I touch you
turned to gold and the gods you know

1716
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:31,810
turned to gold and the gods you know
 

1717
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,390
turned to gold and the gods you know
that's like the machine they said okay

1718
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:33,400
that's like the machine they said okay
 

1719
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,820
that's like the machine they said okay
done you know you now have this power

1720
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:35,830
done you know you now have this power
 

1721
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,760
done you know you now have this power
and of course his food and his drink and

1722
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:38,770
and of course his food and his drink and
 

1723
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,620
and of course his food and his drink and
his family all turned to gold and then

1724
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:40,630
his family all turned to gold and then
 

1725
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,890
his family all turned to gold and then
he's sighs misery and starvation and

1726
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:43,900
he's sighs misery and starvation and
 

1727
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,970
he's sighs misery and starvation and
this is you know it's it's a warning

1728
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:47,980

you know he saw this and he basically

1764
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:31,619
you know he saw this and he basically
 

1765
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,470
you know he saw this and he basically
extrapolated you know as Turing did and

1766
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:34,480
extrapolated you know as Turing did and
 

1767
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,800
extrapolated you know as Turing did and
said okay this is how we could lose

1768
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:37,810
said okay this is how we could lose
 

1769
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:46,140
said okay this is how we could lose
control and specifically that we have to

1770
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:46,150
control and specifically that we have to
 

1771
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,990
control and specifically that we have to
be certain that the purpose we put into

1772
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,000
be certain that the purpose we put into
 

1773
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,550
be certain that the purpose we put into
the machine as the purpose which we

1774
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:50,560
the machine as the purpose which we
 

1775
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,900
the machine as the purpose which we
really desire and the problem is we

1776
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:54,910
really desire and the problem is we
 

1777
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,500
really desire and the problem is we
can't do that right you mean we're not

1778
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,510
can't do that right you mean we're not
 

1779

can't do that right you mean we're not
it's a very difficult to encode so to

1780
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:01,060
it's a very difficult to encode so to
 

1781
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,790
it's a very difficult to encode so to
put our values on paper is really

1782
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:02,800
put our values on paper is really
 

1783
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,920
put our values on paper is really
difficult or you're just saying it's

1784
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:04,930
difficult or you're just saying it's
 

1785
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:10,980
difficult or you're just saying it's
impossible your line is writing this so

1786
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:10,990
impossible your line is writing this so
 

1787
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,550
impossible your line is writing this so
it's it theoretically it's possible but

1788
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:13,560
it's it theoretically it's possible but
 

1789
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,370
it's it theoretically it's possible but
in practice it's extremely unlikely that

1790
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:17,380
in practice it's extremely unlikely that
 

1791
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,609
in practice it's extremely unlikely that
we could specify correctly in advance

1792
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:20,619
we could specify correctly in advance
 

1793
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:24,300
we could specify correctly in advance
the full range of concerns of humanity

1794
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:24,310
the full range of concerns of humanity
 

1795
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,609
the full range of concerns of humanity
that you talked about cultural

1796
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:26,619
that you talked about cultural
 

1797
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,410
that you talked about cultural
transmission of values I think is how

1798
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:28,420
transmission of values I think is how
 

1799
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,420
transmission of values I think is how
humans to human transmission of values

1800
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:30,430
humans to human transmission of values
 

1801
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,300
humans to human transmission of values
happens right what we learned yeah I

1802
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:33,310
happens right what we learned yeah I
 

1803
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,599
happens right what we learned yeah I
mean as we grow up we learn about the

1804
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:36,609
mean as we grow up we learn about the
 

1805
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:39,720
mean as we grow up we learn about the
values that matter how things how things

1806
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:39,730
values that matter how things how things
 

1807
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,120
values that matter how things how things
should go what is reasonable to pursue

1808
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,130
should go what is reasonable to pursue
 

1809
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,090
should go what is reasonable to pursue
and what isn't reasonable to pursue

1810
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,100
and what isn't reasonable to pursue
 

1811
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,349
and what isn't reasonable to pursue
machines can learn in the same kind of

1812
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:46,359
machines can learn in the same kind of
 

1813
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:49,740
machines can learn in the same kind of
way yeah so I think that what we need to

1814
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:49,750
way yeah so I think that what we need to
 

1815
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,800
way yeah so I think that what we need to
do is to get away from this idea that

1816
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:51,810
do is to get away from this idea that
 

1817
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,570
do is to get away from this idea that
you build an optimizing machine and you

1818
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:54,580
you build an optimizing machine and you
 

1819
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,770
you build an optimizing machine and you
put the objective into it

1820
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:56,780
put the objective into it
 

1821
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,600
put the objective into it
because if it's possible that you might

1822
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:01,610
because if it's possible that you might
 

1823
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,460
because if it's possible that you might
put in a wrong objective and we already

1824
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:03,470
put in a wrong objective and we already
 

1825
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,570
put in a wrong objective and we already
know this is possible because it's

1826
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:04,580
know this is possible because it's
 

1827
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,820
know this is possible because it's
happened lots of times alright that

1828
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:06,830
happened lots of times alright that
 

1829
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,690
happened lots of times alright that
means that the machine should never take

1830
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:10,700
means that the machine should never take
 

1831
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,510
means that the machine should never take
an objective that's given as gospel

1832
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
an objective that's given as gospel
 

1833
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,980
an objective that's given as gospel
truth

1834
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:14,990
truth
 

1835
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,410
truth
because once it takes them the the

1836
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:17,420
because once it takes them the the
 

1837
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,100
because once it takes them the the
objective is gospel truth alright then

1838
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,110
objective is gospel truth alright then
 

1839
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,370
objective is gospel truth alright then
it's the leaves that whatever actions

1840
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:24,380
it's the leaves that whatever actions
 

1841
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,800
it's the leaves that whatever actions
it's taking in pursuit of that objective

1842
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:26,810
it's taking in pursuit of that objective
 

1843
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,810
it's taking in pursuit of that objective
are the correct things to do so you

1844
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:28,820
are the correct things to do so you
 

1845
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,340
are the correct things to do so you
could be jumping up and down and saying

1846
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:30,350
could be jumping up and down and saying
 

1847
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,540
could be jumping up and down and saying
no you know no no no you're gonna

1848
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:31,550
no you know no no no you're gonna
 

1849
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,630
no you know no no no you're gonna
destroy the world but the machine knows

1850
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:34,640
destroy the world but the machine knows
 

1851
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,100
destroy the world but the machine knows
what the true objective is and it's

1852
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,110
what the true objective is and it's
 

1853
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,890
what the true objective is and it's
pursuing it and tough luck to you you

1854
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:37,900
pursuing it and tough luck to you you
 

1855
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,200
pursuing it and tough luck to you you
know and this is not restricted to AI

1856
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,210
know and this is not restricted to AI
 

1857
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,900
know and this is not restricted to AI
right this is you know I think many of

1858
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:43,910
right this is you know I think many of
 

1859
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,150
right this is you know I think many of
the 20th century technologies right so

1860
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,160
the 20th century technologies right so
 

1861
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,610
the 20th century technologies right so
in statistics you you minimize a loss

1862
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:48,620
in statistics you you minimize a loss
 

1863
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,720
in statistics you you minimize a loss
function the loss function is

1864
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:49,730
function the loss function is
 

1865
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,120
function the loss function is
exogenously specified in control theory

1866
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:52,130
exogenously specified in control theory
 

1867
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,520
exogenously specified in control theory
you minimize a cost function in

1868
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:54,530
you minimize a cost function in
 

1869
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,140
you minimize a cost function in
operations research you maximize a

1870
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,150
operations research you maximize a
 

1871
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,020
operations research you maximize a
reward function and so on so in all

1872
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,030
reward function and so on so in all
 

1873
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,120
reward function and so on so in all
these disciplines this is how we

1874
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,130
these disciplines this is how we
 

1875
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,180
these disciplines this is how we
conceive of the problem and it's the

1876
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:04,190
conceive of the problem and it's the
 

1877
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,110
conceive of the problem and it's the
wrong problem because we cannot specify

1878
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:08,120
wrong problem because we cannot specify
 

1879
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,320
wrong problem because we cannot specify
with certainty the correct objective

1880
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:11,330
with certainty the correct objective
 

1881
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,950
with certainty the correct objective
right we need uncertainty we the machine

1882
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:14,960
right we need uncertainty we the machine
 

1883
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,650
right we need uncertainty we the machine
to be uncertain about a subjective what

1884
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:17,660
to be uncertain about a subjective what
 

1885
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,900
to be uncertain about a subjective what
it is that it's post it's my favorite

1886

it is that it's post it's my favorite
 

1887
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,060
it is that it's post it's my favorite
idea of yours I've heard you say

1888
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,070
idea of yours I've heard you say
 

1889
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,910
idea of yours I've heard you say
somewhere well I shouldn't pick

1890
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:24,920
somewhere well I shouldn't pick
 

1891
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,680
somewhere well I shouldn't pick
favorites but it just sounds beautiful

1892
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:26,690
favorites but it just sounds beautiful
 

1893
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,970
favorites but it just sounds beautiful
we need to teach machines humility yeah

1894
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:30,980
we need to teach machines humility yeah
 

1895
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,860
we need to teach machines humility yeah
I mean it's a beautiful way to put it I

1896
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:32,870
I mean it's a beautiful way to put it I
 

1897
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:33,940
I mean it's a beautiful way to put it I
love it

1898
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:33,950
love it
 

1899
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:38,050
love it
that they humble oh yeah they know that

1900
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:38,060
that they humble oh yeah they know that
 

1901
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,180
that they humble oh yeah they know that
they don't know what it is they're

1902
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,190
they don't know what it is they're
 

1903
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,830
they don't know what it is they're
supposed to be doing and that those

1904
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:41,840
supposed to be doing and that those
 

1905
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,760
supposed to be doing and that those
those objectives I mean they exist they

1906
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:45,770
those objectives I mean they exist they
 

1907
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,700
those objectives I mean they exist they
are within us but we may not be able to

1908
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:48,710
are within us but we may not be able to
 

1909
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:54,250
are within us but we may not be able to
explicate them we may not even know you

1910
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:54,260
explicate them we may not even know you
 

1911
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,370
explicate them we may not even know you
know how we want our future to go so

1912
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:57,380
know how we want our future to go so
 

1913
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,830
know how we want our future to go so
exactly and the Machine you know a

1914
00:43:59,830 --> 00:43:59,840
exactly and the Machine you know a
 

1915
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,610
exactly and the Machine you know a
machine that's uncertain he's going to

1916
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:03,620
machine that's uncertain he's going to
 

1917
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:07,120
machine that's uncertain he's going to
be deferential to us so if we say don't

1918
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,130
be deferential to us so if we say don't
 

1919
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,010
be deferential to us so if we say don't
do that well now the machines learn

1920
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:09,020
do that well now the machines learn
 

1921
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,410
do that well now the machines learn
something a bit more about our true

1922
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:11,420
something a bit more about our true
 

1923
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,750
something a bit more about our true
objectives because something that it

1924
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:13,760
objectives because something that it
 

1925
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,270
objectives because something that it
thought was reasonable in pursuit of our

1926
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:16,280
thought was reasonable in pursuit of our
 

1927
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,830
thought was reasonable in pursuit of our
objectives turns out not to be so now

1928
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:17,840
objectives turns out not to be so now
 

1929
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,750
objectives turns out not to be so now
it's learn something so it's going to

1930
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:19,760
it's learn something so it's going to
 

1931
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,330
it's learn something so it's going to
defer because it wants to be doing what

1932
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:22,340
defer because it wants to be doing what
 

1933
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,700
defer because it wants to be doing what
we really want

1934
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:23,710
we really want
 

1935
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,470
we really want
and you know that that point I think is

1936
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:28,480
and you know that that point I think is
 

1937
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,020
and you know that that point I think is
absolutely central to solving the

1938
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,030
absolutely central to solving the
 

1939
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,359
absolutely central to solving the
control problem and it's a different

1940
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:33,369
control problem and it's a different
 

1941
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:37,650
control problem and it's a different
kind of AI when you when you take away

1942
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:37,660
kind of AI when you when you take away
 

1943
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,710
kind of AI when you when you take away
this idea that the objective is known

1944
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:39,720
this idea that the objective is known
 

1945
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,319
this idea that the objective is known
then in fact a lot of the theoretical

1946
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:43,329
then in fact a lot of the theoretical
 

1947
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:47,460
then in fact a lot of the theoretical
frameworks that we're so familiar with

1948
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:47,470
frameworks that we're so familiar with
 

1949
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:51,030
frameworks that we're so familiar with
you know Markov decision processes goal

1950
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040
you know Markov decision processes goal
 

1951
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,900
you know Markov decision processes goal
based planning you know standard games

1952
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:54,910
based planning you know standard games
 

1953
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:57,390
based planning you know standard games
research all of these techniques

1954
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:57,400
research all of these techniques
 

1955
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,620
research all of these techniques
actually become inapplicable and you get

1956
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:01,630
actually become inapplicable and you get
 

1957
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,790
actually become inapplicable and you get
a more complicated problem because

1958
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:04,800
a more complicated problem because
 

1959
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,980
a more complicated problem because
because now the interaction with the

1960
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:09,990
because now the interaction with the
 

1961
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,700
because now the interaction with the
human becomes part of the problem

1962
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:13,710
human becomes part of the problem
 

1963
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:18,530
human becomes part of the problem
because the human by making choices is

1964
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:18,540
because the human by making choices is
 

1965
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,530
because the human by making choices is
giving you more information about the

1966
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:21,540
giving you more information about the
 

1967
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,030
giving you more information about the
'true objective and that information

1968
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,040
'true objective and that information
 

1969
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,309
'true objective and that information
helps you achieve the objective better

1970
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:25,319
helps you achieve the objective better
 

1971
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:29,030
helps you achieve the objective better
and so that really means that you're

1972
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,040
and so that really means that you're
 

1973
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,890
and so that really means that you're
mostly dealing with game theoretic

1974
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:30,900
mostly dealing with game theoretic
 

1975
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,930
mostly dealing with game theoretic
problems where you've got the machine

1976
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:32,940
problems where you've got the machine
 

1977
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,040
problems where you've got the machine
and the human and they're coupled

1978
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,050
and the human and they're coupled
 

1979
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,339
and the human and they're coupled
together rather than a machine going off

1980
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:37,349
together rather than a machine going off
 

1981
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:40,040
together rather than a machine going off
by itself with a fixed objective which

1982
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,050
by itself with a fixed objective which
 

1983
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,589
by itself with a fixed objective which
is fascinating on the machine and the

1984
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:42,599
is fascinating on the machine and the
 

1985
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,130
is fascinating on the machine and the
human level that we when you don't have

1986
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:46,140
human level that we when you don't have
 

1987
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,730
human level that we when you don't have
an objective means you're together

1988
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:49,740
an objective means you're together
 

1989
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,770
an objective means you're together
coming up with an objective I mean

1990
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:51,780
coming up with an objective I mean
 

1991
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,540
coming up with an objective I mean
there's a lot of philosophy that you

1992
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:53,550
there's a lot of philosophy that you
 

1993
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,430
there's a lot of philosophy that you
know you could argue that life doesn't

1994
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:55,440
know you could argue that life doesn't
 

1995
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,220
know you could argue that life doesn't
really have meaning we we together agree

1996
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,230
really have meaning we we together agree
 

1997
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,380
really have meaning we we together agree
on what gives it meaning and we kind of

1998
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:00,390
on what gives it meaning and we kind of
 

1999
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,670
on what gives it meaning and we kind of
culturally create things that give why

2000

together as a society create that
 

2005
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:09,980
together as a society create that
meaning and you have to learn that

2006
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:09,990
meaning and you have to learn that
 

2007
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,740
meaning and you have to learn that

that you know we don't have to look
 

2043
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:55,609
that you know we don't have to look
forward to a time when AI systems take

2044
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:55,619
forward to a time when AI systems take
 

2045
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,289
forward to a time when AI systems take
over the world they already have and

2046
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:57,299
over the world they already have and
 

2047
00:46:57,299 --> 00:46:59,359
over the world they already have and
they call corporations right that

2048
00:46:59,359 --> 00:46:59,369
they call corporations right that
 

2049
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:03,260
they call corporations right that
corporations happen to be using people

2050
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,270
corporations happen to be using people
 

2051
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,500
corporations happen to be using people
as components right now but they are

2052
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:06,510
as components right now but they are
 

2053
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,289
as components right now but they are
effectively algorithmic machines and

2054
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:09,299
effectively algorithmic machines and
 

2055
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:11,200
effectively algorithmic machines and
they're optimizing an objective which is

2056
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:11,210
they're optimizing an objective which is
 

2057
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:15,410
they're optimizing an objective which is
quarterly profit that isn't aligned with

2058
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:15,420
quarterly profit that isn't aligned with
 

2059
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,720
quarterly profit that isn't aligned with
overall well-being of the human race and

2060
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:17,730
overall well-being of the human race and
 

2061
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,880
overall well-being of the human race and
they are destroying the world they are

2062
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:19,890
they are destroying the world they are
 

2063
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,549
they are destroying the world they are
primarily responsible for our inability

2064
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:22,559
primarily responsible for our inability
 

2065
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,430
primarily responsible for our inability
to tackle climate change right so I

2066
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,440
to tackle climate change right so I
 

2067
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,140
to tackle climate change right so I
think that's one way

2068
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:27,150
think that's one way
 

2069
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,000
think that's one way
of thinking about what's going on with

2070
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,010
of thinking about what's going on with
 

2071
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,690
of thinking about what's going on with
with cooperations but I think the point

2072
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:32,700
with cooperations but I think the point
 

2073
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,720
with cooperations but I think the point
you're making you is valid that there

2074
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:35,730
you're making you is valid that there
 

2075
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,750
you're making you is valid that there
are there are many systems in the real

2076
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:38,760
are there are many systems in the real
 

2077
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,480
are there are many systems in the real
world where we've sort of prematurely

2078
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:41,490
world where we've sort of prematurely
 

2079
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,100
world where we've sort of prematurely
fixed on the objective and then

2080
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:43,110
fixed on the objective and then
 

2081
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:48,200
fixed on the objective and then
decoupled the the machine from those

2082
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:48,210
decoupled the the machine from those
 

2083
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:51,170
decoupled the the machine from those
that's supposed to be serving and I

that's supposed to be serving and I
 

2085
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,930

think you see this with government right

2086
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:53,940
think you see this with government right
 

2087
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,000
think you see this with government right
government is supposed to be a machine

2088
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,010
government is supposed to be a machine
 

2089
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,940
government is supposed to be a machine
that serves people but instead it tends

2090
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:58,950
that serves people but instead it tends
 

2091
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,600
that serves people but instead it tends
to be taken over by people who have

00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:02,610
to be taken over by people who have
 

2093
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,060
to be taken over by people who have
their own objective and use government

2094
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:05,070
their own objective and use government
 

2095
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,550
their own objective and use government
to optimize that objective regardless of

to optimize that objective regardless of

00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,370
to optimize that objective regardless of
what people want do you have do you find

2098
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:10,380
what people want do you have do you find
 

2099
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,190

appealing the idea of almost arguing

systems with a clear fixed objective we

2104
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:18,300
systems with a clear fixed objective we
 

2105
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,450
systems with a clear fixed objective we
have in government the red team and the

00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:20,460
have in government the red team and the
 

2107
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,730
have in government the red team and the
blue team that are very fixed on their

00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:25,340
objectives and they argue and it kind of
 

2111
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,800
objectives and they argue and it kind of
maybe it would disagree but it kind of

2112
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:27,810
maybe it would disagree but it kind of
 

2113
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:33,410
maybe it would disagree but it kind of
seems to make it work somewhat that the

the duality of it okay let's go a
hundred years back when there was still

2118
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:39,420
hundred years back when there was still
 

2119
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,330
hundred years back when there was still
was going on or at the founding of this

2120
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:41,340
was going on or at the founding of this
 

2121
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,520
was going on or at the founding of this
country there was disagreement and that

2122
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:43,530
country there was disagreement and that
 

2123
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:47,120
country there was disagreement and that
disagreement is where so there's a

2124
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,130
disagreement is where so there's a
 

2125
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,490
disagreement is where so there's a
balance between certainty and forced

2126
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:49,500
balance between certainty and forced
 

2127
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,560

humility because the power was

2128
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:51,570
humility because the power was
 

2129
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:56,900
humility because the power was
distributed yeah I think that the the

2130
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:56,910
distributed yeah I think that the the
 

2131
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,270
distributed yeah I think that the the
the nature of debate and disagreement

2132
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,280
the nature of debate and disagreement
 

2133
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,330
the nature of debate and disagreement
argument takes as a premise the idea

2134
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:05,340
argument takes as a premise the idea
 

2135
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,700
argument takes as a premise the idea
that you could be wrong right which

2136
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:07,710
that you could be wrong right which
 

2137
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,900
that you could be wrong right which
means that you're not necessarily

2138
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:10,910
means that you're not necessarily
 

2139
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,310
means that you're not necessarily
absolutely convinced that your objective

2140
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:13,320
absolutely convinced that your objective
 

2141
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,500
absolutely convinced that your objective
is the correct one right if you were

2142
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:17,510
is the correct one right if you were
 

2143
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,580
is the correct one right if you were
absolutely Guiness there'll be no point

2144
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:19,590
absolutely Guiness there'll be no point
 

2145
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,780
absolutely Guiness there'll be no point
in having any discussion or argument

2146
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:20,790
in having any discussion or argument
 

2147
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,480
in having any discussion or argument
because you would never change your mind

2148
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:22,490
because you would never change your mind
 

2149
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:26,210
because you would never change your mind
and there wouldn't be any any sort of

2150
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:26,220
and there wouldn't be any any sort of
 

2151
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,640
and there wouldn't be any any sort of
synthesis or or anything like that so so

2152
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:28,650
synthesis or or anything like that so so
 

2153
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,200
synthesis or or anything like that so so
I think you can think of argumentation

2154
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,210
I think you can think of argumentation
 

2155
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:34,910
I think you can think of argumentation
as a as an implementation of a form of

00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:34,920
as a as an implementation of a form of

00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,910
as a as an implementation of a form of
uncertain reasoning

2158
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:36,920
uncertain reasoning
 

2159
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:42,040
uncertain reasoning
and you know I I've been reading

2160
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,050
and you know I I've been reading
 

2161
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,950
and you know I I've been reading
recently about utilitarianism in the

2162
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:44,960
recently about utilitarianism in the
 

2163
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,420
recently about utilitarianism in the
history of efforts to define in a sort

2164
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:49,430
history of efforts to define in a sort
 

2165
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:53,430
history of efforts to define in a sort
of clear mathematical way a

2166
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:53,440

 

2167
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,250

I feel like a formula for moral or

2168
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:56,260
I feel like a formula for moral or
 

2169
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,730
I feel like a formula for moral or
political decision-making and it's

2170
00:49:59,730 --> 00:49:59,740
political decision-making and it's
 

2171
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,200
political decision-making and it's
really interesting that the parallels

2172
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,210
really interesting that the parallels
 

2173
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,780
really interesting that the parallels
between the philosophical discussions

2174
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:03,790
between the philosophical discussions
 

2175
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,930
between the philosophical discussions
going back 200 years and what you see

2176
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:06,940
going back 200 years and what you see
 

2177
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,390
going back 200 years and what you see
now in discussions about existential

2178
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:09,400
now in discussions about existential
 

2179
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,200
now in discussions about existential
risk because you it's almost exactly the

2180
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,210
risk because you it's almost exactly the
 

2181
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,120
risk because you it's almost exactly the
same so someone would say okay well

2182
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,130
same so someone would say okay well
 

2183
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:17,550
same so someone would say okay well
here's a formula for how we should make

2184
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:17,560
here's a formula for how we should make
 

2185
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,559
here's a formula for how we should make
decisions right so utilitarianism

2186
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:19,569
decisions right so utilitarianism
 

2187
00:50:19,569 --> 00:50:22,020
decisions right so utilitarianism
you know each person has a utility

2188
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:22,030
you know each person has a utility
 

2189
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,660
you know each person has a utility
function and then we make decisions to

2190
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:24,670
function and then we make decisions to
 

2191
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:27,720
function and then we make decisions to
maximize the sum of everybody's utility

2192
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:27,730
maximize the sum of everybody's utility
 

2193
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:31,079
maximize the sum of everybody's utility
mm-hmm right and then people point out

2194
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:31,089
mm-hmm right and then people point out
 

2195
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:33,990
mm-hmm right and then people point out
well you know in that case the best

2196
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:34,000
well you know in that case the best
 

2197
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,740
well you know in that case the best
policy is one that leads to the enormous

2198
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:37,750
policy is one that leads to the enormous
 

2199
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,740
policy is one that leads to the enormous

00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:40,750
lis vast population all of whom are
 

2201
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,569
lis vast population all of whom are
living a life that's barely worth living

2202
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:42,579
living a life that's barely worth living
 

2203
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:45,300
living a life that's barely worth living
right and this is called the repugnant

2204
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:45,310
right and this is called the repugnant
 

2205
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,059
right and this is called the repugnant
conclusion and you know another version

2206
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:48,069
conclusion and you know another version
 

2207
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:50,460
conclusion and you know another version
is you know that we we should maximize

2208
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:50,470
is you know that we we should maximize
 

2209
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,890
is you know that we we should maximize
pleasure and that's what we mean by

2210
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:52,900
pleasure and that's what we mean by
 

2211
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,160
pleasure and that's what we mean by
utility and then you'll get people

2212
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,170
utility and then you'll get people
 

2213
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,680
utility and then you'll get people
effectively saying well in that case you

2214
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:58,690
effectively saying well in that case you
 

2215
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,700
effectively saying well in that case you
know we might as well just have everyone

2216
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,710
know we might as well just have everyone
 

2217
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,370
know we might as well just have everyone
hooked up to a heroin drip yeah you know

2218
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:02,380
hooked up to a heroin drip yeah you know
 

2219
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,380
hooked up to a heroin drip yeah you know
and they didn't use those words but that

2220
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:04,390
and they didn't use those words but that
 

2221
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,630
and they didn't use those words but that
debate you know what's happening in the

2222
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
debate you know what's happening in the
 

2223
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,890
debate you know what's happening in the
19th century as it is now about AI that

2224
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:10,900
19th century as it is now about AI that
 

2225
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,650
19th century as it is now about AI that
if we get the formula wrong you know

2226
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:13,660
if we get the formula wrong you know
 

2227
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,740
if we get the formula wrong you know
we're going to have AI systems working

2228
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:16,750
we're going to have AI systems working
 

2229
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,559
we're going to have AI systems working
towards an outcome that in retrospect

2230
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:19,569
towards an outcome that in retrospect
 

2231
00:51:19,569 --> 00:51:22,650
towards an outcome that in retrospect
would be exactly wrong do you think

2232
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:22,660
would be exactly wrong do you think
 

2233
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,809
would be exactly wrong do you think
there's it has beautifully put so the

2234
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:24,819
there's it has beautifully put so the
 

2235
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:27,420
there's it has beautifully put so the
the echoes are there but do you think I

2236
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:27,430
the echoes are there but do you think I
 

2237
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:30,270
the echoes are there but do you think I
mean if you look at sam Harris is our

2238
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:30,280
mean if you look at sam Harris is our
 

2239
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,359
mean if you look at sam Harris is our
imagination worries about the AI version

2240
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:33,369
imagination worries about the AI version
 

2241
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:39,530
imagination worries about the AI version
of that because of the speed at which

2242
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:39,540
of that because of the speed at which
 

2243
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,900
of that because of the speed at which
the things going wrong in the

2244
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:42,910
the things going wrong in the
 

2245
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:45,930
the things going wrong in the
utilitarian context could happen yeah is

2246
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:45,940
utilitarian context could happen yeah is
 

2247
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,150
utilitarian context could happen yeah is
that is that a worry for you yeah I I

2248
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:48,160
that is that a worry for you yeah I I
 

2249
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,760
that is that a worry for you yeah I I
think that

2250
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:49,770
think that
 

2251
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,730
think that
you know it in most cases not in all but

2252
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:52,740
you know it in most cases not in all but
 

2253
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,230
you know it in most cases not in all but
you know if we if we have a wrong

2254
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
you know if we if we have a wrong
 

2255
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,170
you know if we if we have a wrong
political idea you know we see it

2256
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:57,180
political idea you know we see it
 

2257
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,730
political idea you know we see it
starting to go wrong and we're you know

2258
00:51:58,730 --> 00:51:58,740
starting to go wrong and we're you know
 

2259
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,830
starting to go wrong and we're you know
we're not completely stupid and so we

2260
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:00,840
we're not completely stupid and so we
 

2261
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,720
we're not completely stupid and so we
said okay that was maybe that was a

2262
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:02,730
said okay that was maybe that was a
 

2263
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,100
said okay that was maybe that was a
mistake

2264
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:04,110
mistake
 

2265
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:08,120
mistake
let's try something different and and

2266
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:08,130
let's try something different and and
 

2267
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:10,010
let's try something different and and
also we're very slow and inefficient

2268
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:10,020
also we're very slow and inefficient
 

2269
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,080
also we're very slow and inefficient
about implementing these things and so

2270
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,090
about implementing these things and so
 

2271
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,720
about implementing these things and so
on so you have to worry when you have

2272
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:14,730
on so you have to worry when you have
 

2273
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,700
on so you have to worry when you have
corporations or political systems that

2274
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:16,710
corporations or political systems that
 

2275
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,010
corporations or political systems that
are extremely efficient

2276
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,020
are extremely efficient
 

2277
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,340
are extremely efficient
but when we look at AI systems or even

2278
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:22,350
but when we look at AI systems or even
 

2279
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,410
but when we look at AI systems or even
just computers in general right they

2280
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:24,420
just computers in general right they
 

2281
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,610
just computers in general right they
have this different characteristic from

2282
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:28,620
have this different characteristic from
 

2283
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,850
have this different characteristic from
ordinary human activity in the past so

2284
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:31,860
ordinary human activity in the past so
 

2285
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,610
ordinary human activity in the past so
let's say you were a surgeon you had

2286
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:34,620
let's say you were a surgeon you had
 

2287
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,640
let's say you were a surgeon you had
some idea about how to do some operation

2288
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:36,650
some idea about how to do some operation
 

2289
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,020
some idea about how to do some operation
right well and let's say you were wrong

2290
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:39,030
right well and let's say you were wrong
 

2291
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,970
right well and let's say you were wrong
all right that that way of doing the

2292
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:40,980
all right that that way of doing the
 

2293
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,490
all right that that way of doing the
operation would mostly kill the patient

2294
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:43,500
operation would mostly kill the patient
 

2295
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,790
operation would mostly kill the patient
well you'd find out pretty quickly like

2296
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
well you'd find out pretty quickly like
 

2297
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,670
well you'd find out pretty quickly like
after three maybe three or four tries

2298
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,680
after three maybe three or four tries
 

2299
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,059
after three maybe three or four tries
right

2300
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:51,069
right
 

2301
00:52:51,069 --> 00:52:53,750
right
but

2302
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:53,760
but
 

2303
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,120
but
that isn't true for pharmaceutical

2304
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:56,130
that isn't true for pharmaceutical
 

2305
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:00,080
that isn't true for pharmaceutical
companies because they don't do three or

2306
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:00,090
companies because they don't do three or
 

2307
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,210
companies because they don't do three or
four operations they they manufacture

2308
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:02,220
four operations they they manufacture
 

2309
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,250
four operations they they manufacture
three or four billion pills and they

2310
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:04,260
three or four billion pills and they
 

2311
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,140
three or four billion pills and they
sell them and then they find out maybe

2312
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:06,150
sell them and then they find out maybe
 

2313
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,050
sell them and then they find out maybe
six months or a year later that oh

2314
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:08,060
six months or a year later that oh
 

2315
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,490
six months or a year later that oh
people are dying of heart attacks or

2316
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:10,500
people are dying of heart attacks or
 

2317
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,640
people are dying of heart attacks or
getting cancer from this drug and so

2318
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:13,650
getting cancer from this drug and so
 

2319
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:16,130
getting cancer from this drug and so
that's why we have the FDA right because

2320
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:16,140
that's why we have the FDA right because
 

2321
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,710
that's why we have the FDA right because
of the scalability of pharmaceutical

2322
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720
of the scalability of pharmaceutical
 

2323
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,170
of the scalability of pharmaceutical
production and you know and there have

2324
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:21,180
production and you know and there have
 

2325
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:27,350
production and you know and there have
been some unbelievably bad episodes in

2326
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:27,360
been some unbelievably bad episodes in
 

2327
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,380
been some unbelievably bad episodes in
the history of pharmaceuticals and and

2328
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,390
the history of pharmaceuticals and and
 

2329
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,320
the history of pharmaceuticals and and
adulteration of of products and so on

2330
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:33,330
adulteration of of products and so on
 

2331
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,780
adulteration of of products and so on
that that have killed tens of thousands

2332
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:35,790
that that have killed tens of thousands
 

2333
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,310
that that have killed tens of thousands
or paralysed hundreds of thousands of

2334
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:37,320
or paralysed hundreds of thousands of
 

2335
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,300
or paralysed hundreds of thousands of
people now with computers we have that

2336
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:41,310
people now with computers we have that
 

2337
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,370
people now with computers we have that
same scalability problem that you can

2338
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:43,380
same scalability problem that you can
 

2339
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:47,120
same scalability problem that you can
sit there and type for I equals 1 to 5

2340
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:47,130
sit there and type for I equals 1 to 5
 

2341
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,460
sit there and type for I equals 1 to 5
billion do right and all of a sudden

2342
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:49,470
billion do right and all of a sudden
 

2343
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,500

you're having an impact on a global

2344
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:51,510
you're having an impact on a global
 

2345
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:54,020
you're having an impact on a global
scale and yet we have no FDA right

2346
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,030
scale and yet we have no FDA right
 

2347
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,890
scale and yet we have no FDA right
there's absolutely no controls at all

2348
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:56,900
there's absolutely no controls at all
 

2349
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,020
there's absolutely no controls at all
it's over what a bunch of undergraduates

2350
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:00,030
it's over what a bunch of undergraduates
 

2351
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,300
it's over what a bunch of undergraduates
with too much caffeine can do to the

2352
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:02,310
with too much caffeine can do to the
 

2353
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,360
with too much caffeine can do to the

00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:05,370
world and you know we look at what
 

2355
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,540
world and you know we look at what
happened with Facebook well social media

2356
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:08,550
happened with Facebook well social media
 

2357
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,040
happened with Facebook well social media
in general and click-through

2358
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,050
in general and click-through
 

2359
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:13,640
in general and click-through
optimization so you have a simple

2360
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:13,650
optimization so you have a simple
 

2361
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,210
optimization so you have a simple
feedback algorithm that's trying to just

2362
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:17,220
feedback algorithm that's trying to just
 

2363
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,770
feedback algorithm that's trying to just
optimize click-through that sounds

2364
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:20,780
optimize click-through that sounds
 

2365
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,910
optimize click-through that sounds
reasonable right because you don't want

2366
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:22,920
reasonable right because you don't want
 

2367
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,890
reasonable right because you don't want
to be feeding people ads that they don't

2368
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:24,900
to be feeding people ads that they don't
 

2369
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,130
to be feeding people ads that they don't
care about I'm not interested in

2370
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:28,140
care about I'm not interested in
 

2371
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,780
care about I'm not interested in
and you might even think of that process

2372
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:32,790
and you might even think of that process
 

2373
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:37,970
and you might even think of that process
as simply adjusting the the feeding of

2374
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:37,980
as simply adjusting the the feeding of
 

2375
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,310
as simply adjusting the the feeding of
ads or news articles or whatever it

2376
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:40,320
ads or news articles or whatever it
 

2377
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,430
ads or news articles or whatever it
might be to match people's preferences

2378
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:43,440
might be to match people's preferences
 

2379
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,600
might be to match people's preferences
right which sounds like a good idea but

2380
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:47,610
right which sounds like a good idea but
 

2381
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:50,360
right which sounds like a good idea but
in fact that isn't how the algorithm

2382
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:50,370
in fact that isn't how the algorithm
 

2383
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:54,350
in fact that isn't how the algorithm
works right you make more money the

2384
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:54,360
works right you make more money the
 

2385
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,970
works right you make more money the
algorithm makes more money if it could

2386
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:58,980
algorithm makes more money if it could
 

2387
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,860
algorithm makes more money if it could
better predict what people are going to

2388
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:00,870
better predict what people are going to
 

2389
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,300
better predict what people are going to
click on because then it can feed them

2390
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:02,310
click on because then it can feed them
 

2391
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:06,200
click on because then it can feed them
exactly that right so the way to

2392
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:06,210
exactly that right so the way to
 

2393
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,480
exactly that right so the way to
maximize click-through is actually to

2394
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:08,490
maximize click-through is actually to
 

2395
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:11,570
maximize click-through is actually to
modify the people to make them more

2396
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:11,580
modify the people to make them more
 

2397
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:15,640
modify the people to make them more
predictable and one way to do that is to

2398
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:15,650
predictable and one way to do that is to
 

2399
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:18,230
predictable and one way to do that is to
feed them information which will change

2400
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:18,240
feed them information which will change
 

2401
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,120
feed them information which will change
their behavior and preferences towards

2402
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,130
their behavior and preferences towards
 

2403
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,130
their behavior and preferences towards
extremes that make them predictable now

2404
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:25,140
extremes that make them predictable now
 

2405
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,900
extremes that make them predictable now
whatever is the nearest extreme or the

2406
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:26,910
whatever is the nearest extreme or the
 

2407
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,810
whatever is the nearest extreme or the
nearest predictable point that's where

2408
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:29,820
nearest predictable point that's where
 

2409
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,370
nearest predictable point that's where
you're going to end up

2410
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:32,380
you're going to end up
 

2411
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,769
you're going to end up
the machines will force you there now

2412
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:34,779
the machines will force you there now
 

2413
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:37,079
the machines will force you there now
and then I think there's a reasonable

2414
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:37,089
and then I think there's a reasonable
 

2415
00:55:37,089 --> 00:55:39,960
and then I think there's a reasonable
argument to say that this among other

2416
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:39,970
argument to say that this among other
 

2417
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,700
argument to say that this among other
things is contributing to the

2418
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:41,710
things is contributing to the
 

2419
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,970
things is contributing to the
destruction of democracy in the world

2420
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:45,980

 

2421
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,560

and where was the oversight of this

2422
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:50,570
and where was the oversight of this
 

2423
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,450
and where was the oversight of this
process where were the people saying

2424
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:52,460
process where were the people saying
 

2425
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,819
process where were the people saying
okay you would like to apply this

2426
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:54,829
okay you would like to apply this
 

2427
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:57,640
okay you would like to apply this
algorithm to five billion people on the

2428
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:57,650
algorithm to five billion people on the
 

2429
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,040
algorithm to five billion people on the
face of the earth can you show me that

2430
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,050
face of the earth can you show me that
 

2431
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,690
face of the earth can you show me that
it's safe can you show me that it won't

2432
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:01,700
it's safe can you show me that it won't
 

2433
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,690
it's safe can you show me that it won't
have various kinds of negative effects

2434
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:04,700
have various kinds of negative effects
 

2435
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,550
have various kinds of negative effects
no there was no one asking that question

2436
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:06,560
no there was no one asking that question
 

2437
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,930
no there was no one asking that question
there was no one placed between you know

2438
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:10,940
there was no one placed between you know
 

2439
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,120
there was no one placed between you know
the undergrads were too much caffeine

2440
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,130
the undergrads were too much caffeine
 

2441
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,210
the undergrads were too much caffeine
and the human race well it's just they

2442
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:16,220
and the human race well it's just they
 

2443
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,839
and the human race well it's just they
just did it and but some way outside the

2444
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:19,849
just did it and but some way outside the
 

2445
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:21,280
just did it and but some way outside the
scope of my knowledge so economists

2446
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:21,290
scope of my knowledge so economists
 

2447
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,440
scope of my knowledge so economists
would argue that the what is it the

2448
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:23,450
would argue that the what is it the
 

2449
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:26,170
would argue that the what is it the
invisible hand so the the capitalist

2450
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:26,180
invisible hand so the the capitalist
 

2451
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:26,589
invisible hand so the the capitalist
system

2452
00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:26,599
system
 

2453
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:29,470
system
it was the oversight so if you're going

2454
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:29,480
it was the oversight so if you're going
 

2455
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,089
it was the oversight so if you're going
to corrupt society with whatever

2456
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:31,099
to corrupt society with whatever
 

2457
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:32,770
to corrupt society with whatever
decision you make is a company then

2458
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:32,780
decision you make is a company then
 

2459
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,630
decision you make is a company then
that's going to be reflected in people

2460
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:34,640
that's going to be reflected in people
 

2461
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,730
that's going to be reflected in people
not using your product sort of one

2462
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:36,740
not using your product sort of one
 

2463
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,550
not using your product sort of one
that's one model of oversight so we

2464
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:39,560
that's one model of oversight so we
 

2465
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,260
that's one model of oversight so we
shall see but you know in the meantime

2466
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:41,270
shall see but you know in the meantime
 

2467
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,660
shall see but you know in the meantime
you know that but you you might even

2468
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:43,670
you know that but you you might even
 

2469
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:48,250
you know that but you you might even
have broken the political system that

2470
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:48,260
have broken the political system that
 

2471
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,770
have broken the political system that
enables capitalism to function well

2472
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:50,780
enables capitalism to function well
 

2473
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,160
enables capitalism to function well
you've changed it and so we should see

2474
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,170
you've changed it and so we should see
 

2475
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,800
you've changed it and so we should see
yeah change changes often painful so my

2476
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:56,810
yeah change changes often painful so my
 

2477
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,200
yeah change changes often painful so my
question is uh absolutely it's

2478
00:56:59,200 --> 00:56:59,210
question is uh absolutely it's
 

2479
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,160
question is uh absolutely it's
fascinating

2480
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:00,170
fascinating
 

2481
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,020
fascinating
you're absolutely right that there is

2482
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,030
you're absolutely right that there is
 

2483
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,960
you're absolutely right that there is
ZERO oversight on algorithms that can

2484
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:04,970
ZERO oversight on algorithms that can
 

2485
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,490
ZERO oversight on algorithms that can
have a profound civilization changing

2486
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:08,500
have a profound civilization changing
 

2487
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,160
have a profound civilization changing
effect so do you think it's possible I

2488
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:12,170
effect so do you think it's possible I
 

2489
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:15,099
effect so do you think it's possible I
mean I haven't have you seen government

2490
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:15,109
mean I haven't have you seen government
 

2491
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:18,359
mean I haven't have you seen government
so do you think it's possible to create

2492
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:18,369
so do you think it's possible to create
 

2493
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:22,059
so do you think it's possible to create
regulatory bodies oversight over AI

2494
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:22,069
regulatory bodies oversight over AI
 

2495
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:24,760
regulatory bodies oversight over AI
algorithms which are inherently such

2496
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:24,770
algorithms which are inherently such
 

2497
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,849
algorithms which are inherently such
cutting edge set of ideas and

2498
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:27,859
cutting edge set of ideas and
 

2499
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:32,079
cutting edge set of ideas and
technologies yeah but I think it takes

2500
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:32,089
technologies yeah but I think it takes
 

2501
00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:33,460
technologies yeah but I think it takes
time

2502
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:33,470
time
 

2503
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:36,160
time
to figure out what kind of oversight

2504
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,170
to figure out what kind of oversight
 

2505
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:38,320
to figure out what kind of oversight
what kinds of controls I mean took time

2506
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:38,330
what kinds of controls I mean took time
 

2507
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,560
what kinds of controls I mean took time
to design the FDA regime you know and

2508
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:41,570
to design the FDA regime you know and
 

2509
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:42,880
to design the FDA regime you know and
some people still don't like it and they

2510
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:42,890
some people still don't like it and they
 

2511
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:43,780
some people still don't like it and they
want to fix it

2512
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:43,790
want to fix it
 

2513
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:47,200
want to fix it
and I think there are clear ways that it

2514
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:47,210
and I think there are clear ways that it
 

2515
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,140
and I think there are clear ways that it
could be improved but the whole notion

2516
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:50,150
could be improved but the whole notion
 

2517
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,300
could be improved but the whole notion
that you have stage 1 stage 2 stage 3

2518
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:52,310
that you have stage 1 stage 2 stage 3
 

2519
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,960
that you have stage 1 stage 2 stage 3
and here are the criteria for what you

2520
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:55,970
and here are the criteria for what you
 

2521
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,780
and here are the criteria for what you
have to do to pass a stage 1 trial right

2522
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:58,790
have to do to pass a stage 1 trial right
 

2523
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,820
have to do to pass a stage 1 trial right
we haven't even thought about what those

2524
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:00,830
we haven't even thought about what those
 

2525
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:01,240
we haven't even thought about what those
would be

2526
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:01,250
would be
 

2527
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,310
would be
for algorithms so I mean I think there

2528
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:03,320
for algorithms so I mean I think there
 

2529
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,609
for algorithms so I mean I think there
are there are things we could do right

2530
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:06,619
are there are things we could do right
 

2531
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:10,930
are there are things we could do right
now with regard to bias for example we

2532
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:10,940
now with regard to bias for example we
 

2533
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,450
now with regard to bias for example we
we have a pretty good technical handle

2534
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:13,460
we have a pretty good technical handle
 

2535
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,710
we have a pretty good technical handle
on how to detect algorithms that are

2536
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:17,720
on how to detect algorithms that are
 

2537
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,320
on how to detect algorithms that are
propagating bias that exists in data

2538
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:20,330
propagating bias that exists in data
 

2539
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:25,030
propagating bias that exists in data
sets how to D by us those algorithms and

2540
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:25,040
sets how to D by us those algorithms and
 

2541
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,770
sets how to D by us those algorithms and
and even what it's going to cost you to

2542
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:26,780
and even what it's going to cost you to
 

2543
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,339
and even what it's going to cost you to
do that so I think we could start having

2544
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:30,349
do that so I think we could start having
 

2545
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:33,310
do that so I think we could start having
some standards on that I think there are

2546
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:33,320
some standards on that I think there are
 

2547
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,200
some standards on that I think there are
there are things to do with

2548
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:36,210
there are things to do with
 

2549
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:39,390
there are things to do with
impersonation of falsification that we

2550
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:39,400
impersonation of falsification that we
 

2551
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,230
impersonation of falsification that we
could we could work on so I thanks ya or

2552
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:43,240
could we could work on so I thanks ya or
 

2553
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,750
could we could work on so I thanks ya or
you know in a very simple point so

2554
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:45,760
you know in a very simple point so
 

2555
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,440
you know in a very simple point so
impersonation ISM is a machine acting as

2556
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:49,450
impersonation ISM is a machine acting as
 

2557
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:53,040
impersonation ISM is a machine acting as
if it was a person I can't see a real

if it was a person I can't see a real
 

2559
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:56,760
if it was a person I can't see a real
justification for why we shouldn't

2560
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:56,770
justification for why we shouldn't
 

2561
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,859
justification for why we shouldn't
insist that machines self-identify as

00:58:58,859 --> 00:58:58,869
insist that machines self-identify as

00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:03,150
insist that machines self-identify as
machines you know where is the social

benefit in in fooling people into
 

2567
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,550
benefit in in fooling people into

00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:08,560
thinking that this is really a person
 

2569
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,849
thinking that this is really a person
when it isn't you know I I don't mind if

2570
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:11,859
when it isn't you know I I don't mind if
 

2571
00:59:11,859 --> 00:59:14,010
when it isn't you know I I don't mind if
it uses a human-like voice that's easy

2572
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:14,020
it uses a human-like voice that's easy
 

2573
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,240
it uses a human-like voice that's easy
to understand that's fine

2574
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:15,250
to understand that's fine
 

2575
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,370
to understand that's fine
but it should just say I'm a machine in

2576
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:17,380
but it should just say I'm a machine in
 

2577
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,930
but it should just say I'm a machine in
some some form

2578
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:20,940

 

2579
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,180

people are speaking to that I would

2580
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:23,190
people are speaking to that I would
 

2581
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,609
people are speaking to that I would
think relatively obvious factors I think

2582
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:25,619
think relatively obvious factors I think
 

2583
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:27,140
think relatively obvious factors I think
mostly yeah I mean there is actually a

2584
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,150
mostly yeah I mean there is actually a
 

2585
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,069
mostly yeah I mean there is actually a
law in California that bans

2586
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
law in California that bans
 

2587
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,800
law in California that bans
impersonation but only in certain

2588
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:32,810
impersonation but only in certain
 

2589
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,290
impersonation but only in certain
restricted circumstances so for the

2590
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:36,300
restricted circumstances so for the
 

2591
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,800
restricted circumstances so for the
purpose of engaging in a for Geling

2592
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:39,810
purpose of engaging in a for Geling
 

2593
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,309
purpose of engaging in a for Geling
transaction and for the purpose of

2594
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:42,319
transaction and for the purpose of
 

2595
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:46,190
transaction and for the purpose of
modifying someone's voting behavior so

2596
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:46,200
modifying someone's voting behavior so
 

2597
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,569
modifying someone's voting behavior so
those are those are the circumstances

2598
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:47,579
those are those are the circumstances
 

2599
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:52,010
those are those are the circumstances
where machines have to self-identify but

2600
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:52,020
where machines have to self-identify but
 

2601
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,109
where machines have to self-identify but
I think this is you know arguably it

2602
00:59:54,109 --> 00:59:54,119
I think this is you know arguably it
 

2603
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:57,620
I think this is you know arguably it
should be in all circumstances and then

2604
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:57,630
should be in all circumstances and then
 

2605
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,349
should be in all circumstances and then
when you talk about deep fakes you know

2606
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:00,359
when you talk about deep fakes you know
 

2607
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:03,530
when you talk about deep fakes you know
we're just beginning but already it's

2608
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:03,540
we're just beginning but already it's
 

2609
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,530
we're just beginning but already it's
possible to make a movie of anybody

2610
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:06,540
possible to make a movie of anybody
 

2611
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,740
possible to make a movie of anybody
saying anything in ways that are pretty

2612
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:09,750
saying anything in ways that are pretty
 

2613
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,500
saying anything in ways that are pretty
hard to detect including yourself

2614
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:12,510
hard to detect including yourself
 

2615
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,819
hard to detect including yourself
because you're on camera now and your

2616
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:13,829
because you're on camera now and your
 

2617
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:15,140
because you're on camera now and your
voice is coming through with high

2618
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:15,150
voice is coming through with high
 

2619
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,630
voice is coming through with high
resolution so you could take what I'm

2620
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:17,640
resolution so you could take what I'm
 

2621
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,040
resolution so you could take what I'm
saying and replaces it with it pretty

2622
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,050
saying and replaces it with it pretty
 

2623
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,359
saying and replaces it with it pretty
much anything else you wanted me to be

2624
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:20,369
much anything else you wanted me to be
 

2625
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:22,400
much anything else you wanted me to be
saying yeah and even it will change my

2626
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:22,410
saying yeah and even it will change my
 

2627
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,530
saying yeah and even it will change my
lips and expression expressions to fit

2628
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:26,540

 

2629
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:31,210

and there's actually not much in the way

2630
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:31,220
and there's actually not much in the way
 

2631
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:35,530
and there's actually not much in the way
of real legal protection against that I

2632
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:35,540
of real legal protection against that I
 

2633
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,990
of real legal protection against that I
think in the commercial area you could

2634
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:38,000
think in the commercial area you could
 

2635
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,080
think in the commercial area you could
say yeah that's you're using my brand

2636
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:41,090
say yeah that's you're using my brand
 

2637
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,820
say yeah that's you're using my brand
and so on that there there are rules

2638
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:42,830
and so on that there there are rules
 

2639
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:45,610
and so on that there there are rules
about that but in the political sphere I

2640
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:45,620
about that but in the political sphere I
 

2641
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:49,240
about that but in the political sphere I
think it's at the moment it's you know

2642
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:49,250
think it's at the moment it's you know
 

2643
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,310
think it's at the moment it's you know
anything goes so like that could be

2644
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:51,320
anything goes so like that could be
 

2645
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:55,770
anything goes so like that could be
really really damaging and let me just

2646
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:55,780
really really damaging and let me just
 

2647
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,690
really really damaging and let me just
try to make not an argument but try to

2648
01:00:58,690 --> 01:00:58,700
try to make not an argument but try to
 

2649
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,380
try to make not an argument but try to
look back at history and say something

2650
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:02,390
look back at history and say something
 

2651
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:06,730
look back at history and say something
dark in essence is while regulation

2652
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:06,740
dark in essence is while regulation
 

2653
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,010
dark in essence is while regulation
seems to be oversight seems to be

2654
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:09,020
seems to be oversight seems to be
 

2655
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,900
seems to be oversight seems to be
exactly the right thing to do here

2656
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:10,910
exactly the right thing to do here
 

2657
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:12,820
exactly the right thing to do here
it seems that human beings what they

2658
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:12,830
it seems that human beings what they
 

2659
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,070
it seems that human beings what they
naturally do is they wait for something

2660
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:15,080
naturally do is they wait for something
 

2661
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,690
naturally do is they wait for something
to go wrong if you're talking about

2662
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:16,700
to go wrong if you're talking about
 

2663
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,970
to go wrong if you're talking about
nuclear weapons

2664

nuclear weapons
 

2665
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:20,950
nuclear weapons
you can't talk about nuclear weapons

2666
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:20,960
you can't talk about nuclear weapons
 

2667
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,290
you can't talk about nuclear weapons
being dangerous until somebody actually

2668
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:23,300
being dangerous until somebody actually
 

2669
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,990
being dangerous until somebody actually

Chernobyl melting do you think we will

2672
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:29,270
Chernobyl melting do you think we will
 

2673

01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:36,560
way that's obviously damaging to society
 

2677
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,400
way that's obviously damaging to society
not an existential risk but obviously

2678
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:39,410
not an existential risk but obviously
 

2679
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:43,750
not an existential risk but obviously
damaging or do you have faith that I I

2680
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:43,760
damaging or do you have faith that I I
 

2681
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,260
damaging or do you have faith that I I
hope not but I mean I think we do have

2682
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:47,270
hope not but I mean I think we do have
 

2683
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:51,430
hope not but I mean I think we do have
to look at history and when you know so

2684
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:51,440
to look at history and when you know so

01:02:51,609 --> 01:02:51,619
so he was imagining how much worse the
 

2727
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:55,090
so he was imagining how much worse the
world would be if we were using that

kind of explosive but the physics

2730
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960
kind of explosive but the physics
 

2731
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,170

including the people who are making it
 

2737
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,020
including the people who are making it
well so they were doing the nuclear

2738
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:08,030
well so they were doing the nuclear
 

2739
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,720
well so they were doing the nuclear
physics I mean eventually were the ones

2740
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:10,730
physics I mean eventually were the ones
 

2741
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:12,670
physics I mean eventually were the ones
who made it and Rockwell for me or

2742
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:12,680
who made it and Rockwell for me or
 

2743
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:16,450
who made it and Rockwell for me or
whoever well so up to the the

2744
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:16,460
whoever well so up to the the
 

2745
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:20,680
whoever well so up to the the
development was was mostly theoretical

2746
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:20,690
development was was mostly theoretical
 

2747
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,599
development was was mostly theoretical
so it was people using sort of primitive

2748
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:22,609
so it was people using sort of primitive
 

2749
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:25,030
so it was people using sort of primitive
kinds of particle acceleration and doing

2750
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:25,040
kinds of particle acceleration and doing
 

2751
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,480
kinds of particle acceleration and doing
experiments at the at the level of

2757
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,809

yet thinking about how to actually make

yet thinking about how to actually make
 

2759
01:03:36,819 --> 01:03:38,339
yet thinking about how to actually make
a bomb or anything like that they but

2760
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:38,349
a bomb or anything like that they but
 

2761
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:39,690
a bomb or anything like that they but
they knew the energy was there and they

2762
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:39,700
they knew the energy was there and they
 

2763
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,240
they knew the energy was there and they
figured if they understood it better it

2764
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:42,250
figured if they understood it better it
 

2765
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,680
figured if they understood it better it
might be possible but the physics

2766
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:43,690
might be possible but the physics
 

2767
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:46,470
might be possible but the physics
establishment their view and I think

2768
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,480
establishment their view and I think
 

2769
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,109
establishment their view and I think
because they did not want it to be true

2770
01:03:49,109 --> 01:03:49,119
because they did not want it to be true
 

2771
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,839
because they did not want it to be true
their view was that it could not be true

2772
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:51,849
their view was that it could not be true
 

2773
01:03:51,849 --> 01:03:56,069
their view was that it could not be true
that this could not provide a way to

2774
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:56,079
that this could not provide a way to
 

2775
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,460
that this could not provide a way to
make a super weapon and you know there

2776
01:03:59,460 --> 01:03:59,470
make a super weapon and you know there
 

2777
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:02,700
make a super weapon and you know there
was this famous speech given by

01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:02,710
was this famous speech given by
 

2779
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,920
was this famous speech given by
Rutherford who was the sort of leader of

nuclear physics and I was on September
 

2783
01:04:08,829 --> 01:04:12,240
nuclear physics and I was on September
11th 1933 and he he said you know anyone

2784
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:12,250
11th 1933 and he he said you know anyone
 

2785
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,640
11th 1933 and he he said you know anyone
who talks about the possibility of

2786
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:14,650
who talks about the possibility of
 

2787
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,430
who talks about the possibility of
obtaining energy from transformation of

obtaining energy from transformation of
 

2789
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,299
obtaining energy from transformation of
atoms is talking complete moonshine and

2790
01:04:20,299 --> 01:04:20,309
atoms is talking complete moonshine and
 

2791
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:24,349

the next the next morning Leo Szilard

2792
01:04:24,349 --> 01:04:24,359
the next the next morning Leo Szilard
 

2793
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:27,299
the next the next morning Leo Szilard
read about that speech and then invented

2794
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:27,309
read about that speech and then invented
 

2795
01:04:27,309 --> 01:04:29,609
read about that speech and then invented
the nuclear chain reaction and so as

2796
01:04:29,609 --> 01:04:29,619
the nuclear chain reaction and so as
 

2797
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:32,759
the nuclear chain reaction and so as
soon as he invented he soon as he had

2798
01:04:32,759 --> 01:04:32,769
soon as he invented he soon as he had
 

2799
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:35,490
soon as he invented he soon as he had
that idea that you could make a chain

2800
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:35,500
that idea that you could make a chain
 

2801
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,440
that idea that you could make a chain
reaction with neutrons because neutrons

2802
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:37,450
reaction with neutrons because neutrons
 

2803
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:39,450
reaction with neutrons because neutrons
were not repelled by the nucleus so they

2804
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:39,460
were not repelled by the nucleus so they
 

2805
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,980
were not repelled by the nucleus so they
could enter the nucleus and then

2806
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:40,990
could enter the nucleus and then
 

2807
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:44,099
could enter the nucleus and then
continue the reaction as soon as he has

2808
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:44,109
continue the reaction as soon as he has
 

2809
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:48,180
continue the reaction as soon as he has
that idea he instantly realized that the

2810
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:48,190
that idea he instantly realized that the
 

2811
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:52,140
that idea he instantly realized that the
world was in deep doo-doo because this

2812
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:52,150
world was in deep doo-doo because this
 

2813
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:55,220
world was in deep doo-doo because this
is 1933 right you know Hitler had

2814
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:55,230
is 1933 right you know Hitler had
 

2815
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:58,460
is 1933 right you know Hitler had
recently come to power in Germany

2816
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:58,470
recently come to power in Germany
 

2817
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:01,890
recently come to power in Germany
Zil odd was in London and eventually

01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:01,900
Zil odd was in London and eventually
 

2819
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,940
Zil odd was in London and eventually
became a refugee and and came to the US

2820
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:05,950
became a refugee and and came to the US
 

2821
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:10,859
became a refugee and and came to the US
and the in the process of having the

2822
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:10,869
and the in the process of having the
 

2823
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:13,710
and the in the process of having the
idea about the chain reaction he figured

2824
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:13,720
idea about the chain reaction he figured
 

2825
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,299
idea about the chain reaction he figured
out basically how to make a bomb and

2826
01:05:15,299 --> 01:05:15,309
out basically how to make a bomb and
 

2827
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:18,420
out basically how to make a bomb and
also how to make a reactor and he

2828
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:18,430
also how to make a reactor and he
 

2829
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,839
also how to make a reactor and he
patented the reactor

2830
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:20,849
patented the reactor
 

2831
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:25,729
patented the reactor
2:34 but because of the situation the

2832
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:25,739
2:34 but because of the situation the
 

2833
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:27,440
2:34 but because of the situation the
great power conflict situation that he

2834
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:27,450
great power conflict situation that he
 

2835
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,870
great power conflict situation that he
could see happening he kept that a

2836
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:29,880
could see happening he kept that a
 

2837
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:36,589
could see happening he kept that a
secret and so between then and the

2838
01:05:36,589 --> 01:05:36,599
secret and so between then and the
 

2839
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,219
secret and so between then and the
beginning of World War two people were

2840
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:40,229
beginning of World War two people were
 

2841
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:45,710
beginning of World War two people were
working including the Germans on how to

2842
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:45,720
working including the Germans on how to
 

2843
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,079
working including the Germans on how to
actually create Neutron sources right

2844
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:48,089
actually create Neutron sources right
 

2845
01:05:48,089 --> 01:05:51,529
actually create Neutron sources right
what specific fission reactions would

2846
01:05:51,529 --> 01:05:51,539
what specific fission reactions would
 

2847
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:54,049
what specific fission reactions would
produce neutrons of the right energy to

2848
01:05:54,049 --> 01:05:54,059
produce neutrons of the right energy to
 

2849
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:58,009
produce neutrons of the right energy to
continue the reaction and and that was

2850
01:05:58,009 --> 01:05:58,019
continue the reaction and and that was
 

2851
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:00,349
continue the reaction and and that was
demonstrated in Germany I think in 1938

2852
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:00,359
demonstrated in Germany I think in 1938
 

2853
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:03,249
demonstrated in Germany I think in 1938
if I remember correctly the first

2854
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:03,259
if I remember correctly the first
 

2855
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:08,120
if I remember correctly the first
nuclear weapon patent was 1939 by the

2856
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:08,130
nuclear weapon patent was 1939 by the
 

2857
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:12,109
nuclear weapon patent was 1939 by the
French so this was actually you know

2858
01:06:12,109 --> 01:06:12,119
French so this was actually you know
 

2859
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,270
French so this was actually you know
this was actually

2860
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:14,280
this was actually
 

2861
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,940
this was actually
going on you know well before World War

2862
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:16,950
going on you know well before World War
 

2863
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:19,550
going on you know well before World War
two really got going and then you know

2864
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:19,560
two really got going and then you know
 

2865
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,170
two really got going and then you know
the British probably had the most

2866
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:21,180
the British probably had the most
 

2867
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:24,020
the British probably had the most
advanced capability in this area but for

2868
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:24,030
advanced capability in this area but for
 

2869
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,300
advanced capability in this area but for
safety reasons among others and blush

2870
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:26,310
safety reasons among others and blush
 

2871
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:28,940
safety reasons among others and blush
which is sort of just resources they

2872
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:28,950
which is sort of just resources they
 

2873
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:31,370
which is sort of just resources they
moved the program from Britain to the US

2874
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:31,380
moved the program from Britain to the US
 

2875
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,760
moved the program from Britain to the US
and then that became Manhattan Project

2876
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:33,770
and then that became Manhattan Project
 

2877
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:39,820
and then that became Manhattan Project
so the the the reason why we couldn't

2878
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:39,830
so the the the reason why we couldn't
 

2879
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:43,460
so the the the reason why we couldn't
have any kind of oversight of nuclear

2880
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:43,470
have any kind of oversight of nuclear
 

2881
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:46,910
have any kind of oversight of nuclear
weapons and nuclear technology was

2882
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:46,920
weapons and nuclear technology was
 

2883
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,820
weapons and nuclear technology was
because we were basically already in an

2884
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:49,830
because we were basically already in an
 

2885
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:54,050
because we were basically already in an
arms race in a war and but you you've

2886
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:54,060
arms race in a war and but you you've
 

2887
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,090
arms race in a war and but you you've
mentioned then in the 20s and 30s so

2888
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:56,100
mentioned then in the 20s and 30s so
 

2889
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:00,500
mentioned then in the 20s and 30s so
what are the echoes yeah the way you've

2890
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:00,510
what are the echoes yeah the way you've
 

2891
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,120
what are the echoes yeah the way you've
described this story I mean there's

2892
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:02,130
described this story I mean there's
 

2893
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:04,160
described this story I mean there's
clearly echoes why do you think most a I

2894
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:04,170
clearly echoes why do you think most a I
 

2895
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:06,580
clearly echoes why do you think most a I

they really are not concerned about it

2900
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:11,450
they really are not concerned about it
 

2901
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:12,700
they really are not concerned about it
and they don't think about it

2902
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:12,710
and they don't think about it
 

2903
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,560
and they don't think about it
whether they don't want to think about

2904
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:14,570
whether they don't want to think about
 

2905
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:17,650
whether they don't want to think about
it it's but what are the yeah why do you

2906
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:17,660
it it's but what are the yeah why do you
 

2907
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:21,430
it it's but what are the yeah why do you
think that is what are the echoes of the

2908
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:21,440
think that is what are the echoes of the
 

2909
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,530
think that is what are the echoes of the
nuclear situation to the current

2910
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:23,540
nuclear situation to the current
 

2911
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:27,870
nuclear situation to the current
situation and what can we do about it I

2912
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:27,880
situation and what can we do about it I
 

2913
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,120
situation and what can we do about it I
think there is a you know a kinda modak

2914
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:31,130
think there is a you know a kinda modak
 

2915

you would like to be true rather than

you would like to be true rather than

you would like to be true rather than

what is true and you know it's it's
 

2923
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:47,830
what is true and you know it's it's
unsettling to think that what you're

01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:47,840
unsettling to think that what you're
 

2925
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,050
unsettling to think that what you're
working on might be the end of the human

working on might be the end of the human
race obviously so you would rather

race obviously so you would rather
 

2929
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,750
race obviously so you would rather
instantly deny it

2930
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:55,760
instantly deny it
 

2931
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,940
instantly deny it
and come up with some reason why it

2932
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:57,950
and come up with some reason why it
 

2933
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:01,030
and come up with some reason why it
couldn't be true and the you know I have

2934
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:01,040
couldn't be true and the you know I have
 

2935
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,140
couldn't be true and the you know I have
I collected a long list of reasons that

01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:04,150
I collected a long list of reasons that

materialize a black hole in near Earth
orbit right wouldn't you ask them is

2984
01:09:10,599 --> 01:09:10,609
orbit right wouldn't you ask them is
 

2985
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:12,460
orbit right wouldn't you ask them is
that a good idea is that gonna be safe

2986
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:12,470
that a good idea is that gonna be safe
 

2987
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:14,260
that a good idea is that gonna be safe
you know what if you succeed all right

2988
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:14,270
you know what if you succeed all right
 

2989
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:18,170
you know what if you succeed all right
right and that's the thing right the AI

2990
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:18,180
right and that's the thing right the AI
 

2991
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:21,230
right and that's the thing right the AI
is sort of refused to ask itself what if

2992
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:21,240
is sort of refused to ask itself what if
 

2993
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,610
is sort of refused to ask itself what if
you succeed and initially I think that

2994
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:25,620
you succeed and initially I think that
 

2995
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,440
you succeed and initially I think that
was because it was too hard but you know

2996
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:27,450
was because it was too hard but you know
 

2997
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:31,100
was because it was too hard but you know
Alan Turing asked himself that and he

2998
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:31,110
Alan Turing asked himself that and he
 

2999
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:34,670
Alan Turing asked himself that and he
said we'd be toast right if we were

3000
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:34,680
said we'd be toast right if we were
 

3001
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,440
said we'd be toast right if we were
lucky we might be able to switch off the

3002
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:36,450
lucky we might be able to switch off the
 

3003
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:38,810
lucky we might be able to switch off the
power but probably we'd be toast but

3004
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:38,820
power but probably we'd be toast but
 

3005
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:42,890
power but probably we'd be toast but
there's also an aspect that because

3006
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:42,900
there's also an aspect that because
 

3007
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,740
there's also an aspect that because
we're not exactly sure what the future

3008
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:45,750
we're not exactly sure what the future
 

3009
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:49,280
we're not exactly sure what the future
holds it's not clear exactly so

3010
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:49,290
holds it's not clear exactly so
 

3011
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,650
holds it's not clear exactly so
technically what to worry about sort of

3012
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:51,660
technically what to worry about sort of
 

3013
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:56,000
technically what to worry about sort of
how things go wrong and so there is

3014
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,010
how things go wrong and so there is
 

3015
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:58,820
how things go wrong and so there is
something it feels like maybe you can

3016
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:58,830
something it feels like maybe you can
 

3017
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,980
something it feels like maybe you can
correct me if I'm wrong but there's

3018
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:00,990
correct me if I'm wrong but there's
 

3019
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:03,200
correct me if I'm wrong but there's
something paralyzing about worrying

3020
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:03,210
something paralyzing about worrying
 

3021
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:06,020
something paralyzing about worrying
about something that logically is

3022
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:06,030
about something that logically is
 

3023
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:08,360
about something that logically is
inevitable but you don't really know

3024
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:08,370
inevitable but you don't really know
 

3025
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,240
inevitable but you don't really know
what that will look like yeah I think

3026
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:11,250
what that will look like yeah I think
 

3027
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,610
what that will look like yeah I think
that's that's it's a reasonable point

3028
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:13,620
that's that's it's a reasonable point
 

3029
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:17,540
that's that's it's a reasonable point
and you know the you know it's certainly

3030
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:17,550
and you know the you know it's certainly
 

3031
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:19,670
and you know the you know it's certainly
in terms of existential risks it's

3032
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:19,680
in terms of existential risks it's
 

3033
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,740
in terms of existential risks it's
different from you know asteroid

3034
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:21,750
different from you know asteroid
 

3035
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,390
different from you know asteroid
collides with the earth right right

3036
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:23,400
collides with the earth right right
 

3037
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,810
collides with the earth right right
which again is quite possible you know

3038
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:26,820
which again is quite possible you know
 

3039
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,850
which again is quite possible you know
it's happened in the past it'll probably

3040
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:28,860
it's happened in the past it'll probably
 

3041
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,830
it's happened in the past it'll probably
happen again we don't right we don't

3042
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:30,840
happen again we don't right we don't
 

3043
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,140
happen again we don't right we don't
know right now but if we did detect an

3044
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:33,150
know right now but if we did detect an
 

3045
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,940
know right now but if we did detect an
asteroid that was going to hit the earth

3046
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:34,950
asteroid that was going to hit the earth
 

3047
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:38,900
asteroid that was going to hit the earth
in 75 years time we'd certainly be doing

3048
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:38,910
in 75 years time we'd certainly be doing
 

3049
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:40,400
in 75 years time we'd certainly be doing
something about it well it's clear

3050
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:40,410
something about it well it's clear
 

3051
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,560
something about it well it's clear
there's got big rocks we'll probably

3052
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:42,570
there's got big rocks we'll probably
 

3053
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,000
there's got big rocks we'll probably
have a meeting you see what do we do

3054
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,010
have a meeting you see what do we do
 

3055
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,020
have a meeting you see what do we do
about the big rock

3056
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:45,030
about the big rock
 

3057
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,390
about the big rock
will they I write with a I I mean the

3058
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:47,400
will they I write with a I I mean the
 

3059
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,550
will they I write with a I I mean the
very few people who think it's not gonna

3060
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:49,560
very few people who think it's not gonna
 

3061
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,480
very few people who think it's not gonna
happen within the next 75 years

3062
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:52,490
happen within the next 75 years
 

3063
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,980
happen within the next 75 years
I know rod Brooks doesn't think it's

3064
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:53,990
I know rod Brooks doesn't think it's
 

3065
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:56,350
I know rod Brooks doesn't think it's
gonna happen maybe and ruing doesn't

3066
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:56,360
gonna happen maybe and ruing doesn't
 

3067
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,780
gonna happen maybe and ruing doesn't
think it's happened but you know a lot

3068
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:58,790
think it's happened but you know a lot
 

3069
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:02,290
think it's happened but you know a lot
of the people who work day-to-day you

3070
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:02,300
of the people who work day-to-day you
 

3071
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,950
of the people who work day-to-day you
know as you say at the rock face

3072
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
know as you say at the rock face
 

3073
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,959
know as you say at the rock face
they think it's gonna happen I think the

3074
01:11:06,959 --> 01:11:06,969
they think it's gonna happen I think the
 

3075
01:11:06,969 --> 01:11:10,770
they think it's gonna happen I think the
median estimate from AI researchers is

3076
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:10,780
median estimate from AI researchers is
 

3077
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,270
median estimate from AI researchers is
somewhere in forty to fifty years from

3078
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:12,280
somewhere in forty to fifty years from
 

3079
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,400
somewhere in forty to fifty years from
from now or maybe a little you know I

3080
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:14,410
from now or maybe a little you know I
 

3081
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,320
from now or maybe a little you know I
think in Asia they think it's gonna be

3082
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:16,330
think in Asia they think it's gonna be
 

3083
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:19,830
think in Asia they think it's gonna be
even faster than that I am I'm a little

3084
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:19,840
even faster than that I am I'm a little
 

3085
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,340
even faster than that I am I'm a little
bit more conservative I think probably

3086
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:23,350
bit more conservative I think probably
 

3087
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,229
bit more conservative I think probably
take longer than that but I think it's

3088
01:11:25,229 --> 01:11:25,239
take longer than that but I think it's
 

3089
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,680
take longer than that but I think it's
you know as happened with nuclear

3090
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:27,690
you know as happened with nuclear
 

3091
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:29,010
you know as happened with nuclear
weapons

3092
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:29,020
weapons
 

3093
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,690
weapons
well I went overnight it can happen

3094
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:30,700
well I went overnight it can happen
 

3095
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,950
well I went overnight it can happen
overnight that you have these

3096
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:31,960
overnight that you have these
 

3097
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,270
overnight that you have these
breakthroughs and we need more than one

3098
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:33,280
breakthroughs and we need more than one
 

3099
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,600
breakthroughs and we need more than one
breakthrough but you know the it's on

3100
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:36,610
breakthrough but you know the it's on
 

3101
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:39,479
breakthrough but you know the it's on
the order of half a dozen this is a very

3102
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:39,489
the order of half a dozen this is a very
 

3103
01:11:39,489 --> 01:11:41,280
the order of half a dozen this is a very
rough scale but so half a dozen

3104
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:41,290
rough scale but so half a dozen
 

3105
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:46,110
rough scale but so half a dozen
breakthroughs of that nature it would

3106
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:46,120
breakthroughs of that nature it would
 

3107
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,570
breakthroughs of that nature it would
have to happen for us to reach the

3108
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:48,580
have to happen for us to reach the
 

3109
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:52,110
have to happen for us to reach the
superhuman AI but the you know the AI

3110
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:52,120
superhuman AI but the you know the AI
 

3111
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,780
superhuman AI but the you know the AI
research community is vast now the

3112
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:54,790
research community is vast now the
 

3113
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:57,180
research community is vast now the
massive investments from governments

3114
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:57,190
massive investments from governments
 

3115
01:11:57,190 --> 01:12:00,900
massive investments from governments
from corporations tons of really really

3116
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:00,910
from corporations tons of really really
 

3117
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:02,910
from corporations tons of really really
smart people you know you just have to

3118
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:02,920
smart people you know you just have to
 

3119
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,500
smart people you know you just have to
look at the rate of progress in

3120
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:04,510
look at the rate of progress in
 

3121
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:06,690
look at the rate of progress in
different areas of AI to see that things

3122
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:06,700
different areas of AI to see that things
 

3123
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,720
different areas of AI to see that things
are moving pretty fast so to say oh it's

3124
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:09,730
are moving pretty fast so to say oh it's
 

3125
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:12,330
are moving pretty fast so to say oh it's
just gonna be thousands of years I don't

3126
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:12,340
just gonna be thousands of years I don't
 

3127
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:15,140
just gonna be thousands of years I don't
see any basis for that you know I see

3128
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:15,150
see any basis for that you know I see
 

3129
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:20,370
see any basis for that you know I see
you know for example the the Stanford

3130
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:20,380
you know for example the the Stanford
 

3131
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:24,950
you know for example the the Stanford
hundred year AI project right which is

3132
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
hundred year AI project right which is
 

3133
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,880
hundred year AI project right which is
supposed to be sort of you know the

3134
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:26,890
supposed to be sort of you know the
 

3135
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:30,090
supposed to be sort of you know the
serious establishment view their most

recent report actually said it's

3138
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:31,900
recent report actually said it's
 

3139
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,680
recent report actually said it's
probably not even possible

3140
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:33,690
probably not even possible
 

3141
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:37,709
probably not even possible
Wow right which if you want a perfect

3142
01:12:37,709 --> 01:12:37,719
Wow right which if you want a perfect
 

3143
01:12:37,719 --> 01:12:40,620
Wow right which if you want a perfect
example of people in denial

3144
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:40,630
example of people in denial
 

3145
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:43,439
example of people in denial
that's it because you know for the whole

3146
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:43,449
that's it because you know for the whole
 

3147
01:12:43,449 --> 01:12:47,580
that's it because you know for the whole
history of AI we've been saying to

3148
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:47,590
history of AI we've been saying to
 

3149
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:49,439
history of AI we've been saying to
philosophers who said it wasn't possible

3150
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:49,449
philosophers who said it wasn't possible
 

3151
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:50,729
philosophers who said it wasn't possible
well you have no idea what you're

3152
01:12:50,729 --> 01:12:50,739
well you have no idea what you're
 

3153
01:12:50,739 --> 01:12:51,750
well you have no idea what you're
talking about of course it's possible

3154
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,760
talking about of course it's possible
 

3155
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,209
talking about of course it's possible
right give me an give me an argument for

3156
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:54,219
right give me an give me an argument for
 

3157
01:12:54,219 --> 01:12:56,160
right give me an give me an argument for
why it couldn't happen and there isn't

3158
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:56,170
why it couldn't happen and there isn't
 

3159
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:59,370
why it couldn't happen and there isn't
one all right and now because people are

3160
01:12:59,370 --> 01:12:59,380
one all right and now because people are
 

3161
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,500
one all right and now because people are
worried that maybe a oh it might get a

3162
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:01,510
worried that maybe a oh it might get a
 

3163
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,390
worried that maybe a oh it might get a
bad name or or I just don't want to

3164
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:03,400
bad name or or I just don't want to
 

3165
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,180
bad name or or I just don't want to
think about this they're saying okay

3166
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:06,190
think about this they're saying okay
 

3167
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,319
think about this they're saying okay
well of course it's not really possible

3168
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:07,329
well of course it's not really possible
 

3169
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:09,660
well of course it's not really possible
you know and we imagine right imagine if

3170
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:09,670
you know and we imagine right imagine if
 

3171
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:12,750
you know and we imagine right imagine if
you know the the leaders of the cancer

3172
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:12,760
you know the the leaders of the cancer
 

3173
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,810
you know the the leaders of the cancer
biology community got up and said well

3174
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:15,820
biology community got up and said well
 

3175
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:17,640
biology community got up and said well
you know of course curing cancer it's

3176
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:17,650
you know of course curing cancer it's
 

3177
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:22,250
you know of course curing cancer it's
not really possible complete outrage and

3178
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:22,260
not really possible complete outrage and
 

3179
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:28,740
not really possible complete outrage and
dismay and you know I I find this really

3180
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:28,750
dismay and you know I I find this really
 

3181
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:34,260
dismay and you know I I find this really
a strange phenomenon so okay so if you

3182
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:34,270
a strange phenomenon so okay so if you
 

3183
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:35,459
a strange phenomenon so okay so if you
accept it as possible

3184
01:13:35,459 --> 01:13:35,469
accept it as possible
 

3185
01:13:35,469 --> 01:13:37,620
accept it as possible
and if you accept that it's probably

3186
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:37,630
and if you accept that it's probably
 

3187
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:40,340
and if you accept that it's probably
going to happen

3188
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:40,350
going to happen
 

3189
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:43,370
going to happen
the point that you're making that you

3190
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:43,380
the point that you're making that you
 

3191
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:46,880
the point that you're making that you
know how does it go wrong a valid

3192
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:46,890
know how does it go wrong a valid
 

3193
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,550
know how does it go wrong a valid
question without that without an answer

3194
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:49,560
question without that without an answer
 

3195
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,440
question without that without an answer
to that question then you stuck with

3196
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:51,450
to that question then you stuck with
 

3197
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,120
to that question then you stuck with
what I call the gorilla problem which is

3198
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:53,130
what I call the gorilla problem which is
 

3199
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,980
what I call the gorilla problem which is
you know the problem that the gorillas

3200
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:54,990
you know the problem that the gorillas
 

3201
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:57,140
you know the problem that the gorillas
face right they made something more

3202
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:57,150
face right they made something more
 

3203
01:13:57,150 --> 01:14:00,380
face right they made something more
intelligent than them namely us a few

3204
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:00,390
intelligent than them namely us a few
 

3205
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:02,810
intelligent than them namely us a few
million years ago and now now they're in

3206
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:02,820
million years ago and now now they're in
 

3207
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,810
million years ago and now now they're in
deep doo-doo yeah so there's really

3208
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:05,820
deep doo-doo yeah so there's really
 

3209
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:08,000
deep doo-doo yeah so there's really
nothing they can do they've lost the

3210
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:08,010
nothing they can do they've lost the
 

3211
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,620
nothing they can do they've lost the
control theater they failed to solve the

3212
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:09,630
control theater they failed to solve the
 

3213
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,900
control theater they failed to solve the
control problem of controlling humans

3214
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:11,910
control problem of controlling humans
 

3215
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:15,950
control problem of controlling humans
and so they've lost so we don't want to

3216
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:15,960
and so they've lost so we don't want to
 

3217
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,440
and so they've lost so we don't want to
be in that situation and if the gorillas

3218
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:18,450
be in that situation and if the gorillas
 

3219
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:20,420
be in that situation and if the gorillas
problem is is the only formulation you

3220
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:20,430
problem is is the only formulation you
 

3221
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:23,420
problem is is the only formulation you
have there's not a lot you can do right

3222
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:23,430
have there's not a lot you can do right
 

3223
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,010
have there's not a lot you can do right
other than to say okay we should try to

3224
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:25,020
other than to say okay we should try to
 

3225
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,770
other than to say okay we should try to
stop you know we should just not make

3226
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:27,780
stop you know we should just not make
 

3227
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:30,170
stop you know we should just not make
the humans or right in this case not

3228
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:30,180
the humans or right in this case not
 

3229
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,330
the humans or right in this case not
make the AI and I think that's really

3230
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:32,340
make the AI and I think that's really
 

3231
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,640
make the AI and I think that's really
hard to do

3232
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:34,650
hard to do
 

3233
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:38,600
hard to do
- I'm not actually proposing that that's

3234
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:38,610
- I'm not actually proposing that that's
 

3235
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:42,410
- I'm not actually proposing that that's
a feasible course of action I also think

3236
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:42,420
a feasible course of action I also think
 

3237
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:44,600
a feasible course of action I also think
that you know if properly control a I

3238
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:44,610
that you know if properly control a I
 

3239
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,110
that you know if properly control a I
could be incredibly beneficial so the

3240
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:48,120
could be incredibly beneficial so the
 

3241
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:52,330
could be incredibly beneficial so the
but it seems to me that there's a

3242
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:52,340
but it seems to me that there's a
 

3243
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:54,680
but it seems to me that there's a
there's a consensus that one of the

3244
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:54,690
there's a consensus that one of the
 

3245
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,200
there's a consensus that one of the
major failure modes is this loss of

3246
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:57,210
major failure modes is this loss of
 

3247
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,770
major failure modes is this loss of
control that we create AI systems that

3248
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:00,780
control that we create AI systems that
 

3249
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,700
control that we create AI systems that
are pursuing incorrect objectives and

3250
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:03,710
are pursuing incorrect objectives and
 

3251
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:08,000
are pursuing incorrect objectives and
because the AI system believes it knows

3252
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,010
because the AI system believes it knows
 

3253
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:10,100
because the AI system believes it knows
what the objective is it has no

3254
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:10,110
what the objective is it has no
 

3255
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:12,290
what the objective is it has no
incentive to listen to us anymore

3256
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:12,300
incentive to listen to us anymore
 

3257
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:15,590
incentive to listen to us anymore
so to speak right it it's just carrying

3258
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
so to speak right it it's just carrying
 

3259
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,550
so to speak right it it's just carrying
out the the strategy that it it has

3260
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:19,560
out the the strategy that it it has
 

3261
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,890
out the the strategy that it it has
computed as being the optimal solution

3262
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:23,900
computed as being the optimal solution
 

3263
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,470
computed as being the optimal solution
and you know it may be that in the

3264
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:26,480
and you know it may be that in the
 

3265
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,590
and you know it may be that in the
process it needs to acquire more

3266
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:29,600
process it needs to acquire more
 

3267
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,410
process it needs to acquire more
resources to increase the possibility of

3268
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:32,420
resources to increase the possibility of
 

3269
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:35,229
resources to increase the possibility of
success or prevent various failure modes

3270
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:35,239
success or prevent various failure modes
 

3271
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,090
success or prevent various failure modes
by defending itself against interference

3272
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:37,100
by defending itself against interference
 

3273
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:41,500
by defending itself against interference
and so that collection of problems I

3274
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:41,510
and so that collection of problems I
 

3275
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:44,189
and so that collection of problems I
think is something we can address yes

3276
01:15:44,189 --> 01:15:44,199
think is something we can address yes
 

3277
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:50,620
think is something we can address yes
that the other problems are roughly

3278
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:50,630
that the other problems are roughly
 

3279
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:54,100
that the other problems are roughly
speaking you know misuse right so even

3280
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:54,110
speaking you know misuse right so even
 

3281
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:56,350
speaking you know misuse right so even
if we solve the control problem we make

3282
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:56,360
if we solve the control problem we make
 

3283
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,689
if we solve the control problem we make
perfectly safe controllable AI systems

3284
01:15:58,689 --> 01:15:58,699
perfectly safe controllable AI systems
 

3285
01:15:58,699 --> 01:16:01,330
perfectly safe controllable AI systems
well why you know why does dr. evil

3286
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:01,340
well why you know why does dr. evil
 

3287
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,950
well why you know why does dr. evil
going to use those right he wants to

3288
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:02,960
going to use those right he wants to
 

3289
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,540
going to use those right he wants to
just take over the world and he'll make

3290
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:04,550
just take over the world and he'll make

of course there's just one of the

failure mode result in that there's

failure mode result in that there's
 

3397
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:26,000
failure mode result in that there's
probably other technology in general

probably other technology in general

detaches us from it does a bit but the

3400
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:29,590
detaches us from it does a bit but the
 

3401
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:31,830
detaches us from it does a bit but the
the the difference is that in terms of

01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:31,840
the the difference is that in terms of
 

3403
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,580
the the difference is that in terms of
the knowledge to to run our civilization

3404
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:35,590
the knowledge to to run our civilization
 

3405
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:37,740
the knowledge to to run our civilization
you know up to now we've had no

3406
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:37,750
you know up to now we've had no
 

3407
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,780
you know up to now we've had no
alternative but to put it into people's

3408
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:39,790
alternative but to put it into people's
 

3409
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:42,630
alternative but to put it into people's
heads right and if you oh it's not we're

3410
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,640
heads right and if you oh it's not we're
 

3411
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,520
heads right and if you oh it's not we're
with Google I mean so software in

01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:44,530
with Google I mean so software in
 

3413
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:46,590
with Google I mean so software in
general so I probably if computers in

3414
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:46,600
general so I probably if computers in
 

3415
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,440
general so I probably if computers in
general but but the you know the

3416
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:49,450
general but but the you know the
 

3417
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,720
general but but the you know the
knowledge of how you know how a

3418
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:51,730
knowledge of how you know how a
 

3419
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:53,460
knowledge of how you know how a
sanitation system works you know that's

3420
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:53,470
sanitation system works you know that's
 

3421
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:56,160
sanitation system works you know that's
an the AI has to understand that it's no

01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:56,170
an the AI has to understand that it's no
 

3423
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,890
an the AI has to understand that it's no
good putting it into Google so I mean we

3424
01:18:58,890 --> 01:18:58,900
good putting it into Google so I mean we
 

3425
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,720
good putting it into Google so I mean we
we've always put knowledge in on paper

3426
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:00,730
we've always put knowledge in on paper
 

3427
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:03,840
we've always put knowledge in on paper
but paper doesn't run our civilization

3428
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:03,850
but paper doesn't run our civilization
 

3429
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:05,520
but paper doesn't run our civilization
it only runs when it goes from the paper

3430
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:05,530
it only runs when it goes from the paper
 

3431
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,800
it only runs when it goes from the paper
into people's heads again right so we've

3432
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:07,810
into people's heads again right so we've
 

3433
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:10,590
into people's heads again right so we've
always propagated civilization through

3434
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:10,600
always propagated civilization through
 

3435
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,320
always propagated civilization through
human minds and we've spent about a

3436
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:13,330
human minds and we've spent about a
 

3437
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,830
human minds and we've spent about a
trillion person years doing that

3438
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:15,840
trillion person years doing that
 

3439
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,240
trillion person years doing that
literature right you you can work it out

3440
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:18,250
literature right you you can work it out
 

3441
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:20,310
literature right you you can work it out
yeah but right is about just over a

3442
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:20,320
yeah but right is about just over a
 

3443
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,840
yeah but right is about just over a
hundred billion people who've ever lived

3444
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:21,850
hundred billion people who've ever lived
 

3445
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:25,170
hundred billion people who've ever lived
and each of them has spent about ten

3446
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:25,180
and each of them has spent about ten
 

3447
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,390
and each of them has spent about ten
years learning stuff and to keep their

3448
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:27,400
years learning stuff and to keep their
 

3449
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,640
years learning stuff and to keep their
civilization going and so that's a

3450
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:29,650
civilization going and so that's a
 

3451
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,260
civilization going and so that's a
trillion person years we put into this

3452
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:31,270
trillion person years we put into this
 

3453
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:33,300
trillion person years we put into this
effort beautiful way to describe all of

3454
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:33,310
effort beautiful way to describe all of
 

3455
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,820
effort beautiful way to describe all of
civilization and now we're you know

3456
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:35,830
civilization and now we're you know
 

3457
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:37,530
civilization and now we're you know
we're danger of throwing that away so

3458
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:37,540
we're danger of throwing that away so
 

3459
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:39,780
we're danger of throwing that away so
this is a problem that AI console it's

3460
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:39,790
this is a problem that AI console it's
 

3461
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:42,300
this is a problem that AI console it's
not a technical problem it's a you know

3462
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:42,310
not a technical problem it's a you know
 

3463
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:45,780
not a technical problem it's a you know
if we do our job right the AI systems

3464
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:45,790
if we do our job right the AI systems
 

3465
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:48,150
if we do our job right the AI systems
will say you know the human race doesn't

3466
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:48,160
will say you know the human race doesn't
 

3467
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,970
will say you know the human race doesn't
in the long run want to be passengers in

3468
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:50,980
in the long run want to be passengers in
 

3469
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,190
in the long run want to be passengers in
a cruise ship the human race wants

3470
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:53,200
a cruise ship the human race wants
 

3471
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,290
a cruise ship the human race wants
autonomy this is part of human

3472
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:55,300
autonomy this is part of human
 

3473
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,070
autonomy this is part of human
preferences so we the AI systems are not

3474
01:19:59,070 --> 01:19:59,080
preferences so we the AI systems are not
 

3475
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,080
preferences so we the AI systems are not
going to do this stuff for you you've

3476
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:01,090
going to do this stuff for you you've
 

3477
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:03,630
going to do this stuff for you you've
got to do it for yourself right I'm not

3478
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:03,640
got to do it for yourself right I'm not
 

3479
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,880
got to do it for yourself right I'm not
going to carry you to the top of Everest

3480
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:05,890
going to carry you to the top of Everest
 

3481
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:08,130
going to carry you to the top of Everest
in an autonomous helicopter you have to

3482
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:08,140
in an autonomous helicopter you have to
 

3483
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:10,160
in an autonomous helicopter you have to
climb it if you want to get the benefit

3484
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:10,170
climb it if you want to get the benefit
 

3485
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:13,710
climb it if you want to get the benefit
and so on so

3486
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:13,720
and so on so
 

3487
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,930
and so on so
but I'm afraid that because we are

3488
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:15,940
but I'm afraid that because we are
 

3489
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:18,630
but I'm afraid that because we are
short-sighted and lazy we're gonna

3490
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:18,640
short-sighted and lazy we're gonna
 

3491
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:22,470
short-sighted and lazy we're gonna
override the AI systems and and there's

3492
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:22,480
override the AI systems and and there's
 

3493
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,840
override the AI systems and and there's
an amazing short story that I recommend

3494
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:24,850
an amazing short story that I recommend
 

3495
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:27,480
an amazing short story that I recommend
to everyone that I talk to about this

3496
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:27,490
to everyone that I talk to about this
 

3497
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,430
to everyone that I talk to about this
called the machine stops

3498

obesity I mean literally the whole thing

3518
01:20:59,169 --> 01:20:59,179
obesity I mean literally the whole thing
 

3519
01:20:59,179 --> 01:21:00,790
obesity I mean literally the whole thing
it's what people spend their time doing

3520
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:00,800
it's what people spend their time doing
 

3521

online courses and talking about ideas
 

3525
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,899
online courses and talking about ideas
but they never get out there in the real

3526
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:07,909
but they never get out there in the real
 

3527
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:10,540
but they never get out there in the real
world that they don't really have a lot

3528
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:10,550
world that they don't really have a lot
 

3529
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:12,939
world that they don't really have a lot
of face-to-face contact everything is

3530
01:21:12,939 --> 01:21:12,949
of face-to-face contact everything is
 

3531
01:21:12,949 --> 01:21:13,959
of face-to-face contact everything is
done online

3532
01:21:13,959 --> 01:21:13,969
done online
 

3533
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,700
done online
you know so all the things we're

3534
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:15,710
you know so all the things we're
 

3535
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:18,430
you know so all the things we're
worrying about now were described in

3536
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:18,440
worrying about now were described in
 

3537
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,080
worrying about now were described in
this story and and then the human race

3538
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:20,090
this story and and then the human race
 

3539
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:22,180
this story and and then the human race
becomes more and more dependent on the

3540
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:22,190
becomes more and more dependent on the
 

3541
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:25,959
becomes more and more dependent on the
Machine loses knowledge of how things

3542
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:25,969
Machine loses knowledge of how things
 

3543
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:29,050
Machine loses knowledge of how things
really run and then becomes vulnerable

3544
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:29,060
really run and then becomes vulnerable
 

3545
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:33,270
really run and then becomes vulnerable
to collapse and so it's a it's a pretty

3546
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:33,280
to collapse and so it's a it's a pretty
 

3547
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,189
to collapse and so it's a it's a pretty
unbelievably amazing story for someone

3548
01:21:36,189 --> 01:21:36,199
unbelievably amazing story for someone
 

3549
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:39,129
unbelievably amazing story for someone
writing in 1909 to imagine all this loss

3550
01:21:39,129 --> 01:21:39,139
writing in 1909 to imagine all this loss
 

3551
01:21:39,139 --> 01:21:41,770
writing in 1909 to imagine all this loss
yeah so there's very few people that

3552
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:41,780
yeah so there's very few people that
 

3553
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,250
yeah so there's very few people that
represent artificial intelligence more

3554
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:44,260
represent artificial intelligence more
 

3555
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:52,830
represent artificial intelligence more
than you Russell so it's all my fault

3556
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:52,840

 

3557
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:57,640

right you're often brought up as the

3558
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:57,650
right you're often brought up as the
 

3559
01:21:57,650 --> 01:22:01,540
right you're often brought up as the
person well Stuart Russell like the AI

3560
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:01,550
person well Stuart Russell like the AI
 

3561
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,520
person well Stuart Russell like the AI
person is worried about this that's why

3562
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:03,530
person is worried about this that's why
 

3563
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:06,399
person is worried about this that's why
you should be worried about it do you

3564
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:06,409
you should be worried about it do you
 

3565
01:22:06,409 --> 01:22:08,740
you should be worried about it do you
feel the burden of that I don't know if

3566
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:08,750
feel the burden of that I don't know if
 

3567
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:11,080
feel the burden of that I don't know if
you feel that at all but when I talk to

3568
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:11,090
you feel that at all but when I talk to
 

3569
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:13,750
you feel that at all but when I talk to
people like from you talk about set

3570
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:13,760
people like from you talk about set
 

3571
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,060
people like from you talk about set
people outside of computer science when

3572
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:16,070
people outside of computer science when
 

3573
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:19,090
people outside of computer science when
they think about this still Russell is

3574
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:19,100
they think about this still Russell is
 

3575
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,979
they think about this still Russell is
worried about AI safety you should be

3576
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:20,989
worried about AI safety you should be
 

3577
01:22:20,989 --> 01:22:22,689
worried about AI safety you should be
worried too do you feel the burden of

3578
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:22,699
worried too do you feel the burden of
 

3579
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:26,649
worried too do you feel the burden of
that I mean in a practical sense yeah

3580
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:26,659
that I mean in a practical sense yeah
 

3581
01:22:26,659 --> 01:22:30,240
that I mean in a practical sense yeah
because I'd yet you know a dozen

3582
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:30,250
because I'd yet you know a dozen
 

3583
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:34,510
because I'd yet you know a dozen
sometimes 25 invitations a day

3584
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:34,520
sometimes 25 invitations a day
 

3585
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,840
sometimes 25 invitations a day
to talk about it to give interviews to

3586
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:37,850
to talk about it to give interviews to
 

3587
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:40,960
to talk about it to give interviews to
write press articles and so on so in

3588
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:40,970
write press articles and so on so in
 

3589
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:44,020
write press articles and so on so in
that very practical sense I'm seeing

3590
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:44,030
that very practical sense I'm seeing
 

3591
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:46,480
that very practical sense I'm seeing
that people are concerned and really

3592
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:46,490
that people are concerned and really
 

3593
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:49,180
that people are concerned and really
interested about this are you worried

3594
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:49,190
interested about this are you worried
 

3595
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:51,340
interested about this are you worried
that you could be wrong as all good

3596
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:51,350
that you could be wrong as all good
 

3597
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:53,530
that you could be wrong as all good
scientists are of course I worry about

3598
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:53,540
scientists are of course I worry about
 

3599
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:55,960
scientists are of course I worry about
that all the time I mean that's that's

3600
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:55,970
that all the time I mean that's that's
 

3601
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:58,450
that all the time I mean that's that's
always been the way that I I've worked

3602
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:58,460
always been the way that I I've worked
 

3603
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:01,090
always been the way that I I've worked
you know is like I have an argument in

3604
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:01,100
you know is like I have an argument in
 

3605
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,940
you know is like I have an argument in
my head with myself right so I have some

3606
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:03,950
my head with myself right so I have some
 

3607
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:07,720
my head with myself right so I have some
idea and then I think okay how could

3608
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:07,730
idea and then I think okay how could
 

3609
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:10,060
idea and then I think okay how could
that be wrong or did someone else

3610
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:10,070
that be wrong or did someone else
 

3611
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,680
that be wrong or did someone else
already have that idea so I'll go and

3612
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:11,690
already have that idea so I'll go and
 

3613
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:14,500
already have that idea so I'll go and
you know search and as much literature

3614
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:14,510
you know search and as much literature
 

3615
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:16,930
you know search and as much literature
as I can't to see whether someone else

3616
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:16,940
as I can't to see whether someone else
 

3617
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,760
as I can't to see whether someone else
already thought of that or or even

3618
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:18,770
already thought of that or or even
 

3619
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:22,960
already thought of that or or even
refuted it so you know I right now I'm

3620
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:22,970
refuted it so you know I right now I'm
 

3621
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:26,670
refuted it so you know I right now I'm
I'm reading a lot of philosophy because

3622
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:26,680
I'm reading a lot of philosophy because
 

3623
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,560
I'm reading a lot of philosophy because
you know in in the form of the debate so

3624
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:29,570
you know in in the form of the debate so
 

3625
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:34,510
you know in in the form of the debate so
V over utilitarianism and other kinds of

3626
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:34,520
V over utilitarianism and other kinds of
 

3627
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:40,540
V over utilitarianism and other kinds of
moral moral formulas shall we say people

3628
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:40,550
moral moral formulas shall we say people
 

3629
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:43,240
moral moral formulas shall we say people
have already thought through some of

3630
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:43,250
have already thought through some of
 

3631
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,100
have already thought through some of
these issues but you know what one of

3632
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:45,110
these issues but you know what one of
 

3633
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:47,740
these issues but you know what one of
the things I'm I'm not seeing in a lot

3634
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:47,750
the things I'm I'm not seeing in a lot
 

3635
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,350
the things I'm I'm not seeing in a lot
of these debates is this specific idea

3636
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:50,360
of these debates is this specific idea
 

3637
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:54,400
of these debates is this specific idea
about the importance of uncertainty in

3638
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:54,410
about the importance of uncertainty in
 

3639
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:58,090
about the importance of uncertainty in
the objective that this is the way we

3640
01:23:58,090 --> 01:23:58,100
the objective that this is the way we
 

3641
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,860
the objective that this is the way we
should think about machines that are

3642
01:23:59,860 --> 01:23:59,870
should think about machines that are
 

3643
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:02,460
should think about machines that are
beneficial to humans so this idea of

3644
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:02,470
beneficial to humans so this idea of
 

3645
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:06,840
beneficial to humans so this idea of
provably beneficial machines based on

3646
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:06,850
provably beneficial machines based on
 

3647
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:09,300
provably beneficial machines based on
explicit uncertainty in the objective

3648
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:09,310
explicit uncertainty in the objective
 

3649
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:14,470
explicit uncertainty in the objective
you know it seems to be you know my gut

3650
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
you know it seems to be you know my gut
 

3651
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,080
you know it seems to be you know my gut
feeling is this is the core of it it's

3652
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:17,090
feeling is this is the core of it it's
 

3653
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:19,120
feeling is this is the core of it it's
gonna have to be elaborated in a lot of

3654
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:19,130
gonna have to be elaborated in a lot of
 

3655
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:21,880
gonna have to be elaborated in a lot of
different directions and there are a lot

3656
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:21,890
different directions and there are a lot
 

3657
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,160
different directions and there are a lot
of lis beneficial yeah but they're I

3658
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:24,170
of lis beneficial yeah but they're I
 

3659
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:27,430
of lis beneficial yeah but they're I
mean it has to be right we can't afford

3660
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,440
mean it has to be right we can't afford
 

3661
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,920
mean it has to be right we can't afford
you know hand-wavy beneficial yeah

3662
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:29,930
you know hand-wavy beneficial yeah
 

3663
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:31,810
you know hand-wavy beneficial yeah
because there are you know whenever we

3664
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:31,820
because there are you know whenever we
 

3665
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,850
because there are you know whenever we
do hand wavy stuff there are loopholes

3666
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:33,860
do hand wavy stuff there are loopholes
 

3667
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,680
do hand wavy stuff there are loopholes
and the thing about super intelligent

3668
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:35,690
and the thing about super intelligent
 

3669
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:38,620
and the thing about super intelligent
machines is they find the loopholes you

3670
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:38,630
machines is they find the loopholes you
 

3671
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:42,220
machines is they find the loopholes you
know just like you know tax evaders if

3672
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:42,230
know just like you know tax evaders if
 

3673
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:43,870
know just like you know tax evaders if
you don't write your tax law properly

3674
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:43,880
you don't write your tax law properly
 

3675
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,090
you don't write your tax law properly
that people will find loopholes and end

3676
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:46,100
that people will find loopholes and end
 

3677
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,520
that people will find loopholes and end
up paying no taxes and

3678
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:47,530
up paying no taxes and
 

3679
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:50,520
up paying no taxes and
and so you should think of it this way

3680
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:50,530
and so you should think of it this way
 

3681
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:55,729
and so you should think of it this way
and in getting those definitions right

3682
01:24:55,729 --> 01:24:55,739
and in getting those definitions right
 

3683
01:24:55,739 --> 01:25:02,310
and in getting those definitions right
you know it is really a long process you

3684
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:02,320
you know it is really a long process you
 

3685
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,540
you know it is really a long process you
know so you can you can define

3686
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:03,550
know so you can you can define
 

3687
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:05,220
know so you can you can define
mathematical frameworks and within that

3688
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:05,230
mathematical frameworks and within that
 

3689
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,899
mathematical frameworks and within that
framework you can prove mathematical

3690
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:06,909
framework you can prove mathematical
 

3691
01:25:06,909 --> 01:25:08,850
framework you can prove mathematical
theorems that yes this will you know

3692
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:08,860
theorems that yes this will you know
 

3693
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:11,040
theorems that yes this will you know
this this theoretical entity will be

3694
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,050
this this theoretical entity will be
 

3695
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:12,899
this this theoretical entity will be
proven beneficial to that theoretical

3696
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:12,909
proven beneficial to that theoretical
 

3697
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:16,470
proven beneficial to that theoretical
entity but that framework may not match

3698
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:16,480
entity but that framework may not match
 

3699
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,500
entity but that framework may not match
the real world in some crucial way so

3700
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:19,510
the real world in some crucial way so
 

3701
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:21,120
the real world in some crucial way so
long process thinking through it of

3702
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:21,130
long process thinking through it of
 

3703
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:22,859
long process thinking through it of
iterating and so on the last question

3704
01:25:22,859 --> 01:25:22,869
iterating and so on the last question
 

3705
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:26,729
iterating and so on the last question
yep you have ten seconds to answer it

3706
01:25:26,729 --> 01:25:26,739
yep you have ten seconds to answer it
 

3707
01:25:26,739 --> 01:25:29,669
yep you have ten seconds to answer it
what is your favorite sci-fi movie about

3708
01:25:29,669 --> 01:25:29,679
what is your favorite sci-fi movie about
 

3709
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:33,270
what is your favorite sci-fi movie about
AI I would say interstellar has my

3710
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,280
AI I would say interstellar has my
 

3711
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,870
AI I would say interstellar has my
favorite robots or beat it Space Odyssey

3712
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:36,880
favorite robots or beat it Space Odyssey
 

3713
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,529
favorite robots or beat it Space Odyssey
yeah yeah yeah so so tars the robots one

3714
01:25:40,529 --> 01:25:40,539
yeah yeah yeah so so tars the robots one
 

3715
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:42,569
yeah yeah yeah so so tars the robots one
of the robots in interstellar is the way

3716
01:25:42,569 --> 01:25:42,579
of the robots in interstellar is the way
 

3717
01:25:42,579 --> 01:25:45,479
of the robots in interstellar is the way
a robot should behave

3718
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:45,489
a robot should behave
 

3719
01:25:45,489 --> 01:25:50,040

and I would say ex machina is in some

3720
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:50,050
and I would say ex machina is in some
 

3721
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:53,000
and I would say ex machina is in some
ways the one like the one that makes you

3722
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,010
ways the one like the one that makes you
 

3723
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:57,120
ways the one like the one that makes you
think in a nervous kind of way about a

3724
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,130
think in a nervous kind of way about a
 

3725
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:58,919
think in a nervous kind of way about a
lot where we're going well Stuart thank

3726
01:25:58,919 --> 01:25:58,929
lot where we're going well Stuart thank
 

3727
01:25:58,929 --> 01:26:08,200
lot where we're going well Stuart thank
you so much for talking today pleasure

3728
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:08,210
