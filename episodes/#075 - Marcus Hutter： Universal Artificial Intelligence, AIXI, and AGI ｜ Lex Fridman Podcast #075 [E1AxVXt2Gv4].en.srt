00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,390
the world and now here's my conversation
 

165
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,570
the world and now here's my conversation
with Markus cutter

166
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:33,580

 

167
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,060

as a computer or maybe an information

168
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,070
as a computer or maybe an information
 

169
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,040
as a computer or maybe an information
processing system let's go with a big

170
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,050
processing system let's go with a big
 

171
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,870
processing system let's go with a big
question first okay I with a big

172
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:39,880
question first okay I with a big
 

173
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,240
question first okay I with a big
question first yeah I think it's very

174
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,250
question first yeah I think it's very
 

175
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,900
question first yeah I think it's very
interesting hypothesis or idea and I

176
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:45,910
interesting hypothesis or idea and I
 

177
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,020
interesting hypothesis or idea and I
have a background in physics so I know a

178
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,030
have a background in physics so I know a
 

179
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,880
have a background in physics so I know a
little bit about physical theories the

180
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:50,890
little bit about physical theories the
 

181
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,620
little bit about physical theories the
standard model of particle physics and

182
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:52,630
standard model of particle physics and
 

183
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,230
standard model of particle physics and
general relativity theory and they are

184
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,240
general relativity theory and they are
 

185
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,820
general relativity theory and they are
amazing and describe virtually

186
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:56,830
amazing and describe virtually
 

187
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,170
amazing and describe virtually
everything in the universe and they're

188
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,180
everything in the universe and they're
 

189
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,820
everything in the universe and they're
all in a sense computable theories I

190
00:03:59,820 --> 00:03:59,830
all in a sense computable theories I
 

191
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,380
all in a sense computable theories I
mean they're very hard to compute and

192
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,390
mean they're very hard to compute and
 

193
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,840
mean they're very hard to compute and
you know it's very elegant simple

194
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:03,850
you know it's very elegant simple
 

195
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,670
you know it's very elegant simple
theories which describe virtually

196
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
theories which describe virtually
 

197
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,040
theories which describe virtually
everything in the universe so there's a

198
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,050
everything in the universe so there's a
 

199
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,540
everything in the universe so there's a
strong indication that somehow the

200
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:12,550
strong indication that somehow the
 

201
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,900
strong indication that somehow the
universe is computable but it's a

202
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:15,910
universe is computable but it's a
 

203
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,390
universe is computable but it's a
plausible hypothesis so what what do you

204
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
plausible hypothesis so what what do you
 

205
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,800
plausible hypothesis so what what do you
think just like you said general

206
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:19,810
think just like you said general
 

207
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,470
think just like you said general
relativity quantum field theory what do

208
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:22,480
relativity quantum field theory what do
 

209
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,840
relativity quantum field theory what do
you think that the laws of physics are

210
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:24,850
you think that the laws of physics are
 

211
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,480
you think that the laws of physics are
so nice and beautiful and simple and

212
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,490
so nice and beautiful and simple and
 

213
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,620
so nice and beautiful and simple and
compressible do you think our universe

214
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,630
compressible do you think our universe
 

215
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,290
compressible do you think our universe
was designed is naturally this way are

we just focusing on the parts that are

221
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,090
especially compressible our human minds
just enjoy something about that

222
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,100
just enjoy something about that
 

223
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,460
just enjoy something about that
simplicity and in fact there's other

simplicity and in fact there's other
 

225
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,860

things that are not so compressible no I

things that are not so compressible no I
 

227
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,810

I mean of course we logically Duck
 

325
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,100
I mean of course we logically Duck
shouldn't be do experimental design but

326
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,110
shouldn't be do experimental design but
 

327
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,530
shouldn't be do experimental design but
science is about finding understanding

328
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:48,540
science is about finding understanding
 

329
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,200
science is about finding understanding
the world finding models of the world

330

the world finding models of the world
 

331
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,210
the world finding models of the world
and we can come up with crazy complex

332
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,220
and we can come up with crazy complex
 

333
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,950
and we can come up with crazy complex
models which you know explain everything

334
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
models which you know explain everything
 

335
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,980
models which you know explain everything
but predict nothing but the simple model

336
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:57,990
but predict nothing but the simple model
 

337
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,340
but predict nothing but the simple model
seem to have predictive power and it's a

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,350
seem to have predictive power and it's a
 

339
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,330
seem to have predictive power and it's a
valid question why yeah and the two

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:05,340
valid question why yeah and the two
 

341
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,100
valid question why yeah and the two
answers to that you can just accept it

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,830
answers to that you can just accept it
that is the principle of science and we

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
that is the principle of science and we
 

345
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,390
that is the principle of science and we
use this principle and it seems to be

346
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,400
use this principle and it seems to be
 

347
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,330
use this principle and it seems to be
successful we don't know why but it just

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:14,340
successful we don't know why but it just
 

349
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,910
successful we don't know why but it just

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,220
comes razor and if we start with the

assumption that the world is governed by
 

357
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,560
assumption that the world is governed by
simple rules then there's a bias toward

358
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:30,570
simple rules then there's a bias toward
 

359
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,390
simple rules then there's a bias toward
simplicity and pliant Occam's razor is

00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,400
simplicity and pliant Occam's razor is
 

361
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,160
simplicity and pliant Occam's razor is
the mechanism to finding these rules and

the mechanism to finding these rules and
 

363
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,870
the mechanism to finding these rules and
actually in a more quantitative sense

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,780
and we come back to that later in terms
of some Roman attraction you can

that the world is simple then Occam's
 

373
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,900
that the world is simple then Occam's
razor is the best you can do in a

certain sense so I apologize for the
 

377
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,570
certain sense so I apologize for the
romanticized question but why do you

romanticized question but why do you
 

379
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,330
romanticized question but why do you

think outside of its effectiveness why
 

381
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,520
think outside of its effectiveness why
do we do you think we find simplicity so

00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:58,530
do we do you think we find simplicity so
 

383
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,080
do we do you think we find simplicity so

Norris and there is a tiger right and
 

413
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,710
Norris and there is a tiger right and
eats me then I'm dead but if I try to

414
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
eats me then I'm dead but if I try to
 

415
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,290
eats me then I'm dead but if I try to
find a pattern and we know that humans

416
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:48,300
find a pattern and we know that humans
 

417
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,610
find a pattern and we know that humans
are prone to find more patterns in data

418
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:52,620
are prone to find more patterns in data
 

419
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,829
are prone to find more patterns in data
than they are you know like the you know

420
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:54,839
than they are you know like the you know
 

421
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,130

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,300
buyers towards finding patterns even if
 

425
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,750
buyers towards finding patterns even if
they are not but I mean its best of

426
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:02,760
they are not but I mean its best of
 

427
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,519
they are not but I mean its best of
course if they are yeah helps us for

428
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:04,529
course if they are yeah helps us for
 

429
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,460
course if they are yeah helps us for
survival yeah that's fascinating I

430
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:07,470
survival yeah that's fascinating I
 

431
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,110
survival yeah that's fascinating I
haven't thought really about this I

432
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
haven't thought really about this I
 

433
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,440
haven't thought really about this I
thought I just loved science but they're

434
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,450
thought I just loved science but they're
 

435
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,260
thought I just loved science but they're
indeed from in terms of just for

indeed from in terms of just for
 

437
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,050
indeed from in terms of just for

beautiful maybe a quick small tangent

444
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
beautiful maybe a quick small tangent
 

445
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,940
beautiful maybe a quick small tangent
could you describe what's Solomonov

446
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:28,950
could you describe what's Solomonov
 

447
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,180
could you describe what's Solomonov
induction is yeah so that's a theory

448
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,190
induction is yeah so that's a theory
 

449
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,230
induction is yeah so that's a theory
which I claim and Riesling enough sort

450
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
which I claim and Riesling enough sort
 

451
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
which I claim and Riesling enough sort
of claimed you know a long time ago that

452
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:37,770
of claimed you know a long time ago that
 

453
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,980
of claimed you know a long time ago that
this solves the big philosophical

454
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:39,990
this solves the big philosophical
 

455
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,040
this solves the big philosophical
problem of induction and I believe the

456
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,050
problem of induction and I believe the
 

457
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,920
problem of induction and I believe the
claim is essentially true and what it

458
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:45,930
claim is essentially true and what it
 

459
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,630
claim is essentially true and what it
does is the following so okay for the

460
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:49,640
does is the following so okay for the
 

461
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,699
does is the following so okay for the
picky listener induction can be

462
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:52,709
picky listener induction can be
 

463
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:56,090
picky listener induction can be
interpreted narrowly and wildly narrow

464
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,100
interpreted narrowly and wildly narrow
 

465
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,530
interpreted narrowly and wildly narrow
means inferring models from data and

466
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:00,540
means inferring models from data and
 

467
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,630
means inferring models from data and
widely means also then using these

468
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
widely means also then using these
 

469
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,100
widely means also then using these
models for doing predictions or

470
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,110
models for doing predictions or
 

471
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,050
models for doing predictions or
predictions also part of of the

472
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,060
predictions also part of of the
 

473
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,540
predictions also part of of the
induction so I'm little sloppy sort of

474
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:08,550
induction so I'm little sloppy sort of
 

475
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,340
induction so I'm little sloppy sort of
as a terminology and maybe that comes

476
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,350
as a terminology and maybe that comes
 

477
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,040
as a terminology and maybe that comes
from ray solomonoff you know being

478
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,050
from ray solomonoff you know being
 

479
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,020
from ray solomonoff you know being
sloppy maybe

480
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,030
sloppy maybe
 

481
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,800
sloppy maybe
saying it we can't complain anymore

482
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:17,810
saying it we can't complain anymore
 

483
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,390
saying it we can't complain anymore
so let me explain a little bit this

484
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,400
so let me explain a little bit this
 

485
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,570
so let me explain a little bit this
theory yeah in simple terms so assume we

486
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:22,580
theory yeah in simple terms so assume we
 

487
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,940
theory yeah in simple terms so assume we
have a data sequence make it very simple

488
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:24,950
have a data sequence make it very simple
 

489
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,040
have a data sequence make it very simple
the simplest one say 1 1 1 1 1 and you

490
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,050
the simplest one say 1 1 1 1 1 and you
 

491
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,170
the simplest one say 1 1 1 1 1 and you
see if 100 ones yeah what do you think

492
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:29,180
see if 100 ones yeah what do you think
 

493
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,230
see if 100 ones yeah what do you think
comes next the natural order I repeat up

494
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
comes next the natural order I repeat up
 

495
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,400
comes next the natural order I repeat up
a little bit the natural answer is of

496
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,410
a little bit the natural answer is of
 

497
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,000
a little bit the natural answer is of
course you know 1 ok and questions why

498
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,010
course you know 1 ok and questions why
 

499
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,840
course you know 1 ok and questions why
ok well we see a pattern there yeah ok

500
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:40,850
ok well we see a pattern there yeah ok
 

501
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,030
ok well we see a pattern there yeah ok
there's a 1 and we repeat it and why

502
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
there's a 1 and we repeat it and why
 

503
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,500
there's a 1 and we repeat it and why
should it suddenly after a hundred ones

504
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:44,510
should it suddenly after a hundred ones
 

505
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,210
should it suddenly after a hundred ones
be different so what we're looking for

506
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:46,220
be different so what we're looking for
 

507
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,480
be different so what we're looking for
is simple explanations or models for the

508
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,490
is simple explanations or models for the
 

509
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,640
is simple explanations or models for the
data we have and now the question is a

510
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:51,650
data we have and now the question is a
 

511
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,010
data we have and now the question is a
model has to be presented in a certain

512
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,020
model has to be presented in a certain
 

513
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,640
model has to be presented in a certain
language in which language to be used in

514
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:57,650
language in which language to be used in
 

515
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,710
language in which language to be used in
science we want formal languages and we

516
00:10:59,710 --> 00:10:59,720
science we want formal languages and we
 

517
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,800
science we want formal languages and we
can use mathematics or we can use

518
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:01,810
can use mathematics or we can use
 

519
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,290
can use mathematics or we can use
programs on a computer so abstract me on

520
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:05,300
programs on a computer so abstract me on
 

521
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,790
programs on a computer so abstract me on
a Turing machine for instance or can be

522
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
a Turing machine for instance or can be
 

523
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,180
a Turing machine for instance or can be
a general-purpose computer so and they

524
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,190
a general-purpose computer so and they
 

525
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,800
a general-purpose computer so and they
of course lots of models of you can say

526
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:11,810
of course lots of models of you can say
 

527
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,330
of course lots of models of you can say
maybe it's a hundred ones and then 100

528
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:13,340
maybe it's a hundred ones and then 100
 

529
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,950
maybe it's a hundred ones and then 100
zeros and a hundred ones that's a model

530
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:14,960
zeros and a hundred ones that's a model
 

531
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,930
zeros and a hundred ones that's a model
right but there are simpler models

532
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:16,940
right but there are simpler models
 

533
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,510
right but there are simpler models
there's a model print one loop and it

534
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:19,520
there's a model print one loop and it
 

535
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,630
there's a model print one loop and it
also explains the data and if you push

536
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
also explains the data and if you push
 

537
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,300
also explains the data and if you push
the to the extreme you are looking for

538
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,310
the to the extreme you are looking for
 

539
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,760
the to the extreme you are looking for
the shortest program which if you run

540
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:27,770
the shortest program which if you run
 

541
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,800
the shortest program which if you run
this program reproduces the data you

542
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:29,810
this program reproduces the data you
 

543
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,460
this program reproduces the data you
have it will not stop it will continue

544
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:32,470
have it will not stop it will continue
 

545
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,080
have it will not stop it will continue
naturally and this you take for your

546
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,090
naturally and this you take for your
 

547
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,090
naturally and this you take for your
prediction and on the sequence of ones

548
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,100
prediction and on the sequence of ones
 

549
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,250
prediction and on the sequence of ones
it's very plausible right at the print

550
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:39,260
it's very plausible right at the print
 

551
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,900
it's very plausible right at the print
one loop it's the shortest program we

552
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:40,910
one loop it's the shortest program we
 

553
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,060
one loop it's the shortest program we
can give some more complex examples like

554
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,070
can give some more complex examples like
 

555
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,150
can give some more complex examples like
1 2 3 4 5 what comes next the short

556
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
1 2 3 4 5 what comes next the short
 

557
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,600
1 2 3 4 5 what comes next the short
program is again you know counter and so

558
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:49,610
program is again you know counter and so
 

559
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,940
program is again you know counter and so
that is roughly speaking house a lot of

560
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:51,950
that is roughly speaking house a lot of
 

561
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,780
that is roughly speaking house a lot of
interaction works the extra twist is

562
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:55,790
interaction works the extra twist is
 

563
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,910
interaction works the extra twist is
that it can also deal with noisy data so

564
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
that it can also deal with noisy data so
 

565
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,100
that it can also deal with noisy data so
if you have for instance a coin flip say

566
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,110
if you have for instance a coin flip say
 

567
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,840
if you have for instance a coin flip say
a biased coin which comes up head with

568
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:01,850
a biased coin which comes up head with
 

569
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,370
a biased coin which comes up head with
60% probability then it will predict if

570
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:06,380
60% probability then it will predict if
 

571
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,960
60% probability then it will predict if
you learn and figure this out and after

572
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:07,970
you learn and figure this out and after
 

573
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,810
you learn and figure this out and after
a while it predict or the next coin flip

574
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:10,820
a while it predict or the next coin flip
 

575
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
a while it predict or the next coin flip
will be head with probability 60% so

576
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:12,830
will be head with probability 60% so
 

577
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,950
will be head with probability 60% so
it's the stochastic version of that but

578
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:14,960
it's the stochastic version of that but
 

579
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,200
it's the stochastic version of that but
the goal is the dream is always the

580
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,210
the goal is the dream is always the
 

581
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,240
the goal is the dream is always the
search for the short program yes yeah

582
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,250
search for the short program yes yeah
 

583
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,980
search for the short program yes yeah
well in solomonov induction precisely

584
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:20,990
well in solomonov induction precisely
 

585
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,280
well in solomonov induction precisely
what you do is so you combine so looking

586
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,290
what you do is so you combine so looking
 

587
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,350
what you do is so you combine so looking
for the shortest program is like

588
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,360
for the shortest program is like
 

589
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,580
for the shortest program is like
applying AAPIs race

590
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:27,590
applying AAPIs race
 

591
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,990
applying AAPIs race
like looking for the simplest theory

592
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,000
like looking for the simplest theory
 

593
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,750
like looking for the simplest theory
there's also a pakoras principle which

594
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
there's also a pakoras principle which
 

595
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,790
there's also a pakoras principle which
says if you have multiple hypotheses

596
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:33,800
says if you have multiple hypotheses
 

597
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,350
says if you have multiple hypotheses
which equally well describe you data

598
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
which equally well describe you data
 

599
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,150
which equally well describe you data
don't discard any of them keep all of

600
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,160
don't discard any of them keep all of
 

601
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,520
don't discard any of them keep all of
them around you never know and you can

602
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:39,530
them around you never know and you can
 

603
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,410
them around you never know and you can
put it together and say ok have a

604
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:41,420
put it together and say ok have a
 

605
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,690
put it together and say ok have a
buyer's to her simplicity but I don't

606
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:43,700
buyer's to her simplicity but I don't
 

607
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,210
buyer's to her simplicity but I don't
rule out the larger models and

608
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:45,220
rule out the larger models and
 

609
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,970
rule out the larger models and
technically what we do is we weigh the

610
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:48,980
technically what we do is we weigh the
 

611
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,340
technically what we do is we weigh the
shorter models higher and the longer

612
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,350
shorter models higher and the longer
 

613
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,160
shorter models higher and the longer
models lower and you use a Bayesian

614
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,170
models lower and you use a Bayesian
 

615
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,620
models lower and you use a Bayesian
techniques you have a prior and which is

616
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:58,630
techniques you have a prior and which is
 

617
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,330
techniques you have a prior and which is
precisely 2 to the minus the complexity

618
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:01,340
precisely 2 to the minus the complexity
 

619
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,850
precisely 2 to the minus the complexity
of the program and you weigh all this

620
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:03,860
of the program and you weigh all this
 

621
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,500
of the program and you weigh all this
hypotheses and take this mixture and

622
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:05,510
hypotheses and take this mixture and
 

623
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,240
hypotheses and take this mixture and
then you get also this plasticity in

624
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,250
then you get also this plasticity in
 

625
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,670
then you get also this plasticity in
yeah like many of your ideas that's just

626
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
yeah like many of your ideas that's just
 

627
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,650
yeah like many of your ideas that's just
a beautiful idea of weighing based on

628
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:11,660
a beautiful idea of weighing based on
 

629
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,450
a beautiful idea of weighing based on
the simplicity of the program I love

630
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:13,460
the simplicity of the program I love
 

631
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,510
the simplicity of the program I love
that that that seems to me may be a very

00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,200

appealing way of discovering good

636
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,210
appealing way of discovering good
 

637
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,690
appealing way of discovering good
programs in this world you've used the

638
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:25,700
programs in this world you've used the
 

639
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,450
programs in this world you've used the

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:31,670
it's a beautiful idea sort of we just
 

643
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,640
it's a beautiful idea sort of we just
talked about simplicity and maybe

644
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:33,650
talked about simplicity and maybe
 

645
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,030

00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:40,889
data sequence just think about a file on
 

741
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,980

just a string of bits and if you and we
 

745
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,480
just a string of bits and if you and we
have data compresses likely compress big

needing an extra decompressor it's just

758
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:03,240
needing an extra decompressor it's just
 

759
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,090
needing an extra decompressor it's just
a decompressor plus the archive together

760
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,100
a decompressor plus the archive together
 

761
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,910
a decompressor plus the archive together
in one and now there are better and

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
in one and now there are better and
 

763
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,590
in one and now there are better and
worse compressors and you can ask what

764
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
worse compressors and you can ask what
 

765
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,780
worse compressors and you can ask what
is the ultimate compressor so what is

766
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:11,790
is the ultimate compressor so what is
 

767
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,299
is the ultimate compressor so what is
the shortest possible self-extracting

768
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:14,309
the shortest possible self-extracting
 

769

data set yeah which reproduces the data

772
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,290
data set yeah which reproduces the data
 

773
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,499
data set yeah which reproduces the data
set and the length of this is called the

774
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:21,509
set and the length of this is called the
 

775
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:24,799
set and the length of this is called the
Kolmogorov complexity and arguably that

776
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:24,809
Kolmogorov complexity and arguably that
 

777
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:27,590
Kolmogorov complexity and arguably that
is the information content in the data

778
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
is the information content in the data
 

779
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,910
is the information content in the data
set I mean if the data set is very

780
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:28,920
set I mean if the data set is very
 

781
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,769
set I mean if the data set is very
redundant or very boring you can

782
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:30,779
redundant or very boring you can
 

783
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,299
redundant or very boring you can
compress it very well so the information

784
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:32,309
compress it very well so the information
 

785
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:35,600
compress it very well so the information
content should be low and you know it is

786
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:35,610
content should be low and you know it is
 

787
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,189
content should be low and you know it is
low according to this difference this is

788
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
low according to this difference this is
 

789
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,859
low according to this difference this is
the length of the shortest program that

790
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:39,869
the length of the shortest program that
 

791
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:42,799
the length of the shortest program that
summarizes the data yes yeah and what's

792
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:42,809
summarizes the data yes yeah and what's
 

793
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:46,730
summarizes the data yes yeah and what's
your sense of our sort of universe when

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,730
your sense of our sort of universe when
we think about the different the

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,470
we think about the different the

00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:56,430
at every level do they have higher or
 

803
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,439
at every level do they have higher or
local girl complexity so what's the hope

804
00:16:59,439 --> 00:16:59,449
local girl complexity so what's the hope
 

805
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,910
local girl complexity so what's the hope
do we have a lot of hope and be able to

806
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
do we have a lot of hope and be able to
 

807
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,220
do we have a lot of hope and be able to
summarize much of our world that's a

808
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,230
summarize much of our world that's a
 

809
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,789
summarize much of our world that's a
tricky and difficult question so as I

810
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
tricky and difficult question so as I
 

811
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,770
tricky and difficult question so as I
said before I believe that the whole

812
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:12,780
said before I believe that the whole
 

813
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,630
said before I believe that the whole
universe based on the evidence we have

814
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
universe based on the evidence we have
 

815
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,689
universe based on the evidence we have
is very simple so it has a very short

816
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:17,699
is very simple so it has a very short
 

817
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,819
is very simple so it has a very short
description the whole sorry did you

818
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:19,829
description the whole sorry did you
 

819
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,710
description the whole sorry did you
would you linger on that the whole

820
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:21,720
would you linger on that the whole
 

821
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,409
would you linger on that the whole
universe what does I mean do you mean at

822
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:24,419
universe what does I mean do you mean at
 

823
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,809
universe what does I mean do you mean at
the very basic fundamental level in

824
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:26,819
the very basic fundamental level in
 

825
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,480
the very basic fundamental level in
order to create the universe yes yeah so

826
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,490
order to create the universe yes yeah so
 

827
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,299
order to create the universe yes yeah so
you need a very short program when you

828
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:32,309
you need a very short program when you
 

829
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,340
you need a very short program when you
run it to get the thing going you get

830
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,350
run it to get the thing going you get
 

831
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,510
run it to get the thing going you get
the thing going and then it will

832
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
the thing going and then it will
 

833
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,700
the thing going and then it will
reproduce our universe and there's a

834
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:37,710
reproduce our universe and there's a
 

835
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,370
reproduce our universe and there's a
problem with noise we can come back to

836
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:40,380
problem with noise we can come back to
 

837
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,220
problem with noise we can come back to
the later possibly noise a problem or a

838
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,230
the later possibly noise a problem or a
 

839
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,580
the later possibly noise a problem or a
fear is it a bug or a feature I would

840
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:46,590
fear is it a bug or a feature I would
 

841
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,220
fear is it a bug or a feature I would
say it makes our life as a scientist

842
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,230
say it makes our life as a scientist
 

843
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,640
say it makes our life as a scientist
really really much harder I didn't think

844
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:52,650
really really much harder I didn't think
 

845
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,110
really really much harder I didn't think
about without noise we wouldn't need all

846
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,120
about without noise we wouldn't need all
 

847
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,690
about without noise we wouldn't need all
of the statistics but that maybe we

848
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:56,700
of the statistics but that maybe we
 

849
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,520
of the statistics but that maybe we
wouldn't feel like there's a free will

850
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:58,530
wouldn't feel like there's a free will
 

851
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,580
wouldn't feel like there's a free will
maybe we need that for the ethics this

852
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:01,590
maybe we need that for the ethics this
 

853
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,630
maybe we need that for the ethics this
is an illusion that Norris can give you

freezing that way it's a feature but

856
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:06,809
freezing that way it's a feature but
 

857
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:09,230
freezing that way it's a feature but
also if you don't have noise you have

858
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,240
also if you don't have noise you have
 

859
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,750
also if you don't have noise you have
chaotic phenomena which are effectively

860
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
chaotic phenomena which are effectively
 

861
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,450
chaotic phenomena which are effectively
like noise so we can't you know get away

862
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:14,460
like noise so we can't you know get away
 

863
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,490
like noise so we can't you know get away
with statistics even then I mean think

864
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:16,500
with statistics even then I mean think
 

865
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,260
with statistics even then I mean think
about rolling a dice and you know forget

about rolling a dice and you know forget

about quantum mechanics and you know
 

869
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,560
about quantum mechanics and you know
exactly how you you throw it but I mean

870
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:21,570
exactly how you you throw it but I mean
 

871
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,880
exactly how you you throw it but I mean
it's still so hard to compute a

general relativity I mean we don't have
 

891
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,090

may hopefully be simple and then you

00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:55,980
may hopefully be simple and then you
 

899
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,440
may hopefully be simple and then you
just run it and then you would reproduce

900
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,450
just run it and then you would reproduce
 

901
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,289
just run it and then you would reproduce

917
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,600
couple of equations this is a hugely
complex just so interesting so when you

918
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:20,610
complex just so interesting so when you
 

919
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,280
complex just so interesting so when you
look at the window like the whole thing

920
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,290
look at the window like the whole thing
 

921
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,810
look at the window like the whole thing
might be simple when you just take a

00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:23,820
might be simple when you just take a
 

923
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,049
might be simple when you just take a
small window then it may become complex

924
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:27,059
small window then it may become complex
 

925
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,880
small window then it may become complex
and that may be counterintuitive but

926
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:28,890
and that may be counterintuitive but
 

927
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,360
and that may be counterintuitive but
there's a very nice analogy the the book

928
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,370
there's a very nice analogy the the book
 

929
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,940
there's a very nice analogy the the book
the library of all books so imagine you

930
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:34,950
the library of all books so imagine you
 

931
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,650
the library of all books so imagine you
have a normal library with interesting

932
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:36,660
have a normal library with interesting
 

933
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,510
have a normal library with interesting
books and you go there great lots of

934
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,520
books and you go there great lots of
 

935
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,450
books and you go there great lots of
information and you quite complex yeah

936
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:41,460
information and you quite complex yeah
 

937
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,490
information and you quite complex yeah
so now I create a library which contains

938
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:43,500
so now I create a library which contains
 

939
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,909
so now I create a library which contains
all possible books say of 500 pages so

940
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:46,919
all possible books say of 500 pages so
 

941
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,100
all possible books say of 500 pages so
the first book just has a aaaa over all

942
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,110
the first book just has a aaaa over all
 

943
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,960
the first book just has a aaaa over all
the pages the next book aaaa and ends

944
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:50,970
the pages the next book aaaa and ends
 

945
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,940
the pages the next book aaaa and ends
with P and so on I create this library

946
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:52,950
with P and so on I create this library
 

947
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,159
with P and so on I create this library
of all books I can write a super short

948
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:55,169
of all books I can write a super short
 

949
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:56,960
of all books I can write a super short
program which creates this library so

950
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:56,970
program which creates this library so
 

951
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,120
program which creates this library so
this library which has all books has

952
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,130
this library which has all books has
 

953
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,669
this library which has all books has
zero information content and you take a

954
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
zero information content and you take a
 

955
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,500
zero information content and you take a
subset of this library and suddenly have

956
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:03,510
subset of this library and suddenly have
 

957
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,630
subset of this library and suddenly have
a lot of information in there so that's

958
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:05,640

1118
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:27,390
possible what's your intuition you think
 

1119
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,970
possible what's your intuition you think
it's possible to reverse engineer and

1120
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:28,980
it's possible to reverse engineer and
 

1121
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,970
it's possible to reverse engineer and
find the short program that generated

1122
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:30,980
find the short program that generated
 

1123

find the short program that generated
the these fractals sort of by what

1124
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:34,169
the these fractals sort of by what

00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:35,210
the these fractals sort of by what
looking

1127
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,370
looking
at the fractals well in principle yes

1128
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:37,380
at the fractals well in principle yes
 

1129
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,580
at the fractals well in principle yes
yeah so I mean in principle what you can

1130
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:40,590
yeah so I mean in principle what you can
 

1131
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,340
yeah so I mean in principle what you can
do is you take you know any data set you

1132
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:43,350
do is you take you know any data set you
 

1133
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,930
do is you take you know any data set you
know you take these fractals or you take

1134
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:44,940
know you take these fractals or you take
 

1135
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,260
know you take these fractals or you take
whatever your data set whatever you have

1136
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:47,270
whatever your data set whatever you have
 

1137
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,020
whatever your data set whatever you have
say a picture of conveys game of life

some of these programs produced the
 

1157
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,130
some of these programs produced the
correct data then you stop and then you

1158
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,140
correct data then you stop and then you
 

1159
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,780
correct data then you stop and then you
have already used some program it may be

1160
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:14,790
have already used some program it may be
 

1161
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,490
have already used some program it may be
a long program because it's faster and

a long program because it's faster and
 

1163
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,740
a long program because it's faster and
then you continue and you get shorter

1164
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:18,750
then you continue and you get shorter
 

1165
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,120
then you continue and you get shorter
and shorter programs until you

1166
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,130
and shorter programs until you
 

1167
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,610
and shorter programs until you
eventually find the shortest program the

1168
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:22,620
eventually find the shortest program the
 

1169
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,870

whether to short this program because

1172
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:25,680
whether to short this program because
 

1173
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,440
whether to short this program because
there could be an even shorter program

1174
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:27,450
there could be an even shorter program
 

1175
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,250
there could be an even shorter program
which is just even slower and you just

1176
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,260
which is just even slower and you just
 

1177
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,740
which is just even slower and you just
have to wait here but asymptotically and

1178
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:33,750
have to wait here but asymptotically and
 

1179
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,450
have to wait here but asymptotically and
actually after finite time you have this

1180
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:35,460
actually after finite time you have this
 

1181
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,100
actually after finite time you have this
shortest program so this is a

1182
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,110
shortest program so this is a
 

1183
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,530
shortest program so this is a
theoretical but completely impractical

1184
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:39,540

intelligently and then if you take

1196
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,050
intelligently and then if you take
 

1197
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,620

there's friends the field of
pseudo-random numbers yeah and these are

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,010
pseudo-random numbers yeah and these are
 

1203
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,350
pseudo-random numbers yeah and these are
random that must so these are

1204
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,360
random that must so these are
 

1205
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,440

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,270
impressive and but it these words have
been very carefully chosen and there is

1276
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:51,280
been very carefully chosen and there is
 

1277
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,460
been very carefully chosen and there is
a mathematical theory behind it and we

1278
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:53,470
a mathematical theory behind it and we
 

1279
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,700
a mathematical theory behind it and we
come back to that later and if you look

1280
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:56,710
come back to that later and if you look
 

1281
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,000
come back to that later and if you look
at this this definition right itself it

1282
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,010
at this this definition right itself it
 

1283
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,430
at this this definition right itself it
seems like yeah okay but it seems a lot

1284
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:02,440
seems like yeah okay but it seems a lot
 

1285
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,500
seems like yeah okay but it seems a lot
of things are missing but if you think

1286
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:04,510
of things are missing but if you think
 

1287
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,370
of things are missing but if you think
it through then you realize that most

1288
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:08,380
it through then you realize that most
 

1289
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,950
it through then you realize that most
and I claim all of the other traits at

1290
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
and I claim all of the other traits at
 

1291
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,170
and I claim all of the other traits at
least of rational intelligence which we

1292
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,180
least of rational intelligence which we
 

1293
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,730
least of rational intelligence which we
usually associate intelligence are

1294
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:14,740
usually associate intelligence are
 

1295
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,540
usually associate intelligence are

knowledge you all need that in order to

1300
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,010
knowledge you all need that in order to
 

1301
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,920
knowledge you all need that in order to
perform well in a wide range of

1302
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:25,930
perform well in a wide range of
 

1303
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,140
perform well in a wide range of
environments so you don't have to

1304
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,150
environments so you don't have to
 

1305
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,030
environments so you don't have to
explicitly mention that in a definition

1306
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,040
explicitly mention that in a definition
 

1307
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,700
explicitly mention that in a definition
interesting so yeah so the consciousness

1308
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:32,710
interesting so yeah so the consciousness
 

1309
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,010
interesting so yeah so the consciousness
abstract reasoning or all these kinds of

1310
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:35,020
abstract reasoning or all these kinds of
 

1311
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,540
abstract reasoning or all these kinds of
things are just emerging phenomena that

1312
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:36,550
things are just emerging phenomena that
 

1313
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:41,400
things are just emerging phenomena that
help you in towards can you say the

1314
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,410
help you in towards can you say the
 

1315
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,580
help you in towards can you say the
definition against multiple environments

1316
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:43,590
definition against multiple environments
 

1317
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,980
definition against multiple environments
did you mention or goals no but we have

1318
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:46,990
did you mention or goals no but we have
 

1319
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,330
did you mention or goals no but we have
an alternative definition instead of

1320
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:48,340
an alternative definition instead of
 

1321
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,070
an alternative definition instead of
performing value conscious replace it by

1322
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
performing value conscious replace it by
 

1323
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,950
performing value conscious replace it by
goals so intelligence measures an agent

1324
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:52,960
goals so intelligence measures an agent
 

1325
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,870
goals so intelligence measures an agent
ability to achieve goals in a wide range

1326
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
ability to achieve goals in a wide range
 

1327
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,540
ability to achieve goals in a wide range
of environments that's more or less

1328
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:56,550
of environments that's more or less
 

1329
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,100
of environments that's more or less
because in there there's an injection of

1330
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,110
because in there there's an injection of
 

1331
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,480
because in there there's an injection of
the word goals so you

1332
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:00,490
the word goals so you
 

1333
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,820
the word goals so you
to specify their there should be a goal

1334
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:02,830
to specify their there should be a goal
 

1335
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,310
to specify their there should be a goal
yeah but perform well is sort of what is

1336
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:05,320
yeah but perform well is sort of what is
 

1337
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,570
yeah but perform well is sort of what is
it does it mean it's the same problem

1338
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:06,580
it does it mean it's the same problem
 

1339
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,990
it does it mean it's the same problem
yeah there's a little gray area but it's

1340
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000
yeah there's a little gray area but it's
 

1341
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,580
yeah there's a little gray area but it's
much closer to something that could be

1342
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:11,590
much closer to something that could be
 

1343
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,740
much closer to something that could be
formalized re in your view are humans

1344
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:15,750
formalized re in your view are humans
 

1345
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,970
formalized re in your view are humans
where do humans fit into that definition

1346
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:17,980
where do humans fit into that definition
 

1347
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,200
where do humans fit into that definition
are they general intelligence systems

1348
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,210
are they general intelligence systems
 

1349
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,140
are they general intelligence systems
that are able to perform in like how

1350
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,150
that are able to perform in like how
 

1351
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,120
that are able to perform in like how
good are they at fulfilling that

1352
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,130
good are they at fulfilling that
 

1353
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,190
good are they at fulfilling that
definition at performing well in

1354
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,200
definition at performing well in
 

1355
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,460
definition at performing well in
multiple environments yeah that's a big

1356
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,470
multiple environments yeah that's a big
 

1357
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,080
multiple environments yeah that's a big
question I mean the humans are

1358
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,090
question I mean the humans are
 

1359
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,919
question I mean the humans are
performing best among all species as we

1360
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:37,929
performing best among all species as we
 

1361
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:41,520
performing best among all species as we
know we know of yeah depends you could

1362
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:41,530
know we know of yeah depends you could
 

1363
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,799
know we know of yeah depends you could
say that trees and plants are doing

1364
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:43,809
say that trees and plants are doing
 

1365
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:45,750
say that trees and plants are doing
better job they'll probably outlast us

1366
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
better job they'll probably outlast us
 

1367
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,180
better job they'll probably outlast us
so yeah but they're in a much more

1368
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,190
so yeah but they're in a much more
 

1369
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,950
so yeah but they're in a much more
narrow environment right I mean you just

1370
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:49,960
narrow environment right I mean you just
 

1371
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,210
narrow environment right I mean you just
you know I have a little bit of air

1372
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:51,220
you know I have a little bit of air
 

1373
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,370
you know I have a little bit of air
pollutions and these trees die and we

1374
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:53,380
pollutions and these trees die and we
 

1375
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,870
pollutions and these trees die and we
can adapt right we build houses with

1376
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:54,880
can adapt right we build houses with
 

1377
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,850
can adapt right we build houses with
filters we we we do geoengineering so

1378
00:28:59,850 --> 00:28:59,860
filters we we we do geoengineering so
 

1379
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,590
filters we we we do geoengineering so
multiple environment part yes that is

1380
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:01,600
multiple environment part yes that is
 

1381
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,669
multiple environment part yes that is
very important yes

1382
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:02,679
very important yes
 

1383
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,770
very important yes
so that distinguish narrow intelligence

1384
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:04,780
so that distinguish narrow intelligence
 

1385
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,600
so that distinguish narrow intelligence
from wide intelligence also in the AI

1386
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:06,610
from wide intelligence also in the AI
 

1387
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,310
from wide intelligence also in the AI
research so let me ask the the Alan

1388
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:11,320
research so let me ask the the Alan
 

1389
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,460
research so let me ask the the Alan
Turing question can machines think can

1390
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:14,470
Turing question can machines think can
 

1391
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,180
Turing question can machines think can
machines be intelligent so in your view

1392
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,190
machines be intelligent so in your view
 

1393
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,100
machines be intelligent so in your view
I have to kind of ask the answer is

1394
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,110
I have to kind of ask the answer is
 

1395
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,290
I have to kind of ask the answer is
probably yes but I want to kind of here

1396
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:22,300
probably yes but I want to kind of here
 

1397
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,650
probably yes but I want to kind of here
with your thoughts on it can machines be

1398
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:25,660
with your thoughts on it can machines be
 

1399
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,960
with your thoughts on it can machines be
made to fulfill this definition of

00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,299
intelligence to achieve intelligence
well we are sort of getting there and

1404
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:33,309
well we are sort of getting there and
 

1405
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:35,490
well we are sort of getting there and
you know on a small scale we are already

1406
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:35,500
you know on a small scale we are already
 

1407
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,760
you know on a small scale we are already
there the wide range of environments is

1408
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:38,770
there the wide range of environments is
 

1409
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,560
there the wide range of environments is
missing about yourself driving cars we

1410
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:40,570
missing about yourself driving cars we
 

1411
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,990
missing about yourself driving cars we
have programs which play go and chess we

1412
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,000
have programs which play go and chess we
 

1413
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,120
have programs which play go and chess we
have speech recognition so it's pretty

1414
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,130
have speech recognition so it's pretty
 

1415
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,310
have speech recognition so it's pretty
amazing but you can you know these are

1416
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,320
amazing but you can you know these are
 

1417
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,460
amazing but you can you know these are
narrow environments but if you look at

1418
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:50,470
narrow environments but if you look at
 

1419
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,830
narrow environments but if you look at
alpha zero that was also developed by

1420
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:52,840
alpha zero that was also developed by
 

1421
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,440
alpha zero that was also developed by
deep mind I mean what famous alphago and

1422
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,450
deep mind I mean what famous alphago and
 

1423
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,990
deep mind I mean what famous alphago and
then came alpha zero a year later there

1424
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,000
then came alpha zero a year later there
 

1425
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,190
then came alpha zero a year later there
was truly amazing

1426
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
was truly amazing
 

1427
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,070
was truly amazing
so on reform a learning algorithm which

1428
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
so on reform a learning algorithm which
 

1429
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,700
so on reform a learning algorithm which
is able just by self play to play chess

1430
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:05,710
is able just by self play to play chess
 

1431
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,659
is able just by self play to play chess
and then also go and I mean yes they're

1432
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:09,669
and then also go and I mean yes they're
 

1433
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:10,890
and then also go and I mean yes they're
both games but they're quite different

1434
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:10,900
both games but they're quite different
 

1435
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,769
both games but they're quite different
games and you know this you didn't don't

1436
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:13,779
games and you know this you didn't don't
 

1437
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,779
games and you know this you didn't don't
feed them the rules of the game and the

1438
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:15,789
feed them the rules of the game and the
 

1439
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:17,279
feed them the rules of the game and the
most remarkable thing which is still a

1440
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:17,289
most remarkable thing which is still a
 

1441
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,649
most remarkable thing which is still a
mystery to me that usually for any

1442
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:19,659
mystery to me that usually for any
 

1443
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,539
mystery to me that usually for any
decent chess program I don't know much

1444
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:21,549
decent chess program I don't know much
 

1445
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:24,899
decent chess program I don't know much
about go you need opening books and

1446
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:24,909
about go you need opening books and
 

1447
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:28,589
about go you need opening books and
endgame tables and so on - and nothing

1448
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:28,599
endgame tables and so on - and nothing
 

1449
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,149
endgame tables and so on - and nothing
in there nothing was put in there it was

1450
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:30,159
in there nothing was put in there it was
 

1451
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,950
in there nothing was put in there it was

uh yeah it did rediscovered you know all

1458
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:41,379
uh yeah it did rediscovered you know all
 

1459
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:43,820
uh yeah it did rediscovered you know all
these famous openings within four hours

what I was really happy about I'm a
 

1465
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,169
what I was really happy about I'm a
terrible chess player but I like queen

1466
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:49,179
terrible chess player but I like queen
 

1467
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:51,989

Gumby and alpha zero figured out that

1468
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:51,999
Gumby and alpha zero figured out that
 

1469
00:30:51,999 --> 00:31:00,299
Gumby and alpha zero figured out that
this is the best opening correct so yes

1470
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:00,309
this is the best opening correct so yes
 

1471
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:01,859
this is the best opening correct so yes
that you do to answer your question yes

1472
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:01,869
that you do to answer your question yes

I believe that general intelligence is

1474
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519
I believe that general intelligence is
 

1475
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,649
I believe that general intelligence is
possible and it also depends how you

1476
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:07,659
possible and it also depends how you
 

1477
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,769
possible and it also depends how you
define it do you say AGI with general

1478
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:10,779
define it do you say AGI with general

intelligence artificial general

1480
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:12,129
intelligence artificial general
 

1481
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:14,820
intelligence artificial general
intelligence only refers to if you

1482
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:14,830
intelligence only refers to if you
 

1483
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,459
intelligence only refers to if you
achieve human-level or a subhuman level

1484
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:17,469
achieve human-level or a subhuman level
 

1485
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:19,440
achieve human-level or a subhuman level
but quite broad is it also general

1486
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:19,450
but quite broad is it also general
 

1487
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,759
but quite broad is it also general
intelligence so we have to distinguish

1488
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:20,769
intelligence so we have to distinguish
 

1489
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:23,099
intelligence so we have to distinguish
or it's only super human intelligence

1490
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:23,109
or it's only super human intelligence
 

1491
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:25,379
or it's only super human intelligence
general artificial intelligence is there

1492
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:25,389
general artificial intelligence is there
 

1493
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:27,479
general artificial intelligence is there
a test in your mind like the Turing test

1494
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:27,489
a test in your mind like the Turing test
 

1495
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:29,489
a test in your mind like the Turing test
for natural language or some other test

1496
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:29,499
for natural language or some other test
 

1497
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:31,349
for natural language or some other test
that would impress the heck out of you

1498
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:31,359
that would impress the heck out of you
 

1499
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,359
that would impress the heck out of you
that would kind of cross the line of

1500
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:35,369
that would kind of cross the line of
 

1501
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:38,459
that would kind of cross the line of
your sense of intelligence within the

1502
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:38,469
your sense of intelligence within the
 

1503
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:40,440
your sense of intelligence within the
framework that you said well the Turing

1504
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,450
framework that you said well the Turing
 

1505
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,139
framework that you said well the Turing
test well has been criticized a lot but

1506
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:43,149
test well has been criticized a lot but
 

1507
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:44,959
test well has been criticized a lot but
I think it's not as bad as some people

1508
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:44,969
I think it's not as bad as some people
 

1509
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,799
I think it's not as bad as some people
thinking some people think it's too

1510
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:46,809
thinking some people think it's too
 

1511
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:47,430
thinking some people think it's too
strong

1512
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,440
strong
 

1513
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,479
strong
so it tests not just for a system to be

1514
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:51,489
so it tests not just for a system to be
 

1515
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:53,899
so it tests not just for a system to be
intelligent but it also has to fake

1516
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:53,909
intelligent but it also has to fake
 

1517
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:57,119
intelligent but it also has to fake
human deception this section right which

1518
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:57,129
human deception this section right which
 

1519
00:31:57,129 --> 00:31:59,879
human deception this section right which
is you know much harder and on the other

1520
00:31:59,879 --> 00:31:59,889
is you know much harder and on the other
 

1521
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:01,320
is you know much harder and on the other
hand they say it's too weak yeah because

1522
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:01,330
hand they say it's too weak yeah because
 

1523
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,149
hand they say it's too weak yeah because
it just may be fakes

1524
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:03,159
it just may be fakes
 

1525
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:06,570
it just may be fakes
you know emotions or intelligent

1526
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:06,580
you know emotions or intelligent
 

1527
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,079
you know emotions or intelligent
behavior it's not real but I don't think

1528
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,089
behavior it's not real but I don't think
 

1529
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:10,979
behavior it's not real but I don't think
that's the problem

1530
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:10,989
that's the problem
 

1531
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:13,409
that's the problem
or big problem so if if you would pass

1532
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:13,419
or big problem so if if you would pass
 

1533
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:15,269
or big problem so if if you would pass

so conversation over terminal with a bot

1536
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:18,580
so conversation over terminal with a bot
 

1537
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,049
so conversation over terminal with a bot
for an hour or maybe a day or so and you

1538
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:22,059
for an hour or maybe a day or so and you
 

1539
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:24,779
for an hour or maybe a day or so and you
can fool a human into you know not

1540
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:24,789
can fool a human into you know not
 

1541
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:26,129
can fool a human into you know not
knowing whether this is a human or not

1542
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:26,139
knowing whether this is a human or not
 

1543
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:26,610
knowing whether this is a human or not
that it's

1544
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:26,620
that it's
 

1545
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,090
that it's
during tests I would be truly impressed

1546
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:30,100
during tests I would be truly impressed
 

1547
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,799
during tests I would be truly impressed
and we have this annual competitions

1548
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:31,809
and we have this annual competitions
 

1549

and we have this annual competitions
alumna price and I mean it started with

1550
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:35,559
alumna price and I mean it started with
 

1551
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,230
alumna price and I mean it started with
Elijah that was the first conversational

1552
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,240
Elijah that was the first conversational
 

1553
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,320
Elijah that was the first conversational
program and what is it called the

1554
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,330
program and what is it called the
 

1555
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,090
program and what is it called the
Japanese Mitsouko or so that's the

1556
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:42,100
Japanese Mitsouko or so that's the
 

1557
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,650
Japanese Mitsouko or so that's the
winner of the last you know a couple of

1558
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:43,660
winner of the last you know a couple of
 

1559
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,440
winner of the last you know a couple of
years and well impressive yes quite

1560
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:46,450
years and well impressive yes quite
 

1561
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,380
years and well impressive yes quite
impressive and then google has developed

1562
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:49,390
impressive and then google has developed
 

1563
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,410
impressive and then google has developed
Meena right just just recently that's an

00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:55,510
open domain conversational but just a

couple of weeks ago I think yeah I kind

1568
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,120
couple of weeks ago I think yeah I kind
 

1569
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,880
couple of weeks ago I think yeah I kind
of like the metric that sort of the

00:32:59,880 --> 00:32:59,890
of like the metric that sort of the
 

1571
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,100
of like the metric that sort of the
Alexa price has proposed and he maybe

1572
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,110
Alexa price has proposed and he maybe
 

1573
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,810
Alexa price has proposed and he maybe
it's obvious to you it wasn't to me of

1574
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:03,820
it's obvious to you it wasn't to me of
 

1575
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,870
it's obvious to you it wasn't to me of
setting sort of a length of a

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:06,880
setting sort of a length of a

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,570
setting sort of a length of a
conversation like you want the bot to be

1578
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:09,580
conversation like you want the bot to be
 

1579
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,460
conversation like you want the bot to be
sufficiently interestingly you'd want to

1580
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:11,470
sufficiently interestingly you'd want to
 

1581
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,200
sufficiently interestingly you'd want to
keep talking to it for like 20 minutes

1582
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,210
keep talking to it for like 20 minutes
 

1583
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,740
keep talking to it for like 20 minutes
and that's a that's a surprisingly

1584
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:15,750
and that's a that's a surprisingly
 

1585
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:20,130
and that's a that's a surprisingly
effective in aggregate metric because it

1586
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,140
effective in aggregate metric because it
 

1587
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,500
effective in aggregate metric because it

to develop these systems in the first

1618
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,190
to develop these systems in the first
 

1619
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,560
to develop these systems in the first
place of course you know we can develop

1620
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:01,570
place of course you know we can develop
 

1621
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,810
place of course you know we can develop
them by trial and error and you know do

1622
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:03,820
them by trial and error and you know do
 

1623
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,520
them by trial and error and you know do
whatever and and then run the test and

1624
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:05,530
whatever and and then run the test and
 

1625
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,389
whatever and and then run the test and
see whether it works or not but a

mathematical definition of intelligence

1628
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
mathematical definition of intelligence
 

1629
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,560
mathematical definition of intelligence
gives us you know an objective which we

1630
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:16,570
gives us you know an objective which we
 

1631
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,050
gives us you know an objective which we
can then analyze by you know theoretical

1632
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:19,060
can then analyze by you know theoretical

maybe improve how close we are and we

1636
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:25,629
maybe improve how close we are and we
 

1637

model so or I mention the compression

1640
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,030
model so or I mention the compression
 

1641
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,290
model so or I mention the compression
right so in natural language processing

1642
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:33,300
right so in natural language processing
 

1643
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,570
right so in natural language processing
and they have chiefed amazing results

1644
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:36,580
and they have chiefed amazing results
 

1645
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,550
and they have chiefed amazing results
and are one way to test this of course

1646
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,560
and are one way to test this of course
 

1647
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,379
and are one way to test this of course
you know take the system you train it

1648
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:40,389
you know take the system you train it
 

1649
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,730
you know take the system you train it
then you you know see how well it

1650
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:41,740
then you you know see how well it
 

1651
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,289
then you you know see how well it
performs on the task but a lot of

1652
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:45,299
performs on the task but a lot of
 

1653
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:48,210
performs on the task but a lot of
performance measurement is done by so

1654
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:48,220
performance measurement is done by so
 

1655
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,619
performance measurement is done by so
called perplexity this is essentially

1656
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:49,629
called perplexity this is essentially
 

1657
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,349
called perplexity this is essentially
the same as complexity or compression

1658
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:52,359
the same as complexity or compression
 

1659
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:55,349
the same as complexity or compression
length so the NLP community develops new

1660
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:55,359
length so the NLP community develops new
 

1661
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,669
length so the NLP community develops new
systems and then they measure the

1662
00:34:56,669 --> 00:34:56,679
systems and then they measure the
 

1663
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,440
systems and then they measure the
compression length and then they have

1664
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:58,450
compression length and then they have
 

1665
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,950
compression length and then they have
ranking and leaks because there's a

1666
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:01,960
ranking and leaks because there's a
 

1667
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,019
ranking and leaks because there's a
strong correlation between compressing

1668
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:04,029
strong correlation between compressing
 

1669
00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:06,000
strong correlation between compressing
well and then this systems performing

1670
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,010
well and then this systems performing
 

1671
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,799
well and then this systems performing
well at the task at hand it's not

1672
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:07,809
well at the task at hand it's not
 

1673
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:10,769
well at the task at hand it's not
perfect but it's good enough for them as

1674
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:10,779
perfect but it's good enough for them as
 

1675
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:13,759
perfect but it's good enough for them as
as an intermediate aim

1676
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:13,769
as an intermediate aim
 

1677
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:17,370
as an intermediate aim
so you mean a measure so this is kind of

1678
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:17,380
so you mean a measure so this is kind of
 

1679
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,170
so you mean a measure so this is kind of
almost returning to the coma girl of

1680
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:19,180
almost returning to the coma girl of
 

1681
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,779
almost returning to the coma girl of
complexity so you're saying good

1682
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:21,789
complexity so you're saying good
 

1683
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,880
complexity so you're saying good
compression usually means good

1684
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:23,890
compression usually means good
 

1685
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,150
compression usually means good
intelligence yes

1686
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
intelligence yes
 

1687
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,730
intelligence yes
so you mentioned you're one of the one

1688
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:29,740
so you mentioned you're one of the one
 

1689
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,049
so you mentioned you're one of the one
of the only people who dared boldly to

1690
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:34,059
of the only people who dared boldly to
 

1691
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:36,900
of the only people who dared boldly to
try to formalize our the idea of

1692
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:36,910
try to formalize our the idea of
 

1693
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,000
try to formalize our the idea of
artificial general intelligence to have

1694
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,010
artificial general intelligence to have
 

1695
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,910
artificial general intelligence to have
a a mathematical framework for

1696
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:41,920
a a mathematical framework for
 

1697
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,269
a a mathematical framework for
intelligence just like as we mentioned

1698
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:44,279
intelligence just like as we mentioned
 

1699
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:50,190
intelligence just like as we mentioned
termed IHC AI X I so let me ask the

1700
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,200
termed IHC AI X I so let me ask the
 

1701
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,980
termed IHC AI X I so let me ask the
basic question what is IHC okay so let

1702
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:55,990
basic question what is IHC okay so let
 

1703
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,749
basic question what is IHC okay so let
me first say what it stands for because

1704
00:35:57,749 --> 00:35:57,759
me first say what it stands for because
 

1705
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,039
me first say what it stands for because
letter stands for actually that's

1706
00:35:59,039 --> 00:35:59,049
letter stands for actually that's
 

1707
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:00,740
letter stands for actually that's
probably the more basic question but it

1708
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:00,750
probably the more basic question but it
 

1709
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,690
probably the more basic question but it
the first question is usually how how

1710
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:03,700
the first question is usually how how
 

1711
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,339
the first question is usually how how
it's pronounced but finally I put it on

1712
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:05,349
it's pronounced but finally I put it on
 

1713
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:07,470
it's pronounced but finally I put it on
the website how it's pronounced and you

1714
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:07,480
the website how it's pronounced and you
 

1715
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,230
the website how it's pronounced and you
figured it out yeah

1716
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,240
figured it out yeah
 

1717
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,210
figured it out yeah
the name comes from AI artificial

1718
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:12,220
the name comes from AI artificial
 

1719
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,120
the name comes from AI artificial
intelligence and the X I is the Greek

1720
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,130
intelligence and the X I is the Greek
 

1721
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,730
intelligence and the X I is the Greek
letter X I which are used for solo

1722
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:17,740

here in front of camera so it just

1728
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:27,910
here in front of camera so it just
 

1729
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,849
here in front of camera so it just
happened to be more less arbitrary I

1730
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:29,859

other interpretations so their actions

1734
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,490
other interpretations so their actions
 

1735
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,430
other interpretations so their actions
and perceptions in this model write an

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:38,440
and perceptions in this model write an
 

1737
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,490
and perceptions in this model write an
agent his actions and perceptions and

overtime so this is a Index IX index I

1740
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:44,500
overtime so this is a Index IX index I
 

1741
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,349
overtime so this is a Index IX index I
so this action at time I and then

followed by reception at time I will go
with that I let it out the first part

1746
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:51,609
with that I let it out the first part
 

1747
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,760
with that I let it out the first part
yes I'm just kidding I have some

1748
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:53,770
yes I'm just kidding I have some
 

1749
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,970
yes I'm just kidding I have some
interpretations so at some point maybe

1750
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:56,980
interpretations so at some point maybe
 

1751
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,190
interpretations so at some point maybe
five years ago or ten years ago I

1752
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,200
five years ago or ten years ago I
 

1753
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,390
five years ago or ten years ago I
discovered in in Barcelona it wasn't a

1754
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:03,400
discovered in in Barcelona it wasn't a
 

1755
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,970
discovered in in Barcelona it wasn't a
big church there wasn't you know stone

1756
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:05,980
big church there wasn't you know stone
 

1757
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,120
big church there wasn't you know stone
engraved some text and the word I see

1758
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,130
engraved some text and the word I see
 

1759
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:14,730
engraved some text and the word I see
appeared there I was very surprised and

1760
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:14,740
appeared there I was very surprised and
 

1761
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,280
appeared there I was very surprised and
and and and happy about it and I looked

1762
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,290
and and and happy about it and I looked
 

1763
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,620
and and and happy about it and I looked
it up so it is Catalan language and it

1764
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:19,630
it up so it is Catalan language and it
 

1765
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,960
it up so it is Catalan language and it
means with some interpretation of debts

1766
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:21,970
means with some interpretation of debts
 

1767
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,520
means with some interpretation of debts
it that's the right thing to do yeah

1768
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:23,530
it that's the right thing to do yeah
 

1769
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,840
it that's the right thing to do yeah
Eureka Oh

1770
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:24,850
Eureka Oh
 

1771
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,780
Eureka Oh
so it's almost like destined somehow

1772
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:27,790
so it's almost like destined somehow
 

1773
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,920
so it's almost like destined somehow
came yeah yeah came to you in a dream

1774
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:31,930
came yeah yeah came to you in a dream
 

1775
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,110
came yeah yeah came to you in a dream
so Osceola there's a Chinese word I she

1776
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,120
so Osceola there's a Chinese word I she
 

1777
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,700
so Osceola there's a Chinese word I she
also written a galaxy if you could

1778
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:35,710
also written a galaxy if you could
 

1779
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,250
also written a galaxy if you could
transcribe that opinion then the final

1780
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:38,260
transcribe that opinion then the final
 

1781
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,070
transcribe that opinion then the final
one is that is AI crossed with induction

1782
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,080
one is that is AI crossed with induction
 

1783
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,930
one is that is AI crossed with induction
because status and that's going more to

1784
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:42,940
because status and that's going more to
 

1785
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,750
because status and that's going more to
the content now so good old-fashioned AI

1786
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
the content now so good old-fashioned AI
 

1787
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,490
the content now so good old-fashioned AI
is more about you know planning and

1788
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:47,500
is more about you know planning and
 

1789
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,620
is more about you know planning and
known data mystic world and induction is

1790
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:49,630
known data mystic world and induction is
 

1791
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,870
known data mystic world and induction is
more about often yellow area D data and

1792
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:51,880
more about often yellow area D data and
 

1793
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,030
more about often yellow area D data and
inferring models and essentially what

1794
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,040
inferring models and essentially what
 

1795
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,620
inferring models and essentially what
this accident does is combining these

1796
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:55,630
this accident does is combining these
 

1797
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,800
this accident does is combining these
two and I actually also recently I think

1798
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:58,810
two and I actually also recently I think
 

1799
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,450
two and I actually also recently I think
heard that in Japanese AI means love so

1800
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:02,460
heard that in Japanese AI means love so
 

1801
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,580
heard that in Japanese AI means love so
so if you can combine excise somehow

1802
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:05,590
so if you can combine excise somehow
 

1803
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,090
so if you can combine excise somehow
with that I think we can there might be

1804
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:09,100
with that I think we can there might be
 

1805
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,370
with that I think we can there might be
some interesting ideas there so I let's

1806
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:11,380
some interesting ideas there so I let's
 

1807
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,510
some interesting ideas there so I let's
then take the next step can you maybe

1808
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:14,520
then take the next step can you maybe
 

1809
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,880
then take the next step can you maybe
talk at the big level of what is this

1810
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:17,890
talk at the big level of what is this
 

1811
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,340
talk at the big level of what is this
mathematical framework yeah so it

1812
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:20,350
mathematical framework yeah so it
 

1813
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,770
mathematical framework yeah so it
consists essentially of two parts one is

1814
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:22,780
consists essentially of two parts one is
 

1815
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,320
consists essentially of two parts one is
the learning and induction and

1816
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,330
the learning and induction and
 

1817
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,300
the learning and induction and
prediction part and the other one is the

1818
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,310
prediction part and the other one is the
 

1819
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,050
prediction part and the other one is the
planning part

1820
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:28,060
planning part
 

1821
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,080
planning part
so let's come first to the learning

1822
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,090
so let's come first to the learning
 

1823
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,970
so let's come first to the learning
induction prediction part which

1824
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:32,980
induction prediction part which
 

1825
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,160
induction prediction part which
essentially I explained already before

1826
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,170
essentially I explained already before
 

1827
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:39,840
essentially I explained already before
so what we need for any agent to act

1828
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:39,850
so what we need for any agent to act
 

1829
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,110
so what we need for any agent to act
well is that it can somehow predict what

1830
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:43,120
well is that it can somehow predict what
 

1831
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,550
well is that it can somehow predict what
happens I mean if you have no idea what

1832
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:44,560
happens I mean if you have no idea what
 

1833
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,090
happens I mean if you have no idea what
your actions do how can you decide which

1834
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:48,100
your actions do how can you decide which
 

1835
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,680
your actions do how can you decide which
acts not good or not so you need to have

1836
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:49,690
acts not good or not so you need to have
 

1837
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,070
acts not good or not so you need to have
some model of what your actions affect

1838
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,080
some model of what your actions affect
 

1839
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,690
some model of what your actions affect
so what you do is you have some

1840
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:54,700
so what you do is you have some
 

1841
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,120
so what you do is you have some
experience you build models like

1842
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,130
experience you build models like
 

1843
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,920
experience you build models like
scientists you know of your experience

1844
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:58,930
scientists you know of your experience
 

1845
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,960
scientists you know of your experience
then you hope these models are roughly

1846
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:00,970
then you hope these models are roughly
 

1847
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,310
then you hope these models are roughly
correct and then you use these models

1848
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
correct and then you use these models
 

1849
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,710
correct and then you use these models
for prediction and the model is sorry to

1850
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:04,720
for prediction and the model is sorry to
 

1851
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,870
for prediction and the model is sorry to
interrupt our model is based on you

1852
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:06,880
interrupt our model is based on you
 

1853
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,120
interrupt our model is based on you
perception of the world how your actions

1854
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,130
perception of the world how your actions
 

1855
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,210
perception of the world how your actions
will affect that world that's not so

1856
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:12,220
will affect that world that's not so
 

1857
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,849
will affect that world that's not so
what is the important part but it is

1858
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:14,859
what is the important part but it is
 

1859
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,499
what is the important part but it is
technically important but at this stage

1860
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:16,509
technically important but at this stage
 

1861
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:18,420
technically important but at this stage
we can just think about predicting say

1862
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:18,430
we can just think about predicting say
 

1863
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,390
we can just think about predicting say
stock market data whether data or IQ

1864
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:21,400
stock market data whether data or IQ
 

1865
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,370
stock market data whether data or IQ
sequences one two three four five what

1866
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:23,380
sequences one two three four five what
 

1867
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,329
sequences one two three four five what
comes next yeah so of course our actions

1868
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:26,339
comes next yeah so of course our actions
 

1869
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:29,370
comes next yeah so of course our actions
affect what we're doing but I come back

1870
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:29,380
affect what we're doing but I come back
 

1871
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,200
affect what we're doing but I come back
to that in a second so and I'll keep

1872
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,210
to that in a second so and I'll keep
 

1873
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,799
to that in a second so and I'll keep
just interrupting so just to draw a line

1874
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:34,809
just interrupting so just to draw a line
 

1875
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:37,620
just interrupting so just to draw a line
between prediction and planning or what

1876
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:37,630
between prediction and planning or what
 

1877
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,230
between prediction and planning or what
do you mean by prediction in this and

1878
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,240
do you mean by prediction in this and
 

1879
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,410
do you mean by prediction in this and
this where it's trying to predict the

1880
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:42,420
this where it's trying to predict the
 

1881
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,299
this where it's trying to predict the
environment without your long-term

1882
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:45,309
environment without your long-term
 

1883
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:47,099
environment without your long-term
action in the environment

1884
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:47,109
action in the environment
 

1885
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:50,220
action in the environment
what is prediction okay if you want to

1886
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,230
what is prediction okay if you want to
 

1887
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,720
what is prediction okay if you want to
put the actions in now okay then let's

1888
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,730
put the actions in now okay then let's
 

1889
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:58,529
put the actions in now okay then let's
put in a now yes so the question okay so

1890
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:58,539
put in a now yes so the question okay so
 

1891
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:00,120
put in a now yes so the question okay so
this is the simplest form of prediction

1892
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,130
this is the simplest form of prediction
 

1893
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,999
this is the simplest form of prediction
is that you just have data which you

1894
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:03,009
is that you just have data which you
 

1895
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:05,339
is that you just have data which you
passively observe yes and you want to

1896
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:05,349
passively observe yes and you want to
 

1897
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:06,779
passively observe yes and you want to
predict what happens without you know

1898
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:06,789
predict what happens without you know
 

1899
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:07,640
predict what happens without you know
interfering

1900
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:07,650

okay and Salama of zeref interaction

1906
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:17,950
okay and Salama of zeref interaction
 

1907
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,529
okay and Salama of zeref interaction
based on compression so you look for the

1908
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:19,539
based on compression so you look for the
 

1909
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:21,150
based on compression so you look for the
shortest program which describes your

1910
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,160
shortest program which describes your
 

1911
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,099
shortest program which describes your
data sequence and then you take this

1912
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:23,109
data sequence and then you take this
 

1913
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:25,380
data sequence and then you take this
program run it which reproduces your

1914
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:25,390
program run it which reproduces your
 

1915
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,569
program run it which reproduces your
data sequence by definition and then you

1916
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:27,579
data sequence by definition and then you
 

1917
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:29,609
data sequence by definition and then you
let it continue running and then it will

1918
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:29,619
let it continue running and then it will
 

1919
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:31,289
let it continue running and then it will
produce some predictions and you can

1920
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:31,299
produce some predictions and you can
 

1921
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:35,970
produce some predictions and you can
rigorously prove that for any prediction

1922
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:35,980
rigorously prove that for any prediction
 

1923
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,400
rigorously prove that for any prediction
task this is essentially the best

1924
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,410
task this is essentially the best
 

1925
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,740
task this is essentially the best
possible predictor of course if there's

1926
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:40,750
possible predictor of course if there's
 

1927
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,370
possible predictor of course if there's
a prediction task or tasks which is

1928
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:44,380
a prediction task or tasks which is
 

1929
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,960
a prediction task or tasks which is
unpredictable like you know your fair

1930
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:45,970
unpredictable like you know your fair
 

1931
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,549
unpredictable like you know your fair
coin flips yeah I cannot predict the

1932
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:47,559
coin flips yeah I cannot predict the
 

1933
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:48,960
coin flips yeah I cannot predict the
next fair country but Solomon of Tarsus

1934
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:48,970
next fair country but Solomon of Tarsus
 

1935
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,779
next fair country but Solomon of Tarsus
says okay next head is probably 50% it's

1936
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:51,789
says okay next head is probably 50% it's
 

1937
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:52,620
says okay next head is probably 50% it's
the best you can do

1938
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:52,630
the best you can do
 

1939
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,329
the best you can do
so if something is unpredictable Salama

1940
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:54,339
so if something is unpredictable Salama
 

1941
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:56,910
so if something is unpredictable Salama
will also not magically predicted but if

1942
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:56,920
will also not magically predicted but if
 

1943
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,759
will also not magically predicted but if
there is some pattern and predictability

1944
00:40:58,759 --> 00:40:58,769
there is some pattern and predictability
 

1945
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:01,950
there is some pattern and predictability
then Solomonov induction we'll figure

1946
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:01,960
then Solomonov induction we'll figure
 

1947
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,170
then Solomonov induction we'll figure
that out eventually and not just

1948
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:04,180
that out eventually and not just
 

1949
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,240
that out eventually and not just
eventually but rather quickly and you

1950
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,250
eventually but rather quickly and you
 

1951
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,980
eventually but rather quickly and you
can have proof convergence rates

1952
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:09,990
can have proof convergence rates
 

1953
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,779
can have proof convergence rates
whatever your data is so there's pure

magic in a sense what's the catch well

1956
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:15,609
magic in a sense what's the catch well
 

1957
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,160
magic in a sense what's the catch well
the catch is that is not computable and

1958
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,170
the catch is that is not computable and
 

1959
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,539
the catch is that is not computable and
we come back to that later you cannot

00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:18,549
we come back to that later you cannot
 

1961
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:20,080
we come back to that later you cannot
just implement it in even this

00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,090
just implement it in even this

Google resources here and run it and you

1964
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:22,100
Google resources here and run it and you
 

1965
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,710
Google resources here and run it and you
know predict the stock market and become

1966
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:23,720
know predict the stock market and become

not write it at the time but the basic

1970
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:29,480
not write it at the time but the basic
 

1971
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,640
not write it at the time but the basic
task is you know you're in the

1972
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:30,650
task is you know you're in the
 

1973
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,530
task is you know you're in the
environment and you're interacting with

1974
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:32,540
environment and you're interacting with
 

1975
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,540
environment and you're interacting with
an environment to try to learn a model

1976
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:34,550
an environment to try to learn a model
 

1977
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,090
an environment to try to learn a model
the environment and the model is in the

1978
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,100
the environment and the model is in the
 

1979
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,890
the environment and the model is in the
space as these all these programs and

1980
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:38,900
space as these all these programs and
 

1981
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,390
space as these all these programs and
your goal is to get a bunch of programs

1982
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,400
your goal is to get a bunch of programs
 

1983
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,550
your goal is to get a bunch of programs
that are simple and so let's let's go to

1984
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560
that are simple and so let's let's go to
 

1985
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,740
that are simple and so let's let's go to
the actions now but actually good that

1986
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:44,750
the actions now but actually good that
 

1987
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,690
the actions now but actually good that
you asked usually I skip this part also

1988
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:46,700
you asked usually I skip this part also
 

1989
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,400
you asked usually I skip this part also
there is also a minor contribution which

1990
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,410
there is also a minor contribution which
 

1991
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,930
there is also a minor contribution which
I did so the action part but they

1992
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:49,940
I did so the action part but they
 

1993
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,250
I did so the action part but they
usually sort of just jump to the

1994
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:51,260
usually sort of just jump to the
 

1995
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,600
usually sort of just jump to the
decision path so let me explain to the

1996
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:52,610
decision path so let me explain to the
 

1997
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,000
decision path so let me explain to the
action part now thanks for asking

1998
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,010
action part now thanks for asking
 

1999
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,990
action part now thanks for asking
so you have to modify it a little bit by

2000
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,000
so you have to modify it a little bit by
 

2001
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,210
so you have to modify it a little bit by
now not just predicting a sequence which

2002
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:01,220
now not just predicting a sequence which
 

2003
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,680
now not just predicting a sequence which
just comes to you

2004
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:02,690
just comes to you
 

2005
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,410
just comes to you
but you have an observation then you act

2006
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:05,420
but you have an observation then you act
 

2007
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,690
but you have an observation then you act
somehow and then you want to predict the

2008
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:07,700
somehow and then you want to predict the
 

2009
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,060
somehow and then you want to predict the
next observation based on the past

2010
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,070
next observation based on the past
 

2011
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,940
next observation based on the past
observation and your action then you

2012
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:12,950
observation and your action then you
 

2013
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,160
observation and your action then you
take the next action you don't care

2014
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,170
take the next action you don't care
 

2015
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,390
take the next action you don't care
about predicting it because you're doing

2016
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
about predicting it because you're doing
 

2017
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,610
about predicting it because you're doing
it and then you get the next observation

2018
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:18,620
it and then you get the next observation
 

2019
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,770
it and then you get the next observation
and you want more before you get it you

2020
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:20,780
and you want more before you get it you
 

2021
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,270
and you want more before you get it you
want to predict it again based on your

2022
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:22,280
want to predict it again based on your
 

2023
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,520
want to predict it again based on your
past action and observation sequence

2024
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:24,530
past action and observation sequence
 

2025
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,640
past action and observation sequence
it's just condition extra on your

00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:27,650
it's just condition extra on your
 

2027
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,830
it's just condition extra on your
actions there's an interesting

00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:29,840
actions there's an interesting
 

2029
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,720
actions there's an interesting
alternative that you also try to predict

2030
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:31,730
alternative that you also try to predict
 

2031
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:37,030
alternative that you also try to predict
your own actions if you want oh in the

want to insert that in here but you're
 

2049
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,080
want to insert that in here but you're

you can give it a positive reward or

2098
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:48,680
you can give it a positive reward or
 

2099
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,440
you can give it a positive reward or
negative reward or baby no reward it

2100

you give +1 for winning or -1 for losing
so in the aixi framework that's

00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:57,370
say I play backgammon right there's dice
 

2213
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,190
say I play backgammon right there's dice
and there's certain randomness involved

2214
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,200
and there's certain randomness involved
 

2215
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,330
and there's certain randomness involved
you know I can calculate probabilities

2216
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:00,340
you know I can calculate probabilities
 

2217
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,790
you know I can calculate probabilities
and feed it in the expecting max or the

2218
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
and feed it in the expecting max or the
 

2219
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,710
and feed it in the expecting max or the
signature disease we come up is the

2220
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:04,720
signature disease we come up is the
 

2221
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,060
signature disease we come up is the
optimal decision if I have enough

2222
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,070
optimal decision if I have enough
 

2223
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,430
optimal decision if I have enough
compute but in the for the real world we

2224
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:08,440
compute but in the for the real world we
 

2225
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,200
compute but in the for the real world we
don't know that you know what is the

2226
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,210
don't know that you know what is the
 

2227
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,810
don't know that you know what is the
probability you drive in front of me

2228
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:12,820
probability you drive in front of me

brakes and I don't know you know so

2230
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,130
brakes and I don't know you know so
 

2231
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,040

depends on all kinds of things and

2232
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,050
depends on all kinds of things and
 

2233
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,260
depends on all kinds of things and
especially new situations I don't know

2234
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:19,270
especially new situations I don't know
 

2235
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,780
especially new situations I don't know
so this is this unknown thing about

2236
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:21,790
so this is this unknown thing about
 

2237
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,490
so this is this unknown thing about
prediction and there's where solomonoff

2238
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:23,500
prediction and there's where solomonoff
 

2239
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,710
prediction and there's where solomonoff
comes in so what you do is in sequential

2240
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:25,720
comes in so what you do is in sequential
 

2241
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,050
comes in so what you do is in sequential
decision jury it just replace the true

2242
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:28,060
decision jury it just replace the true
 

2243
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,800
decision jury it just replace the true
distribution which we don't know by this

2244
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:30,810
distribution which we don't know by this
 

2245
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,330
distribution which we don't know by this
Universal distribution I didn't

2246
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:33,340
Universal distribution I didn't
 

2247
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,950
Universal distribution I didn't
explicitly talk about it but this is

2248
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
explicitly talk about it but this is
 

2249
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,260
explicitly talk about it but this is
used for universal prediction and plug

2250
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:37,270
used for universal prediction and plug
 

2251
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,540
used for universal prediction and plug
it into the sequential decision tree

2252
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:39,550
it into the sequential decision tree
 

2253
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,460
it into the sequential decision tree
mechanism and then you get the best of

2254
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:41,470
mechanism and then you get the best of
 

2255
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,500
mechanism and then you get the best of
both worlds you have a long-term

2256
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:43,510
both worlds you have a long-term
 

2257
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,410
both worlds you have a long-term
planning agent but it doesn't need to

2258
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:46,420
planning agent but it doesn't need to
 

2259
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,420
planning agent but it doesn't need to
know anything about the world because

2260
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:48,430
know anything about the world because
 

2261
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,180
know anything about the world because
there's a lot of induction part learns

2262
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:51,190
there's a lot of induction part learns
 

2263
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,840
there's a lot of induction part learns
can you explicitly try to describe the

2264
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:54,850
can you explicitly try to describe the
 

2265
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,540
can you explicitly try to describe the
universal distribution and how some of

2266
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:57,550
universal distribution and how some of
 

2267
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,880
universal distribution and how some of
induction plays a role here yeah I'm

2268
00:46:59,880 --> 00:46:59,890
induction plays a role here yeah I'm
 

2269
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,650
induction plays a role here yeah I'm
trying to understand so what it does it

2270
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:01,660
trying to understand so what it does it
 

2271
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,590
trying to understand so what it does it
I'm so in the simplest case I said take

2272
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:04,600
I'm so in the simplest case I said take
 

2273
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,180
I'm so in the simplest case I said take
the shortest program describing your

2274
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,190
the shortest program describing your
 

2275
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,890
the shortest program describing your
data run it have a prediction which

2276
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:07,900
data run it have a prediction which
 

2277
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,340
data run it have a prediction which
would be deterministic yes okay but you

2278
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:11,350
would be deterministic yes okay but you
 

2279
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,900
would be deterministic yes okay but you
should not just take a shortest program

2280
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:12,910
should not just take a shortest program
 

2281
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,480
should not just take a shortest program
but also consider the longer ones but

2282
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:15,490
but also consider the longer ones but
 

2283
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:18,720
but also consider the longer ones but
keep it lower a priori probability so in

2284
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:18,730
keep it lower a priori probability so in
 

2285
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,900
keep it lower a priori probability so in
the Bayesian framework you say a priori

2286
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:21,910
the Bayesian framework you say a priori
 

2287
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:27,780
the Bayesian framework you say a priori
any distribution which is a model or

2288
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:27,790
any distribution which is a model or
 

2289
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,000
any distribution which is a model or
stochastic program has a certain a

2290
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,010
stochastic program has a certain a
 

2291
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,470
stochastic program has a certain a
priori probability which is 2 to the

2292
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:31,480
priori probability which is 2 to the
 

2293
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,540
priori probability which is 2 to the
minus and Y to the minus length you know

2294
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:33,550
minus and Y to the minus length you know
 

2295
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,460
minus and Y to the minus length you know
I could explain length of this program

2296
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:35,470
I could explain length of this program
 

2297
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,980
I could explain length of this program
so longer programs are punished yes a

2298
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:37,990
so longer programs are punished yes a
 

2299
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,580
so longer programs are punished yes a
priori and then you multiplied with the

2300
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:41,590
priori and then you multiplied with the
 

2301
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,010
priori and then you multiplied with the
so-called likelihood function yeah which

2302
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:44,020
so-called likelihood function yeah which
 

2303
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,970
so-called likelihood function yeah which
is as the name suggests is how likely is

2304
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:47,980
is as the name suggests is how likely is
 

2305
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,510
is as the name suggests is how likely is
this model given the data at hand so if

2306
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
this model given the data at hand so if
 

2307
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,670
this model given the data at hand so if
you have a very wrong model it's very

2308
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:53,680
you have a very wrong model it's very
 

2309
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,380
you have a very wrong model it's very
unlikely that this model is true so it

2310
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:55,390
unlikely that this model is true so it
 

2311
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,540
unlikely that this model is true so it
is very small number so even if the

2312
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:57,550
is very small number so even if the
 

2313
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,550
is very small number so even if the
model is simple it gets penalized by

2314
00:47:59,550 --> 00:47:59,560
model is simple it gets penalized by
 

2315
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,560
model is simple it gets penalized by
that and what you do is then you take

2316
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:01,570
that and what you do is then you take
 

2317
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:01,890
that and what you do is then you take
just

2318
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:01,900
just
 

2319
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,660
just
the some word this is the average over

2320
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:03,670
the some word this is the average over
 

2321
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,270
the some word this is the average over
it and this gives you a probability

2322
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:06,280
it and this gives you a probability
 

2323
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,610
it and this gives you a probability
distribution so with universal

2324
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:08,620
distribution so with universal
 

2325
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,750
distribution so with universal
distribution of phenomena of

2326
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:09,760
distribution of phenomena of
 

2327
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,460
distribution of phenomena of
distribution so it's weighed by the

2328
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:11,470
distribution so it's weighed by the
 

2329
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,980
distribution so it's weighed by the
simplicity of the program and likelihood

2330
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:13,990
simplicity of the program and likelihood
 

2331
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:18,120
simplicity of the program and likelihood
yes it's kind of a nice idea yeah so

2332
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,130
yes it's kind of a nice idea yeah so
 

2333
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,690
yes it's kind of a nice idea yeah so
okay and then you said there's you're

2334
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:21,700
okay and then you said there's you're
 

2335
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,030
okay and then you said there's you're
playing N or M or forgot the letter

2336
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,040
playing N or M or forgot the letter
 

2337
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,480
playing N or M or forgot the letter
steps into the future so how difficult

2338
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:27,490
steps into the future so how difficult
 

2339
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,040
steps into the future so how difficult
is that problem what's involved there

2340
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,050
is that problem what's involved there
 

2341
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,290
is that problem what's involved there
okay so here's a customization problem

2342
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:31,300
okay so here's a customization problem
 

2343
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,180
okay so here's a customization problem
what do we do yes so you have a planning

2344
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:33,190
what do we do yes so you have a planning
 

2345
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,220
what do we do yes so you have a planning
problem up to horizon M and that's

2346
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:35,230
problem up to horizon M and that's
 

2347
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,860
problem up to horizon M and that's
exponential time in in the horizon M

2348
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:37,870
exponential time in in the horizon M
 

2349
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:40,230
exponential time in in the horizon M
which is I mean it's computable but in

2350
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:40,240
which is I mean it's computable but in
 

2351
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,420
which is I mean it's computable but in
fact intractable I mean even for chess

2352
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:42,430
fact intractable I mean even for chess
 

2353
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,860
fact intractable I mean even for chess
it's already intractable to do that

2354
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:43,870
it's already intractable to do that
 

2355
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,170
it's already intractable to do that
exactly and you know it could be also

2356
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:46,180
exactly and you know it could be also
 

2357
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,990
exactly and you know it could be also
discounted kind of framework or yes so

2358
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:49,000
discounted kind of framework or yes so
 

2359
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,080
discounted kind of framework or yes so
so having a heart arising you know at

2360
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:52,090
so having a heart arising you know at
 

2361
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,180
so having a heart arising you know at
numbered years it's just for simplicity

2362
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:54,190
numbered years it's just for simplicity
 

2363
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,100
numbered years it's just for simplicity
of discussing the model and also

2364
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:56,110
of discussing the model and also
 

2365
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:59,250
of discussing the model and also
sometimes the math is simple but there

2366
00:48:59,250 --> 00:48:59,260
sometimes the math is simple but there
 

2367
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,870
sometimes the math is simple but there
are lots of variations actually quite

2368
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:00,880
are lots of variations actually quite
 

2369
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,510
are lots of variations actually quite
interesting parameter is its there's

2370
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:03,520
interesting parameter is its there's
 

2371
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,350
interesting parameter is its there's
nothing really problematic about it but

2372
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:07,360
nothing really problematic about it but
 

2373
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,700
nothing really problematic about it but
it's very interesting so for instance

2374
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:08,710
it's very interesting so for instance
 

2375
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,620
it's very interesting so for instance
you think no let's let's then let's let

2376
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:10,630
you think no let's let's then let's let
 

2377
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,780
you think no let's let's then let's let
the parameter M tend to infinity right

all right if you do it novel you have

2382
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:16,750
all right if you do it novel you have
 

2383
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,510
all right if you do it novel you have
two problems first the mathematics

2384
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:18,520
two problems first the mathematics
 

2385
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,100
two problems first the mathematics
breaks down because you have an infinite

2386
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:20,110
breaks down because you have an infinite
 

2387
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:22,590
breaks down because you have an infinite
reward some which may give infinity and

not really what we want other problem is
 

2397
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,850
not really what we want other problem is
that if you have an infinite life you

2398
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:35,860
that if you have an infinite life you
 

2399
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,530
that if you have an infinite life you
can be lazy for as long as you want for

2400
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:37,540
can be lazy for as long as you want for

00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:39,610
ten years yeah and then catch up with
 

2403
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,180
ten years yeah and then catch up with
the same expected reward and you know

2404
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:42,190
the same expected reward and you know
 

2405
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,850
the same expected reward and you know
think about yourself or you know or

2406
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:44,860
think about yourself or you know or
 

2407
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,280
think about yourself or you know or
maybe you know some friends or so if

2408
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,290
maybe you know some friends or so if
 

2409
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,130
maybe you know some friends or so if
they knew they lived forever you know

2410
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:50,140
they knew they lived forever you know

your life you know and then catch up
 

2415
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,530
your life you know and then catch up
later so that's another problem with

2416
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:55,540
later so that's another problem with
 

2417
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,570
later so that's another problem with

00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,650
the long run if the agent you know x
long enough then you know it performs

2524
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:04,660
long enough then you know it performs
 

2525
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,569
long enough then you know it performs
optimal or some nice things happens so

2526
00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:06,579
optimal or some nice things happens so
 

2527
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:08,609
optimal or some nice things happens so
but you don't know how fast it converges

2528
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:08,619
but you don't know how fast it converges
 

2529
00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:11,099
but you don't know how fast it converges
yeah so it may converge fast but we're

2530
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:11,109
yeah so it may converge fast but we're
 

2531
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:16,280
yeah so it may converge fast but we're
just not able to prove it because a

2532
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:16,290

 

2533
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:18,630

difficult so that is really dead slow

2534
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:18,640
difficult so that is really dead slow
 

2535
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,690
difficult so that is really dead slow
yeah so so that is what asymptotic means

2536
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:21,700
yeah so so that is what asymptotic means
 

2537
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,579
yeah so so that is what asymptotic means
sort of eventually but we don't know how

2538
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:23,589
sort of eventually but we don't know how
 

2539
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:27,000
sort of eventually but we don't know how
fast and if I give the agent a fixed

2540
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,010
fast and if I give the agent a fixed
 

2541
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,079
fast and if I give the agent a fixed
horizon M

2542
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:28,089
horizon M
 

2543
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:31,469
horizon M
yeah then I cannot prove asymptotic

2544
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:31,479
yeah then I cannot prove asymptotic
 

2545
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:33,089
yeah then I cannot prove asymptotic
results right so I mean sort of people

2546
00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:33,099
results right so I mean sort of people
 

2547
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:35,699
results right so I mean sort of people
dies in hundred years then and hundred

2548
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:35,709
dies in hundred years then and hundred
 

2549
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:38,339
dies in hundred years then and hundred
uses over cannot say eventually so this

2550
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:38,349
uses over cannot say eventually so this
 

2551
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:40,769
uses over cannot say eventually so this
is the advantage of the discounting that

2552
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:40,779
is the advantage of the discounting that
 

2553
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:43,609
is the advantage of the discounting that
I can prove on some topic results so

2554
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:43,619
I can prove on some topic results so
 

2555
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:47,099
I can prove on some topic results so
just to clarify so so I okay I made I've

2556
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:47,109
just to clarify so so I okay I made I've
 

2557
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:50,039
just to clarify so so I okay I made I've
built up a model well now in a moment

2558
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:50,049
built up a model well now in a moment
 

2559
00:52:50,049 --> 00:52:54,749
built up a model well now in a moment
I've have this way of looking several

2560
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:54,759
I've have this way of looking several
 

2561
00:52:54,759 --> 00:52:57,029
I've have this way of looking several
steps ahead how do I pick what action I

2562
00:52:57,029 --> 00:52:57,039
steps ahead how do I pick what action I
 

2563
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,359
steps ahead how do I pick what action I
will take it's like with a playing chess

2564
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:00,369
will take it's like with a playing chess
 

2565
00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:01,709
will take it's like with a playing chess
right you do this minimax

2566
00:53:01,709 --> 00:53:01,719
right you do this minimax
 

2567
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:04,049
right you do this minimax
in this case here do expect the max

2568
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:04,059
in this case here do expect the max
 

2569
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:06,929
in this case here do expect the max
based on the selamat of distribution you

2570
00:53:06,929 --> 00:53:06,939
based on the selamat of distribution you
 

2571
00:53:06,939 --> 00:53:11,099
based on the selamat of distribution you
propagate back and then while inaction

2572
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:11,109
propagate back and then while inaction
 

2573
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:13,620
propagate back and then while inaction
falls out the action which maximizes the

2574
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:13,630
falls out the action which maximizes the
 

2575
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:16,140
falls out the action which maximizes the
future expected reward on the Solano's

2576
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:16,150
future expected reward on the Solano's
 

2577
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,699
future expected reward on the Solano's
distribution and then you just take this

2578
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:17,709
distribution and then you just take this
 

2579
00:53:17,709 --> 00:53:20,069
distribution and then you just take this
action and then repeat until you get a

2580
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:20,079
action and then repeat until you get a
 

2581
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,779
action and then repeat until you get a
new observation and you feed it in this

2582
00:53:21,779 --> 00:53:21,789
new observation and you feed it in this
 

2583
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:23,099
new observation and you feed it in this
excellent observation then you repeat

2584
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:23,109
excellent observation then you repeat
 

2585
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:25,589
excellent observation then you repeat
and the reward so on yeah so you're a

2586
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:25,599
and the reward so on yeah so you're a
 

2587
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,719
and the reward so on yeah so you're a
row - yeah and then maybe you can even

2588
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:27,729
row - yeah and then maybe you can even
 

2589
00:53:27,729 --> 00:53:29,670
row - yeah and then maybe you can even
predict your own action however the idea

2590
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:29,680
predict your own action however the idea
 

2591
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,809
predict your own action however the idea
but okay this big framework what is it

2592
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:33,819
but okay this big framework what is it
 

2593
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:37,259
but okay this big framework what is it
this is I mean it's kind of a beautiful

00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:56,710
solve the other problem for me yeah
 

2655
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,480

why I didn't settle I mean this thought
 

2661
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,309
why I didn't settle I mean this thought
about you know once we have solved HDI

00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:21,180
it's very appealing to many people and
you know I thought also that I was quite

00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:28,390
you know about logical reasoning but I
 

2679
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,910
you know about logical reasoning but I
was never convinced that this will fly

2680
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:29,920
was never convinced that this will fly
 

2681
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,309
was never convinced that this will fly
and then there was this Homer more

2682
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:32,319
and then there was this Homer more
 

2683
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,079
and then there was this Homer more
holistic approaches with neural networks

2684
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:34,089
holistic approaches with neural networks
 

2685
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:37,710
holistic approaches with neural networks
and I didn't like these heuristics so

2686
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:37,720
and I didn't like these heuristics so
 

2687
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,599
and I didn't like these heuristics so
and also I didn't have any good idea

2688
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:39,609
and also I didn't have any good idea
 

2689
00:55:39,609 --> 00:55:43,589
and also I didn't have any good idea
myself so that's the reason why I toggle

2690
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
myself so that's the reason why I toggle
 

2691
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,150
myself so that's the reason why I toggle
back and forth quite some violent even

2692
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:45,160
back and forth quite some violent even
 

2693
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,799
back and forth quite some violent even
worked some four and a half years and a

2694
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:46,809
worked some four and a half years and a
 

2695
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:48,569
worked some four and a half years and a
company developing software something

2696
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:48,579
company developing software something
 

2697
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,309
company developing software something
completely unrelated but then I had this

2698
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:50,319
completely unrelated but then I had this
 

2699
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:55,440
completely unrelated but then I had this
idea about the aixi model and so what it

2700
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:55,450
idea about the aixi model and so what it
 

2701
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,210
idea about the aixi model and so what it
gives you it gives you a gold standard

2702
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:57,220
gives you it gives you a gold standard
 

2703
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,690
gives you it gives you a gold standard
so I have proven that this is the most

2704
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:00,700
so I have proven that this is the most
 

2705
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,220
so I have proven that this is the most
intelligent agents which anybody could

2706
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:04,230
intelligent agents which anybody could
 

2707
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,780
intelligent agents which anybody could
build built in quotation mark right

2708
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:06,790
build built in quotation mark right
 

2709
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,390
build built in quotation mark right
because it's just mathematical and you

2710
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:09,400
because it's just mathematical and you
 

2711
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,819
because it's just mathematical and you
need infinite compute yeah but this is

2712
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:11,829
need infinite compute yeah but this is
 

2713
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:14,220
need infinite compute yeah but this is
the limit and this is completely

2714
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:14,230
the limit and this is completely
 

2715
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,319
the limit and this is completely
specified it's not just a framework and

2716
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:16,329
specified it's not just a framework and
 

2717
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:19,680
specified it's not just a framework and
it you know every year tens of

2718
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:19,690
it you know every year tens of
 

2719
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,660
it you know every year tens of
frameworks are developed with just have

2720
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:21,670
frameworks are developed with just have
 

2721
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,640
frameworks are developed with just have
skeletons and then pieces are missing

2722
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:23,650
skeletons and then pieces are missing
 

2723
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,260
skeletons and then pieces are missing
and usually these missing pieces you

2724
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:25,270
and usually these missing pieces you
 

2725
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,370
and usually these missing pieces you
know turn out to be really really

2726
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:26,380
know turn out to be really really
 

2727
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,250
know turn out to be really really
difficult and so this is completely and

2728
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:29,260
difficult and so this is completely and
 

2729
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,859
difficult and so this is completely and
uniquely defined and we can analyze that

2730
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:31,869
uniquely defined and we can analyze that
 

2731
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:35,940
uniquely defined and we can analyze that
mathematically and we've also developed

2732
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:35,950
mathematically and we've also developed
 

2733
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,730
mathematically and we've also developed
some approximations I can talk about it

2734
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:38,740
some approximations I can talk about it
 

2735
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,770
some approximations I can talk about it
a little bit later that would dissolve

2736
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:40,780
a little bit later that would dissolve
 

2737
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,780
a little bit later that would dissolve
the top-down approach like say for

2738
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:42,790
the top-down approach like say for
 

2739
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,609
the top-down approach like say for
Norman's minimax theory that's the

2740
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:44,619
Norman's minimax theory that's the
 

2741
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:47,130
Norman's minimax theory that's the
theoretical optimal play of games and

2742
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:47,140
theoretical optimal play of games and
 

2743
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,990
theoretical optimal play of games and
now we need to approximate it put

2744
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:49,000
now we need to approximate it put
 

2745
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,789
now we need to approximate it put
heuristics in prune the tree blah blah

2746
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:50,799
heuristics in prune the tree blah blah
 

2747
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,410
heuristics in prune the tree blah blah
blah and so on so we can do that also

2748
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:52,420
blah and so on so we can do that also
 

2749
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,250
blah and so on so we can do that also
with an icy body but for generally I

2750
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:55,260
with an icy body but for generally I
 

2751
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,150
with an icy body but for generally I
it can also inspire those and most of

2752
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
it can also inspire those and most of
 

2753
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,890
it can also inspire those and most of
most researchers go bottom-up right they

2754
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:00,900
most researchers go bottom-up right they
 

2755
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,300
most researchers go bottom-up right they
have the systems that try to make it

2756
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:02,310
have the systems that try to make it
 

2757
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,430
have the systems that try to make it
more general more intelligent it can

2758
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:04,440
more general more intelligent it can
 

2759
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,300
more general more intelligent it can
inspire in which direction to go what do

2760
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,310
inspire in which direction to go what do
 

2761
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,040
inspire in which direction to go what do
you mean by that so if you have some

2762
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,050
you mean by that so if you have some
 

2763
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,050
you mean by that so if you have some
choice to make right so how should they

2764
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:12,060
choice to make right so how should they
 

2765
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,940
choice to make right so how should they
evaluate my system if I can't do cross

2766
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:13,950
evaluate my system if I can't do cross
 

2767
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:17,960
evaluate my system if I can't do cross
validation how should I do my learning

2768
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:17,970
validation how should I do my learning
 

2769
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,030
validation how should I do my learning
if my standard regularization doesn't

2770
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:20,040
if my standard regularization doesn't
 

2771
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,040
if my standard regularization doesn't
work well you know so the answer is

2772
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:22,050
work well you know so the answer is
 

2773
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,480
work well you know so the answer is
always this we have a system which does

2774
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:23,490
always this we have a system which does
 

2775
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,610
always this we have a system which does
everything that's actually it's just you

2776
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:25,620
everything that's actually it's just you
 

2777
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,650
everything that's actually it's just you
know completing the ivory tower

2778
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:27,660
know completing the ivory tower
 

2779
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,600
know completing the ivory tower
completely useless from a practical

2780
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:29,610
completely useless from a practical
 

2781
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,700
completely useless from a practical
point of view but you can look at it and

2782
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:31,710
point of view but you can look at it and
 

2783
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,100
point of view but you can look at it and
see oh yeah maybe you know I can take

2784
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:34,110
see oh yeah maybe you know I can take
 

2785
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,480
see oh yeah maybe you know I can take
some aspects and you know instead of

2786
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:35,490
some aspects and you know instead of
 

2787
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,040
some aspects and you know instead of
Kolmogorov complexity there just take

2788
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,050
Kolmogorov complexity there just take
 

2789
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:38,600
Kolmogorov complexity there just take
some compressors which has been

2790
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:38,610
some compressors which has been
 

2791
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:41,000
some compressors which has been
developed so far and for the planning

2792
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,010
developed so far and for the planning
 

2793
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,740
developed so far and for the planning
well we have used it here which is also

2794
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:42,750
well we have used it here which is also
 

2795
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:47,300
well we have used it here which is also
you know being used in go and it at

2796
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:47,310
you know being used in go and it at
 

2797
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:50,390
you know being used in go and it at
least it's inspired me a lot to have

2798
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:50,400
least it's inspired me a lot to have
 

2799
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,680
least it's inspired me a lot to have
this formal definition and if you look

2800
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:54,690
this formal definition and if you look
 

2801
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:56,720
this formal definition and if you look
at other fields you know like I always

2802
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:56,730
at other fields you know like I always
 

2803
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:58,220
at other fields you know like I always
come back to physics because I'm a

2804
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:58,230
come back to physics because I'm a
 

2805
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,630
come back to physics because I'm a
physics background think about the

2806
00:57:59,630 --> 00:57:59,640
physics background think about the
 

2807
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,940
physics background think about the
Phenom of energy that was long time a

2808
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:01,950
Phenom of energy that was long time a
 

2809
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:03,950
Phenom of energy that was long time a
mysterious concept and at some point it

2810
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:03,960
mysterious concept and at some point it
 

2811
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,680
mysterious concept and at some point it
was completely formalized and that

2812
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:06,690
was completely formalized and that
 

2813
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,140
was completely formalized and that
really helped a lot and you can point

2814
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,150
really helped a lot and you can point
 

2815
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,060
really helped a lot and you can point
out a lot of these things which were

2816
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:11,070
out a lot of these things which were
 

2817
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,370
out a lot of these things which were
first mysterious and wake and then they

2818
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:13,380
first mysterious and wake and then they
 

2819
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,620
first mysterious and wake and then they
have been rigorously formalized speed

2820
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:15,630
have been rigorously formalized speed
 

2821
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:17,990
have been rigorously formalized speed
and acceleration has been confused tried

2822
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
and acceleration has been confused tried
 

2823
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,970
and acceleration has been confused tried
until it was formally defined here there

2824
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:19,980
until it was formally defined here there
 

2825
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,950
until it was formally defined here there
was a time like this and in people you

2826
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:21,960
was a time like this and in people you
 

2827
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,170
was a time like this and in people you
know often you know know don't have any

2828
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:24,180
know often you know know don't have any
 

2829
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,040
know often you know know don't have any
background you know still confused it so

2830
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,050
background you know still confused it so
 

2831
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,770
background you know still confused it so
and this is a model or the the

2832
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:30,780
and this is a model or the the
 

2833
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,390
and this is a model or the the
intelligence definitions which is sort

00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
intelligence definitions which is sort
 

2835
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,040
intelligence definitions which is sort
of the dual to it we come back to that

2836
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,050
of the dual to it we come back to that
 

2837
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:36,110
of the dual to it we come back to that
later formalizes the notion of

2838
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:36,120
later formalizes the notion of
 

2839
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,080
later formalizes the notion of
intelligence uniquely and rigorously so

2840
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:39,090
intelligence uniquely and rigorously so
 

2841
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,330
intelligence uniquely and rigorously so
in in the sense it serves as kind of the

2842
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:41,340
in in the sense it serves as kind of the
 

2843
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,520
in in the sense it serves as kind of the
light at the end of the tunnel so before

2844
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:43,530
light at the end of the tunnel so before
 

2845
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,250
light at the end of the tunnel so before
yeah so I mean there's a million

2846
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:46,260
yeah so I mean there's a million
 

2847
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,550
yeah so I mean there's a million
question I could ask her so maybe the

2848
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:49,560
question I could ask her so maybe the
 

2849
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,680
question I could ask her so maybe the
kind of ok let's feel around in the dark

2850
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:51,690
kind of ok let's feel around in the dark
 

2851
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,020
kind of ok let's feel around in the dark
a little bit so there's been here a deep

2852
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,030
a little bit so there's been here a deep
 

2853
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,970
a little bit so there's been here a deep
mind but in general been a lot of

2854
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:55,980
mind but in general been a lot of
 

2855
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,410
mind but in general been a lot of
breakthrough ideas just like we've been

2856
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:57,420
breakthrough ideas just like we've been
 

2857
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,660
breakthrough ideas just like we've been
saying around reinforcement learning so

2858
00:58:59,660 --> 00:58:59,670
saying around reinforcement learning so
 

2859
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,210
saying around reinforcement learning so
how do you see the progress in

2860
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:02,220
how do you see the progress in
 

2861
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,580
how do you see the progress in
reinforcement learning is different like

2862
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:04,590
reinforcement learning is different like
 

2863
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,820
reinforcement learning is different like
which subset of IHC does it occupy

2864
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:07,830
which subset of IHC does it occupy
 

2865
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:12,230
which subset of IHC does it occupy
the current like you said the maybe the

2866
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,240
the current like you said the maybe the
 

2867
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,630
the current like you said the maybe the
Markov assumptions made quite often in

2868
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:14,640
Markov assumptions made quite often in
 

2869
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,200
Markov assumptions made quite often in
reinforce for learning the there's other

2870
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:18,210
reinforce for learning the there's other
 

2871
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,840
reinforce for learning the there's other
assumptions made in order to make the

2872
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:20,850
assumptions made in order to make the
 

2873
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,820
assumptions made in order to make the
system work what do you see is the

2874
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,830
system work what do you see is the
 

2875
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,320
system work what do you see is the
difference connection between

2876
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:24,330
difference connection between
 

2877
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,900
difference connection between
reinforcement learning in Nyack see and

2878
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:26,910
reinforcement learning in Nyack see and
 

2879
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:30,130
reinforcement learning in Nyack see and
so the major difference is that

2880
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:30,140
so the major difference is that
 

2881
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,530
so the major difference is that
essentially all other approaches they

2882
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:33,540
essentially all other approaches they
 

2883
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,870
essentially all other approaches they
make stronger assumptions so in

2884
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:35,880
make stronger assumptions so in
 

2885
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,130
make stronger assumptions so in
reinforcement learning the Markov

2886
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:37,140
reinforcement learning the Markov
 

2887
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,400
reinforcement learning the Markov
assumption is that the the next state or

2888
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:40,410
assumption is that the the next state or
 

2889
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,350
assumption is that the the next state or
next observation only depends on the on

2890
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:42,360
next observation only depends on the on
 

2891
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,730
next observation only depends on the on
the previous observation and not the

2892
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:43,740
the previous observation and not the
 

2893
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,130
the previous observation and not the
whole history which makes of course the

2894
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:46,140
whole history which makes of course the
 

2895
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,870
whole history which makes of course the
mathematics much easier and rather than

2896
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:47,880
mathematics much easier and rather than
 

2897
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,600
mathematics much easier and rather than
dealing with histories of course their

2898
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:50,610
dealing with histories of course their
 

2899
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,190
dealing with histories of course their
profit from it also because then you

2900
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:52,200
profit from it also because then you
 

2901
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,840
profit from it also because then you
have algorithms that run on current

2902
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:53,850
have algorithms that run on current
 

2903
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:55,460
have algorithms that run on current
computers and do something practically

2904
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:55,470
computers and do something practically
 

2905
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:59,120
computers and do something practically
useful but for generally are all the

2906
00:59:59,120 --> 00:59:59,130
useful but for generally are all the
 

2907
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,560
useful but for generally are all the
assumptions which are made by other

2908
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:00,570
assumptions which are made by other
 

2909
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,290
assumptions which are made by other
approaches we know already now they are

2910
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:03,300
approaches we know already now they are
 

2911
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:08,360
approaches we know already now they are
limiting so for instance usually you

2912
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:08,370
limiting so for instance usually you
 

2913
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,010
limiting so for instance usually you
need a go digital assumption in the MDP

2914
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:10,020
need a go digital assumption in the MDP
 

2915
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,930
need a go digital assumption in the MDP
frameworks in order to learn it goes

2916
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:11,940
frameworks in order to learn it goes
 

2917
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,550
frameworks in order to learn it goes
this T essentially means that you can

2918
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:13,560
this T essentially means that you can
 

2919
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,070
this T essentially means that you can
recover from your mistakes and that they

2920
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:16,080
recover from your mistakes and that they
 

2921
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,010
recover from your mistakes and that they
are not traps in the environment and if

2922
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:19,020
are not traps in the environment and if
 

2923
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,090
are not traps in the environment and if
you make this assumption then

2924
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:20,100
you make this assumption then
 

2925
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,920
you make this assumption then
essentially it can you know go back to a

2926
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:21,930
essentially it can you know go back to a
 

2927
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,690
essentially it can you know go back to a
previous state go there a couple of

2928
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:23,700
previous state go there a couple of
 

2929
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,110
previous state go there a couple of
times and then learn what what

2930
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:27,120
times and then learn what what
 

2931
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,720
times and then learn what what
statistics and what the state is like

2932
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:29,730
statistics and what the state is like
 

2933
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,480
statistics and what the state is like
and then in the long run perform well in

2934
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:32,490
and then in the long run perform well in
 

2935
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:33,860
and then in the long run perform well in
this state yeah but there are no

2936
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:33,870
this state yeah but there are no
 

2937
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:36,710
this state yeah but there are no
fundamental problems but in real life we

2938
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:36,720
fundamental problems but in real life we
 

2939
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,270
fundamental problems but in real life we
know you know there can be one single

2940
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:38,280
know you know there can be one single
 

2941
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,790
know you know there can be one single
action you know one second of being

2942
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:40,800
action you know one second of being
 

2943
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,120
action you know one second of being
inattentive while driving a car fast you

2944
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:44,130
inattentive while driving a car fast you
 

2945
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,980
inattentive while driving a car fast you
know you can ruin the rest of my life I

2946
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:45,990
know you can ruin the rest of my life I
 

2947
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,530
know you can ruin the rest of my life I
can become quadriplegic or whatever so

2948
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:48,540
can become quadriplegic or whatever so
 

2949
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,630
can become quadriplegic or whatever so
and there's no recovery anymore so the

2950
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:50,640
and there's no recovery anymore so the
 

2951
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,340
and there's no recovery anymore so the
real world is not err gorica I always

2952
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:52,350
real world is not err gorica I always
 

2953
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,840
real world is not err gorica I always
say you know there are traps and there

2954
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:53,850
say you know there are traps and there
 

2955
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,640
say you know there are traps and there
are situations we are not recover from

2956
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:55,650
are situations we are not recover from
 

2957
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:59,420
are situations we are not recover from
and very little theory has been

2958
01:00:59,420 --> 01:00:59,430
and very little theory has been
 

2959
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:05,540
and very little theory has been
developed for this case what about what

2960
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:05,550
developed for this case what about what
 

2961
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,160
developed for this case what about what
do you see in there in the context of I

2962
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:07,170
do you see in there in the context of I
 

2963
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:12,490
do you see in there in the context of I
see as the role of exploration sort of

2964
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:12,500

 

2965
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,750

you mentioned you know in the in the

2966
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:14,760
you mentioned you know in the in the
 

2967
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,850
you mentioned you know in the in the
real world and get into trouble when we

2968
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:16,860
real world and get into trouble when we
 

2969
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,320
real world and get into trouble when we
make the wrong decisions and really pay

2970
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:18,330
make the wrong decisions and really pay
 

2971
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,960
make the wrong decisions and really pay
for it but exploration it seems to be

2972
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:20,970
for it but exploration it seems to be
 

2973
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:21,710
for it but exploration it seems to be
fundamentally

2974
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:21,720
fundamentally
 

2975
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,630
fundamentally
important for learning about this world

2976
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:23,640
important for learning about this world
 

2977
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,960
important for learning about this world
for gaining new knowledge so is it his

2978
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:26,970
for gaining new knowledge so is it his
 

2979
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:29,930
for gaining new knowledge so is it his
exploration baked in another way to ask

2980
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:29,940
exploration baked in another way to ask
 

2981
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,620
exploration baked in another way to ask
it what are the parameters of this of

2982
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:33,630
it what are the parameters of this of
 

2983
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:37,310
it what are the parameters of this of
IHC it can be controlled yeah I say the

2984
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:37,320
IHC it can be controlled yeah I say the
 

2985
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,270
IHC it can be controlled yeah I say the
good thing is that there are no

2986
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:38,280
good thing is that there are no
 

2987
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,520
good thing is that there are no
parameters to control and some other

2988
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:40,530
parameters to control and some other
 

2989
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,580
parameters to control and some other
people track knobs to control and you

2990
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:43,590
people track knobs to control and you
 

2991
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:45,890
people track knobs to control and you
can do that I mean you can modify axes

2992
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:45,900
can do that I mean you can modify axes
 

2993
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,330
can do that I mean you can modify axes
so that you have some knobs to play with

2994
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:47,340
so that you have some knobs to play with
 

2995
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,990
so that you have some knobs to play with
if you want to but the exploration is

2996
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:51,000
if you want to but the exploration is
 

2997
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,520
if you want to but the exploration is
directly baked in and that comes from

2998
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:54,530
directly baked in and that comes from
 

2999
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,560
directly baked in and that comes from
the Bayesian learning and the long-term

3000
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:57,570
the Bayesian learning and the long-term

so these together already imply

3004
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:02,780
so these together already imply
 

3005
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,750
so these together already imply
exploration you can nicely and

3006
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:05,760
exploration you can nicely and
 

3007
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,800
exploration you can nicely and
explicitly prove that for simple

3008
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:09,810
explicitly prove that for simple
 

3009
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:12,700
explicitly prove that for simple
problems like so-called banded problems

3010
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:12,710
problems like so-called banded problems
 

3011
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:17,510
problems like so-called banded problems
where you say to give a real world

3012
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:17,520
where you say to give a real world
 

3013
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,920
where you say to give a real world
example say you have two medical

3014
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:18,930
example say you have two medical
 

3015
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,750
example say you have two medical
treatments a and B you don't know the

01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:20,760
treatments a and B you don't know the
 

3017
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,730
treatments a and B you don't know the
effectiveness you try a a little bit be

3018
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:22,740
effectiveness you try a a little bit be
 

3019
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,920
effectiveness you try a a little bit be
a little bit but you don't want to harm

3020
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:24,930
a little bit but you don't want to harm
 

3021
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:26,950
a little bit but you don't want to harm
too many patients so you have to sort of

3022
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:26,960
too many patients so you have to sort of
 

3023
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,260
too many patients so you have to sort of
trade-off exploring yeah and at some

3024
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:30,270
trade-off exploring yeah and at some
 

3025
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:33,230
trade-off exploring yeah and at some
point you want to explore and you can do

3026
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:33,240
point you want to explore and you can do
 

3027
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,820
point you want to explore and you can do

agency also non-bayesian agents but it
 

3033
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,359

long term planning is a really important
 

3061
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:14,660
long term planning is a really important
but the long term part of the planet is

but the long term part of the planet is
 

3063
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:17,150
but the long term part of the planet is
really important yes and also I mean

really important yes and also I mean

01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,640
really important yes and also I mean

01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:21,780
you think is removing the Markov

it's important but is it like

3074
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:29,089
it's important but is it like
 

3075
01:03:29,089 --> 01:03:31,190
it's important but is it like
fundamentally transformative to the

fundamentally transformative to the
 

3077
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,680
fundamentally transformative to the

01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,660

we make that assumption quite often it's

we make that assumption quite often it's
 

3083
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:40,220
we make that assumption quite often it's
just throwing away the past now I think

3084
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:40,230
just throwing away the past now I think
 

3085
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:43,780
just throwing away the past now I think
it's absolutely crucial the question is

3086
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:43,790
it's absolutely crucial the question is
 

3087
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,270
it's absolutely crucial the question is
whether there's a way to deal with it in

3088
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,280
whether there's a way to deal with it in
 

3089
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,200
whether there's a way to deal with it in
a more holistic and still sufficiently

3090
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:51,210
a more holistic and still sufficiently
 

3091
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:54,740
a more holistic and still sufficiently
well way so I have to come up with an

3092
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:54,750
well way so I have to come up with an
 

3093
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,120
well way so I have to come up with an
example and fly but you know you have

3094
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:56,130
example and fly but you know you have
 

3095
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:59,000
example and fly but you know you have
say some you know key event in your life

3096
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,010
say some you know key event in your life
 

3097
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,980
say some you know key event in your life
you know a long time ago you know in

01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:00,990
you know a long time ago you know in

01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:02,690
you know a long time ago you know in
some city or something you realize you

01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:02,700
some city or something you realize you
 

3101
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,250
some city or something you realize you
know that's a really dangerous street or

3102
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:04,260
know that's a really dangerous street or
 

3103
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,870
know that's a really dangerous street or
whatever right here and you want to

3104
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:05,880
whatever right here and you want to
 

3105
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,420
whatever right here and you want to
remember that forever right in case you

3106
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:08,430
remember that forever right in case you
 

3107
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:10,849
remember that forever right in case you
come back they're kind of a selective

3108
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:10,859
come back they're kind of a selective
 

3109
01:04:10,859 --> 01:04:12,589
come back they're kind of a selective
kind of memory so you remember that all

3110
01:04:12,589 --> 01:04:12,599
kind of memory so you remember that all
 

3111
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,230
kind of memory so you remember that all
the important events in the past but

3112
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:15,240
the important events in the past but
 

3113
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,539
the important events in the past but
somehow selecting the importance is see

3114
01:04:17,539 --> 01:04:17,549
somehow selecting the importance is see
 

3115
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:19,250
somehow selecting the importance is see
that's very hard yeah and I'm not

3116
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:19,260
that's very hard yeah and I'm not
 

3117
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,230
that's very hard yeah and I'm not
concerned about you know just storing

3118
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:21,240
concerned about you know just storing
 

3119
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,900
concerned about you know just storing
the whole history just you can calculate

3120
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:22,910
the whole history just you can calculate
 

3121
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:26,450
the whole history just you can calculate
you know human life says so you're 100

3122
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:26,460
you know human life says so you're 100
 

3123

you know human life says so you're 100
years doesn't matter right how much data

3124
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:29,970
years doesn't matter right how much data
 

3125
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,910

comes in through the vision system and

3126
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
comes in through the vision system and
 

3127
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,829
comes in through the vision system and
the auditory system you compress it a

3128
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:33,839
the auditory system you compress it a
 

3129
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,260
the auditory system you compress it a
little bit in this case law silly and

3130
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:36,270
little bit in this case law silly and
 

3131
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:38,660
little bit in this case law silly and
store it we are soon in the means of

3132
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:38,670
store it we are soon in the means of
 

3133
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,170
store it we are soon in the means of
just storing it yeah but you still need

3134
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:42,180
just storing it yeah but you still need
 

3135
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,690
just storing it yeah but you still need
to the selection for the planning part

3136
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:44,700
to the selection for the planning part
 

3137
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,039
to the selection for the planning part
and the compression for the

3138
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:46,049
and the compression for the
 

3139
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,200
and the compression for the
understanding part the raw storage I'm

3140
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,210
understanding part the raw storage I'm
 

3141
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:51,109
understanding part the raw storage I'm
really not concerned about and I think

3142
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
really not concerned about and I think
 

3143
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,030
really not concerned about and I think
we should just store if you develop an

3144
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:53,040
we should just store if you develop an
 

3145
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,170
we should just store if you develop an
agent preferably just restore all the

3146
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:57,180
agent preferably just restore all the
 

3147
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,950
agent preferably just restore all the
interaction history and then you build

3148
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:00,960
interaction history and then you build
 

3149
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,480
interaction history and then you build
of course models on top of it and you

3150
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:02,490
of course models on top of it and you
 

3151
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:05,059
of course models on top of it and you
compress it and you are selective but

3152
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:05,069
compress it and you are selective but
 

3153
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:07,670
compress it and you are selective but
occasionally you go back to the old data

3154
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,680
occasionally you go back to the old data
 

3155
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,849
occasionally you go back to the old data
and reanalyze it based on your new

3156
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:10,859
and reanalyze it based on your new
 

3157
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:12,410
and reanalyze it based on your new
experience you have you know sometimes

3158
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:12,420
experience you have you know sometimes
 

3159
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,359
experience you have you know sometimes
you you're in school you learn all these

3160
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:14,369
you you're in school you learn all these
 

3161
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,549
you you're in school you learn all these
things you think it's totally useless

3162
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:16,559
things you think it's totally useless
 

3163
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,260
things you think it's totally useless
and you know much later you realize not

3164
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:18,270
and you know much later you realize not
 

3165
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:21,200
and you know much later you realize not
you know it looks like as you thought

3166
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:21,210
you know it looks like as you thought
 

3167
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,490
you know it looks like as you thought
I'm looking at you linear algebra right

3168
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:24,500
I'm looking at you linear algebra right
 

3169
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,569
I'm looking at you linear algebra right
so maybe a minute let me ask about

3170
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:26,579
so maybe a minute let me ask about
 

3171
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:29,920
so maybe a minute let me ask about
objective functions because that rewards

3172
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:29,930
objective functions because that rewards
 

3173
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:33,530
objective functions because that rewards
it seems to be an important part the

3174
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:33,540
it seems to be an important part the
 

3175
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:37,490
it seems to be an important part the
rewards are kind of given to the system

3176
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:37,500
rewards are kind of given to the system
 

3177
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:43,099
rewards are kind of given to the system
for a lot of people the the

3178
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:43,109
for a lot of people the the
 

3179
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:45,200
for a lot of people the the
specification of the objective function

3180
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:45,210
specification of the objective function
 

3181
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:48,620
specification of the objective function
is a key part of intelligence like the

3182
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:48,630
is a key part of intelligence like the
 

3183
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:51,500
is a key part of intelligence like the
the agent itself figuring out what is

3184
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:51,510
the agent itself figuring out what is
 

3185
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:54,320
the agent itself figuring out what is
important what do you think about that

3186
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:54,330
important what do you think about that
 

3187
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:58,670
important what do you think about that
is it possible within IHC framework to

3188
01:05:58,670 --> 01:05:58,680
is it possible within IHC framework to
 

3189
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,450
is it possible within IHC framework to
yourself discover the reward based on

3190
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:02,460
yourself discover the reward based on
 

3191
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:06,170
yourself discover the reward based on
which you should operate okay that'll be

3192
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:06,180
which you should operate okay that'll be
 

3193
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:10,880
which you should operate okay that'll be
a long answer so and it is a very

3194
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:10,890
a long answer so and it is a very
 

3195
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:13,640
a long answer so and it is a very
interesting question and I asked a lot

3196
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:13,650
interesting question and I asked a lot
 

3197
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,080
interesting question and I asked a lot
about this question where do the rivers

3198
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:15,090
about this question where do the rivers
 

3199
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:20,540
about this question where do the rivers
come from and that depends yeah so and

3200
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:20,550
come from and that depends yeah so and
 

3201
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:21,980
come from and that depends yeah so and
there you know I give you now a couple

3202
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:21,990
there you know I give you now a couple
 

3203
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:23,720
there you know I give you now a couple
of answers so if you want to build

3204
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:23,730
of answers so if you want to build
 

3205
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:28,099
of answers so if you want to build
agents now let's start simple so let's

3206
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:28,109
agents now let's start simple so let's
 

3207
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,990
agents now let's start simple so let's
assume we want to build an agent based

3208
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,000
assume we want to build an agent based
 

3209
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,990
assume we want to build an agent based
on the aixi model which performs a

3210
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:33,000
on the aixi model which performs a
 

3211
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,940
on the aixi model which performs a
particular task let's start with

3212
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:34,950
particular task let's start with
 

3213
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,890
particular task let's start with
something super simple like I mean super

3214
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:36,900
something super simple like I mean super
 

3215
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,599
something super simple like I mean super
simple like playing chess or go or

3216
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:38,609
simple like playing chess or go or
 

3217
01:06:38,609 --> 01:06:41,450
simple like playing chess or go or
something yeah then you just you know

3218
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:41,460
something yeah then you just you know
 

3219
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,859
something yeah then you just you know
the reward is you know winning the game

3220
01:06:42,859 --> 01:06:42,869
the reward is you know winning the game
 

3221
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:44,540
the reward is you know winning the game
is plus one losing theorems minus one

3222
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:44,550
is plus one losing theorems minus one
 

3223
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:47,660
is plus one losing theorems minus one
done you apply this agent if you have

3224
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:47,670
done you apply this agent if you have
 

3225
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,150
done you apply this agent if you have
enough compute you let itself play and

3226
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160
enough compute you let itself play and
 

3227
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,859
enough compute you let itself play and
it will learn the rules of the game will

3228
01:06:51,859 --> 01:06:51,869
it will learn the rules of the game will
 

3229
01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:52,970
it will learn the rules of the game will
play perfect chess

3230
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:52,980
play perfect chess
 

3231
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,500
play perfect chess
after some while problem solve okay so

3232
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:56,510
after some while problem solve okay so
 

3233
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,740
after some while problem solve okay so
if you have more complicated problems

3234
01:06:59,740 --> 01:06:59,750
if you have more complicated problems
 

3235
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:03,859
if you have more complicated problems
then you may believe that you have the

3236
01:07:03,859 --> 01:07:03,869
then you may believe that you have the
 

3237
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:05,900
then you may believe that you have the
right rewrote but it's not so a nice

3238
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:05,910
right rewrote but it's not so a nice
 

3239
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:09,230
right rewrote but it's not so a nice
cute example is elevator control that is

3240
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:09,240
cute example is elevator control that is
 

3241
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,210
cute example is elevator control that is
also in rich Sutton's book which is a

3242
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:11,220
also in rich Sutton's book which is a
 

3243
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:15,050
also in rich Sutton's book which is a
great book by the way so you control the

3244
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:15,060
great book by the way so you control the
 

3245
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,270
great book by the way so you control the
elevator and you think well maybe the

3246
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:17,280
elevator and you think well maybe the
 

3247
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,829
elevator and you think well maybe the
reward should be coupled to how long

3248
01:07:18,829 --> 01:07:18,839
reward should be coupled to how long
 

3249
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:20,420
reward should be coupled to how long
people wait in front of the elevator you

3250
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:20,430
people wait in front of the elevator you
 

3251
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:23,150
people wait in front of the elevator you
know long wait is bad you program it and

3252
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:23,160
know long wait is bad you program it and
 

3253
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,099
know long wait is bad you program it and
you do it and what happens is the

3254
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:25,109
you do it and what happens is the
 

3255
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:26,870
you do it and what happens is the
elevator eagerly picks up all the people

3256
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:26,880
elevator eagerly picks up all the people
 

3257
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,930
elevator eagerly picks up all the people
but never drops them off maybe the time

3258
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:32,940
but never drops them off maybe the time
 

3259
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,550
but never drops them off maybe the time
in the elevator also counts so you

3260
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:34,560
in the elevator also counts so you
 

3261
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,950
in the elevator also counts so you
minimize the sum yeah yeah in the

3262
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
minimize the sum yeah yeah in the
 

3263
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,960
minimize the sum yeah yeah in the
elevator does that but never picks up

3264
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:38,970
elevator does that but never picks up
 

3265
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,520
elevator does that but never picks up
the people in the tenth row in the top

3266
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:40,530
the people in the tenth row in the top
 

3267
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,410
the people in the tenth row in the top
floor because in expectation it's not

3268
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:42,420
floor because in expectation it's not
 

3269
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:47,810
floor because in expectation it's not
worth it just let them stay so so even

3270
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:47,820
worth it just let them stay so so even
 

3271
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:50,510
worth it just let them stay so so even
in apparently simple problems you can

3272
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:50,520
in apparently simple problems you can
 

3273
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,350
in apparently simple problems you can
make mistakes

3274
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:51,360
make mistakes
 

3275
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,650
make mistakes
you know and that's what in in war

3276
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:54,660
you know and that's what in in war
 

3277
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,570
you know and that's what in in war
serious context say a GI safety

3278
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:56,580
serious context say a GI safety
 

3279
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:59,180
serious context say a GI safety
researchers consider so now let's go

3280
01:07:59,180 --> 01:07:59,190
researchers consider so now let's go
 

3281
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:01,970
researchers consider so now let's go
back to general agents so assume you

3282
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:01,980
back to general agents so assume you
 

3283
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,190
back to general agents so assume you
want to build an agent which is

3284
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:03,200
want to build an agent which is
 

3285
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,840
want to build an agent which is
generally useful to humans yes we have a

3286
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:05,850
generally useful to humans yes we have a
 

3287
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:08,600
generally useful to humans yes we have a
household robot here and it should do

3288
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:08,610
household robot here and it should do
 

3289
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:12,080
household robot here and it should do
all kinds of tasks so in this case the

3290
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:12,090
all kinds of tasks so in this case the
 

3291
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:14,480
all kinds of tasks so in this case the
human should give the reward on the fly

3292
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:14,490
human should give the reward on the fly
 

3293
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,190
human should give the reward on the fly
I mean maybe it's pre trained in the

3294
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:16,200
I mean maybe it's pre trained in the
 

3295
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,630
I mean maybe it's pre trained in the
factory and there there's some sort of

3296
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:17,640
factory and there there's some sort of
 

3297
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,370
factory and there there's some sort of
internal reward for you know the battery

3298
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:19,380
internal reward for you know the battery
 

3299
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:22,190
internal reward for you know the battery
level or whatever here but so it you

3300
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:22,200
level or whatever here but so it you
 

3301
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,720
level or whatever here but so it you
know it does the dishes badly you know

3302
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:23,730
know it does the dishes badly you know
 

3303
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,310
know it does the dishes badly you know
you punish the robot intercept good you

3304
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:25,320
you punish the robot intercept good you
 

3305
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,320
you punish the robot intercept good you
read what the robot and then train it do

3306
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:27,330
read what the robot and then train it do
 

3307
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,820
read what the robot and then train it do
a new task you know like a child right

3308
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:28,830
a new task you know like a child right
 

3309
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:31,910
a new task you know like a child right
so you need the human in the loop if you

3310
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:31,920
so you need the human in the loop if you
 

3311
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,130
so you need the human in the loop if you
want a system which is useful to the

3312
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:34,140
want a system which is useful to the
 

3313
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:37,550
want a system which is useful to the
human and as long as this agent stays up

3314
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:37,560
human and as long as this agent stays up
 

3315
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,820
human and as long as this agent stays up
human level that should work reasonably

3316
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:40,830
human level that should work reasonably
 

3317
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:42,410
human level that should work reasonably
well I'm apart from you know these

3318
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:42,420
well I'm apart from you know these
 

3319
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,660
well I'm apart from you know these
examples it becomes critical if they

3320
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:44,670
examples it becomes critical if they
 

3321
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:46,430
examples it becomes critical if they
become you know on a human level it's

3322
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:46,440
become you know on a human level it's
 

3323
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,390
become you know on a human level it's
it's that miss children small children

3324
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:47,400
it's that miss children small children
 

3325
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,950
it's that miss children small children
you have reason to be well under control

3326
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:48,960
you have reason to be well under control
 

3327
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,830
you have reason to be well under control
they become older the river technique

3328
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:51,840
they become older the river technique
 

3329
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,950
they become older the river technique
doesn't work so well anymore

3330
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:53,960
doesn't work so well anymore
 

3331
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:59,090
doesn't work so well anymore
so then finally so this would be agents

3332
01:08:59,090 --> 01:08:59,100
so then finally so this would be agents
 

3333
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,160
so then finally so this would be agents
which are just you could sorry slaves to

3334
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:01,170
which are just you could sorry slaves to
 

3335
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,230
which are just you could sorry slaves to
the humans yeah so if you are more

3336
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:03,240
the humans yeah so if you are more
 

3337
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,090
the humans yeah so if you are more
ambitious and just say we want to build

3338
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:05,100
ambitious and just say we want to build
 

3339
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,690
ambitious and just say we want to build
a new species of intelligent beings we

3340
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:08,700
a new species of intelligent beings we
 

3341
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,490
a new species of intelligent beings we
put them on a new planet and we want

3342
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:10,500
put them on a new planet and we want
 

3343
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,440
put them on a new planet and we want
them to develop this planet or whatever

3344
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:12,450
them to develop this planet or whatever
 

3345
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:16,250
them to develop this planet or whatever
so we don't give them any reward so what

3346
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:16,260
so we don't give them any reward so what
 

3347
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:20,150
so we don't give them any reward so what
could we do and you could try to you

3348
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:20,160
could we do and you could try to you
 

3349
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,560
could we do and you could try to you
know come up with some reward functions

3350
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:21,570
know come up with some reward functions
 

3351
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:23,240
know come up with some reward functions
like you know it should maintain itself

3352
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:23,250
like you know it should maintain itself
 

3353
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,270
like you know it should maintain itself
the robot it should maybe multiply build

3354
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:26,280
the robot it should maybe multiply build
 

3355
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:31,550
the robot it should maybe multiply build
more robots right and you know maybe for

3356
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:31,560
more robots right and you know maybe for
 

3357
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,050
more robots right and you know maybe for
all kinds of things did you find useful

3358
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:33,060
all kinds of things did you find useful
 

3359
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:34,460
all kinds of things did you find useful
but that's pretty hard right you know

3360
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:34,470
but that's pretty hard right you know
 

3361
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,560
but that's pretty hard right you know
what what the self maintenance mean you

3362
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:36,570
what what the self maintenance mean you
 

3363
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:38,030
what what the self maintenance mean you
know what does it mean to build a copy

3364
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:38,040
know what does it mean to build a copy
 

3365
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,070
know what does it mean to build a copy
should be exact copy an approximate copy

3366
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,080
should be exact copy an approximate copy
 

3367
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,820
should be exact copy an approximate copy
and so that's really hard but LaVon or

3368
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:43,830
and so that's really hard but LaVon or
 

3369
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:46,610
and so that's really hard but LaVon or
so also a deep mind developed a

3370
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:46,620
so also a deep mind developed a
 

3371
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:49,880
so also a deep mind developed a
beautiful model so it just took the aixi

3372
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:49,890
beautiful model so it just took the aixi
 

3373
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:53,060
beautiful model so it just took the aixi
model and coupled the rewards to

3374
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:53,070
model and coupled the rewards to
 

3375
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:56,600
model and coupled the rewards to
information gained so he said the reward

3376
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:56,610
information gained so he said the reward
 

3377
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,000
information gained so he said the reward
is proportional to how much the agent

3378
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,010
is proportional to how much the agent
 

3379
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:01,160
is proportional to how much the agent
had learned about the world and you can

3380
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:01,170
had learned about the world and you can
 

3381
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:03,260
had learned about the world and you can
rigorously formally uniquely define it

3382
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:03,270
rigorously formally uniquely define it
 

3383
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,500
rigorously formally uniquely define it
in terms of our case

3384
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:04,510
in terms of our case
 

3385
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:07,470
in terms of our case
versions okay so if you put it in you

3386
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:07,480
versions okay so if you put it in you
 

3387
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,990
versions okay so if you put it in you
get a completely autonomous agent and

3388
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,000
get a completely autonomous agent and
 

3389
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,790
get a completely autonomous agent and
actually interestingly for this agent we

3390
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:11,800
actually interestingly for this agent we
 

3391
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,439
actually interestingly for this agent we
can prove much stronger result and for

3392
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:13,449
can prove much stronger result and for
 

3393
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:15,870
can prove much stronger result and for
the general agent which is also nice and

3394
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:15,880
the general agent which is also nice and
 

3395
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,540
the general agent which is also nice and
if you let this agent loose it will be

3396
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:18,550
if you let this agent loose it will be
 

3397
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,250
if you let this agent loose it will be
in a sense the optimal scientist is this

3398
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:20,260
in a sense the optimal scientist is this
 

3399
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,109
in a sense the optimal scientist is this
absolutely curious to learn as much as

3400
01:10:22,109 --> 01:10:22,119
absolutely curious to learn as much as
 

3401
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:24,750
absolutely curious to learn as much as
possible about the world and of course

3402
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:24,760
possible about the world and of course
 

3403
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,459
possible about the world and of course
it will also have a lot of instrumental

3404
01:10:26,459 --> 01:10:26,469
it will also have a lot of instrumental
 

3405
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:28,410
it will also have a lot of instrumental
goals right in order to learn it needs

3406
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:28,420
goals right in order to learn it needs
 

3407
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,000
goals right in order to learn it needs
to at least survive right a dead agent

3408
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,010
to at least survive right a dead agent
 

3409
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:32,399
to at least survive right a dead agent
is not good for anything so it needs to

3410
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:32,409
is not good for anything so it needs to
 

3411
01:10:32,409 --> 01:10:34,859
is not good for anything so it needs to
have self-preservation and if it builds

3412
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:34,869
have self-preservation and if it builds
 

3413
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:36,950
have self-preservation and if it builds
small helpless acquiring more

3414
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:36,960
small helpless acquiring more
 

3415
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,620
small helpless acquiring more
information it will do that yeah if

3416
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:39,630
information it will do that yeah if
 

3417
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:42,180
information it will do that yeah if
exploration space exploration or

gathering information and develop it so

3422
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:46,090
gathering information and develop it so
 

3423
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:48,029
gathering information and develop it so
it has a lot of instrumental goals

3424
01:10:48,029 --> 01:10:48,039
it has a lot of instrumental goals
 

3425
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:50,939
it has a lot of instrumental goals
following on this information gain and

3426
01:10:50,939 --> 01:10:50,949
following on this information gain and
 

3427
01:10:50,949 --> 01:10:52,979
following on this information gain and
this agent is completely autonomous of

3428
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:52,989
this agent is completely autonomous of
 

3429
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:56,160
this agent is completely autonomous of
us no rebirth necessary anymore yeah of

3430
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:56,170
us no rebirth necessary anymore yeah of
 

3431
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,990
us no rebirth necessary anymore yeah of
course you could define the awaited game

3432
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:58,000
course you could define the awaited game
 

3433
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,680
course you could define the awaited game
the concept of information it gets stuck

3434
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:01,690
the concept of information it gets stuck
 

3435
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,680
the concept of information it gets stuck
in that library that you mentioned

3436
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:04,690
in that library that you mentioned
 

3437
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:07,589
in that library that you mentioned
beforehand with the was a very large

3438
01:11:07,589 --> 01:11:07,599
beforehand with the was a very large
 

3439
01:11:07,599 --> 01:11:09,629
beforehand with the was a very large
number of books the first agent had this

3440
01:11:09,629 --> 01:11:09,639
number of books the first agent had this
 

3441
01:11:09,639 --> 01:11:12,299
number of books the first agent had this
problem and it would get stuck in front

3442
01:11:12,299 --> 01:11:12,309
problem and it would get stuck in front
 

3443
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:14,250
problem and it would get stuck in front
of an old TV screen which has just said

3444
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:14,260
of an old TV screen which has just said
 

3445
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:17,819
of an old TV screen which has just said
white noise yeah I know but the second

3446
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:17,829
white noise yeah I know but the second
 

3447
01:11:17,829 --> 01:11:19,080
white noise yeah I know but the second
version can deal with at least

3448
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:19,090
version can deal with at least
 

3449
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:22,740
version can deal with at least
stochasticity well yeah what about

3450
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:22,750
stochasticity well yeah what about
 

3451
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:26,100
stochasticity well yeah what about
curiosity this kind of word curiosity

3452
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:26,110
curiosity this kind of word curiosity
 

3453
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:30,089
curiosity this kind of word curiosity
creativity is that kind of the reward

3454
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:30,099
creativity is that kind of the reward
 

3455
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:31,439
creativity is that kind of the reward
function being of getting new

3456
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:31,449
function being of getting new
 

3457
01:11:31,449 --> 01:11:34,470
function being of getting new
information is that similar to idea of

3458
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,480
information is that similar to idea of
 

3459
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:39,299
information is that similar to idea of
kind of injecting exploration for its

3460
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:39,309
kind of injecting exploration for its
 

3461
01:11:39,309 --> 01:11:41,970
kind of injecting exploration for its
own sake inside the reward function do

3462
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:41,980
own sake inside the reward function do
 

3463
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,169
own sake inside the reward function do
you find this at all appealing

3464
01:11:43,169 --> 01:11:43,179
you find this at all appealing
 

3465
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:45,750
you find this at all appealing
interesting I think that's a nice

3466
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:45,760
interesting I think that's a nice
 

3467
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,930
interesting I think that's a nice
definition curiosity is reward sorry

3468
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:48,940
definition curiosity is reward sorry
 

3469
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,000
definition curiosity is reward sorry
curiosity is exploration for its own

3470
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:51,010
curiosity is exploration for its own
 

3471
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:57,600
curiosity is exploration for its own
sake yeah I would accept that but most

3472
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:57,610
sake yeah I would accept that but most
 

3473
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:00,359
sake yeah I would accept that but most
curiosity well in humans and especially

3474
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:00,369
curiosity well in humans and especially
 

3475
01:12:00,369 --> 01:12:02,279
curiosity well in humans and especially
in children yeah it's not just for its

3476
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:02,289
in children yeah it's not just for its
 

3477
01:12:02,289 --> 01:12:04,740
in children yeah it's not just for its
own sake but for actually learning about

3478
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:04,750
own sake but for actually learning about
 

3479
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:08,669
own sake but for actually learning about
the environment and for behaving so I

3480
01:12:08,669 --> 01:12:08,679
the environment and for behaving so I
 

3481
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:11,939
the environment and for behaving so I
would I think most curiosity is tied in

3482
01:12:11,939 --> 01:12:11,949
would I think most curiosity is tied in
 

3483
01:12:11,949 --> 01:12:15,029
would I think most curiosity is tied in
the end towards performing better well

3484
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:15,039
the end towards performing better well
 

3485
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,000
the end towards performing better well
okay so if intelligence systems need to

3486
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,010
okay so if intelligence systems need to
 

3487
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:18,700
okay so if intelligence systems need to
have the show

3488
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:18,710
have the show
 

3489
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,760
have the show

01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:37,120
that Marcus hunter is operating under
 

3501
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,970
that Marcus hunter is operating under
okay to the first question the

3502
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:39,980
okay to the first question the
 

3503
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,760
okay to the first question the
biological reward function is to survive

3504
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:42,770
biological reward function is to survive
 

3505
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:46,030
biological reward function is to survive
and to spread and very few humans sort

3506
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:46,040
and to spread and very few humans sort
 

3507
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,760
and to spread and very few humans sort
of are able to overcome this biological

3508
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:48,770
of are able to overcome this biological
 

3509
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:53,200
of are able to overcome this biological
reward function but we live in a very

3510
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:53,210
reward function but we live in a very
 

3511
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:55,510
reward function but we live in a very
nice world where we have lots of spare

3512
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:55,520
nice world where we have lots of spare
 

3513
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,850
nice world where we have lots of spare
time and can still survive and spread so

3514
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:57,860
time and can still survive and spread so
 

3515
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:01,870
time and can still survive and spread so
we can develop arbitrary other interests

3516
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:01,880
we can develop arbitrary other interests
 

3517
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,910
we can develop arbitrary other interests
which is quite interesting on top of

3518
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:03,920
which is quite interesting on top of
 

3519
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,690
which is quite interesting on top of
that that yeah but this survival and

3520
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:07,700
that that yeah but this survival and
 

3521
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:11,050
that that yeah but this survival and
spreading sort of is I would say the the

3522
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:11,060
spreading sort of is I would say the the
 

3523
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,940
spreading sort of is I would say the the
goal or the reward function of human

3524
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:12,950
goal or the reward function of human
 

3525
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,260
goal or the reward function of human
said that the core one

3526
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:14,270
said that the core one
 

3527
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:16,690
said that the core one
I like how you avoided answering the

3528
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:16,700
I like how you avoided answering the
 

3529
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,010
I like how you avoided answering the
second question which a good

3530
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:18,020
second question which a good
 

3531
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:21,610
second question which a good
intelligence would so my that your own

intelligence would so my that your own
 

3533
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,560
intelligence would so my that your own
meaning of life and the reward function

3534
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:23,570

01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:26,390
my own meaning of life and Riyad
 

3537

beautifully put okay let's dissect Ickes

3540
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:33,530
beautifully put okay let's dissect Ickes
 

3541
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,709
beautifully put okay let's dissect Ickes
even further so one of the assumptions

3542
01:13:35,709 --> 01:13:35,719
even further so one of the assumptions
 

3543
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:38,830
even further so one of the assumptions
is kind of infinity keeps creeping up

3544
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:38,840
is kind of infinity keeps creeping up
 

3545
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:44,800
is kind of infinity keeps creeping up
everywhere which what are your thoughts

3546
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:44,810
everywhere which what are your thoughts
 

3547
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:48,040
everywhere which what are your thoughts
and kind of bounded rationality and so

3548
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:48,050
and kind of bounded rationality and so
 

3549
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,770
and kind of bounded rationality and so
the nature of our existence and

3550
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:49,780
the nature of our existence and
 

3551
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,550
the nature of our existence and
intelligence systems is that we're

3552
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:51,560
intelligence systems is that we're
 

3553
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,790
intelligence systems is that we're
operating all under constraints under

3554
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:53,800
operating all under constraints under
 

3555
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,530
operating all under constraints under
you know limited time limited resources

3556
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:56,540
you know limited time limited resources
 

3557
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:59,140
you know limited time limited resources
how does that how do you think about

3558
01:13:59,140 --> 01:13:59,150
how does that how do you think about
 

3559
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:03,160
how does that how do you think about
that with an IQ framework within trying

3560
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:03,170
that with an IQ framework within trying
 

3561
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:04,630
that with an IQ framework within trying
to create an eg a system that operates

3562
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:04,640
to create an eg a system that operates
 

3563
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,840
to create an eg a system that operates
under these constraints yeah that is one

3564
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:07,850
under these constraints yeah that is one
 

3565
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,160
under these constraints yeah that is one
of the criticisms around I could see

3566
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:09,170
of the criticisms around I could see
 

3567
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:10,720
of the criticisms around I could see
that it ignores computation and

3568
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:10,730
that it ignores computation and
 

3569
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:12,880
that it ignores computation and
completely and some people believe that

3570
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:12,890
completely and some people believe that
 

3571
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:15,940
completely and some people believe that
intelligence is inherently tied to

3572
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:15,950
intelligence is inherently tied to
 

3573
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:19,870
intelligence is inherently tied to
what's bounded resources what do you

3574
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:19,880
what's bounded resources what do you
 

3575
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,570
what's bounded resources what do you
think on this one point I think it's do

3576
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:22,580
think on this one point I think it's do
 

3577
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:24,010
think on this one point I think it's do
you think the boundary of resources are

3578
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:24,020
you think the boundary of resources are
 

3579
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:28,870
you think the boundary of resources are
fundamental to intelligence I would say

3580
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:28,880
fundamental to intelligence I would say
 

3581
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,060
fundamental to intelligence I would say
that an intelligence notion which ignore

3582
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:32,070
that an intelligence notion which ignore
 

3583
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:34,340
that an intelligence notion which ignore
computational limits is extremely useful

3584
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:34,350
computational limits is extremely useful
 

3585
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:37,280
computational limits is extremely useful
a good intelligence notion which

3586
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:37,290
a good intelligence notion which
 

3587
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:39,620
a good intelligence notion which
includes these resources would be even

3588
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:39,630
includes these resources would be even
 

3589
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:42,310
includes these resources would be even
more useful but we don't have that yet

3590
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:42,320
more useful but we don't have that yet
 

3591
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,610
more useful but we don't have that yet
and so look at other fields outside of

3592
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:46,620
and so look at other fields outside of
 

3593
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:49,730
and so look at other fields outside of
computer science computational aspects

3594
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:49,740
computer science computational aspects
 

3595
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:52,280
computer science computational aspects
never play a fundamental role you

3596
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:52,290
never play a fundamental role you
 

3597
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:54,740
never play a fundamental role you
develop biological models for cells

3598
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:54,750
develop biological models for cells
 

3599
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,750
develop biological models for cells
something in physics these theories I

3600
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:56,760
something in physics these theories I
 

3601
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,700
something in physics these theories I
mean become more and more crazy and hard

3602
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:58,710
mean become more and more crazy and hard
 

3603
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:01,100
mean become more and more crazy and hard
and harder to compute well in the end of

3604
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:01,110
and harder to compute well in the end of
 

3605
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:02,600
and harder to compute well in the end of
course we need to do something with this

3606
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:02,610
course we need to do something with this
 

3607
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:04,250
course we need to do something with this
model but this more a nuisance than a

3608
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:04,260
model but this more a nuisance than a
 

3609
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:08,300
model but this more a nuisance than a
feature and I'm sometimes wondering if

3610
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:08,310
feature and I'm sometimes wondering if
 

3611
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:10,640
feature and I'm sometimes wondering if
artificial intelligence would not sit in

3612
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:10,650
artificial intelligence would not sit in
 

3613
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:12,350
artificial intelligence would not sit in
a computer science department but in a

3614
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:12,360
a computer science department but in a
 

3615
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,610
a computer science department but in a
philosophy department

3616
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:13,620
philosophy department
 

3617
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:16,340
philosophy department
then this computational focus would be

3618
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:16,350
then this computational focus would be
 

3619
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,710
then this computational focus would be
probably significantly less I mean think

3620
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:18,720
probably significantly less I mean think
 

3621
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,120
probably significantly less I mean think
about the induction problem is more in

3622

the philosophy department there's really

3624
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:22,590
the philosophy department there's really
 

3625
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,650
the philosophy department there's really
no paper who cares about you know how

computational resources then the next

3636
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:37,890
computational resources then the next
 

3637
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:39,560
computational resources then the next
and very good question is could we

3638
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:39,570
and very good question is could we
 

3639
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,960
and very good question is could we
improve it by including computational

3640

3778
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:41,400
write the algorithm to minimax to the
 

3779
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,980
write the algorithm to minimax to the
end of the game so you write down what

3780
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:42,990
end of the game so you write down what
 

3781
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:46,910
end of the game so you write down what
the girdle machine should do then it

3782
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:46,920
the girdle machine should do then it
 

3783
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,220
the girdle machine should do then it
will take part of it resources to run

3784
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:49,230
will take part of it resources to run
 

3785
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:51,620
will take part of it resources to run
this program and other part of the

3786
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:51,630
this program and other part of the
 

3787
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:54,680
this program and other part of the
sources to improve this program and when

3788
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:54,690
sources to improve this program and when
 

3789
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:57,100
sources to improve this program and when
it finds an improved version which

3790
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:57,110
it finds an improved version which
 

3791
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,330
it finds an improved version which
provably

3792
01:18:59,330 --> 01:18:59,340
provably
 

3793
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,430
provably
it's the same answer so that's the key

3794
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,440
it's the same answer so that's the key
 

3795
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,680
it's the same answer so that's the key
part yeah it needs to prove by itself

3796
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:03,690
part yeah it needs to prove by itself
 

3797
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:06,050
part yeah it needs to prove by itself
that this change of program still

3798
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:06,060
that this change of program still
 

3799
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,780
that this change of program still
satisfies the original specification and

3800
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:08,790
satisfies the original specification and
 

3801
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,939
satisfies the original specification and
if it does so then it replaces the

3802
01:19:10,939 --> 01:19:10,949
if it does so then it replaces the
 

3803
01:19:10,949 --> 01:19:12,680
if it does so then it replaces the
original program by the improved program

3804
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:12,690
original program by the improved program
 

3805
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:15,169
original program by the improved program
and by definition does the same job but

3806
01:19:15,169 --> 01:19:15,179
and by definition does the same job but
 

3807
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:17,780
and by definition does the same job but
just faster okay and then you know it

3808
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:17,790
just faster okay and then you know it
 

3809
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:20,540
just faster okay and then you know it
proved over it and over it and it's it's

3810
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:20,550
proved over it and over it and it's it's
 

3811
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:24,229
proved over it and over it and it's it's
it's developed in a way that all parts

3812
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:24,239
it's developed in a way that all parts
 

3813
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,240
it's developed in a way that all parts
of this girdle machine can self improve

3814
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:26,250
of this girdle machine can self improve
 

3815
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:29,330
of this girdle machine can self improve
but it stays provably consistent with

3816
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:29,340
but it stays provably consistent with
 

3817
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:33,260
but it stays provably consistent with
the original specification so from this

3818
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:33,270
the original specification so from this
 

3819
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,879
the original specification so from this
perspective it has nothing to do with

3820
01:19:34,879 --> 01:19:34,889
perspective it has nothing to do with
 

3821
01:19:34,889 --> 01:19:38,209
perspective it has nothing to do with
aixi but if you would now put axial as

3822
01:19:38,209 --> 01:19:38,219
aixi but if you would now put axial as
 

3823
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:41,479
aixi but if you would now put axial as
the starting axioms in it would run arc

3824
01:19:41,479 --> 01:19:41,489
the starting axioms in it would run arc
 

3825
01:19:41,489 --> 01:19:44,959
the starting axioms in it would run arc
C but you know that takes forever but

3826
01:19:44,959 --> 01:19:44,969
C but you know that takes forever but
 

3827
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:47,930
C but you know that takes forever but
then if it finds a provable speed-up of

3828
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:47,940
then if it finds a provable speed-up of
 

3829
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:50,030
then if it finds a provable speed-up of
Arc C it would replace it by this and

3830
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:50,040
Arc C it would replace it by this and
 

3831
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,560
Arc C it would replace it by this and
that this and this and maybe eventually

3832
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:51,570
that this and this and maybe eventually
 

3833
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:53,300
that this and this and maybe eventually
it comes up with a model which is still

then ax is optimal

3900
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:17,060
then ax is optimal

for the goal interesting human things
 

3935
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:06,980
for the goal interesting human things
can emerge so is there a place for

can emerge so is there a place for
consciousness within IHC what where does

3938
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:11,250
consciousness within IHC what where does
 

3939
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:14,120

uh maybe you can comment because I

3940
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:14,130
uh maybe you can comment because I
 

3941
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:16,610
uh maybe you can comment because I
suppose we humans are just another

3942
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:16,620
suppose we humans are just another
 

3943
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:19,100
suppose we humans are just another
instantiation Vioxx agents and we seem

3944
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:19,110
instantiation Vioxx agents and we seem
 

3945
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:21,710
instantiation Vioxx agents and we seem
to have consciousness you say humans are

3946
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:21,720
to have consciousness you say humans are
 

3947
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,810
to have consciousness you say humans are
an instantiation of Mike's agent yes oh

3948
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:23,820
an instantiation of Mike's agent yes oh
 

3949
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,970
an instantiation of Mike's agent yes oh
that would be amazing but I think that's

3950
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:25,980
that would be amazing but I think that's
 

3951
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,430
that would be amazing but I think that's
three for the smartest and most rational

3952
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:28,440
three for the smartest and most rational
 

3953
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,220
three for the smartest and most rational
humans I think maybe we are very crude

3954
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:31,230
humans I think maybe we are very crude
 

3955
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:34,190
humans I think maybe we are very crude
approximation interesting I mean I tend

3956
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:34,200
approximation interesting I mean I tend
 

3957
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,130
approximation interesting I mean I tend
to believe again I'm Russian so I tend

3958
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:37,140
to believe again I'm Russian so I tend
 

3959
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:40,040
to believe again I'm Russian so I tend
to believe our flaws are part of the

3960
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:40,050
to believe our flaws are part of the
 

3961
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:44,480
to believe our flaws are part of the
optimal so the we tend to laugh off and

3962
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:44,490
optimal so the we tend to laugh off and
 

3963
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:47,390
optimal so the we tend to laugh off and
criticize our flaws and I tend to think

3964
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:47,400
criticize our flaws and I tend to think
 

3965
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,880
criticize our flaws and I tend to think
that that's actually close to an optimal

3966
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:49,890
that that's actually close to an optimal
 

3967
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:52,610
that that's actually close to an optimal
behavior but some flaws if you think

3968
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:52,620
behavior but some flaws if you think
 

3969
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:54,320
behavior but some flaws if you think
more carefully about it are actually not

3970
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:54,330
more carefully about it are actually not
 

3971
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:56,540
more carefully about it are actually not
floss yeah but I think there are still

3972
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:56,550
floss yeah but I think there are still
 

3973
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:00,560
floss yeah but I think there are still
enough flaws I don't know it's unclear

3974
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:00,570
enough flaws I don't know it's unclear
 

3975
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:02,660
enough flaws I don't know it's unclear
as a student of history I think all the

3976
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:02,670
as a student of history I think all the
 

3977
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,390
as a student of history I think all the
suffering that we've been endured as a

suffering that we've been endured as a
 

3979
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,570
suffering that we've been endured as a
civilization it's possible that that's

01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:08,580
civilization it's possible that that's
 

3981
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:10,460
civilization it's possible that that's
the optimal amount of suffering we need

3982
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:10,470
the optimal amount of suffering we need
 

3983
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:13,070
the optimal amount of suffering we need
to endure to minimize the long-term

01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:13,080
to endure to minimize the long-term
 

3985
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:16,450
to endure to minimize the long-term
suffering that's your Russian background

3986
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:16,460
suffering that's your Russian background
 

3987
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:19,070
suffering that's your Russian background
that's the Russian weather whoo humans

01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:19,080
that's the Russian weather whoo humans

do you think there's a consciousness of

do you think there's a consciousness of
 

3993

no formal framework like IHC let me also

3996
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:30,090
no formal framework like IHC let me also
 

3997
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:32,180
no formal framework like IHC let me also
ask you a question do you think I'm

3998
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:32,190
ask you a question do you think I'm
 

3999
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:37,910
ask you a question do you think I'm
conscious that's a good question you

4000
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:37,920
conscious that's a good question you
 

4001
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:43,009
conscious that's a good question you
you're that that tie is confusing me but

4002
01:23:43,009 --> 01:23:43,019
you're that that tie is confusing me but
 

4003
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:45,169
you're that that tie is confusing me but
I think you think it makes me

4004
01:23:45,169 --> 01:23:45,179
I think you think it makes me
 

4005
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:47,209
I think you think it makes me
unconscious because it strangles me if

4006
01:23:47,209 --> 01:23:47,219
unconscious because it strangles me if

01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:49,279
unconscious because it strangles me if
if an agent were to solve the imitation

4008
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:49,289
if an agent were to solve the imitation
 

4009
01:23:49,289 --> 01:23:51,169
if an agent were to solve the imitation
game posed by touring I think they would

4010
01:23:51,169 --> 01:23:51,179
game posed by touring I think they would
 

4011
01:23:51,179 --> 01:23:53,779
game posed by touring I think they would
be dressed similarly to you that because

4012
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:53,789
be dressed similarly to you that because
 

4013
01:23:53,789 --> 01:23:56,750
be dressed similarly to you that because
there's a there's a kind of flamboyant

4014
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:56,760
there's a there's a kind of flamboyant
 

4015
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:01,009
there's a there's a kind of flamboyant
interesting complex behavior pattern

4016
01:24:01,009 --> 01:24:01,019
interesting complex behavior pattern
 

4017
01:24:01,019 --> 01:24:02,959
interesting complex behavior pattern
that sells that you're human and you're

4018
01:24:02,959 --> 01:24:02,969
that sells that you're human and you're
 

4019
01:24:02,969 --> 01:24:06,709
that sells that you're human and you're
cautious but why do you ask was it a yes

4020
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:06,719
cautious but why do you ask was it a yes
 

4021
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:10,850
cautious but why do you ask was it a yes
always gonna know yes I think you're

4022
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:10,860
always gonna know yes I think you're
 

4023
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:13,580
always gonna know yes I think you're
conscious yes yeah so and you explain

4024
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:13,590
conscious yes yeah so and you explain
 

4025
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,709
conscious yes yeah so and you explain
sort of somehow why

4026
01:24:15,709 --> 01:24:15,719
sort of somehow why
 

4027
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:18,140
sort of somehow why
but you infer that from my behavior

4028
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:18,150
but you infer that from my behavior
 

4029
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:19,759
but you infer that from my behavior
right yeah you can never be sure about

4030
01:24:19,759 --> 01:24:19,769
right yeah you can never be sure about
 

4031
01:24:19,769 --> 01:24:22,700
right yeah you can never be sure about
that and I think the same thing will

4032
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:22,710
that and I think the same thing will
 

4033
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:26,060
that and I think the same thing will
happen with any intelligent way to be

4034
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:26,070
happen with any intelligent way to be
 

4035
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:29,169
happen with any intelligent way to be
developed if it behaves in a way

4036
01:24:29,169 --> 01:24:29,179
developed if it behaves in a way
 

4037
01:24:29,179 --> 01:24:31,520
developed if it behaves in a way
sufficiently close to humans or maybe if

4038
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:31,530
sufficiently close to humans or maybe if
 

4039
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,169
sufficiently close to humans or maybe if
not humans I mean you know maybe a dog

4040
01:24:33,169 --> 01:24:33,179
not humans I mean you know maybe a dog
 

4041
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:34,669
not humans I mean you know maybe a dog
is also sometimes a little bit

4042
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:34,679
is also sometimes a little bit
 

4043
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:37,009
is also sometimes a little bit
self-conscious right so so if it behaves

4044
01:24:37,009 --> 01:24:37,019
self-conscious right so so if it behaves
 

4045
01:24:37,019 --> 01:24:40,549
self-conscious right so so if it behaves
in a way where we attribute typically

4046
01:24:40,549 --> 01:24:40,559
in a way where we attribute typically
 

4047
01:24:40,559 --> 01:24:42,020
in a way where we attribute typically
consciousness we would actually build

4048
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:42,030
consciousness we would actually build
 

4049
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:43,759
consciousness we would actually build
consciousness to this intelligent

4050
01:24:43,759 --> 01:24:43,769
consciousness to this intelligent
 

4051
01:24:43,769 --> 01:24:46,009
consciousness to this intelligent
systems and you know except all in

4052
01:24:46,009 --> 01:24:46,019
systems and you know except all in
 

4053
01:24:46,019 --> 01:24:48,200

01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:49,549

the question whether it's really

4056
01:24:49,549 --> 01:24:49,559
the question whether it's really
 

4057
01:24:49,559 --> 01:24:51,890
the question whether it's really
conscious and that's the you know the

4058
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:51,900
conscious and that's the you know the
 

4059
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,450
conscious and that's the you know the
big hard problem of consciousness you

4060
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:53,460
big hard problem of consciousness you
 

4061
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:56,270
big hard problem of consciousness you
know maybe I'm a zombie I mean not the

4062
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:56,280
know maybe I'm a zombie I mean not the
 

4063
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,040
know maybe I'm a zombie I mean not the
movie zombie but the philosophical

4064
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:58,050
movie zombie but the philosophical
 

4065
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:00,859
movie zombie but the philosophical
zombie it's to you the display of

4066
01:25:00,859 --> 01:25:00,869
zombie it's to you the display of
 

4067
01:25:00,869 --> 01:25:03,439
zombie it's to you the display of
consciousness close enough to

4068
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:03,449
consciousness close enough to
 

4069
01:25:03,449 --> 01:25:06,290
consciousness close enough to
consciousness from a perspective of a GI

4070
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:06,300
consciousness from a perspective of a GI
 

4071
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,200
consciousness from a perspective of a GI
that the distinction of the hard problem

4072
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:09,210
that the distinction of the hard problem
 

4073
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,759
that the distinction of the hard problem
of consciousness is not an interesting

4074
01:25:10,759 --> 01:25:10,769
of consciousness is not an interesting
 

4075
01:25:10,769 --> 01:25:12,589
of consciousness is not an interesting
one I think we don't have to worry about

4076
01:25:12,589 --> 01:25:12,599
one I think we don't have to worry about
 

4077
01:25:12,599 --> 01:25:14,419
one I think we don't have to worry about
the consciousness problem especially the

4078
01:25:14,419 --> 01:25:14,429
the consciousness problem especially the
 

4079
01:25:14,429 --> 01:25:16,819
the consciousness problem especially the
heart problem for developing a GI I

4080
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:16,829
heart problem for developing a GI I
 

4081
01:25:16,829 --> 01:25:20,689
heart problem for developing a GI I
think you know we progress at some point

4082
01:25:20,689 --> 01:25:20,699
think you know we progress at some point
 

4083
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,549
think you know we progress at some point
we have solved all the technical

4084
01:25:22,549 --> 01:25:22,559
we have solved all the technical
 

4085
01:25:22,559 --> 01:25:24,439
we have solved all the technical
problems and this system will behave

4086
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:24,449
problems and this system will behave
 

4087
01:25:24,449 --> 01:25:26,450
problems and this system will behave
intelligent and then super intelligent

4088
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:26,460
intelligent and then super intelligent
 

4089
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:30,259
intelligent and then super intelligent
and this consciousness will emerge I

01:25:30,259 --> 01:25:30,269
and this consciousness will emerge I
 

4091
01:25:30,269 --> 01:25:32,479
and this consciousness will emerge I
mean definitely it will display behavior

4092
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:32,489
mean definitely it will display behavior
 

4093
01:25:32,489 --> 01:25:35,740
mean definitely it will display behavior
which we will interpret as conscious and

4094
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:35,750
which we will interpret as conscious and
 

4095
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,419
which we will interpret as conscious and
then it's a philosophical question did

4096
01:25:38,419 --> 01:25:38,429
then it's a philosophical question did
 

4097
01:25:38,429 --> 01:25:40,189
then it's a philosophical question did
this consciousness really emerge or is

4098
01:25:40,189 --> 01:25:40,199
this consciousness really emerge or is
 

4099
01:25:40,199 --> 01:25:42,020
this consciousness really emerge or is
zombie which just you know fakes

4100
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:42,030
zombie which just you know fakes
 

4101
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:44,870
zombie which just you know fakes
everything we still don't have to figure

4102
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:44,880
everything we still don't have to figure
 

4103
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,569
everything we still don't have to figure
that out although it may be interesting

4104
01:25:46,569 --> 01:25:46,579
that out although it may be interesting
 

4105
01:25:46,579 --> 01:25:48,919
that out although it may be interesting
at least from a philosophical point of

4106
01:25:48,919 --> 01:25:48,929
at least from a philosophical point of
 

4107
01:25:48,929 --> 01:25:50,540
at least from a philosophical point of
it's very interesting but it may also be

4108
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:50,550
it's very interesting but it may also be
 

4109
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:53,419
it's very interesting but it may also be
sort of practically interesting you know

4110
01:25:53,419 --> 01:25:53,429
sort of practically interesting you know
 

4111
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:54,620
sort of practically interesting you know
there's some people say you know if it's

4112
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:54,630
there's some people say you know if it's
 

4113
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:56,180
there's some people say you know if it's
just faking consciousness and feelings

4114
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:56,190
just faking consciousness and feelings
 

4115
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:57,439
just faking consciousness and feelings
you know then we don't need to have be

4116
01:25:57,439 --> 01:25:57,449
you know then we don't need to have be
 

4117
01:25:57,449 --> 01:25:59,419
you know then we don't need to have be
concerned about you know rights but if

4118
01:25:59,419 --> 01:25:59,429
concerned about you know rights but if
 

4119
01:25:59,429 --> 01:26:01,040
concerned about you know rights but if
it's real conscious and has feelings

4120
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:01,050
it's real conscious and has feelings
 

4121
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:05,469
it's real conscious and has feelings
then we need to be concerned yeah I

4122
01:26:05,469 --> 01:26:05,479
then we need to be concerned yeah I
 

4123
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:09,290
then we need to be concerned yeah I
can't wait til the day where AI systems

4124
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:09,300
can't wait til the day where AI systems
 

4125
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,239
can't wait til the day where AI systems
exhibit consciousness because it'll

4126
01:26:11,239 --> 01:26:11,249
exhibit consciousness because it'll
 

4127
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:13,580
exhibit consciousness because it'll
truly be some of the hardest ethical

4128
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:13,590
truly be some of the hardest ethical
 

4129
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:15,979
truly be some of the hardest ethical
questions how well we do with that it is

4130
01:26:15,979 --> 01:26:15,989
questions how well we do with that it is
 

4131
01:26:15,989 --> 01:26:19,069
questions how well we do with that it is
rather easy to build systems which

4132
01:26:19,069 --> 01:26:19,079
rather easy to build systems which
 

4133
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:21,589
rather easy to build systems which
people ascribe consciousness and I give

4134
01:26:21,589 --> 01:26:21,599
people ascribe consciousness and I give
 

4135
01:26:21,599 --> 01:26:24,080
people ascribe consciousness and I give
you an analogy I mean remember maybe

4136
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:24,090
you an analogy I mean remember maybe
 

4137
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:25,959
you an analogy I mean remember maybe
once before you were born the Tamagotchi

4138
01:26:25,959 --> 01:26:25,969
once before you were born the Tamagotchi
 

4139
01:26:25,969 --> 01:26:33,080
once before you were born the Tamagotchi
yes how dare you sir you're young right

4140
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:33,090
yes how dare you sir you're young right
 

4141
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:34,969
yes how dare you sir you're young right
yes it's good thing yeah thank you thank

4142
01:26:34,969 --> 01:26:34,979
yes it's good thing yeah thank you thank
 

4143
01:26:34,979 --> 01:26:37,100
yes it's good thing yeah thank you thank
you very much but I was also in the so

4144
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:37,110
you very much but I was also in the so
 

4145
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:41,359
you very much but I was also in the so
you have any of those funny things but

4146
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:41,369
you have any of those funny things but
 

4147
01:26:41,369 --> 01:26:42,830
you have any of those funny things but
you have heard about this time ago it

4148
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:42,840
you have heard about this time ago it
 

4149
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,359
you have heard about this time ago it
was you know really really primitive

4150
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:44,369
was you know really really primitive
 

4151
01:26:44,369 --> 01:26:47,270
was you know really really primitive
actually for the time it was and you

4152
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,280
actually for the time it was and you
 

4153
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,739
actually for the time it was and you
know you could race you know this and

4154
01:26:48,739 --> 01:26:48,749
know you could race you know this and
 

4155
01:26:48,749 --> 01:26:51,410
know you could race you know this and
and and and kids got so attached to it

4156
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:51,420
and and and kids got so attached to it
 

4157
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,449
and and and kids got so attached to it
and you know didn't want to let it die

4158
01:26:53,449 --> 01:26:53,459
and you know didn't want to let it die
 

4159
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:56,180
and you know didn't want to let it die
and would have probably if we would have

4160
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:56,190
and would have probably if we would have
 

4161
01:26:56,190 --> 01:26:57,680
and would have probably if we would have
asked you know the children know do you

4162
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:57,690
asked you know the children know do you
 

4163
01:26:57,690 --> 01:26:59,239
asked you know the children know do you
think this drama coach is conscious and

4164
01:26:59,239 --> 01:26:59,249
think this drama coach is conscious and
 

4165
01:26:59,249 --> 01:27:02,060
think this drama coach is conscious and
they would say yes yes I was yes that's

4166
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:02,070
they would say yes yes I was yes that's
 

4167
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:03,910
they would say yes yes I was yes that's
kind of a beautiful thing actually

4168
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:03,920
kind of a beautiful thing actually
 

4169
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,799
kind of a beautiful thing actually
because that consciousness ascribing

4170
01:27:06,799 --> 01:27:06,809
because that consciousness ascribing
 

4171
01:27:06,809 --> 01:27:09,799
because that consciousness ascribing
consciousness seems to create a deeper

4172
01:27:09,799 --> 01:27:09,809
consciousness seems to create a deeper
 

4173
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:12,350
consciousness seems to create a deeper
connection yeah which is a powerful

4174
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:12,360
connection yeah which is a powerful
 

4175
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,699
connection yeah which is a powerful
thing but we have to be careful on the

4176
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:13,709
thing but we have to be careful on the
 

4177
01:27:13,709 --> 01:27:16,489
thing but we have to be careful on the
ethics side of that well let me ask

4178
01:27:16,489 --> 01:27:16,499
ethics side of that well let me ask
 

4179
01:27:16,499 --> 01:27:18,830
ethics side of that well let me ask
about the AGI community broadly you kind

4180
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:18,840
about the AGI community broadly you kind
 

4181
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,620
about the AGI community broadly you kind
of represent some of the most serious

4182
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:21,630
of represent some of the most serious
 

4183
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:24,229
of represent some of the most serious
work on a giass of at least or earlier

4184
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:24,239
work on a giass of at least or earlier
 

4185
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,709
work on a giass of at least or earlier
and deepmind represents a serious work

4186
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:27,719
and deepmind represents a serious work
 

4187
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:31,879
and deepmind represents a serious work
on AGI these days but why in your sense

4188
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:31,889
on AGI these days but why in your sense
 

4189
01:27:31,889 --> 01:27:34,370
on AGI these days but why in your sense
is the AGI communities so small or has

4190
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:34,380
is the AGI communities so small or has
 

4191
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,100
is the AGI communities so small or has
been so small until maybe deep mine came

4192
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:37,110
been so small until maybe deep mine came
 

4193
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:39,850
been so small until maybe deep mine came
along like why why aren't more people

4194
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:39,860
along like why why aren't more people
 

4195
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:44,239
along like why why aren't more people
seriously working on human level and

4196
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:44,249
seriously working on human level and
 

4197
01:27:44,249 --> 01:27:46,189
seriously working on human level and
super human level intelligence from a

4198
01:27:46,189 --> 01:27:46,199
super human level intelligence from a
 

4199
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:49,069
super human level intelligence from a
formal perspective okay from a formal

4200
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:49,079
formal perspective okay from a formal
 

4201
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:51,229
formal perspective okay from a formal
perspective that sort of you know and an

4202
01:27:51,229 --> 01:27:51,239
perspective that sort of you know and an
 

4203
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:54,049
perspective that sort of you know and an
extra point so I think

4204
01:27:54,049 --> 01:27:54,059
extra point so I think
 

4205
01:27:54,059 --> 01:27:55,849
extra point so I think
a couple of reasons I mean AI came in

4206
01:27:55,849 --> 01:27:55,859
a couple of reasons I mean AI came in
 

4207
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:57,919
a couple of reasons I mean AI came in
waves right you know our interest in our

4208
01:27:57,919 --> 01:27:57,929
waves right you know our interest in our
 

4209
01:27:57,929 --> 01:27:59,750
waves right you know our interest in our
summers and then there were big promises

4210
01:27:59,750 --> 01:27:59,760
summers and then there were big promises
 

4211
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:04,699
summers and then there were big promises
which were not fulfilled and people got

4212
01:28:04,699 --> 01:28:04,709
which were not fulfilled and people got
 

4213
01:28:04,709 --> 01:28:09,889
which were not fulfilled and people got
disappointed and that narrow AI are sold

4214
01:28:09,889 --> 01:28:09,899
disappointed and that narrow AI are sold
 

4215
01:28:09,899 --> 01:28:12,649
disappointed and that narrow AI are sold
in particular problems which seem to

4216
01:28:12,649 --> 01:28:12,659
in particular problems which seem to
 

4217
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:15,919
in particular problems which seem to
require intelligence was always to some

4218
01:28:15,919 --> 01:28:15,929
require intelligence was always to some
 

4219
01:28:15,929 --> 01:28:17,329
require intelligence was always to some
extent successful and there were

4220
01:28:17,329 --> 01:28:17,339
extent successful and there were
 

4221
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:20,239
extent successful and there were
improvements small steps and if you

4222
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:20,249
improvements small steps and if you
 

4223
01:28:20,249 --> 01:28:23,509
improvements small steps and if you
build something which is you know useful

4224
01:28:23,509 --> 01:28:23,519
build something which is you know useful
 

4225
01:28:23,519 --> 01:28:25,250
build something which is you know useful
for society or industrial useful then

4226
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:25,260
for society or industrial useful then
 

4227
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,199
for society or industrial useful then
there's a lot of funding so I guess it

4228
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:27,209
there's a lot of funding so I guess it
 

4229
01:28:27,209 --> 01:28:30,409
there's a lot of funding so I guess it
wasn't pass the money which drives

4230
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:30,419
wasn't pass the money which drives
 

4231
01:28:30,419 --> 01:28:34,189
wasn't pass the money which drives
people to develop specific system

4232
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:34,199
people to develop specific system
 

4233
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:36,589
people to develop specific system
solving specific tasks but you would

4234
01:28:36,589 --> 01:28:36,599
solving specific tasks but you would
 

4235
01:28:36,599 --> 01:28:37,759
solving specific tasks but you would
think that you know at least on

4236
01:28:37,759 --> 01:28:37,769
think that you know at least on
 

4237
01:28:37,769 --> 01:28:40,719
think that you know at least on
university you should be able to do

4238
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:40,729
university you should be able to do
 

4239
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:44,689
university you should be able to do
ivory tower research and that was

4240
01:28:44,689 --> 01:28:44,699
ivory tower research and that was
 

4241
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,129
ivory tower research and that was
probably better a long time ago about

4242
01:28:46,129 --> 01:28:46,139
probably better a long time ago about
 

4243
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:47,629
probably better a long time ago about
even nowadays there's quite some

4244
01:28:47,629 --> 01:28:47,639
even nowadays there's quite some
 

4245
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:50,059
even nowadays there's quite some
pressure off of doing applied research

4246
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:50,069
pressure off of doing applied research
 

4247
01:28:50,069 --> 01:28:53,119
pressure off of doing applied research
or translational research and you know

4248
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:53,129
or translational research and you know
 

4249
01:28:53,129 --> 01:28:55,959
or translational research and you know
it's harder to get grants as a theorist

4250
01:28:55,959 --> 01:28:55,969
it's harder to get grants as a theorist
 

4251
01:28:55,969 --> 01:29:00,049
it's harder to get grants as a theorist
so that also drives people away it's

4252
01:29:00,049 --> 01:29:00,059
so that also drives people away it's
 

4253
01:29:00,059 --> 01:29:02,329
so that also drives people away it's
maybe also harder attacking the general

4254
01:29:02,329 --> 01:29:02,339
maybe also harder attacking the general
 

4255
01:29:02,339 --> 01:29:04,069
maybe also harder attacking the general
intelligence problem so I think enough

4256
01:29:04,069 --> 01:29:04,079
intelligence problem so I think enough
 

4257
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:06,020
intelligence problem so I think enough
people I mean maybe a small number we're

4258
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:06,030
people I mean maybe a small number we're
 

4259
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:08,719
people I mean maybe a small number we're
still interested in in formalizing

4260

4267
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:21,979
up right or not much great stuff came up
so what do you think we talked about the

4268
01:29:21,979 --> 01:29:21,989
so what do you think we talked about the
 

4269
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:25,279
so what do you think we talked about the
formal big light at the end of the

01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:01,490
for all kinds of things yeah but for
 

4343
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:04,750
for all kinds of things yeah but for

4345
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:08,500

01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,580
in our 3d simulated environment like in
many computer games and and you train

many computer games and and you train
 

4361
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:30,850
many computer games and and you train
and learn the agent even if you don't

01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:46,730
simulated 3d world is possibly and I say
 

4373
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:51,430
simulated 3d world is possibly and I say
possibly important to understand things

4374
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,440
possibly important to understand things
 

4375
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:54,480

the agent wants needs to interact with

4380
01:31:59,530 --> 01:31:59,540
the agent wants needs to interact with
 

4381
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:00,700
the agent wants needs to interact with
the humans right you know if you talk

4382
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:00,710
the humans right you know if you talk
 

4383
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:02,560
the humans right you know if you talk
about objects on top of each other in

4384
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:02,570
about objects on top of each other in
 

4385
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:04,780
about objects on top of each other in
space and flying and cars and so on and

4386
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:04,790
space and flying and cars and so on and
 

4387
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:07,290
space and flying and cars and so on and
the agent has no experience with even

4388
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:07,300
the agent has no experience with even
 

4389
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:10,360
the agent has no experience with even
virtual 3d worlds it's probably hard to

4390
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:10,370
virtual 3d worlds it's probably hard to
 

4391
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:14,020
virtual 3d worlds it's probably hard to
grasp so if you develop an abstract

4392
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:14,030
grasp so if you develop an abstract
 

4393
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:16,510
grasp so if you develop an abstract
agent say we take the mathematical path

4394
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:16,520
agent say we take the mathematical path
 

4395
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,460
agent say we take the mathematical path
and we just want to build an agent which

4396
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:18,470
and we just want to build an agent which
 

4397
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:20,740
and we just want to build an agent which
can prove theorems and becomes a better

4398
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:20,750
can prove theorems and becomes a better
 

4399
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:22,870
can prove theorems and becomes a better
imitation then this agent needs to be

4400
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:22,880
imitation then this agent needs to be
 

4401
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,870
imitation then this agent needs to be
able to reason in very abstract spaces

4402
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:25,880
able to reason in very abstract spaces
 

4403
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,850
able to reason in very abstract spaces
and then maybe sort of putting it into

4404
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:27,860
and then maybe sort of putting it into
 

4405
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:29,950
and then maybe sort of putting it into
3d environment simulated alt is even

4406
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:29,960
3d environment simulated alt is even
 

4407
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,140
3d environment simulated alt is even
harmful it should sort of you put it in

4408
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:32,150
harmful it should sort of you put it in
 

4409
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:34,270
harmful it should sort of you put it in
I don't know an environment which it

4410
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:34,280
I don't know an environment which it
 

4411
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:37,330
I don't know an environment which it
creates itself or so it seems like you

4412
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:37,340
creates itself or so it seems like you
 

4413
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:39,160
creates itself or so it seems like you
have an interesting rich complex

4414
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:39,170
have an interesting rich complex
 

4415
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:41,290
have an interesting rich complex
trajectory through life in terms of your

4416
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:41,300
trajectory through life in terms of your
 

4417
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:43,600
trajectory through life in terms of your
journey of ideas so it's interesting to

4418
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:43,610
journey of ideas so it's interesting to
 

4419
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:46,840
journey of ideas so it's interesting to
ask what books technical fiction

4420
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:46,850
ask what books technical fiction
 

4421
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:50,740
ask what books technical fiction
philosophical and books ideas people had

4422
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:50,750
philosophical and books ideas people had
 

4423
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:53,320
philosophical and books ideas people had
a transformative effect books are most

4424
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:53,330
a transformative effect books are most
 

4425
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:55,110
a transformative effect books are most
interesting because maybe people could

4426
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:55,120
interesting because maybe people could
 

4427
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,880
interesting because maybe people could
also read those books and see if they

4428
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:57,890
also read those books and see if they
 

4429
01:32:57,890 --> 01:33:00,670
also read those books and see if they
could be inspired as well you're luckily

4430
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:00,680
could be inspired as well you're luckily
 

4431
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,640
could be inspired as well you're luckily
asked books and not singular book it's

4432
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:03,650
asked books and not singular book it's
 

4433
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:06,910
asked books and not singular book it's
very hard and I tried to pin down one

4434
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:06,920
very hard and I tried to pin down one
 

4435
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:09,840
very hard and I tried to pin down one
book yeah then I can do that at the end

4436
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:09,850
book yeah then I can do that at the end
 

4437
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:15,220
book yeah then I can do that at the end
so the most the books which were most

4438
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:15,230
so the most the books which were most
 

4439
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:17,020
so the most the books which were most
transformative for me or which I can

most highly recommend to people
 

4443
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:24,820
most highly recommend to people
interested in AI both perhaps yeah I

4444
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:24,830
interested in AI both perhaps yeah I
 

4445
01:33:24,830 --> 01:33:28,120
interested in AI both perhaps yeah I
would always start with Russell and

4446
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:28,130
would always start with Russell and
 

4447
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:29,980
would always start with Russell and
Norvig artificial intelligence a modern

4448

approach that's the AI Bible it's an

4450
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:33,740
approach that's the AI Bible it's an
 

4451
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:36,850
approach that's the AI Bible it's an
amazing book it's very broad it covers

4452
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:36,860
amazing book it's very broad it covers
 

4453
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:39,340
amazing book it's very broad it covers
you know all approaches to AI and even

4454
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:39,350
you know all approaches to AI and even
 

4455
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:41,230
you know all approaches to AI and even
if you focus on one approach I think

4456
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:41,240
if you focus on one approach I think
 

4457
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:42,520
if you focus on one approach I think
that is the minimum you should know

4458
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:42,530
that is the minimum you should know
 

4459
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:44,800
that is the minimum you should know
about the other approaches out there so

4460
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:44,810
about the other approaches out there so
 

4461
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:46,180
about the other approaches out there so
that should be your first book

4462
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:46,190
that should be your first book
 

4463

days you feel you know you know what RL
 

4495
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,940
days you feel you know you know what RL
is about but it's much harder than the

4496
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:30,950
is about but it's much harder than the
 

4497

then there's Kolmogorov complexity by
 

4509
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:48,760
then there's Kolmogorov complexity by
Alene batani but probably you know some

on from math from art from physics and
 

4541
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:36,370
on from math from art from physics and
ask how can we know I'm anything and

01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,460
when I discovered Maxim Allah I mean it
was not in one day but it was one

4606
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:46,470
was not in one day but it was one

4608
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:49,320
moment they are realized comig of
 

4609
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,490
moment they are realized comig of
complexity and didn't even know that it

4610
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:52,500
complexity and didn't even know that it
 

4611
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,980
complexity and didn't even know that it
existed but I rediscovered sort of this

4612
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:54,990
existed but I rediscovered sort of this
 

4613
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:56,810
existed but I rediscovered sort of this
compression idea myself but immediately

4614
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:56,820
compression idea myself but immediately
 

4615
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:58,280
compression idea myself but immediately
I knew I can't be the first one but I

4616
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:58,290
I knew I can't be the first one but I
 

4617
01:36:58,290 --> 01:37:01,070
I knew I can't be the first one but I
had this idea and then I knew about

4618
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:01,080
had this idea and then I knew about
 

4619
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,710
had this idea and then I knew about
sequential decision ray and I knew if I

4620
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:03,720
sequential decision ray and I knew if I
 

4621
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,420
sequential decision ray and I knew if I
put it together this is the right thing

4622
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:05,430
put it together this is the right thing
 

4623
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:08,690
put it together this is the right thing
and yeah I'm still when I think back

4624
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:08,700
and yeah I'm still when I think back
 

4625
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:11,570
and yeah I'm still when I think back
about this moment I'm I'm super excited

4626
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:11,580
about this moment I'm I'm super excited
 

4627
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,190
about this moment I'm I'm super excited
about it was there

4628
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:13,200
about it was there
 

4629
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,680
about it was there
was there any more details and context

4630
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:15,690
was there any more details and context
 

4631
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:17,420
was there any more details and context
that moment did an apple fall in your

4632
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:17,430
that moment did an apple fall in your

Goodfellow talking about Gans there was

4636
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:24,330
Goodfellow talking about Gans there was
 

4637
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:27,590
Goodfellow talking about Gans there was
beer involved there is there some more

4638
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:27,600
beer involved there is there some more
 

4639
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,260
beer involved there is there some more
context of what sparked your thought it

4640
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:30,270
context of what sparked your thought it
 

4641
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:32,300
context of what sparked your thought it
was a jest and no it was much more

4642
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:32,310
was a jest and no it was much more
 

4643
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:33,860
was a jest and no it was much more
mundane so I've worked in this company

4644
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:33,870
mundane so I've worked in this company
 

4645
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:35,780
mundane so I've worked in this company
so in this sense the four and a half

4646
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:35,790
so in this sense the four and a half
 

4647
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:39,320
so in this sense the four and a half
years was not completely wasted so and

4648
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:39,330
years was not completely wasted so and
 

4649
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:42,020
years was not completely wasted so and
I've worked on an image interpolation

4650
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:42,030
I've worked on an image interpolation
 

4651
01:37:42,030 --> 01:37:47,330
I've worked on an image interpolation
problem and I developed a quite neat new

4652
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:47,340
problem and I developed a quite neat new
 

4653
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,800
problem and I developed a quite neat new
interpolation techniques and they got

4654
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:48,810
interpolation techniques and they got
 

4655
01:37:48,810 --> 01:37:51,020
interpolation techniques and they got
patented and then I you know and which

4656
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:51,030
patented and then I you know and which
 

4657
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:52,760
patented and then I you know and which
happens quite often I got sort of

4658
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:52,770
happens quite often I got sort of
 

4659
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:54,260
happens quite often I got sort of
overboard and thought about you know

4660
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:54,270
overboard and thought about you know
 

4661
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:55,880
overboard and thought about you know
yeah that's pretty good but it's not the

4662
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:55,890
yeah that's pretty good but it's not the
 

4663
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:58,070
yeah that's pretty good but it's not the
best so what is the best possible way of

4664
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:58,080
best so what is the best possible way of
 

4665
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,140
best so what is the best possible way of
doing in the interpolation and then I

4666
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:00,150
doing in the interpolation and then I
 

4667
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,970
doing in the interpolation and then I
thought yeah you you want the simplest

4668
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:01,980
thought yeah you you want the simplest
 

4669
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,490
thought yeah you you want the simplest
picture which is if you cross train it

4670
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:04,500
picture which is if you cross train it
 

4671
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,800
picture which is if you cross train it
recovers your original picture and then

4672
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:06,810
recovers your original picture and then
 

4673
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,360
recovers your original picture and then
I you know thought about the simplicity

4674
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:08,370
I you know thought about the simplicity
 

4675
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:11,350
I you know thought about the simplicity
concept more in quantitative terms and

4676
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:11,360
concept more in quantitative terms and
 

4677
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,540
concept more in quantitative terms and
you know then everything developed and

4678
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:14,550
you know then everything developed and
 

4679
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:16,970
you know then everything developed and
somehow love the full beautiful mix of

4680
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:16,980
somehow love the full beautiful mix of
 

4681
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:19,340
somehow love the full beautiful mix of
also being a physicist and thinking

4682
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:19,350
also being a physicist and thinking
 

4683
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:21,380
also being a physicist and thinking
about the big picture of it then led you

4684
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:21,390
about the big picture of it then led you
 

4685
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:24,320
about the big picture of it then led you
to probably the end of a good idea so as

4686
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:24,330
to probably the end of a good idea so as
 

4687
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:26,360
to probably the end of a good idea so as
a physicist I was probably trained not

4688
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:26,370
a physicist I was probably trained not
 

4689
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:27,980
a physicist I was probably trained not
to always think in computational terms

4690
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:27,990
to always think in computational terms
 

4691
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:29,720
to always think in computational terms
you know just ignore that and think

4692
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:29,730
you know just ignore that and think
 

4693
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:31,550
you know just ignore that and think
about the other two the fundamental

4694
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:31,560
about the other two the fundamental
 

4695
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:34,190
about the other two the fundamental
properties which you want to have so

4696
01:38:34,190 --> 01:38:34,200
properties which you want to have so
 

4697
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,780
properties which you want to have so
what about if you could really one day

4698
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:35,790
what about if you could really one day
 

4699
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:38,720
what about if you could really one day
in the future all the day what would

4700
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:38,730
in the future all the day what would
 

4701
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:43,130
in the future all the day what would
that be when I solve the AGI problem and

4702
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:43,140
that be when I solve the AGI problem and
 

4703
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,690
that be when I solve the AGI problem and
I bring the practice in practice so in

4704
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:44,700
I bring the practice in practice so in
 

4705
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,340
I bring the practice in practice so in
theory I have solved it that I see what

4706
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:46,350
theory I have solved it that I see what
 

4707
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:49,370
theory I have solved it that I see what
already attracted me and then ask the

4708
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:49,380
already attracted me and then ask the
 

4709
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,470
already attracted me and then ask the
first question or would be the first

4710
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:51,480
