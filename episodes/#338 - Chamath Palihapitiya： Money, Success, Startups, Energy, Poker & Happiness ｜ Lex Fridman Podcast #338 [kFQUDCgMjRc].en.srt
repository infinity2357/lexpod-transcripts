and so you became hyper aware of which
 

151
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,210
and so you became hyper aware of which
part of the Buckle was facing out versus

part of the Buckle was facing out versus

little examples
 

159
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,350

and at some point by the way I should

328
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:31,800
and at some point by the way I should
 

329
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,650
and at some point by the way I should
tell you like I don't blame my parents

330
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:33,660
tell you like I don't blame my parents
 

331
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,629
tell you like I don't blame my parents
anymore it was a process to get there

332
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:35,639
anymore it was a process to get there
 

333
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,790
anymore it was a process to get there
but I feel like they did the best they

334
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:37,800
but I feel like they did the best they
 

335
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,290
but I feel like they did the best they
could

336
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,300
could
 

337
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,930
could
and they suffered their own issues and

338
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:41,940
and they suffered their own issues and
 

339
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,689
and they suffered their own issues and
enormous pressures and stresses

340
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:44,699
enormous pressures and stresses
 

341
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,689
enormous pressures and stresses
and so you know I've really for the most

342
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:47,699
and so you know I've really for the most
 

343
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,249
and so you know I've really for the most
part forgiven them

344
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:49,259
part forgiven them
 

345
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,650
part forgiven them
how did you start to interrupt let go of

346
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:51,660
how did you start to interrupt let go of
 

347
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,090
how did you start to interrupt let go of
that blame

348
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,100
that blame
 

349
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,570
that blame
that was a really long process where

350
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:56,580
that was a really long process where
 

351
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,090
that was a really long process where
I would say the first 35 years of my

352
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,100
I would say the first 35 years of my
 

353
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,110
I would say the first 35 years of my
life

354
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
life
 

355
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,350
life
I compartmentalized and I avoided all of

356
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
I compartmentalized and I avoided all of
 

357
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,210
I compartmentalized and I avoided all of
those memories

358
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,220
those memories
 

359
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,469
those memories
and I saw external validation

360
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:09,479
and I saw external validation
 

361
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,629
and I saw external validation
right going back to this self-worth idea

362
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:11,639
right going back to this self-worth idea
 

363
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,189
right going back to this self-worth idea
if you're taught as a child that you're

364
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
if you're taught as a child that you're
 

365
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,809
if you're taught as a child that you're
worthless because why would somebody do

366
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:14,819
worthless because why would somebody do
 

367
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,189
worthless because why would somebody do
these things to you

368
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:16,199
these things to you
 

369
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,689
these things to you
it's not because you're worth something

370
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:17,699
it's not because you're worth something
 

371
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,689
it's not because you're worth something
you think to yourself very viscerally

372
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:20,699
you think to yourself very viscerally
 

373
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,550
you think to yourself very viscerally
you're worth nothing

374
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
you're worth nothing
 

375
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,170
you're worth nothing
and so then you go out and you seek

376
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,180
and so then you go out and you seek
 

377
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,210
and so then you go out and you seek
external validation maybe you try to go

378
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,220
external validation maybe you try to go
 

379
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,249
external validation maybe you try to go
and get into a great College you try to

380
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:28,259
and get into a great College you try to
 

381
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,529
and get into a great College you try to
get a good job you try to make a lot of

382
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:30,539
get a good job you try to make a lot of
 

383
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,370
get a good job you try to make a lot of
money you try to you know demonstrate in

384
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,380
money you try to you know demonstrate in
 

385
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,230
money you try to you know demonstrate in
superficial ways with the car you drive

386
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
superficial ways with the car you drive
 

387
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,969
superficial ways with the car you drive
or the clothes you wear

388
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:37,979
or the clothes you wear
 

389
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,249
or the clothes you wear
that you deserve people to care about

390
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:40,259
that you deserve people to care about
 

391
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,150
that you deserve people to care about
you

392
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,160
you
 

393
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,010
you
to try to make up for that really deep

394
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,020
to try to make up for that really deep
 

395
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,029
to try to make up for that really deep
hole

396
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:44,039
hole
 

397
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,249
hole
but at some point you it doesn't get

398
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:46,259
but at some point you it doesn't get
 

399
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,390
but at some point you it doesn't get
filled in

400
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:47,400
filled in
 

401
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,490
filled in
and so you have a choice

402
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:49,500
and so you have a choice
 

403
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,650
and so you have a choice
and so for me what happened was in in

404
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:51,660
and so for me what happened was in in
 

405
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,510
and so for me what happened was in in
the course of a six-month period I lost

406
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
the course of a six-month period I lost
 

407
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,909
the course of a six-month period I lost
my best friend and I lost my father

408
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
my best friend and I lost my father
 

409
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,110
my best friend and I lost my father
and

410
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
and
 

411
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,270
and
it was really like the dam broke loose

412
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
it was really like the dam broke loose
 

413
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,969
it was really like the dam broke loose
because I the compartmentalization

414
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:01,979
because I the compartmentalization
 

415
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,150
because I the compartmentalization
stopped working because the reminder

416
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,160
stopped working because the reminder
 

417
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,749
stopped working because the reminder
of why I was compartmentalizing was gone

418
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:08,759
of why I was compartmentalizing was gone
 

419
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,029
of why I was compartmentalizing was gone
and so I had to go through this period

420
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
and so I had to go through this period
 

421
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,650
and so I had to go through this period
of disharmony

422
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:12,660
of disharmony
 

423
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,589
of disharmony
to really understand

424
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
to really understand
 

425
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,490
to really understand
and Steel Man his perspective

426
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:19,500
and Steel Man his perspective
 

427
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,969
and Steel Man his perspective
and can you imagine trying to do that to

428
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:22,979
and can you imagine trying to do that to
 

429
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,670
and can you imagine trying to do that to
go through all of the things where you

430
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
go through all of the things where you
 

431
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,170
go through all of the things where you
have to now look at it from his

432
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,180
have to now look at it from his
 

433
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,689
have to now look at it from his
perspective and find compassion and

434
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:29,699
perspective and find compassion and
 

435
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,770
perspective and find compassion and
empathy

436
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:30,780
empathy
 

437
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,409
empathy
for what he went through

438
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:33,419
for what he went through
 

439
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,630
for what he went through
and then I shift you know the focus to

440
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,640
and then I shift you know the focus to
 

441
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,110
and then I shift you know the focus to
my mom and I said well you were not the

442
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
my mom and I said well you were not the
 

443
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,490
my mom and I said well you were not the
victim actually you were somewhat

444
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:40,500
victim actually you were somewhat
 

445
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,709
victim actually you were somewhat
complicit as well because you were of

446
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
complicit as well because you were of
 

447
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,510
complicit as well because you were of
sound mind and body and you were in the

448
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:44,520
sound mind and body and you were in the
 

449
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,070
sound mind and body and you were in the
room when it happened

450
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
room when it happened
 

451
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,990
room when it happened
so then I had to go through that process

452
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
so then I had to go through that process
 

453
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,530
so then I had to go through that process
with her and steal man her perspective

454
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:51,540
with her and steal man her perspective
 

455
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,870
with her and steal man her perspective
and at the end of it I never Justified

456
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:53,880
and at the end of it I never Justified
 

457
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,970
and at the end of it I never Justified
what they did but I've been able to

458
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:55,980
what they did but I've been able to
 

459
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,310
what they did but I've been able to
forgive what they did

460
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
forgive what they did
 

461
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,810
forgive what they did
um I think they did the best they could

462
00:08:59,810 --> 00:08:59,820
um I think they did the best they could
 

463
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,290
um I think they did the best they could
and at the end of the day they did the

464
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,300
and at the end of the day they did the
 

465
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,389
and at the end of the day they did the
most important thing which is they gave

466
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:05,399
most important thing which is they gave
 

467
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,090
most important thing which is they gave
me and my sisters a shot by emigrating

but it's it's been a long process of of
 

489
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,210
but it's it's been a long process of of

that steel Manning so that you can
develop some empathy and compassion and

do you think if you talk to your dad

496
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:39,540

 

497
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,690

shortly after he died and you went to

498
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:41,700
shortly after he died and you went to
 

499
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,870
shortly after he died and you went to
that process or today you'll be able to

500
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:43,880
that process or today you'll be able to
 

501
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,449
that process or today you'll be able to
have the same strength

502
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:47,459
have the same strength
 

503
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,889
have the same strength
to forgive him

504
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:51,899

 

505
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,050

I think it would be a very complicated

506
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,060
I think it would be a very complicated
 

507
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,790
I think it would be a very complicated
Journey

508
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:55,800
Journey
 

509
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,790
Journey
I think I've learned to be incredibly

510
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
I think I've learned to be incredibly
 

511
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,850
I think I've learned to be incredibly
open about what has happened

512
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:01,860
open about what has happened
 

513
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,530
open about what has happened
and all of the mistakes I've made

514
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:06,540
and all of the mistakes I've made
 

515
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,190
and all of the mistakes I've made
I think it's it would require him to be

516
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,200
I think it's it would require him to be
 

517
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,329
I think it's it would require him to be
pretty radically honest about confirming

518
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:14,339
pretty radically honest about confirming
 

519
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,670
pretty radically honest about confirming
what I think he went through

520
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:16,680
what I think he went through
 

521
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,470
what I think he went through

because otherwise it just wouldn't work
 

523
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,269
because otherwise it just wouldn't work
otherwise I would say let's keep things

524
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:20,279
otherwise I would say let's keep things
 

525
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,210
otherwise I would say let's keep things

this sacrifice will not be worth it
that it spills out in really

unproductive ways
 

565
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,850
unproductive ways
and I would put him in that category

566
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:04,860
and I would put him in that category

evaluation introspection they have
tunnel vision so they're not

572
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:11,820
tunnel vision so they're not
 

573
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,050
tunnel vision so they're not
able to often see the damage they did I

a few successful people that had very

578
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
a few successful people that had very
 

579
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,430
a few successful people that had very
difficult relationships

580
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:22,440
difficult relationships
 

581
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,650
difficult relationships
with their dad and you take the

582
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:24,660
with their dad and you take the
 

583
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,050
with their dad and you take the
perspective of the dad

584
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,060
perspective of the dad
 

585
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,690

they're completely in denial about any

586
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:29,700
they're completely in denial about any
 

587
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,130
they're completely in denial about any
of it so if you actually have a

588
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,140
of it so if you actually have a
 

589
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,170
of it so if you actually have a
conversation there would not be a deep

590
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,180
conversation there would not be a deep
 

591
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,530
conversation there would not be a deep
honesty there uh and that I think that's

592
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:36,540
honesty there uh and that I think that's
 

593
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,230
honesty there uh and that I think that's
maybe in part the way of life

594
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
maybe in part the way of life
 

595

maybe in part the way of life
yeah and you know I remember pretty

yeah and you know I remember pretty
 

597
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,990
yeah and you know I remember pretty
distinctly after I left and in this you

598
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,000
distinctly after I left and in this you
 

599
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,750
distinctly after I left and in this you
know in my middle 30s where

600
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
know in my middle 30s where
 

601
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,730
know in my middle 30s where
you know by all measure I had roughly

602
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:49,740
you know by all measure I had roughly
 

603
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,850
you know by all measure I had roughly
become reasonably successful

604
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:52,860
become reasonably successful
 

605
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,650

and my dad didn't particularly care

606
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:54,660
and my dad didn't particularly care
 

607
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,710
and my dad didn't particularly care
about that which was so odd because I

608
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:57,720
about that which was so odd because I
 

609
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,110
about that which was so odd because I
had to confront the fact that you know

610
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,120
had to confront the fact that you know
 

611
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,810
had to confront the fact that you know
whether it was a title or money or press

612
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,820
whether it was a title or money or press
 

613
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,750
whether it was a title or money or press
clippings he never really cared he moved

615
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,670

on to a different set of goals which was

616
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
on to a different set of goals which was
 

617
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,610
on to a different set of goals which was
more about my character and you know

618
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:10,620
more about my character and you know
 

619
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,530
more about my character and you know
being a good person to my family and

620
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:12,540
being a good person to my family and
 

621
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,430
being a good person to my family and
really preparing me to lead our family

622
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:16,440
really preparing me to lead our family
 

623
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,230
really preparing me to lead our family
when he wasn't there

624
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
when he wasn't there
 

625
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,970
when he wasn't there
and that bothered me

626
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:19,980
and that bothered me
 

627
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,769
and that bothered me
because I thought I thought I got to the

628
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:21,779
because I thought I thought I got to the
 

629
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,150
because I thought I thought I got to the
finish line and I thought there was

630
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,160
finish line and I thought there was
 

631
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,350
finish line and I thought there was
going to be a

632
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,360
going to be a
 

633
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,389
going to be a
metal you know meaning like I can tell

634
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
metal you know meaning like I can tell
 

635
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,250
metal you know meaning like I can tell
you Lex you know he never told me that

636
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:28,260
you Lex you know he never told me that
 

637
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,630
you Lex you know he never told me that
he loved me

638
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:29,640
he loved me
 

639
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,970
he loved me
I'm not sure if that's normal or not it

640
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:31,980
I'm not sure if that's normal or not it
 

641
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,949
I'm not sure if that's normal or not it
was my normality and I thought there's

642
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:33,959
was my normality and I thought there's
 

643
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,630
was my normality and I thought there's
going to be something some gold star

644
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:35,640
going to be something some gold star
 

645
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,630
going to be something some gold star
which never appeared

646
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:38,640
which never appeared
 

647
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,150
which never appeared
and so that's like a hard thing to kind

648
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,160
and so that's like a hard thing to kind
 

649
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,370
and so that's like a hard thing to kind
of confront because you're like well now

650
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:43,380
of confront because you're like well now
 

651
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,370
of confront because you're like well now
what is this what is this all about

652
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:46,380
what is this what is this all about
 

653
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,190
what is this what is this all about
um was this all just kind of a a ruse

654
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
um was this all just kind of a a ruse
 

655
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,930
um was this all just kind of a a ruse
but then I realized well hold on a

656
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:50,940
but then I realized well hold on a
 

657
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,150
but then I realized well hold on a
second there were these moments

658
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,160
second there were these moments
 

659
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,269

where in his way again putting yourself

660

where in his way again putting yourself
 

661
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,889
where in his way again putting yourself
in his shoes

662
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:57,899
in his shoes
 

663
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,810
in his shoes
I think he was trying to say he was

664
00:12:59,810 --> 00:12:59,820
I think he was trying to say he was
 

665
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,090
I think he was trying to say he was
sorry he would hold my hand

666
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,100
sorry he would hold my hand
 

667
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,590
sorry he would hold my hand
you know and he would interlock the

668
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
you know and he would interlock the

fingers which I felt is that's a really

670
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
fingers which I felt is that's a really
 

671
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,769
fingers which I felt is that's a really
intimate way of holding somebody's hand

672
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:06,779
intimate way of holding somebody's hand
 

673
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,329
intimate way of holding somebody's hand
I think

674
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:08,339

675
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,030
I think
um so I remember those things so you

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:12,300
know these are the things that are just
 

679
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,170
know these are the things that are just
etched in at least in my mind and

680
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,180
etched in at least in my mind and
 

681
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,230
etched in at least in my mind and
at the end of it you know I think uh

at the end of it you know I think uh
 

683
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,750
at the end of it you know I think uh
I've done a decent job in repairing my

684
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:20,760
I've done a decent job in repairing my
 

685
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,150
I've done a decent job in repairing my
relationship with him even though you

wonder in which way you and I or we

think that when you grow up in those

696
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
think that when you grow up in those
 

697
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,269
think that when you grow up in those
kinds of environments and they're all

698
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:38,279
kinds of environments and they're all
 

699
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,530
kinds of environments and they're all
different kinds of this kind of

700
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:39,540
different kinds of this kind of
 

701
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,970
different kinds of this kind of
dysfunction

702
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:40,980
dysfunction
 

703
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,470
dysfunction
but if

704
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
but if
 

705
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,509
but if
what you get from that is that you're

706
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:44,519
what you get from that is that you're
 

707
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,150
what you get from that is that you're
not worthwhile you're not you're less

708
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,160
not worthwhile you're not you're less
 

709
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,509
not worthwhile you're not you're less
than many many other people

710
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:50,519
than many many other people
 

711
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,970
than many many other people
when you enter adulthood or you know

when you enter adulthood or you know
 

713
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,389
when you enter adulthood or you know
semi-adulthood in your early 20s you

00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
semi-adulthood in your early 20s you
 

715
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,889
semi-adulthood in your early 20s you
will be in a cycle where you are hurting

716
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:57,899
will be in a cycle where you are hurting
 

717
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,509
will be in a cycle where you are hurting
other people

718
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
other people
 

719
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,490
other people
you may not know it

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:01,500
you may not know it
 

721
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,590
you may not know it
hopefully you find somebody who holds

722
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
hopefully you find somebody who holds
 

723
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,629
hopefully you find somebody who holds
you accountable and tells you and loves

724
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:05,639
you accountable and tells you and loves
 

725
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,670
you accountable and tells you and loves
you enough through that

726
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
you enough through that
 

727
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,490
you enough through that
but you are going to take all of that

728
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:10,500
but you are going to take all of that
 

729
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,170
but you are going to take all of that
disharmony in your childhood and you're

730
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:12,180
disharmony in your childhood and you're
 

731
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,629
disharmony in your childhood and you're
going to inject that disharmony into

732
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
going to inject that disharmony into
 

733
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,949
going to inject that disharmony into
whether it's your professional

734
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:15,959
whether it's your professional
 

735
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,150
whether it's your professional
relationships or your personal

736
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,160
relationships or your personal
 

737
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,190
relationships or your personal
relationships or both

738
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,200
relationships or both
 

739
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,629
relationships or both
until

740
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
until
 

741
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,610
until
you get to some form of rock bottom and

742
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:22,620
you get to some form of rock bottom and
 

743
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,990
you get to some form of rock bottom and
you start to repair

744
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
you start to repair
 

745
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,970
you start to repair
and I think there's a lot of people that

746
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:25,980
and I think there's a lot of people that
 

747
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,150
and I think there's a lot of people that
resonate with that because they have

748
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,160
resonate with that because they have
 

749
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,610
resonate with that because they have
each suffered their own things that at

750
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:31,620
each suffered their own things that at
 

751
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,110
each suffered their own things that at
some point in their lives have told them

752
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
some point in their lives have told them
 

753
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,389
some point in their lives have told them
that they're less than

754
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:35,399
that they're less than
 

755
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,329
that they're less than
and um and then they go and cope

756
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:38,339
and um and then they go and cope
 

757
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,129
and um and then they go and cope
and when you cope

758
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:40,139
and when you cope
 

759
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,290
and when you cope
eventually those coping mechanisms

760
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:42,300
eventually those coping mechanisms
 

761
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,110
eventually those coping mechanisms
escalate and at some point it'll be

762
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
escalate and at some point it'll be
 

763
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,689
escalate and at some point it'll be
unhealthy either for you but oftentimes

764
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:47,699
unhealthy either for you but oftentimes
 

765
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,670
unhealthy either for you but oftentimes
it's for the people around you

766
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
it's for the people around you
 

767
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,090
it's for the people around you
well from those humble beginnings you

the landscape of experience in your life
 

775
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,470
the landscape of experience in your life

776
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480
does it buy happiness it doesn't buy
 

777
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,350
does it buy happiness it doesn't buy
happiness but it buys you a level of

778
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
happiness but it buys you a level of
 

779
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,590
happiness but it buys you a level of
comfort for you to really amplify What

00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:12,600
comfort for you to really amplify What
 

781
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,389
comfort for you to really amplify What
happiness is

happiness is
 

783
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,889
happiness is
I kind of think about it in the

784
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:15,899
I kind of think about it in the
 

785
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,750
I kind of think about it in the
following way let's just say that

786
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
following way let's just say that
 

787
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,509
following way let's just say that
there's a a hundred things on a table

788
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:20,519
there's a a hundred things on a table
 

789
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,410
there's a a hundred things on a table
and the table says find happiness here

790
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:24,420
and the table says find happiness here
 

791
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,650
and the table says find happiness here
and there are different prices

792
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:27,660

 

793
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,350

the way that the world works

794
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,360
the way that the world works
 

795
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,449
the way that the world works
is that many of these experiences are

796
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:32,459
is that many of these experiences are
 

797
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,189
is that many of these experiences are
cordoned off a little bit behind the

there negative aspects to money like for

I think the most negative aspect is that

950
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:22,860
I think the most negative aspect is that
 

951
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,230
I think the most negative aspect is that
it amplifies

952
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240

a 360 degree view of your personality
 

955
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,590
a 360 degree view of your personality
because there are a lot of people and

because there are a lot of people and
Society tells you that more money is

958
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,260
Society tells you that more money is
 

959
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,049
Society tells you that more money is
actually better you are a better person

960
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:36,059
actually better you are a better person
 

961
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,510
actually better you are a better person
somehow and you're factually more

962
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:38,520
somehow and you're factually more
 

963
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,430
somehow and you're factually more
worthwhile than some other people that

964
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:40,440
worthwhile than some other people that
 

965
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,750
worthwhile than some other people that
have less money

966
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
have less money
 

967
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,990
have less money
that's also a lie but when you're given

968
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,000
that's also a lie but when you're given
 

969
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,029
that's also a lie but when you're given
that kind of attention it's very easy

970
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
that kind of attention it's very easy
 

971
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,070
that kind of attention it's very easy
for you to become a caricature of

yourself
 

975
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,370

um that's probably the single worst

976
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:52,380

um and we can talk about the solution to
 

1111
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,850
um and we can talk about the solution to
some of these problems are but

some of these problems are but
 

1113
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,950
some of these problems are but
um that's I think the loop that we're

1114
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
um that's I think the loop that we're

00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:40,799
to influence them you could try to
 

1457
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,310
to influence them you could try to
subvert them maybe you plant a spy

1458
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:43,320
subvert them maybe you plant a spy
 

1459
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,529
subvert them maybe you plant a spy
inside of that other person's company to

1460
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:45,539
inside of that other person's company to
 

1461
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,450
inside of that other person's company to
sabotage them I guess there are things

1462
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:47,460
sabotage them I guess there are things
 

1463
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,970
sabotage them I guess there are things
at the edges that you can do

1464
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:49,980
at the edges that you can do
 

1465
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,250
at the edges that you can do
but my firm belief is that life success

1466
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:52,260
but my firm belief is that life success
 

1467
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,669
but my firm belief is that life success
really boils down to how do you control

1468
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
really boils down to how do you control
 

1469
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,769
really boils down to how do you control
your mistakes

1470
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:57,779
your mistakes
 

1471
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,870
your mistakes
now this is a bit counterintuitive

1472
00:27:59,870 --> 00:27:59,880
now this is a bit counterintuitive
 

1473
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,610
now this is a bit counterintuitive
the way you control your mistakes is by

1474
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:01,620
the way you control your mistakes is by
 

1475
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,769
the way you control your mistakes is by
making a lot of mistakes

1476
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:03,779
making a lot of mistakes
 

1477
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,370
making a lot of mistakes
so taking risks you have to is somehow

1478
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:07,380
so taking risks you have to is somehow
 

1479
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,010
so taking risks you have to is somehow
you have to you to minimize the number

1480
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,020
you have to you to minimize the number
 

1481
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,510
you have to you to minimize the number
of mistakes let's just say you want to

1482
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,520
of mistakes let's just say you want to
 

1483
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,610
of mistakes let's just say you want to
find love yeah you know you want to find

1484
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:13,620
find love yeah you know you want to find
 

1485
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,710
find love yeah you know you want to find
something go on deeply connected with

00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,149
something go on deeply connected with

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
your mistake
 

1515
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,810
your mistake
that's a controllable thing in you you

1516
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:47,820
that's a controllable thing in you you
 

1517
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,450
that's a controllable thing in you you
can tell them the truth who you are and

1518
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:50,460
can tell them the truth who you are and
 

1519
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,630
can tell them the truth who you are and
say Here's my pluses and minuses my

1520
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:53,640
say Here's my pluses and minuses my
 

1521
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,370
say Here's my pluses and minuses my
point is there are very few things in

1522
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:55,380
point is there are very few things in
 

1523
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,210
point is there are very few things in
life

1524
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:56,220
life
 

1525
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,370
life
that you can't break down I think into

1526
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:58,380
that you can't break down I think into
 

1527
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,950
that you can't break down I think into
that very simple idea

1528
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:00,960
that very simple idea
 

1529
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,610
that very simple idea
and in terms of your mistakes Society

1530
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:04,620
and in terms of your mistakes Society
 

1531
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,190
and in terms of your mistakes Society
tells you don't make them because we

1532
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,200
tells you don't make them because we
 

1533
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,110
tells you don't make them because we
will judge you and we will look down on

1534
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
will judge you and we will look down on
 

1535
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,830
will judge you and we will look down on
you

1536
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:09,840
you
 

1537
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,570
you
and I think the really successful people

1538
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:11,580
and I think the really successful people
 

1539
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,850
and I think the really successful people
realize that actually no

1540
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:13,860
realize that actually no
 

1541
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,190
realize that actually no
it's the cycle time of mistakes that

1542
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,200
it's the cycle time of mistakes that
 

1543
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,810
it's the cycle time of mistakes that
gets you to success

1544
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:17,820
gets you to success
 

1545
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,970
gets you to success
because your error rate will diminish

1546
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:19,980
because your error rate will diminish
 

1547
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,850
because your error rate will diminish
the more mistakes that you make You

1548
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:22,860
the more mistakes that you make You
 

1549
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,649
the more mistakes that you make You
observe them you figure out where it's

1550
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:24,659
observe them you figure out where it's
 

1551
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,330
observe them you figure out where it's
coming from is it a psychological thing

1552
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:26,340
coming from is it a psychological thing
 

1553
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,789
coming from is it a psychological thing
is it a you know cognitive thing and

1554
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
is it a you know cognitive thing and
 

1555
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,370
is it a you know cognitive thing and
then you fix it so the implied thing

1556
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:31,380
then you fix it so the implied thing
 

1557
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,070
then you fix it so the implied thing
there is that there's a

1558
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,080
there is that there's a
 

1559
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,310
there is that there's a
uh in in business and investing in poker

1560
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:37,320
uh in in business and investing in poker
 

1561
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,370
uh in in business and investing in poker
and dating in life is that there's this

1562
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:40,380
and dating in life is that there's this
 

1563
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,370
and dating in life is that there's this
platonic GTO Game Theory optimal thing

1564
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:43,380
platonic GTO Game Theory optimal thing
 

1565
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,669
platonic GTO Game Theory optimal thing
out there and so when you say mistakes

1566
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
out there and so when you say mistakes
 

1567
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,289
out there and so when you say mistakes
you're always comparing to that optimal

1568
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:48,299
you're always comparing to that optimal
 

1569
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,690
you're always comparing to that optimal
path you could have taken I think uh

1570
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:50,700
path you could have taken I think uh
 

1571
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,549
path you could have taken I think uh
slightly different I would say mistake

1572
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
slightly different I would say mistake
 

1573
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,649
slightly different I would say mistake
is maybe a bad proxy but it's the best

1574
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:54,659
is maybe a bad proxy but it's the best
 

1575
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,049
is maybe a bad proxy but it's the best
proxy I have for learning

1576
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:57,059
proxy I have for learning
 

1577
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,029
proxy I have for learning
but I'm using the language of what

1578
00:29:59,029 --> 00:29:59,039
but I'm using the language of what
 

1579
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,149
but I'm using the language of what
Society tells you sure got it Society

1580
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
Society tells you sure got it Society
 

1581
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,710
Society tells you sure got it Society
tells you that when you try something

1582
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:03,720
tells you that when you try something
 

1583
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,529
tells you that when you try something
and it doesn't work it's a mistake

1584
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:06,539
and it doesn't work it's a mistake
 

1585
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,870
and it doesn't work it's a mistake
so I just use that word because it's the

1586
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
so I just use that word because it's the
 

1587
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,610
so I just use that word because it's the
word that resonates most with most

1588
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:10,620
word that resonates most with most
 

1589
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,250
word that resonates most with most
people got it the real thing that it is

1590
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:13,260
people got it the real thing that it is
 

1591
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,590
people got it the real thing that it is
is learning yeah it's like in neural

1592
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
is learning yeah it's like in neural
 

1593
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,330
is learning yeah it's like in neural
networks it's lost the neural network is

1594
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:17,340
networks it's lost the neural network is
 

1595
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,669
networks it's lost the neural network is
lost exactly uh yeah all right so you're

1596
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
lost exactly uh yeah all right so you're
 

1597
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,590
lost exactly uh yeah all right so you're
using the mistake that is most uh the

1598
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
using the mistake that is most uh the
 

1599
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,269
using the mistake that is most uh the
the word that is the most understandable

1600
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
the word that is the most understandable
 

1601
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,610
the word that is the most understandable
especially by the way people experience

1602
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:25,620
especially by the way people experience
 

1603
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,789
especially by the way people experience
it I guess most of life is a sequence of

1604
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
it I guess most of life is a sequence of
 

1605
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,950
it I guess most of life is a sequence of
mistakes the problem is when you use the

1606
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
mistakes the problem is when you use the
 

1607
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,330
mistakes the problem is when you use the
word mistake and you think about

1608
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:32,340
word mistake and you think about
 

1609
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,409
word mistake and you think about
mistakes it actually has the

1610
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:35,419
mistakes it actually has the
 

1611
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,909
mistakes it actually has the

right and so instead it reinforces this

1684
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:07,500
right and so instead it reinforces this

you've failed completely

that you don't have any other signals
 

1745
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,190
that you don't have any other signals
it's very easy to believe like when

1746
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:22,200
it's very easy to believe like when
 

1747
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,490

1753
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,549
he used me as a mechanism to alleviate
his own frustration and this may sound

1754
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:34,559
his own frustration and this may sound
 

1755
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,630
his own frustration and this may sound
very crazy but he also believed in me

1756
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
very crazy but he also believed in me
 

1757
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,370
very crazy but he also believed in me
and so that's what created this weird

1758
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:40,380
and so that's what created this weird
 

1759

00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:12,599
and so because I had no expectations and
 

1845
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,510

now if I was close to it I probably

1852

now if I was close to it I probably
 

1853
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,870
now if I was close to it I probably
would have aspired to it because I my

and the security of the middle class
 

1949
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,349
and the security of the middle class
like I didn't have any good examples of

1950
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:15,359
like I didn't have any good examples of
 

1951
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,450
like I didn't have any good examples of

interactions to want that and so my
 

1961
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,230
interactions to want that and so my
desires were framed by these two random

1962
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,240
desires were framed by these two random
 

1963
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,790
desires were framed by these two random
rich people that lived in my town who

rich people that lived in my town who
 

1965
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,930
rich people that lived in my town who
I'd never met

1966
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:29,940
I'd never met
 

1967

and what I read in magazines about
 

1969
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,810

you were an early senior executive at

1974
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
you were an early senior executive at
 

1975
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,150
you were an early senior executive at
Facebook uh during a period of a lot of

1976
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,160
Facebook uh during a period of a lot of
 

1977
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,010
Facebook uh during a period of a lot of
scaling in the company history I mean

1978
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,020
scaling in the company history I mean
 

1979
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,870
scaling in the company history I mean
it's actually a fascinating period of

1980
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880
it's actually a fascinating period of
 

1981
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,430
it's actually a fascinating period of
human history in terms of Technology

human history in terms of Technology
 

1983
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,990
human history in terms of Technology
well

1984
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,000
well
 

1985
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,170
well
in terms of human civilization honestly

1986
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:51,180
in terms of human civilization honestly
 

1987
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,530
in terms of human civilization honestly
uh what did you learn from that

1988
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:54,540
uh what did you learn from that
 

1989
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,109
uh what did you learn from that
time about what it takes to build and

1990
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
time about what it takes to build and
 

1991
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,390
time about what it takes to build and
scale a successful tech company a

1992
00:37:59,390 --> 00:37:59,400
scale a successful tech company a
 

1993
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,050
scale a successful tech company a
company that has almost immeasurable

1994
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:03,060
company that has almost immeasurable
 

1995
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,290
company that has almost immeasurable
impact on the world

1996
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:06,300

 

1997
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,329

that was an incredible moment in time

1998
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:08,339
that was an incredible moment in time
 

1999
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,670
that was an incredible moment in time
because everything was so new

2000
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:10,680
because everything was so new
 

2001
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,410
because everything was so new
to your point like even how the

2002
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:12,420
to your point like even how the
 

2003
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,810
to your point like even how the
standards of Web 2.0 at that time were

2004
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:14,820
standards of Web 2.0 at that time were
 

2005
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,730
standards of Web 2.0 at that time were
being defined we were defining them you

2006
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:16,740
being defined we were defining them you
 

2007
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,589
being defined we were defining them you
know I mean I think if you if you look

2008
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:18,599
know I mean I think if you if you look
 

2009
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,150
know I mean I think if you if you look
in sort of the if you search in the

2010
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
in sort of the if you search in the
 

2011
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,950
in sort of the if you search in the
patents

2012
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:21,960
patents
 

2013
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,609
patents
um

2014
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:22,619
um
 

2015
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,290
um
patent Library there's a bunch of these

2016
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:24,300
patent Library there's a bunch of these
 

2017
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,089
patent Library there's a bunch of these
patents that like me and Zuck have for

like random things like cookies you know

2020
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,160
like random things like cookies you know
 

2021
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,950
like random things like cookies you know
or like cross-site JavaScript like all

2022
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
or like cross-site JavaScript like all
 

2023
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,390
or like cross-site JavaScript like all
these crazy things that are just like

these duh kind of ideas in 2023
 

2027
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,290
these duh kind of ideas in 2023
we had to invent our way around how do

2028
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:39,300
we had to invent our way around how do
 

2029
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,329
we had to invent our way around how do
websites communicate with each other you

2030
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:41,339
websites communicate with each other you
 

2031
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:42,950
websites communicate with each other you
know how do we build in the cloud versus

2032
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:42,960
know how do we build in the cloud versus
 

2033
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,630
know how do we build in the cloud versus
in a data center how do we actually have

2034
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
in a data center how do we actually have
 

2035
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,790
in a data center how do we actually have
high performance systems you mentioned

2036
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:46,800
high performance systems you mentioned
 

2037
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,970
high performance systems you mentioned
data science the term and yeah we

2038
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:49,980
data science the term and yeah we
 

2039
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,470
data science the term and yeah we
invented this I invented this thing

2040
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,480
invented this I invented this thing
 

2041
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,210
invented this I invented this thing
called data scientist because we had a

2042
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:53,220
called data scientist because we had a
 

2043
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,130
called data scientist because we had a
PhD from Google that refused to join

2044
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,140
PhD from Google that refused to join
 

2045
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,410
PhD from Google that refused to join
unless because he got a job offer that

2046
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:57,420
unless because he got a job offer that
 

2047
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,750
unless because he got a job offer that
says data analyst yeah

2048
00:38:59,750 --> 00:38:59,760
says data analyst yeah
 

2049
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,250
says data analyst yeah
um and so we said column of scientist

2050
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:01,260
um and so we said column of scientist
 

2051
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,569
um and so we said column of scientist
because he was a PhD in particle physics

2052
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:02,579
because he was a PhD in particle physics
 

2053
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,430
because he was a PhD in particle physics
so he really you know he was a scientist

2054
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:04,440
so he really you know he was a scientist
 

2055
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,870
so he really you know he was a scientist
and I said great you're a scientist here

2056
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:05,880
and I said great you're a scientist here
 

2057
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,150
and I said great you're a scientist here
and that launched a discipline that

2058
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,160
and that launched a discipline that
 

2059
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,130
and that launched a discipline that
launched it just made a term you know

2060
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,140
launched it just made a term you know
 

2061
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,770
launched it just made a term you know
what's a rose by any other name but yeah

2062
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:12,780
what's a rose by any other name but yeah
 

2063
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,109
what's a rose by any other name but yeah
like you know sometimes words like this

2064
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,119
like you know sometimes words like this
 

2065
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,849
like you know sometimes words like this
can launch entire

2066
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:16,859
can launch entire
 

2067
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,609
can launch entire
fields and it did in that case and you

2068
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:19,619
fields and it did in that case and you
 

2069
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,770
fields and it did in that case and you
didn't I mean I guess at that time you

2070
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:21,780
didn't I mean I guess at that time you
 

2071
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,170
didn't I mean I guess at that time you
didn't anticipate the impact of machine

2072
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:24,180
didn't anticipate the impact of machine
 

2073
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,089
didn't anticipate the impact of machine
learning on the entirety of this whole

2076
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599

00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:18,540
and we would go through that Loop and
 

2287
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,270
and we would go through that Loop and
what did it train people not that you

00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:20,280
what did it train people not that you
 

2289
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,210
what did it train people not that you
got celebrated for the right answer

I ran 12 experiments 12 failed and we'd

can I just take a small tangent on that

00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:33,660
can I just take a small tangent on that

can I just take a small tangent on that
is to move fast and break things

2300
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:35,880
is to move fast and break things
 

2301
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,390
is to move fast and break things
has become as like a catchphrase of the

2302
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:41,400
has become as like a catchphrase of the
 

2303
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,670
has become as like a catchphrase of the
thing that embodies the toxic culture of

2304
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:43,680
thing that embodies the toxic culture of
 

2305
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,130
thing that embodies the toxic culture of
Silicon Valley in today's

2306
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:46,140
Silicon Valley in today's
 

2307
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,609
Silicon Valley in today's
uh discourse which uh confuses me of

2308
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:49,619
uh discourse which uh confuses me of
 

2309
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,890
uh discourse which uh confuses me of
course words and phrases get sort of

2310
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:51,900
course words and phrases get sort of
 

2311
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,510
course words and phrases get sort of
captured and so on becomes very

2312
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
captured and so on becomes very
 

2313
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,309
captured and so on becomes very
reductive you know that's a very loaded

2314
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:55,319
reductive you know that's a very loaded
 

2315
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,250
reductive you know that's a very loaded
set of words that together can be

2316
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:58,260
set of words that together can be
 

2317
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,470
set of words that together can be
many years later people can view very

2318
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480
many years later people can view very
 

2319
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,510
many years later people can view very
reductive can you still man each side of

2320
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:02,520
reductive can you still man each side of
 

2321
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,990
reductive can you still man each side of
that so yeah pro move fast and break

2322
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
that so yeah pro move fast and break
 

2323
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,349
that so yeah pro move fast and break
things yeah and against yeah

2324
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
things yeah and against yeah
 

2325
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,089
things yeah and against yeah
um so I think the pro have moved fast

2326
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:11,099
um so I think the pro have moved fast
 

2327
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:13,670
um so I think the pro have moved fast
and break things is saying the following

2328
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:13,680
and break things is saying the following
 

2329
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,010
and break things is saying the following
there's a space of things we know

2330
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,020
there's a space of things we know
 

2331
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,589
there's a space of things we know
and a massive space of things we don't

2332
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:18,599
and a massive space of things we don't
 

2333
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:19,670
and a massive space of things we don't
know

2334
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:19,680
know
 

2335
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,190
know
and there's a rate of growth of the

2336
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:22,200
and there's a rate of growth of the
 

2337
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,809
and there's a rate of growth of the
things we know

2338
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:23,819
things we know
 

2339
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:25,910
things we know
but the rate of growth of the things we

2340
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
but the rate of growth of the things we
 

2341
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,770
but the rate of growth of the things we
don't know is actually we have to assume

2342
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:27,780
don't know is actually we have to assume
 

2343
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,990
don't know is actually we have to assume
growing faster

2344
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,000
growing faster
 

2345
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,630
growing faster
so the most important thing is to move

2346
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,640
so the most important thing is to move
 

2347
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,309
so the most important thing is to move
into the space of the things we don't

2348
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:34,319
into the space of the things we don't
 

2349
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,370
into the space of the things we don't
know as quickly as possible

2350
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:37,380
know as quickly as possible
 

2351
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,470
know as quickly as possible
and so in order to acquire knowledge

2352
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:39,480
and so in order to acquire knowledge
 

2353
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,390
and so in order to acquire knowledge
we're going to assume

2354
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:41,400
we're going to assume
 

2355
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,910
we're going to assume
that the failure mode is the nominal

2356
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:43,920
that the failure mode is the nominal
 

2357
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,190
that the failure mode is the nominal
state

2358
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:45,200
state
 

2359
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,750
state
and so we just need to move as quickly

2360
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
and so we just need to move as quickly
 

2361
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,910
and so we just need to move as quickly
as we can break as many things as

2362
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:49,920
as we can break as many things as
 

2363
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,470
as we can break as many things as
possible which means like things are

2364
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:51,480
possible which means like things are
 

2365
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,329
possible which means like things are
breaking in code

2366
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:53,339

then rapidly move into the space and he

2372
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:00,599
then rapidly move into the space and he
 

2373
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,230
then rapidly move into the space and he

00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,910
there is no more room
to experiment in an open-ended way

2404
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:40,920
to experiment in an open-ended way
 

2405
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,069
to experiment in an open-ended way
because the implications have broad

2406
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:43,079
because the implications have broad
 

2407
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,309
because the implications have broad
societal impacts that are not clear up

2408
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:46,319
societal impacts that are not clear up

so let's take a different less

2412
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:49,380
so let's take a different less

so let's take a different less
controversial example if we said you

2414
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:52,140
controversial example if we said you
 

2415
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,470
controversial example if we said you
know Lipitor

2416
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,480
know Lipitor
 

2417
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,290
know Lipitor
um worked well for all people except

2418
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:57,300
um worked well for all people except
 

2419
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,450
um worked well for all people except
South Asians and there's a specific

2420
00:45:59,450 --> 00:45:59,460
South Asians and there's a specific
 

2421
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,450
South Asians and there's a specific
immuno response that we can iterate to

2422
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:02,460
immuno response that we can iterate to
 

2423
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,609
immuno response that we can iterate to
and if we move quickly enough we can run

2424
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:04,619
and if we move quickly enough we can run
 

2425
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,410
and if we move quickly enough we can run
10 000 experiments and we think the

2426
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:06,420
10 000 experiments and we think the
 

2427
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,050
10 000 experiments and we think the
answer is in that space

2428
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:09,060
answer is in that space
 

2429
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,329
answer is in that space
well the problem is that those 10 000

2430
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:11,339
well the problem is that those 10 000
 

2431
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,089
well the problem is that those 10 000
experiments May kill 10 million people

2432
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:14,099
experiments May kill 10 million people
 

2433
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:17,150
experiments May kill 10 million people
so you have to move methodically when

2434
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:17,160
so you have to move methodically when
 

2435
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,550
so you have to move methodically when
that drug was experimental

2436
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:19,560
that drug was experimental
 

2437
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,550
that drug was experimental
and it wasn't being given to 500 million

2438
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
and it wasn't being given to 500 million
 

2439
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,870
and it wasn't being given to 500 million
people in the world

2440
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:23,880
people in the world
 

2441
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,609
people in the world
moving fast made sense because you could

2442
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:25,619
moving fast made sense because you could
 

2443
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,650
moving fast made sense because you could
have a pig model a mouse model a monkey

we picked all that low hanging fruit

2448
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:32,520
we picked all that low hanging fruit
 

2449
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,630
we picked all that low hanging fruit
and so now these small iterations

2450
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:35,640
and so now these small iterations
 

2451
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,790
and so now these small iterations
have huge impacts that need to be

you work at Boeing
and you have an implementation that

00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:45,300
and you have an implementation that

and you have an implementation that
gives you a two percent efficiency by

of
 

2563
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,490
of
uh now this is a board meeting how would

2564
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:46,500
uh now this is a board meeting how would
 

2565
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,710
uh now this is a board meeting how would
that make Facebook money

2566
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:48,720
that make Facebook money
 

2567
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,829
that make Facebook money
I think that you have all of these

2568
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:51,839
I think that you have all of these
 

2569
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,190
I think that you have all of these
systems over time that that we don't

2570
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200
systems over time that that we don't
 

2571
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,670
systems over time that that we don't
know could benefit from

2572
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:58,680
know could benefit from
 

2573
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,210
know could benefit from
um some layer of reasoning to make it

2574
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:02,220
um some layer of reasoning to make it
 

2575
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,410
um some layer of reasoning to make it
better

2576
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:03,420
better
 

2577
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,190
better
um

2578
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:04,200
um

so if you take that OSI reference stack

so if you take that OSI reference stack

00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,050
so if you take that OSI reference stack

you better start digging quickly and

2702
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:23,099
you better start digging quickly and
 

2703
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:25,069
you better start digging quickly and
moving your way down and get out of the

00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:46,440
personalization almost like a operating
 

2721
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,190
personalization almost like a operating
system layer so pushing away from the

2722
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:49,200
system layer so pushing away from the
 

2723
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,809
system layer so pushing away from the
interface and the actual system that

2724
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:50,819
interface and the actual system that
 

2725
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,450
interface and the actual system that
does the personalization I think the

00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:53,460
does the personalization I think the
 

2727
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,130

challenge is there there's obviously

2728
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:55,140
challenge is there there's obviously
 

2729
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,049
challenge is there there's obviously
technical challenges

2730
00:51:57,049 --> 00:51:57,059
technical challenges
 

2731
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,270
technical challenges
but there's also societal challenges

2732
00:51:59,270 --> 00:51:59,280
but there's also societal challenges
 

2733
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,329
but there's also societal challenges
that

2734
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:01,339
that
 

2735
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:04,370
that
it's like in a relationship if you have

2736
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:04,380
it's like in a relationship if you have
 

2737
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,290
it's like in a relationship if you have
an intimate algorithmic connection with

2738
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:06,300
an intimate algorithmic connection with
 

2739
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,829
an intimate algorithmic connection with
individual humans you can do both good

2740
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:09,839
individual humans you can do both good
 

2741
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,109
individual humans you can do both good
and bad and so there's risks that you're

2742
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:12,119
and bad and so there's risks that you're
 

2743
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,290
and bad and so there's risks that you're
taking you can so if you're making a lot

2744
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:15,300
taking you can so if you're making a lot
 

2745
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,910
taking you can so if you're making a lot

um I mean there's a cost to forming a

00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:33,599
um I mean there's a cost to forming a
 

2759

more intimate relationship with the

in the short term I think you said a

2764
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:38,460
in the short term I think you said a
 

2765
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,030
in the short term I think you said a
really really key thing which is

2766
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,040
really really key thing which is
 

2767
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,010
really really key thing which is
um which was a really great

2768
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:43,020
um which was a really great
 

2769
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,470
um which was a really great
emotional instinctive reaction which is

2770
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:45,480
emotional instinctive reaction which is
 

2771
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,390
emotional instinctive reaction which is
when I said the AGI thing you said well

2772
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:47,400
when I said the AGI thing you said well
 

2773
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,490

how would you ever make money from that

2774
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:49,500
how would you ever make money from that
 

2775
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,250
how would you ever make money from that
that is the key the presumption is that

2776
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:52,260
that is the key the presumption is that
 

2777
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,870
that is the key the presumption is that
this thing would not be an important

2778
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:53,880
this thing would not be an important
 

2779
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,849
this thing would not be an important
thing at the beginning and I think what

2780
00:52:55,849 --> 00:52:55,859
thing at the beginning and I think what
 

2781
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:57,170
thing at the beginning and I think what
that allows you to do if you were

2782
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:57,180
that allows you to do if you were
 

2783
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,390
that allows you to do if you were

something like this is that you can

2788
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:04,500
something like this is that you can
 

2789
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,790
something like this is that you can
actually have it off the critical path

2790
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:07,800
actually have it off the critical path
 

2791
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,370
actually have it off the critical path
and you can experiment with this for

2792
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:10,380
and you can experiment with this for
 

2793
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,950
and you can experiment with this for
years if that's what it takes to find a

2794
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:12,960
years if that's what it takes to find a
 

2795
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,530
years if that's what it takes to find a
version one that is special enough where

2796
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:15,540
version one that is special enough where
 

2797
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,809
version one that is special enough where
it's worth showcasing

Lots over and I would just say no look

3304
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:26,819
Lots over and I would just say no look
 

3305
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:30,230
Lots over and I would just say no look
at teraflops and really teraflops is the

3306
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:30,240
at teraflops and really teraflops is the
 

3307
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,569
at teraflops and really teraflops is the
combination of CPUs but much much less

3308
01:02:32,569 --> 01:02:32,579
combination of CPUs but much much less
 

3309
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:34,490
combination of CPUs but much much less
important and really is the combination

3310
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:34,500
important and really is the combination
 

3311
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,490
important and really is the combination
of Asics so application specific ICS and

3312
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:37,500
of Asics so application specific ICS and

gpus
 

3315
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,210
gpus
and so you put the two together I mean

3316
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:41,220
and so you put the two together I mean
 

3317
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,130
and so you put the two together I mean
if I gave you a billion dollars five

01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:46,380
the amount of damage you could do
 

3323
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:49,130
the amount of damage you could do
damaged in good way in terms of you know

building racks and racks of gpus the

3326
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:51,420
building racks and racks of gpus the
 

3327
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,910
building racks and racks of gpus the
kind of models that you could build the

3328
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:52,920
kind of models that you could build the
 

3329
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,349
kind of models that you could build the
training sets and the data that you

3330
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:54,359
training sets and the data that you
 

3331
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:57,049
training sets and the data that you
could consume to solve a problem

3332
01:02:57,049 --> 01:02:57,059
could consume to solve a problem
 

3333
01:02:57,059 --> 01:02:59,450
could consume to solve a problem
it's it's enough to to do something

3334
01:02:59,450 --> 01:02:59,460
it's it's enough to to do something
 

3335
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,950
it's it's enough to to do something
really powerful whereas today it's not

3336
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:00,960
really powerful whereas today it's not
 

3337
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,089
really powerful whereas today it's not
yet quite enough

3338
01:03:02,089 --> 01:03:02,099
yet quite enough
 

3339
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:03,890
yet quite enough
so there's this really interesting idea

3340
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:03,900
so there's this really interesting idea
 

3341
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,349
so there's this really interesting idea
that you talk about in terms of Facebook

3342
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:06,359
that you talk about in terms of Facebook
 

3343
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:08,750
that you talk about in terms of Facebook
and Twitter that's connected to this

3344
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:08,760
and Twitter that's connected to this
 

3345
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,690
and Twitter that's connected to this
that if you were running sort of Twitter

3346
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:11,700
that if you were running sort of Twitter
 

3347
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,789
that if you were running sort of Twitter
or Facebook that you would move them all

3348
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:13,799
or Facebook that you would move them all
 

3349
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:16,069
or Facebook that you would move them all
to like AWS

3350
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
to like AWS
 

3351
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,430
to like AWS
so you would uh have somebody else to

3352
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,440
so you would uh have somebody else to
 

3353
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,829
so you would uh have somebody else to
come the compute the infrastructure it

3354
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
come the compute the infrastructure it
 

3355
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,450
come the compute the infrastructure it
probably if you could explain that

3356
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:23,460
probably if you could explain that
 

3357
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,910
probably if you could explain that
reasoning

3358
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:24,920
reasoning
 

3359
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,470
reasoning
means that you believe in this idea of

3360
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:27,480
means that you believe in this idea of
 

3361
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,030
means that you believe in this idea of
energy going to zero compute going to

3362
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:29,040
energy going to zero compute going to
 

3363
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,370
energy going to zero compute going to
zero so let people that are optimizing

3364
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:31,380
zero so let people that are optimizing
 

3365
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,450
zero so let people that are optimizing
that

3366
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:32,460
that
 

3367
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,870
that
do the best job and I think that's a you

3368
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:35,880
do the best job and I think that's a you
 

3369
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,170
do the best job and I think that's a you
know the initially in the early 2000s

3370
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:39,180
know the initially in the early 2000s
 

3371
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,630
know the initially in the early 2000s
and the beginning of the 2010s

3372
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:41,640
and the beginning of the 2010s
 

3373
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,630
and the beginning of the 2010s
if you were a big enough scale

3374
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:44,640
if you were a big enough scale
 

3375
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,190
if you were a big enough scale
oh sorry everybody was building their

3376
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:46,200
oh sorry everybody was building their
 

3377
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,270
oh sorry everybody was building their
own stuff then between 2010 through 2020

3378
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:49,280
own stuff then between 2010 through 2020
 

3379
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,130
own stuff then between 2010 through 2020
really the idea was everybody should be

3380
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:52,140
really the idea was everybody should be
 

3381
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,410
really the idea was everybody should be
on AWS except the biggest of the biggest

3382
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:54,420
on AWS except the biggest of the biggest
 

3383
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,569
on AWS except the biggest of the biggest
folks

3384
01:03:56,569 --> 01:03:56,579
folks
 

3385
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:00,650
folks
I think in the 2020s and 30s I think the

3386
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:00,660
I think in the 2020s and 30s I think the
 

3387
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,150
I think in the 2020s and 30s I think the
answer is actually everybody should be

3388
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:02,160
answer is actually everybody should be
 

3389
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,549
answer is actually everybody should be
in these public clouds and the reason is

3390
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:04,559
in these public clouds and the reason is
 

3391
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,990
in these public clouds and the reason is
the engineering velocity of the guts

3392
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,000
the engineering velocity of the guts
 

3393
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,730
the engineering velocity of the guts
so you know take a simple example which

3394
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:10,740
so you know take a simple example which
 

3395
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,250
so you know take a simple example which
is you know we have not seen a massive

3396
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:13,260
is you know we have not seen a massive
 

3397
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,289
is you know we have not seen a massive

well software has a very powerful

3514
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:31,140
well software has a very powerful
 

3515
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,710
well software has a very powerful
property in that there's a lot of things

3516
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:33,720
property in that there's a lot of things
 

3517
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,089
property in that there's a lot of things
that can happen asynchronous

3518
01:06:35,089 --> 01:06:35,099
that can happen asynchronous
 

3519
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:37,849
that can happen asynchronous
asynchronously so that real-time

lightweight code deployment and that's

3524
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:42,539
lightweight code deployment and that's
 

3525
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:43,849
lightweight code deployment and that's
why I think you can have a very

3526
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:43,859
why I think you can have a very

different because in order to build the
 

3533
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,569

best car it's kind of like trying to
 

3535
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:55,970
best car it's kind of like trying to
build the best iPhone which is that you

3536
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:55,980
build the best iPhone which is that you
 

3537
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,410
build the best iPhone which is that you
need to control it all the way down to

3538
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:57,420
need to control it all the way down to
 

3539
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,910
need to control it all the way down to
the bare metal in order to do it well

the bare metal in order to do it well
 

3541
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,510
the bare metal in order to do it well
and that's just not possible if you're

3542
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:02,520
and that's just not possible if you're
 

3543
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,190
and that's just not possible if you're
trying to be a systems integrator which

thought about this a little bit
 

3585
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:48,829
thought about this a little bit
um

3586
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:48,839
um
 

3587
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,809
um
first of all let me give you a backdrop

and the answer is the reasoning is the
 

3595
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,430
and the answer is the reasoning is the
following

following
 

3597
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,529

3713
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,270

your question is I would focus on the

your question is I would focus on the
 

3715
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,430
your question is I would focus on the
content creator side of things because I

3716
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440
content creator side of things because I
 

3717
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,689
content creator side of things because I
believe that's where the puck is going

believe that's where the puck is going
 

3719
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:25,070
believe that's where the puck is going
that's a much more important shift in

3720
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:25,080
that's a much more important shift in
 

3721
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,350
that's a much more important shift in
how we all consume information content

humanize and understand are the filter
 

3729
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,530
humanize and understand are the filter
but aren't you just

3730
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:36,540
but aren't you just
 

3731
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,330
but aren't you just
arguing against the point you made

3732
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:38,340
arguing against the point you made
 

3733
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,649
arguing against the point you made
earlier which is what you would

3734
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:39,659
earlier which is what you would
 

3735
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:42,649
earlier which is what you would
recommend is the invest in the AGI the

the depersonalization because because

3738
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:44,820
the depersonalization because because
 

3739
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,970
the depersonalization because because
they they could still be a participant

3740
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:46,980
they they could still be a participant
 

3741
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,649
they they could still be a participant
in that in that end state if that

3742
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:48,659
in that in that end state if that
 

3743
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:50,990
in that in that end state if that
happens you have the option value of

3744
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:51,000
happens you have the option value of
 

3745
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,790
happens you have the option value of
being an enabler of that

3746
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:52,800
being an enabler of that
 

3747
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,130
being an enabler of that
right you can help improve what they do

3748
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:55,140
right you can help improve what they do
 

3749
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,169
right you can help improve what they do
again you can be this bare metal service

3750
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:57,179
again you can be this bare metal service
 

3751
01:10:57,179 --> 01:11:00,290
again you can be this bare metal service
provider where you can be a tax

3752
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:00,300
provider where you can be a tax
 

3753
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,750

yeah right you can participate in every

3754
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:02,760
yeah right you can participate in every
 

3755
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,390
yeah right you can participate in every
thing that you do every question that's

3756
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:05,400
thing that you do every question that's
 

3757
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,910
thing that you do every question that's
asked every comment that's curated if

3758
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:07,920
asked every comment that's curated if
 

3759
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,649
asked every comment that's curated if
you could have more intelligence as you

3760
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:09,659
you could have more intelligence as you
 

3761
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:11,390
you could have more intelligence as you
provide a service to your fans in your

3762
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:11,400
provide a service to your fans in your
 

3763
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,550
provide a service to your fans in your
audience you would probably pay a small

3764
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:13,560
audience you would probably pay a small
 

3765
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,130
audience you would probably pay a small
percentage of that Revenue I suspect all

3766
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:16,140
percentage of that Revenue I suspect all
 

3767
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,649
percentage of that Revenue I suspect all
content creators would and so it's that

3768
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:18,659
content creators would and so it's that
 

3769
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:21,290
content creators would and so it's that
stack of services that is like a smart

3770
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:21,300
stack of services that is like a smart
 

3771
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,790
stack of services that is like a smart
human being it's like you know how do

3772
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:22,800
human being it's like you know how do
 

3773
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,410
human being it's like you know how do
you help produce this information you

3774
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:24,420
you help produce this information you
 

3775
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,970
you help produce this information you
would pay a producer for that I mean

3776
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:25,980
would pay a producer for that I mean
 

3777
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,950
would pay a producer for that I mean
maybe you would but so back to your

3778
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:27,960
maybe you would but so back to your
 

3779
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,450
maybe you would but so back to your
question so what would I do

3780
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:29,460
question so what would I do
 

3781
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,430
question so what would I do
I think that you have to move into that

3782
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:31,440
I think that you have to move into that
 

3783
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,330
I think that you have to move into that
world

3784
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:32,340
world
 

3785
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,370
world
pretty aggressively

3786
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:34,380
pretty aggressively
 

3787
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:34,910
pretty aggressively
um

3788
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:34,920
um
 

3789
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,709
um
I think that right now you first have to

3790
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:36,719
I think that right now you first have to
 

3791
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:39,169
I think that right now you first have to
solve what is broken inside of these

3792
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:39,179
solve what is broken inside of these
 

3793
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:40,550
solve what is broken inside of these
social networks

3794
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:40,560
social networks
 

3795
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,990
social networks
and I don't think it's a technical

3796
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
and I don't think it's a technical
 

3797
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,010
and I don't think it's a technical
problem

3798
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:43,020
problem
 

3799
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,450
problem
so just to put it out there I don't

3800
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:44,460
so just to put it out there I don't
 

3801
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,250
so just to put it out there I don't
think it's a

3802
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:46,260
think it's a
 

3803
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,169
think it's a
you know it's one where there are these

3804
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:48,179
you know it's one where there are these
 

3805
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,470
you know it's one where there are these
nefarious organizations that happens

3806
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:50,480
nefarious organizations that happens
 

3807
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,110
nefarious organizations that happens
brigading XYZ that happens

3808
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:54,120
brigading XYZ that happens
 

3809
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,510
brigading XYZ that happens
but the real problem is a psychological

3810
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:56,520
but the real problem is a psychological
 

3811
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,930
but the real problem is a psychological
one that we're dealing with which is

3812
01:11:59,930 --> 01:11:59,940
one that we're dealing with which is
 

3813
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,729
one that we're dealing with which is
people

3814
01:12:01,729 --> 01:12:01,739
people
 

3815
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:05,750
people
through a whole set of situations

3816
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:05,760
through a whole set of situations
 

3817
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,149
through a whole set of situations
have lost

3818
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:08,159
have lost
 

3819
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:11,510
have lost
belief in themselves

3820
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520

 

3821
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,590

and I think that that

3822
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:15,600

 

3823
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,470

comes up as this very virulent form of

3824
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:18,480
comes up as this very virulent form of
 

3825
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,030
comes up as this very virulent form of
rejection that they tried to put into

3826
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:20,040

to solve that psychological Corner case
 

3887

to solve that psychological Corner case
because it is what makes a network

because it is what makes a network

to get real density you have to find a
 

3893
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,950
to get real density you have to find a
way of moving away from that toxicity

way of moving away from that toxicity
 

3895
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,290
way of moving away from that toxicity

other people are just going to say you

other people are just going to say you

so the social network has to have a

3912
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:48,420
so the social network has to have a
 

3913
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,330
so the social network has to have a
social cost you can do it in a couple

3914
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:50,340
social cost you can do it in a couple
 

3915
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,310
social cost you can do it in a couple
ways one is where you have real world

3916
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,320
ways one is where you have real world
 

3917
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,709
ways one is where you have real world
identity so then there's a cost to being

3918
01:13:54,709 --> 01:13:54,719
identity so then there's a cost to being
 

3919
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:55,850
identity so then there's a cost to being
virulent

3920
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:55,860
virulent
 

3921
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:58,669
virulent
and there's a cost to being caustic

3922
01:13:58,669 --> 01:13:58,679
and there's a cost to being caustic
 

3923
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:01,490
and there's a cost to being caustic
a second way is to actually just overlay

3924
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:01,500
a second way is to actually just overlay
 

3925
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,649
a second way is to actually just overlay
an economic framework

3926
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:03,659
an economic framework
 

3927
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:05,510
an economic framework
so that there's a more pertinent

3928
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,520
so that there's a more pertinent
 

3929
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,729
so that there's a more pertinent
economic value that you assign to

3930
01:14:07,729 --> 01:14:07,739
economic value that you assign to
 

3931
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:10,189
economic value that you assign to
basically spouting off and the more you

3932
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:10,199
basically spouting off and the more you
 

3933
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:12,590
basically spouting off and the more you
want to spend the more you can say

3934
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:12,600
want to spend the more you can say
 

3935
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,050
want to spend the more you can say
and I think both have a lot of value I

3936
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:15,060
and I think both have a lot of value I
 

3937
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,669
and I think both have a lot of value I
don't know what the right answer is I

3938
01:14:16,669 --> 01:14:16,679
don't know what the right answer is I
 

3939
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:18,290
don't know what the right answer is I
tend to like the latter

3940
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:18,300
tend to like the latter
 

3941
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,870
tend to like the latter
I think real world identity shuts down a

3942
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:20,880
I think real world identity shuts down a
 

3943
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,270
I think real world identity shuts down a
lot of debate because there's still too

3944
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,280
lot of debate because there's still too
 

3945
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,770
lot of debate because there's still too
much

3946
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:24,780
much
 

3947
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,510
much
um you know there's a sensation that

3948
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:26,520
um you know there's a sensation that
 

3949
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,270
um you know there's a sensation that
there that there'll be some retribution

3950
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:29,280
there that there'll be some retribution
 

3951
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,890
there that there'll be some retribution
um so I think there's more free speech

3952
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:30,900
um so I think there's more free speech
 

3953
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,770
um so I think there's more free speech
over here but it cannot be Costless

3954
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:33,780
over here but it cannot be Costless
 

3955
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,510
over here but it cannot be Costless
because in that there's a level of

3956
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:35,520
because in that there's a level of
 

3957
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,370
because in that there's a level of
toxicity that just makes these products

3958
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:37,380
toxicity that just makes these products
 

3959
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:40,250
toxicity that just makes these products
unusable what about a third option and

3960
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:40,260
unusable what about a third option and
 

3961
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,750
unusable what about a third option and
by the way all of these can work

3962
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
by the way all of these can work
 

3963
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,910
by the way all of these can work
together

3964
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:43,920
together
 

3965
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,830

Go on too long
 

4149
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:36,530
Go on too long
the other side of the argument would be

4150
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:36,540
the other side of the argument would be
 

4151
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:40,310
the other side of the argument would be
he was a duly elected person whose views

things in order to showcase
 

4159
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:55,189
things in order to showcase
how corrupt these systems have become

4160
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
how corrupt these systems have become
 

4161
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,830
how corrupt these systems have become
and how insular these organizations are

4162

the let's say there's a metric that

of the platform and they probably saw uh
 

4219
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,669
of the platform and they probably saw uh
in several ways you could look at this

in several ways you could look at this
 

4221
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,370

violence or so on that would work if you

4274
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:11,100
violence or so on that would work if you
 

4275
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,649
violence or so on that would work if you
could measure

your construct of Happiness properly the
problem is I think what Twitter looked

4280
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:16,500
problem is I think what Twitter looked
 

4281
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,350
problem is I think what Twitter looked
at were active commenters and got it

4282
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:18,360
at were active commenters and got it
 

4283
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,149
at were active commenters and got it
confused for overall system happiness

4284
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:20,159
confused for overall system happiness
 

4285
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,189
confused for overall system happiness
because for every piece of content

4286
01:21:22,189 --> 01:21:22,199
because for every piece of content
 

4287
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:24,169
because for every piece of content
that's created on the internet of the

4288
01:21:24,169 --> 01:21:24,179
that's created on the internet of the
 

4289
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:26,450
that's created on the internet of the
hundred people that consume it maybe one

4290
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:26,460
hundred people that consume it maybe one
 

4291
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:29,630
hundred people that consume it maybe one
or two people comment on it and so by

4292
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:29,640
or two people comment on it and so by
 

4293
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,149
or two people comment on it and so by
over amplifying that signal and assuming

4294
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:32,159
over amplifying that signal and assuming
 

4295
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,189
over amplifying that signal and assuming
that it was the plurality of people

4296
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:34,199
that it was the plurality of people
 

4297
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:36,290
that it was the plurality of people
that's where they actually made a huge

4298
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:36,300
that's where they actually made a huge
 

4299
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,990
that's where they actually made a huge
blunder because there was no scientific

4300
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:39,000
blunder because there was no scientific
 

4301
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,090
blunder because there was no scientific
method I think to get to the answer of

4302
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:41,100
method I think to get to the answer of

that Loop was
 

4597
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:40,430
that Loop was
um was unproductive it's because those

4598

because you hold the strong opinion
 

5219
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,310
because you hold the strong opinion
sometimes uh like for example the cost

5220
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:25,320
sometimes uh like for example the cost
 

5221
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,350
sometimes uh like for example the cost
of energy going to zero

5222
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:27,360
of energy going to zero
 

5223
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,270
of energy going to zero
is that

5224
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:29,280
is that
 

5225
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,250
is that
like what's the degree of certainty on

5226
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:31,260
like what's the degree of certainty on
 

5227
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:34,910
like what's the degree of certainty on
that is is this kind of like you really

5228
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:34,920
that is is this kind of like you really
 

5229
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:37,490
that is is this kind of like you really
taking a prediction of how the world

5230
01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:37,500
taking a prediction of how the world
 

5231
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,550
taking a prediction of how the world
will unroll and if it does this will

5232
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:40,560
will unroll and if it does this will
 

5233
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,790
will unroll and if it does this will
benefit uh a huge amount of companies

5234
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:43,800
benefit uh a huge amount of companies
 

5235
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:46,430
benefit uh a huge amount of companies
and people that will believe that idea

5236
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:46,440
and people that will believe that idea
 

5237
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,310
and people that will believe that idea
so you really you you like uh you spend

5238
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:49,320
so you really you you like uh you spend
 

5239
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,110
so you really you you like uh you spend
a few days a few weeks with that idea

5240
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:51,120
a few days a few weeks with that idea
 

5241
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:53,510
a few days a few weeks with that idea
I've been spending two years with that

5242
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:53,520
I've been spending two years with that
 

5243
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,129
I've been spending two years with that
idea and that idea has manifested into

5244
01:39:58,129 --> 01:39:58,139
idea and that idea has manifested into
 

5245
01:39:58,139 --> 01:40:02,410
idea and that idea has manifested into
um many pages and pages of more and more

5246
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:02,420
um many pages and pages of more and more
 

5247
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,790
um many pages and pages of more and more
branches of a tree

5248
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:04,800
branches of a tree
 

5249
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,070
branches of a tree
but it started with that idea so if you

5250
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:07,080
but it started with that idea so if you
 

5251
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,689
but it started with that idea so if you
think about this tree this logical tree

5252
01:40:08,689 --> 01:40:08,699
think about this tree this logical tree
 

5253
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:10,189
think about this tree this logical tree
that I built I would consider it more of

5254
01:40:10,189 --> 01:40:10,199
that I built I would consider it more of
 

5255
01:40:10,199 --> 01:40:13,310
that I built I would consider it more of

01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:10,800
unplug me from the entire world economy
 

5573
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,189
unplug me from the entire world economy
the only morally reprehensible thing

5574
01:46:13,189 --> 01:46:13,199
the only morally reprehensible thing
 

5575
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:15,470
the only morally reprehensible thing
that's left in my Arsenal that could do

5576
01:46:15,470 --> 01:46:15,480
that's left in my Arsenal that could do
 

5577
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,030
that's left in my Arsenal that could do
all of these things together would be to

5578
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:17,040
all of these things together would be to
 

5579
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,310
all of these things together would be to
set off attack nuke I would be the only

5580
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:19,320
set off attack nuke I would be the only
 

5581
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:21,649
set off attack nuke I would be the only
person since World War II to have done

5582
01:46:21,649 --> 01:46:21,659
person since World War II to have done
 

5583
01:46:21,659 --> 01:46:24,470
person since World War II to have done
that

5584
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:24,480

 

5585
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,750

you know it's it seems like it's a

5586
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:26,760
you know it's it seems like it's a
 

5587
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:28,330
you know it's it seems like it's a
really really really

5588
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:28,340
really really really
 

5589
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:31,189
really really really
big step to take

5590
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:31,199
big step to take
 

5591
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:34,010
big step to take
and so I think that

5592
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:34,020
and so I think that
 

5593
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:37,010
and so I think that
X of the clamoring for war that the

5594
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:37,020
X of the clamoring for war that the
 

5595
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:38,870
X of the clamoring for war that the
military-industrial complex wants us to

5596
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:38,880
military-industrial complex wants us to
 

5597
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,189
military-industrial complex wants us to
buy into

5598
01:46:40,189 --> 01:46:40,199
buy into
 

5599
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:43,070
buy into
the financial reasons to do it and the

5600
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:43,080
the financial reasons to do it and the
 

5601
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:46,010
the financial reasons to do it and the
natural reason resources needs to do it

5602
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:46,020
natural reason resources needs to do it
 

5603
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:49,250
natural reason resources needs to do it
are making it very unlikely

5604
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:49,260
are making it very unlikely
 

5605
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:51,770
are making it very unlikely
that is not just true for us

5606
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:51,780
that is not just true for us
 

5607
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,810
that is not just true for us
I think it's also true for Europe I

5608
01:46:53,810 --> 01:46:53,820
I think it's also true for Europe I
 

5609
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:55,609
I think it's also true for Europe I
think the European economy is going to

5610
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:55,619
think the European economy is going to
 

5611
01:46:55,619 --> 01:46:57,890
think the European economy is going to
roll over

5612
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:57,900
roll over
 

5613
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,990
roll over
I think it's going I see a very hard

5614
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:00,000
I think it's going I see a very hard
 

5615
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,450
I think it's going I see a very hard
Landing for them which means that if the

5616
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:02,460
Landing for them which means that if the
 

5617
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:04,070
Landing for them which means that if the
economy slows down there's going to be

5618
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:04,080
economy slows down there's going to be
 

5619
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,410
economy slows down there's going to be
less need for energy

5620
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:06,420
less need for energy
 

5621
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,590
less need for energy
and so it starts to become a thing where

5622
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:09,600
and so it starts to become a thing where
 

5623
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,109
and so it starts to become a thing where
a negotiated settlement is actually the

5624
01:47:12,109 --> 01:47:12,119
a negotiated settlement is actually the
 

5625
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:14,330
a negotiated settlement is actually the
win-win for everybody

5626
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:14,340
win-win for everybody
 

5627
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,010
win-win for everybody
but none of this would be possible

5628
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:16,020
but none of this would be possible
 

5629
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:19,250
but none of this would be possible
without zero interest rates in a world

5630
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:19,260
without zero interest rates in a world
 

5631
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:20,750
without zero interest rates in a world
of zero interest rates we would be in

5632
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:20,760
of zero interest rates we would be in
 

5633
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:22,910
of zero interest rates we would be in
war

5634
01:47:22,910 --> 01:47:22,920
war
 

5635
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:26,450
war
so you believe in the financial forces

5636
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:26,460
so you believe in the financial forces
 

5637
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:29,510
so you believe in the financial forces
and pressures overpowering I believe in

5638
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:29,520
and pressures overpowering I believe in
 

5639
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,950
and pressures overpowering I believe in
the human lives

5640
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:30,960
the human lives
 

5641
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,169
the human lives
I really do believe in these even in in

5642
01:47:33,169 --> 01:47:33,179
I really do believe in these even in in
 

5643
01:47:33,179 --> 01:47:36,470
I really do believe in these even in in
international War more so there I think

5644
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:36,480
international War more so there I think
 

5645
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,689
international War more so there I think
the Invisible Hand and by the Invisible

5646
01:47:38,689 --> 01:47:38,699
the Invisible Hand and by the Invisible
 

5647
01:47:38,699 --> 01:47:40,010
the Invisible Hand and by the Invisible
Hand for the audience I think really

5648
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:40,020
Hand for the audience I think really
 

5649
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:42,169
Hand for the audience I think really
what it means is you know the the

5650
01:47:42,169 --> 01:47:42,179
what it means is you know the the
 

5651
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:44,629
what it means is you know the the
financial complex and really the Central

5652
01:47:44,629 --> 01:47:44,639
financial complex and really the Central
 

5653
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:47,149
financial complex and really the Central
Bank complex and the interplay between

5654
01:47:47,149 --> 01:47:47,159
Bank complex and the interplay between
 

5655
01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:49,790
Bank complex and the interplay between
fiscal and monetary policy

5656
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:49,800
fiscal and monetary policy
 

5657
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,010
fiscal and monetary policy
um is a very convoluted and complicated

5658
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:52,020
um is a very convoluted and complicated
 

5659
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:54,709
um is a very convoluted and complicated
set of things

5660
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:54,719
set of things
 

5661
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:58,010
set of things
but if we had zero interest rates

5662
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:58,020
but if we had zero interest rates
 

5663
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:00,890
but if we had zero interest rates
we would be probably in the middle of it

5664
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:00,900
we would be probably in the middle of it
 

5665
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:01,729
we would be probably in the middle of it
now

5666
01:48:01,729 --> 01:48:01,739
now
 

5667
01:48:01,739 --> 01:48:04,430
now
see there's a complexity to this game at

5668
01:48:04,430 --> 01:48:04,440
see there's a complexity to this game at
 

5669
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,770
see there's a complexity to this game at
the international

5670
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:05,780
the international
 

5671
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:09,310
the international
level where the nation some nations are

5672
01:48:09,310 --> 01:48:09,320
level where the nation some nations are
 

5673
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:12,050
level where the nation some nations are
authoritarian and are there's

5674
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:12,060
authoritarian and are there's
 

5675
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,990
authoritarian and are there's
significant corruption

5676
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:15,000
significant corruption
 

5677
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,930
significant corruption
and so that adds uh from a game

5678
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:17,940
and so that adds uh from a game
 

5679
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:20,030
and so that adds uh from a game
theoretic optimal perspective

5680
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:20,040
theoretic optimal perspective
 

5681
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,970
theoretic optimal perspective
you know the invisible hand has is

5682
01:48:22,970 --> 01:48:22,980
you know the invisible hand has is
 

5683
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:24,729
you know the invisible hand has is
operating in the mud

is Jerome Powell he is probably doing

5692
01:48:31,729 --> 01:48:31,739
is Jerome Powell he is probably doing
 

5693
01:48:31,739 --> 01:48:34,010
is Jerome Powell he is probably doing
more to prevent more than anybody else

more to prevent more than anybody else
 

5695

he keeps ratcheting rates it's just

01:48:35,990 --> 01:48:36,000
he keeps ratcheting rates it's just
 

5697
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,430
he keeps ratcheting rates it's just
impossible it's a mathematical

5703
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,850
unless there is such a cataclysmic moral
transgression by Russia so there is tail

5704
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:43,860

5705
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:45,649

where we say forget it all bets are off

where we say forget it all bets are off
 

5709
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:50,390
where we say forget it all bets are off
we're going back to zero rates issue a

5710
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:50,400
we're going back to zero rates issue a
 

5711
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,830
we're going back to zero rates issue a
hundred year bond we're going to finance

5712
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:51,840
hundred year bond we're going to finance
 

5713
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,030
hundred year bond we're going to finance
a war machine

5714
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:53,040
a war machine
 

5715
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,370
a war machine
there is a small risk of that but I

5716
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:55,380
there is a small risk of that but I
 

5717
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:57,050
there is a small risk of that but I
think the propensity of the majority of

5718
01:48:57,050 --> 01:48:57,060
think the propensity of the majority of
 

5719
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:58,370
think the propensity of the majority of
outcomes is more of a negotiated

5720
01:48:58,370 --> 01:48:58,380
outcomes is more of a negotiated
 

5721
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:00,890
outcomes is more of a negotiated
settlement so what about I mean if you

5722
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:00,900
settlement so what about I mean if you
 

5723
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:03,109
settlement so what about I mean if you
what's the motivation of Putin to invade

5724
01:49:03,109 --> 01:49:03,119
what's the motivation of Putin to invade
 

5725
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:06,169
what's the motivation of Putin to invade
Ukraine in the first place if Financial

5726
01:49:06,169 --> 01:49:06,179
Ukraine in the first place if Financial
 

5727
01:49:06,179 --> 01:49:09,530
Ukraine in the first place if Financial
forces are the most

forces are the most
 

5729
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,350
forces are the most
um the most powerful forces

5730
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:12,360
um the most powerful forces
 

5731
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:14,629
um the most powerful forces
why did it happen

5732
01:49:14,629 --> 01:49:14,639
why did it happen
 

5733
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,010
why did it happen
because it seems like there's other

5734
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:16,020
because it seems like there's other
 

5735
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:18,729
because it seems like there's other
forces at play of uh

5736
01:49:18,729 --> 01:49:18,739
forces at play of uh
 

5737
01:49:18,739 --> 01:49:21,649
forces at play of uh
maintaining superpower status on the

5738
01:49:21,649 --> 01:49:21,659
maintaining superpower status on the
 

5739
01:49:21,659 --> 01:49:24,590
maintaining superpower status on the
world stage yeah it seems like

5740
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:24,600
world stage yeah it seems like
 

5741
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,050
world stage yeah it seems like
geopolitics doesn't happen just

5742
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:27,060
geopolitics doesn't happen just
 

5743
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,750
geopolitics doesn't happen just
with the Invisible Hand in consideration

5744
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:29,760
with the Invisible Hand in consideration
 

5745
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,030
with the Invisible Hand in consideration
I agree with that I can't beg to know to

5746
01:49:32,030 --> 01:49:32,040
I agree with that I can't beg to know to
 

5747
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,770
I agree with that I can't beg to know to
be honest I don't know

5748
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:33,780
be honest I don't know
 

5749
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:34,910
be honest I don't know
um

5750
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:34,920
um
 

5751
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:37,010
um
but he did it

5752
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:37,020
but he did it
 

5753
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:39,950
but he did it
and I think it's easier for me

5754
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:39,960
and I think it's easier for me
 

5755
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:42,109
and I think it's easier for me
to guess the outcome from here it would

5756
01:49:42,109 --> 01:49:42,119
to guess the outcome from here it would
 

5757
01:49:42,119 --> 01:49:43,430
to guess the outcome from here it would
have been impossible for me to really

5758
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:43,440
have been impossible for me to really
 

5759
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,050
have been impossible for me to really
understand it is

5760
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:45,060
understand it is
 

5761
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:47,209
understand it is
what got him to this place

5762
01:49:47,209 --> 01:49:47,219
what got him to this place
 

5763
01:49:47,219 --> 01:49:49,430
what got him to this place
but it seems like there's an end game

5764
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:49,440
but it seems like there's an end game
 

5765
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:52,010
but it seems like there's an end game
here and there's

5766
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:52,020
here and there's
 

5767
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:54,410
here and there's
um there's not much playability

5768
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:54,420
um there's not much playability
 

5769
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:57,109
um there's not much playability
yeah I feel like I'm on a sturdy ground

5770
01:49:57,109 --> 01:49:57,119
yeah I feel like I'm on a sturdy ground
 

5771
01:49:57,119 --> 01:50:00,229
yeah I feel like I'm on a sturdy ground
because there's been so many experts at

5772
01:50:00,229 --> 01:50:00,239
because there's been so many experts at
 

5773
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:01,970
because there's been so many experts at
every stage of this that have been wrong

5774
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:01,980
every stage of this that have been wrong
 

5775
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:06,850
every stage of this that have been wrong
well there are no experts well on this

5776
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:06,860

 

5777
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:09,830

uh there are no experts Lex I understand

5778
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:09,840
uh there are no experts Lex I understand
 

5779
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,350
uh there are no experts Lex I understand
this well okay let's dig into that

5780
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:12,360
this well okay let's dig into that
 

5781
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:13,729
this well okay let's dig into that
because there's some because we just

5782
01:50:13,729 --> 01:50:13,739
because there's some because we just
 

5783
01:50:13,739 --> 01:50:16,129
because there's some because we just
said Phil helmuth is the um is the

5784
01:50:16,129 --> 01:50:16,139
said Phil helmuth is the um is the
 

5785
01:50:16,139 --> 01:50:17,689
said Phil helmuth is the um is the
greatest poker player of all time he has

5786
01:50:17,689 --> 01:50:17,699
greatest poker player of all time he has
 

5787
01:50:17,699 --> 01:50:20,990
greatest poker player of all time he has
an opinion yeah he doesn't he's so he

5788
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:21,000
an opinion yeah he doesn't he's so he
 

5789
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,990
an opinion yeah he doesn't he's so he
would be mistaken hey poker Phil has an

5790
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:24,000
would be mistaken hey poker Phil has an
 

5791
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,729
would be mistaken hey poker Phil has an
opinion Ivy has an opinion as well on

5792
01:50:25,729 --> 01:50:25,739
opinion Ivy has an opinion as well on
 

5793
01:50:25,739 --> 01:50:27,290
opinion Ivy has an opinion as well on
how to play all these games

5794
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:27,300
how to play all these games
 

5795
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:28,970
how to play all these games
meaning an opinion means here's the

5796
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:28,980
meaning an opinion means here's the
 

5797
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:30,709
meaning an opinion means here's the
lines I take here are the decisions I

5798
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:30,719
lines I take here are the decisions I
 

5799
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:31,370

I live and die by those and if I'm right

5802
01:50:33,229 --> 01:50:33,239
I live and die by those and if I'm right
 

5803
01:50:33,239 --> 01:50:36,590
I live and die by those and if I'm right
I win if I'm wrong I lose I've made more

5804
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:36,600
I win if I'm wrong I lose I've made more
 

5805
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,450
I win if I'm wrong I lose I've made more
mistakes than my opponent

5806
01:50:38,450 --> 01:50:38,460
mistakes than my opponent
 

5807
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:41,149
mistakes than my opponent
I thought you said there's an optimal

5808
01:50:41,149 --> 01:50:41,159
I thought you said there's an optimal
 

5809
01:50:41,159 --> 01:50:43,310
I thought you said there's an optimal
so aren't there people that have a

5810
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:43,320
so aren't there people that have a
 

5811
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,229
so aren't there people that have a
deeper understand

5812
01:50:45,229 --> 01:50:45,239
deeper understand
 

5813
01:50:45,239 --> 01:50:47,390
deeper understand
a higher likelihood of being able to

5814
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:47,400
a higher likelihood of being able to
 

5815
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:49,669
a higher likelihood of being able to
describe and know the optimal the

5816
01:50:49,669 --> 01:50:49,679
describe and know the optimal the
 

5817
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,770
describe and know the optimal the
optimal set of actions here at every

5818
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:51,780
optimal set of actions here at every
 

5819
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:54,890
optimal set of actions here at every
layer well they're they're they're being

5820
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:54,900
layer well they're they're they're being
 

5821
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:57,050
layer well they're they're they're being
theoretically set of optimal decisions

5822
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:57,060
theoretically set of optimal decisions
 

5823
01:50:57,060 --> 01:51:00,290
theoretically set of optimal decisions
but you can't play your life

5824
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:00,300
but you can't play your life
 

5825
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:01,729
but you can't play your life
um

5826
01:51:01,729 --> 01:51:01,739
um
 

5827
01:51:01,739 --> 01:51:04,010
um
against a computer like meaning the

5828
01:51:04,010 --> 01:51:04,020
against a computer like meaning the
 

5829
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,050
against a computer like meaning the
minute that you face an opponent and

5830
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:06,060
minute that you face an opponent and
 

5831
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:07,910
minute that you face an opponent and
that person takes you off that optimal

5832
01:51:07,910 --> 01:51:07,920
that person takes you off that optimal
 

5833
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,250
that person takes you off that optimal
path you have to adjust yeah

5834
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:10,260
path you have to adjust yeah
 

5835
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:14,149
path you have to adjust yeah
like what happens if a tactical nuke

5836
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:14,159
like what happens if a tactical nuke
 

5837
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,129
like what happens if a tactical nuke
it would be really bad

5838
01:51:16,129 --> 01:51:16,139
it would be really bad
 

5839
01:51:16,139 --> 01:51:17,270
it would be really bad
um

5840
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:17,280
um
 

5841
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,790
um
I think the world is resilient enough I

5842
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:19,800
I think the world is resilient enough I
 

5843
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:21,050
I think the world is resilient enough I
think the ukrainians are resilient

5844
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:21,060
think the ukrainians are resilient
 

5845
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:22,970
think the ukrainians are resilient
enough to overcome it it would be really

5846
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:22,980
enough to overcome it it would be really
 

5847
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:25,010
enough to overcome it it would be really
bad it's just an it's an incredibly sad

5848
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:25,020
bad it's just an it's an incredibly sad
 

5849
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:27,169
bad it's just an it's an incredibly sad
moment in human history but do you

5850
01:51:27,169 --> 01:51:27,179
moment in human history but do you
 

5851
01:51:27,179 --> 01:51:29,090
moment in human history but do you
wonder what U.S does

5852
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:29,100
wonder what U.S does
 

5853
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:30,950
wonder what U.S does
is there any understanding do you think

5854
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:30,960
is there any understanding do you think
 

5855
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,649
is there any understanding do you think
people inside the United States

5856
01:51:33,649 --> 01:51:33,659
people inside the United States
 

5857
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:35,990
people inside the United States
understand not not the regular citizens

5858
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:36,000
understand not not the regular citizens
 

5859
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,330
understand not not the regular citizens
but people in the military do you think

5860
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:38,340
but people in the military do you think
 

5861
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:39,830
but people in the military do you think
Joe Biden understands do you think I

5862
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:39,840
Joe Biden understands do you think I
 

5863
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,750
Joe Biden understands do you think I
think Joe Biden does understand I think

5864
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:41,760
think Joe Biden does understand I think
 

5865
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,390
think Joe Biden does understand I think
that I think they have a clear plan I

5866
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:44,400
that I think they have a clear plan I
 

5867
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,270
that I think they have a clear plan I
think that there are

5868
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:46,280
think that there are
 

5869
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:49,669
think that there are
few reasons to let the gerontocracy rule

5870
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:49,679
few reasons to let the gerontocracy rule
 

5871
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:51,109
few reasons to let the gerontocracy rule
but this is one of the reasons where I

5872
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:51,119
but this is one of the reasons where I
 

5873
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:52,729
but this is one of the reasons where I
think they are better Adept than other

5874
01:51:52,729 --> 01:51:52,739
think they are better Adept than other
 

5875
01:51:52,739 --> 01:51:54,410
think they are better Adept than other
people

5876
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:54,420
people
 

5877
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:55,790
people
um you know folks that were around

5878
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:55,800
um you know folks that were around
 

5879
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,890
um you know folks that were around
during the Bay of Pigs folks that

5880
01:51:57,890 --> 01:51:57,900
during the Bay of Pigs folks that
 

5881
01:51:57,900 --> 01:52:00,470
during the Bay of Pigs folks that
hopefully have studied that and studied

5882
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:00,480
hopefully have studied that and studied
 

5883
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:03,109
hopefully have studied that and studied
you know nuclear de-escalation

5884
01:52:03,109 --> 01:52:03,119
you know nuclear de-escalation
 

5885
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:04,970
you know nuclear de-escalation
we'll have a better Playbook than I do

5886
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:04,980
we'll have a better Playbook than I do
 

5887
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:07,609
we'll have a better Playbook than I do
my suspicion

5888
01:52:07,609 --> 01:52:07,619
my suspicion
 

5889
01:52:07,619 --> 01:52:09,109
my suspicion
is that

5890
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:09,119
is that
 

5891
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:11,030
is that

jobs that have good families you know
I've this like idyllic sense like

6092
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:14,580
I've this like idyllic sense like
 

6093
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:16,609
I've this like idyllic sense like
I see it on Tick Tock all the time so I

6094
01:56:16,609 --> 01:56:16,619
I see it on Tick Tock all the time so I
 

6095
01:56:16,619 --> 01:56:19,010
I see it on Tick Tock all the time so I
know it exists these neighborhoods where

6096
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:19,020
know it exists these neighborhoods where
 

6097
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:20,930
know it exists these neighborhoods where
there's like a cul-de-sac and these

6098
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:20,940
there's like a cul-de-sac and these
 

6099
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,550
there's like a cul-de-sac and these
beautiful homes and these kids are

6100
01:56:22,550 --> 01:56:22,560
beautiful homes and these kids are
 

6101
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:24,050
beautiful homes and these kids are
biking around

6102
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:24,060
biking around
 

6103
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:26,270
biking around
and every time I see that Lex I

6104
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:26,280
and every time I see that Lex I
 

6105
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:29,270
and every time I see that Lex I
immediately flash back to what I didn't

6106
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:29,280
immediately flash back to what I didn't
 

6107
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,169
immediately flash back to what I didn't
have

6108
01:56:30,169 --> 01:56:30,179
have
 

6109
01:56:30,179 --> 01:56:33,050
have
and I think that's success look at how

6110
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:33,060
and I think that's success look at how
 

6111
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:36,050
and I think that's success look at how
happy those kids are so no you there is

6112
01:56:36,050 --> 01:56:36,060
happy those kids are so no you there is
 

6113
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:38,450
happy those kids are so no you there is
no one definition and so if people are

6114
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:38,460
no one definition and so if people are
 

6115
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:40,790
no one definition and so if people are
starting out to try to make a million

6116
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:40,800
starting out to try to make a million
 

6117
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,470
starting out to try to make a million
dollars 100 million dollars a billion

6118
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:42,480
dollars 100 million dollars a billion
 

6119
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,149
dollars 100 million dollars a billion
dollars you're gonna fail

6120
01:56:44,149 --> 01:56:44,159
dollars you're gonna fail
 

6121
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:46,729
dollars you're gonna fail
there's a definition of personal success

6122
01:56:46,729 --> 01:56:46,739
there's a definition of personal success
 

6123
01:56:46,739 --> 01:56:50,390
there's a definition of personal success
but is there's also some level of um

6124
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:50,400
but is there's also some level of um
 

6125
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,129
but is there's also some level of um
that's different from person to person

6126
01:56:52,129 --> 01:56:52,139
that's different from person to person
 

6127
01:56:52,139 --> 01:56:55,629
that's different from person to person
but there's also some level of

6128
01:56:55,629 --> 01:56:55,639
but there's also some level of
 

6129
01:56:55,639 --> 01:56:59,330
but there's also some level of
the responsibility you have if there's a

6130
01:56:59,330 --> 01:56:59,340
the responsibility you have if there's a
 

6131
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:00,950
the responsibility you have if there's a
mission to have a positive impact on the

6132
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:00,960
mission to have a positive impact on the
 

6133
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,950
mission to have a positive impact on the
world so I'm not sure that Elon is happy

6134
01:57:03,950 --> 01:57:03,960
world so I'm not sure that Elon is happy
 

6135
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,149
world so I'm not sure that Elon is happy
no

6136
01:57:05,149 --> 01:57:05,159
no
 

6137
01:57:05,159 --> 01:57:07,070
no
in fact I think if you focus on trying

6138
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:07,080
in fact I think if you focus on trying
 

6139
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:08,629
in fact I think if you focus on trying
to have an impact on the world I think

6140
01:57:08,629 --> 01:57:08,639
to have an impact on the world I think
 

6141
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:10,430
to have an impact on the world I think
you're going to end up deeply unhappy

6142
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:10,440
you're going to end up deeply unhappy
 

6143
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,169
you're going to end up deeply unhappy
but does that matter

6144
01:57:12,169 --> 01:57:12,179
but does that matter
 

6145
01:57:12,179 --> 01:57:15,169
but does that matter
like what may happen what happens it may

6146
01:57:15,169 --> 01:57:15,179
like what may happen what happens it may
 

6147
01:57:15,179 --> 01:57:17,390
like what may happen what happens it may
happen as a byproduct

6148
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:17,400
happen as a byproduct
 

6149
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:19,310
happen as a byproduct
but I think that you should strive to

6150
01:57:19,310 --> 01:57:19,320
but I think that you should strive to
 

6151
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:21,169
but I think that you should strive to
find your own personal happiness and

6152
01:57:21,169 --> 01:57:21,179
find your own personal happiness and
 

6153
01:57:21,179 --> 01:57:22,310
find your own personal happiness and
then measure

6154
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:22,320
then measure
 

6155
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:25,070
then measure
how that manifests as it relates to

6156
01:57:25,070 --> 01:57:25,080
how that manifests as it relates to
 

6157
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,830
how that manifests as it relates to
society and to other people but if the

6158
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:27,840
society and to other people but if the
 

6159
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:30,290
society and to other people but if the
answer to those questions is zero that

6160
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:30,300
answer to those questions is zero that
 

6161
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:32,510
answer to those questions is zero that
doesn't make you less of a person no 100

6162
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:32,520
doesn't make you less of a person no 100
 

6163
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:35,030
doesn't make you less of a person no 100
but then the other way is there are

6164
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:35,040
but then the other way is there are
 

6165
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,589
but then the other way is there are
times when you need to sacrifice your

6166
01:57:36,589 --> 01:57:36,599
times when you need to sacrifice your
 

6167
01:57:36,599 --> 01:57:38,649
times when you need to sacrifice your
own personal happiness

6168
01:57:38,649 --> 01:57:38,659
own personal happiness
 

6169
01:57:38,659 --> 01:57:41,510
own personal happiness
Force for a bigger thing for that you've

Force for a bigger thing for that you've
 

6171
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,310
Force for a bigger thing for that you've
created yeah if you're if you're in a

6172
01:57:43,310 --> 01:57:43,320
created yeah if you're if you're in a
 

6173

created yeah if you're if you're in a
position to do it I think some folks are

6174
01:57:45,950 --> 01:57:45,960
position to do it I think some folks are
 

6175
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:47,930
position to do it I think some folks are
tested Elon is probably the best example

why do you think there's so few elons

6244
01:59:07,729 --> 01:59:07,739
why do you think there's so few elons
 

6245
01:59:07,739 --> 01:59:09,950
why do you think there's so few elons
it's an extremely

6246
01:59:09,950 --> 01:59:09,960
it's an extremely
 

6247
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:12,770
it's an extremely
lonely set of trade-offs

6248
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:12,780
lonely set of trade-offs
 

6249
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:16,129
lonely set of trade-offs
because to your point if you get tested

6250
01:59:16,129 --> 01:59:16,139
because to your point if you get tested
 

6251
01:59:16,139 --> 01:59:17,750
because to your point if you get tested
so if you think about it again

6252
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:17,760
so if you think about it again
 

6253
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,609
so if you think about it again
probabilistically there's eight billion

6254
01:59:19,609 --> 01:59:19,619
probabilistically there's eight billion
 

6255
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:22,669
probabilistically there's eight billion
people in the world maybe 50 of them get

6256
01:59:22,669 --> 01:59:22,679
people in the world maybe 50 of them get
 

6257
01:59:22,679 --> 01:59:24,050
people in the world maybe 50 of them get
put in a position where they are

6258
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:24,060
put in a position where they are
 

6259
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:25,970
put in a position where they are
building something of such colossal

6260
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:25,980
building something of such colossal
 

6261
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:28,070
building something of such colossal
importance that they even have this

6262
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:28,080
importance that they even have this
 

6263
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,089
importance that they even have this
choice

6264
01:59:29,089 --> 01:59:29,099
choice
 

6265
01:59:29,099 --> 01:59:32,629
choice
and then of that 50 maybe 10 of them are

6266
01:59:32,629 --> 01:59:32,639
and then of that 50 maybe 10 of them are
 

6267
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:34,669
and then of that 50 maybe 10 of them are
put in a moment where they actually have

6268
01:59:34,669 --> 01:59:34,679
put in a moment where they actually have
 

6269
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:36,229
put in a moment where they actually have
to make a trade-off

6270
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:36,239
to make a trade-off

those boundary conditions
you know and really grind it out

6366
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:07,560
you know and really grind it out
 

6367
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,410
you know and really grind it out
it's just very few people in the end

6368
02:01:09,410 --> 02:01:09,420
it's just very few people in the end
 

6369

that
 

6371
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,430
that
um will have the resiliency to stick it

6372
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:13,440

just a really hard set of boundary

6380
02:01:22,669 --> 02:01:22,679
just a really hard set of boundary
 

6381
02:01:22,679 --> 02:01:24,290
just a really hard set of boundary

I mean to to linger on the
 

6457
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:52,310

the trade-offs the complicated

6458
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:52,320
the trade-offs the complicated
 

6459
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,109
the trade-offs the complicated
trade-offs with all this

6460
02:02:54,109 --> 02:02:54,119
trade-offs with all this
 

6461
02:02:54,119 --> 02:02:56,689
trade-offs with all this
uh what's your take on work-life balance

6462
02:02:56,689 --> 02:02:56,699
uh what's your take on work-life balance
 

6463
02:02:56,699 --> 02:02:59,510
uh what's your take on work-life balance
in uh in a in a company that's trying to

6464
02:02:59,510 --> 02:02:59,520
in uh in a in a company that's trying to
 

6465
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,129
in uh in a in a company that's trying to
do

6466
02:03:01,129 --> 02:03:01,139
do
 

6467
02:03:01,139 --> 02:03:03,530
do
big things

6468
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:03,540
big things
 

6469
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:06,290
big things
I think that you have to have

6470
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:06,300
I think that you have to have
 

6471
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:10,370
I think that you have to have
some very very strict boundaries

6472
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:10,380
some very very strict boundaries
 

6473
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:12,770
some very very strict boundaries
but otherwise I think balance is kind of

6474
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:12,780
but otherwise I think balance is kind of
 

6475
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:14,510
but otherwise I think balance is kind of
dumb

6476
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:14,520
dumb
 

6477
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,850
dumb
it will make you Limited

6478
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:16,860
it will make you Limited
 

6479
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:18,589
it will make you Limited
I think you need to immerse yourself in

6480
02:03:18,589 --> 02:03:18,599
I think you need to immerse yourself in
 

6481
02:03:18,599 --> 02:03:19,430
I think you need to immerse yourself in
the problem

6482
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:19,440
the problem
 

6483
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,109
the problem
but you need to Define that immersion

6484
02:03:21,109 --> 02:03:21,119
but you need to Define that immersion
 

6485
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:22,310
but you need to Define that immersion
with boundaries

6486
02:03:22,310 --> 02:03:22,320
with boundaries
 

6487
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:24,350
with boundaries
so if you you know if you ask me like

6488
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:24,360
so if you you know if you ask me like
 

6489
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:26,149
so if you you know if you ask me like
you know what does like my process look

6490
02:03:26,149 --> 02:03:26,159
you know what does like my process look
 

6491
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:27,290
you know what does like my process look
like

6492
02:03:27,290 --> 02:03:27,300
like
 

6493
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:30,470
like
it's monotonous and regimented but it's

6494
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:30,480
it's monotonous and regimented but it's
 

6495
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:33,830
it's monotonous and regimented but it's
all the time except when it's not and

6496
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:33,840
all the time except when it's not and
 

6497
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:37,550
all the time except when it's not and
that's also monotonous and regimented

6498
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:37,560
that's also monotonous and regimented
 

6499
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:38,450
that's also monotonous and regimented
um

6500
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:38,460
um
 

6501
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:40,550
um
and I think that makes me very good at

6502
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:40,560
and I think that makes me very good at
 

6503
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,109
and I think that makes me very good at
my craft

6504
02:03:42,109 --> 02:03:42,119
my craft
 

6505
02:03:42,119 --> 02:03:44,930
my craft
because it gives me what I need

6506
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:44,940
because it gives me what I need
 

6507
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:47,990
because it gives me what I need
to stay connected to the problem without

6508
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:48,000
to stay connected to the problem without
 

6509
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,870
to stay connected to the problem without
feeling resentful about the problem

6510
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:49,880
feeling resentful about the problem
 

6511
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:54,169
feeling resentful about the problem
which part the monotonous all in nature

6512
02:03:54,169 --> 02:03:54,179
which part the monotonous all in nature
 

6513
02:03:54,179 --> 02:03:57,350
which part the monotonous all in nature

of it or the the when you say hard
 

6515
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,870

boundaries essentially

6516
02:03:59,870 --> 02:03:59,880
boundaries essentially
 

6517
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:03,530
boundaries essentially
go all out until you stop and you don't

they've compounded you know at above 30

6582
02:05:18,890 --> 02:05:18,900
they've compounded you know at above 30
 

6583

as have I
 

6587
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:27,229
as have I
but now I feel like I really need to let

6588
02:05:27,229 --> 02:05:27,239
but now I feel like I really need to let
 

6589
02:05:27,239 --> 02:05:30,169
but now I feel like I really need to let
go because I think I know how to do the

6590
02:05:30,169 --> 02:05:30,179
go because I think I know how to do the

basics of my job
and if I had to summarize like an

6594
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:34,800
and if I had to summarize like an
 

6595
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,950
and if I had to summarize like an
investing challenge or investing I think

6596
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:36,960
investing challenge or investing I think
 

6597
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,510
investing challenge or investing I think
really it's you know when you first

6598
02:05:38,510 --> 02:05:38,520
really it's you know when you first
 

6599
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,910
really it's you know when you first
start out investing you're a momentum

6600
02:05:40,910 --> 02:05:40,920
start out investing you're a momentum
 

6601
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:42,950
start out investing you're a momentum
person you saw it in GameStop just a

6602
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:42,960
person you saw it in GameStop just a
 

6603
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:45,649
person you saw it in GameStop just a
bunch of people aping each other

6604
02:05:45,649 --> 02:05:45,659
bunch of people aping each other
 

6605
02:05:45,659 --> 02:05:48,050
bunch of people aping each other
and then it goes from momentum

6606
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:48,060
and then it goes from momentum
 

6607
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:50,689
and then it goes from momentum
to you start to think about cash flows

6608
02:05:50,689 --> 02:05:50,699
to you start to think about cash flows
 

6609
02:05:50,699 --> 02:05:52,129
to you start to think about cash flows
you know how much profit is this person

6610
02:05:52,129 --> 02:05:52,139
you know how much profit is this person
 

6611
02:05:52,139 --> 02:05:53,510
you know how much profit is this person
going to make whatever so that's like

6612
02:05:53,510 --> 02:05:53,520
going to make whatever so that's like
 

6613
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:56,390
going to make whatever so that's like
the evolution you know this is the this

6614
02:05:56,390 --> 02:05:56,400
the evolution you know this is the this
 

6615
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:59,270
the evolution you know this is the this
is the basic thing to this is a

6616
02:05:59,270 --> 02:05:59,280
is the basic thing to this is a
 

6617
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:01,850
is the basic thing to this is a
reasonably sophisticated way then a much

6618
02:06:01,850 --> 02:06:01,860
reasonably sophisticated way then a much
 

6619
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:03,530
reasonably sophisticated way then a much
smaller group of people think about it

6620
02:06:03,530 --> 02:06:03,540
smaller group of people think about it
 

6621
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:06,169
smaller group of people think about it
in terms of macro geopolitics

6622
02:06:06,169 --> 02:06:06,179
in terms of macro geopolitics
 

6623
02:06:06,179 --> 02:06:08,810
in terms of macro geopolitics
but then a very finite few cracked this

6624
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:08,820
but then a very finite few cracked this
 

6625
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:10,430
but then a very finite few cracked this
special code which is there's a

6626
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:10,440
special code which is there's a
 

6627
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,890
special code which is there's a
philosophy and it's the philosophy that

6628
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:12,900
philosophy and it's the philosophy that
 

6629
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:15,350
philosophy and it's the philosophy that
creates the system

6630
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:15,360
creates the system
 

6631
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:18,470
creates the system
and I'm scratching at that furiously but

6632
02:06:18,470 --> 02:06:18,480
and I'm scratching at that furiously but
 

6633
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:20,030
and I'm scratching at that furiously but
I cannot break through and I haven't

6634
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:20,040
I cannot break through and I haven't
 

6635
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:21,709
I cannot break through and I haven't
broken through and I know that in order

6636
02:06:21,709 --> 02:06:21,719
broken through and I know that in order
 

6637
02:06:21,719 --> 02:06:24,109
broken through and I know that in order
to break through I gotta let go

6638
02:06:24,109 --> 02:06:24,119
to break through I gotta let go
 

6639
02:06:24,119 --> 02:06:26,689
to break through I gotta let go
so this is the journey that I'm in as in

6640
02:06:26,689 --> 02:06:26,699
so this is the journey that I'm in as in
 

6641
02:06:26,699 --> 02:06:28,729
so this is the journey that I'm in as in
my in my professional life

02:13:02,820 --> 02:13:05,450
it's very rare that we all have
something really important to say

6994
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:05,460
something really important to say
 

6995
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:08,930
something really important to say
and so the ritual that is becomes really

6996
02:13:08,930 --> 02:13:08,940
and so the ritual that is becomes really
 

6997
02:13:08,940 --> 02:13:10,850
and so the ritual that is becomes really
valuable to get scale

6998
02:13:10,850 --> 02:13:10,860
valuable to get scale
 

6999
02:13:10,860 --> 02:13:12,890
valuable to get scale
is not the ritual of meetings but the

7000
02:13:12,890 --> 02:13:12,900
is not the ritual of meetings but the
 

7001
02:13:12,900 --> 02:13:14,930
is not the ritual of meetings but the
ritual of respecting the collective time

7002
02:13:14,930 --> 02:13:14,940
ritual of respecting the collective time
 

7003
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:17,270
ritual of respecting the collective time
of the unit

7004
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:17,280
of the unit
 

7005
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:19,250
of the unit
and so it's like you know what folks I'm

7006
02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:19,260
and so it's like you know what folks I'm
 

7007
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:20,810
and so it's like you know what folks I'm
going to assume that you guys are also

7008
02:13:20,810 --> 02:13:20,820
going to assume that you guys are also
 

7009
02:13:20,820 --> 02:13:23,089
going to assume that you guys are also
tackling really important projects you

7010
02:13:23,089 --> 02:13:23,099
tackling really important projects you
 

7011
02:13:23,099 --> 02:13:24,649
tackling really important projects you
also want to have good boundaries in

7012
02:13:24,649 --> 02:13:24,659

7023
02:13:33,179 --> 02:13:35,870
work this painting didn't need to be 30
minutes it could be five and the rest of

7024
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:35,880
minutes it could be five and the rest of
 

7025

because when people join that system at

7028

because when people join that system at
Social Capital they just

7035
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:48,890
make sure and let me talk a lot so I
can't say anything I respect the person

7036
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:48,900
can't say anything I respect the person
 

7037
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:50,450
can't say anything I respect the person
that says nothing for two years and the

7038
02:13:50,450 --> 02:13:50,460
that says nothing for two years and the
 

7039
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:52,010
that says nothing for two years and the
first thing that they say is not obvious

7040
02:13:52,010 --> 02:13:52,020
first thing that they say is not obvious
 

7041
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:54,109
first thing that they say is not obvious
that person is immensely more valuable

7042
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:54,119
that person is immensely more valuable
 

7043
02:13:54,119 --> 02:13:55,310
that person is immensely more valuable
than the person that tries to talk all

7044
02:13:55,310 --> 02:13:55,320
than the person that tries to talk all
 

7045
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:56,270
than the person that tries to talk all
the time

7046
02:13:56,270 --> 02:13:56,280
the time
 

7047
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:58,490
the time
what have you learned from your um so

7048
02:13:58,490 --> 02:13:58,500
what have you learned from your um so
 

7049

what have you learned from your um so
after Facebook you started social

after Facebook you started social

Social Capital what have you learned
from all the successful investing you've

7056
02:14:07,069 --> 02:14:07,079
from all the successful investing you've
 

7057
02:14:07,079 --> 02:14:09,050
from all the successful investing you've
done there

7058
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:09,060
done there
 

7059
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:12,530
done there
about investing or about life yeah or

7060
02:14:12,530 --> 02:14:12,540
about investing or about life yeah or
 

7061
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:15,169
about investing or about life yeah or
about running a team if I'm very loath

7062
02:14:15,169 --> 02:14:15,179
about running a team if I'm very loath
 

7063
02:14:15,179 --> 02:14:17,030
about running a team if I'm very loath
to give advice because I think it so

7064
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:17,040
to give advice because I think it so
 

7065
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:19,250
to give advice because I think it so
much of it is situational but my

7066
02:14:19,250 --> 02:14:19,260
much of it is situational but my
 

7067
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:20,930
much of it is situational but my
observation is that starting a business

7068
02:14:20,930 --> 02:14:20,940
observation is that starting a business
 

7069
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:23,629
observation is that starting a business
is really hard any kind of business

7070
02:14:23,629 --> 02:14:23,639
is really hard any kind of business
 

7071
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:26,030
is really hard any kind of business
and most people don't know what they're

7072
02:14:26,030 --> 02:14:26,040
and most people don't know what they're
 

7073
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:26,930
and most people don't know what they're
doing

7074
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:26,940
doing
 

7075
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:29,750
doing
and as a result we make enormous

7076
02:14:29,750 --> 02:14:29,760
and as a result we make enormous
 

7077
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:30,950
and as a result we make enormous
mistakes

7078
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:30,960
mistakes
 

7079
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:33,229
mistakes
but I would summarize this and this may

7080
02:14:33,229 --> 02:14:33,239
but I would summarize this and this may
 

7081
02:14:33,239 --> 02:14:35,450
but I would summarize this and this may
be a little heterodoxical I think there

7082
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:35,460
be a little heterodoxical I think there
 

7083
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:37,250
be a little heterodoxical I think there
are only three kinds of mistakes because

7084
02:14:37,250 --> 02:14:37,260
are only three kinds of mistakes because
 

7085
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:38,870
are only three kinds of mistakes because
if we go back to what we said before in

7086
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:38,880
if we go back to what we said before in
 

7087
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,010
if we go back to what we said before in
the business

7088
02:14:40,010 --> 02:14:40,020
the business
 

7089
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:42,589
the business
it's just learning you're exploring the

7090
02:14:42,589 --> 02:14:42,599
it's just learning you're exploring the
 

7091
02:14:42,599 --> 02:14:44,450
it's just learning you're exploring the
dark space to get to the answer faster

7092
02:14:44,450 --> 02:14:44,460
dark space to get to the answer faster
 

7093
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:45,950
dark space to get to the answer faster
than other people

7094
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:45,960
than other people
 

7095
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:48,649
than other people
and those the mistakes that you make are

7096
02:14:48,649 --> 02:14:48,659
and those the mistakes that you make are
 

7097
02:14:48,659 --> 02:14:50,390
and those the mistakes that you make are
three

7098
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:50,400
three
 

7099
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,250
three
or the three kinds of decisions let's

7100
02:14:52,250 --> 02:14:52,260
or the three kinds of decisions let's
 

7101
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,030
or the three kinds of decisions let's
say

7102
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:53,040
say
 

7103
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:55,189
say
you'll hire somebody

7104
02:14:55,189 --> 02:14:55,199
you'll hire somebody
 

7105
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:57,350
you'll hire somebody
and

7106
02:14:57,350 --> 02:14:57,360
and
 

7107
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:00,890
and
they're really really really average but

7108
02:15:00,890 --> 02:15:00,900
they're really really really average but
 

7109
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:02,629
they're really really really average but
they're a really good person

7110
02:15:02,629 --> 02:15:02,639
they're a really good person
 

7111
02:15:02,639 --> 02:15:04,010
they're a really good person
oh yeah

7112
02:15:04,010 --> 02:15:04,020
oh yeah
 

7113
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:06,649
oh yeah
you'll hire somebody

7114
02:15:06,649 --> 02:15:06,659
you'll hire somebody
 

7115
02:15:06,659 --> 02:15:09,290
you'll hire somebody
and they really weren't candid with who

7116
02:15:09,290 --> 02:15:09,300
and they really weren't candid with who
 

7117
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:12,530
and they really weren't candid with who
they are and their real personality and

7118
02:15:12,530 --> 02:15:12,540
they are and their real personality and
 

7119
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:14,149
they are and their real personality and
their morality and their ethics only

7120
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:14,159
their morality and their ethics only
 

7121
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:15,649
their morality and their ethics only
expose them

7122
02:15:15,649 --> 02:15:15,659
expose them
 

7123
02:15:15,659 --> 02:15:18,589
expose them
over a long period of time

7124
02:15:18,589 --> 02:15:18,599
over a long period of time
 

7125
02:15:18,599 --> 02:15:21,189
over a long period of time
and then you hire somebody

7126
02:15:21,189 --> 02:15:21,199
and then you hire somebody
 

7127
02:15:21,199 --> 02:15:25,729
and then you hire somebody
and uh they're not that good

7128
02:15:25,729 --> 02:15:25,739
and uh they're not that good
 

7129
02:15:25,739 --> 02:15:30,109
and uh they're not that good
uh morally but they're highly performant

7130
02:15:30,109 --> 02:15:30,119
uh morally but they're highly performant
 

7131
02:15:30,119 --> 02:15:33,229
uh morally but they're highly performant
what do you do with those three things

7132
02:15:33,229 --> 02:15:33,239
what do you do with those three things
 

7133
02:15:33,239 --> 02:15:35,870
what do you do with those three things
and I think successful companies

7134
02:15:35,870 --> 02:15:35,880
and I think successful companies
 

7135
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:39,649
and I think successful companies
have figured out how to answer those

7136
02:15:39,649 --> 02:15:39,659
have figured out how to answer those
 

7137
02:15:39,659 --> 02:15:41,810
have figured out how to answer those
three things because those are the

7138
02:15:41,810 --> 02:15:41,820
three things because those are the
 

7139
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:43,189
three things because those are the
things

7140
02:15:43,189 --> 02:15:43,199
things
 

7141
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:45,649
things
that in my opinion determine success and

7142
02:15:45,649 --> 02:15:45,659
that in my opinion determine success and
 

7143
02:15:45,659 --> 02:15:47,629
that in my opinion determine success and
failure so it's basically hiring and you

7144
02:15:47,629 --> 02:15:47,639
failure so it's basically hiring and you
 

7145
02:15:47,639 --> 02:15:50,629
failure so it's basically hiring and you
just identified three failure cases for

7146
02:15:50,629 --> 02:15:50,639
just identified three failure cases for
 

7147
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:52,490
just identified three failure cases for
hiring but very different failure cases

7148
02:15:52,490 --> 02:15:52,500
hiring but very different failure cases
 

7149
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:54,229
hiring but very different failure cases
and very complicated ones right like the

7150
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:54,239
and very complicated ones right like the
 

7151
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:56,689
and very complicated ones right like the
highly performant person who's not that

and they can be managed as long as they
 

7309
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:06,410
and they can be managed as long as they
are one to two degrees away from one of

7310
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:06,420
are one to two degrees away from one of
 

7311
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:07,490
are one to two degrees away from one of
those people that you just mentioned

7312
02:19:07,490 --> 02:19:07,500
those people that you just mentioned
 

7313
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:10,969
those people that you just mentioned
yeah yeah because it's easy then to drag

7314
02:19:10,969 --> 02:19:10,979
yeah yeah because it's easy then to drag
 

7315
02:19:10,979 --> 02:19:13,910
yeah yeah because it's easy then to drag
the entire company down if they're too

7316
02:19:13,910 --> 02:19:13,920
the entire company down if they're too
 

7317
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:15,950
the entire company down if they're too
far away from the LeBron James because

7318
02:19:15,950 --> 02:19:15,960
far away from the LeBron James because
 

7319
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,570
far away from the LeBron James because
you don't know what LeBron James looks

7320
02:19:17,570 --> 02:19:17,580
you don't know what LeBron James looks
 

7321
02:19:17,580 --> 02:19:20,150
you don't know what LeBron James looks
and feels and smells and you know so you

7322
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:20,160
and feels and smells and you know so you
 

7323
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:21,889
and feels and smells and you know so you
need that tactile sense of what

7324
02:19:21,889 --> 02:19:21,899
need that tactile sense of what
 

7325
02:19:21,899 --> 02:19:24,290
need that tactile sense of what
Excellence looks like in front of you

7326

Excellence looks like in front of you
 

7327

Excellence looks like in front of you
a great example is if you like if you

7328
02:19:26,030 --> 02:19:26,040
a great example is if you like if you
 

7329
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:27,410
a great example is if you like if you
just go on YouTube and you search these

7330
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:27,420
just go on YouTube and you search these
 

7331
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:29,270
just go on YouTube and you search these
clips of how Kobe Bryant's teammates

7332
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:29,280
clips of how Kobe Bryant's teammates
 

7333
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:33,469
clips of how Kobe Bryant's teammates
described not Kobe but how their own

described not Kobe but how their own
 

7335
02:19:33,479 --> 02:19:35,209
described not Kobe but how their own
behavior

7336
02:19:35,209 --> 02:19:35,219
behavior
 

7337
02:19:35,219 --> 02:19:37,490
behavior
not performance because there's a bunch

7338
02:19:37,490 --> 02:19:37,500
not performance because there's a bunch
 

7339
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:38,990
not performance because there's a bunch
of average people that Kobe played with

7340
02:19:38,990 --> 02:19:39,000
of average people that Kobe played with
 

7341
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,629
of average people that Kobe played with
this whole career but their behavior

7342
02:19:41,629 --> 02:19:41,639
this whole career but their behavior
 

7343
02:19:41,639 --> 02:19:43,429
this whole career but their behavior
changed

7344
02:19:43,429 --> 02:19:43,439
changed
 

7345
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:46,730
changed
by being somewhat closer to him and I

7346
02:19:46,730 --> 02:19:46,740
by being somewhat closer to him and I
 

7347
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:48,349
by being somewhat closer to him and I
think that's an important psychological

7348
02:19:48,349 --> 02:19:48,359
think that's an important psychological
 

7349
02:19:48,359 --> 02:19:49,910
think that's an important psychological
thing to note

7350
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:49,920
thing to note
 

7351
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:52,250
thing to note
for how you can do reasonably good team

7352
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:52,260
for how you can do reasonably good team
 

7353
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:54,230
for how you can do reasonably good team
construction if you're lucky enough to

7354
02:19:54,230 --> 02:19:54,240
construction if you're lucky enough to
 

7355
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:56,150
construction if you're lucky enough to
find those generational talents

7356
02:19:56,150 --> 02:19:56,160
find those generational talents
 

7357
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:58,250
find those generational talents
you have to find a composition of a team

7358
02:19:58,250 --> 02:19:58,260
you have to find a composition of a team
 

7359
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:00,950
you have to find a composition of a team
that keeps them roughly close

7360
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:00,960
that keeps them roughly close
 

7361
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:03,650
that keeps them roughly close
to enough of the org that way that

7362
02:20:03,650 --> 02:20:03,660
to enough of the org that way that
 

7363
02:20:03,660 --> 02:20:05,810
to enough of the org that way that
group of people

7364
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:05,820
group of people
 

7365
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:07,849
group of people
can continue to add value and then

7366
02:20:07,849 --> 02:20:07,859
can continue to add value and then
 

7367
02:20:07,859 --> 02:20:10,070
can continue to add value and then
you'll have courage to fire these next

7368
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:10,080
you'll have courage to fire these next
 

7369
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:11,990
you'll have courage to fire these next
two groups of people and I think the

7370
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:12,000
two groups of people and I think the
 

7371
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,790
two groups of people and I think the
answer is to fire those two groups of

7372
02:20:13,790 --> 02:20:13,800
answer is to fire those two groups of
 

7373
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:15,830
answer is to fire those two groups of
people because no matter how good you

7374
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:15,840
people because no matter how good you
 

7375
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:18,110
people because no matter how good you
are that stuff just injects poison into

7376
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:18,120
are that stuff just injects poison into
 

7377
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:20,570
are that stuff just injects poison into
a into a living organism and that living

7378
02:20:20,570 --> 02:20:20,580
a into a living organism and that living
 

7379
02:20:20,580 --> 02:20:23,750
a into a living organism and that living
organism will die when exposed to poison

7380
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:23,760
organism will die when exposed to poison
 

7381
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:25,790
organism will die when exposed to poison
so would you invest in a lot of

7382
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:25,800
so would you invest in a lot of
 

7383
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:27,110
so would you invest in a lot of
companies you've looked at a lot of

7384

companies you've looked at a lot of
 

7385

companies you've looked at a lot of
companies what do you think makes for a

and when I'm meeting a Company CEO for
 

7401
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:48,170
and when I'm meeting a Company CEO for
the first time I couldn't care less

7402
02:20:48,170 --> 02:20:48,180
the first time I couldn't care less
 

7403
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:51,469
the first time I couldn't care less
about the business in fact

7404
02:20:51,469 --> 02:20:51,479
about the business in fact
 

7405

um and I try to take the time
to let them reveal themselves now in

7408
02:20:56,929 --> 02:20:56,939
to let them reveal themselves now in
 

7409
02:20:56,939 --> 02:20:58,429
to let them reveal themselves now in
this environment you know I'm doing most

7410
02:20:58,429 --> 02:20:58,439
this environment you know I'm doing most
 

7411
02:20:58,439 --> 02:21:00,170
this environment you know I'm doing most
of the talking but if this were the

7412
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:00,180
of the talking but if this were the
 

7413
02:21:00,180 --> 02:21:01,370
of the talking but if this were the
other way around and you were ever

7414
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:01,380
other way around and you were ever
 

7415
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:03,110
other way around and you were ever
raising capital and usage math I'd be

7416
02:21:03,110 --> 02:21:03,120
raising capital and usage math I'd be
 

7417
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:04,070
raising capital and usage math I'd be
interested in you looking at this

7418
02:21:04,070 --> 02:21:04,080
interested in you looking at this
 

7419
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:04,910
interested in you looking at this
business

7420
02:21:04,910 --> 02:21:04,920
business
 

7421
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:07,790
business
I'd probably say eight to ten words

7422
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:07,800
I'd probably say eight to ten words
 

7423
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:10,910
I'd probably say eight to ten words
for hours and just listen prod you know

7424
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:10,920
for hours and just listen prod you know
 

7425
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:12,830
for hours and just listen prod you know
I throw things out prod and let you

7426
02:21:12,830 --> 02:21:12,840
I throw things out prod and let you
 

7427
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:15,830
I throw things out prod and let you
Meander and in you Meandering I'm trying

7428
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:15,840
Meander and in you Meandering I'm trying
 

7429
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:18,550
Meander and in you Meandering I'm trying
to build a sense of who this person is

7430
02:21:18,550 --> 02:21:18,560
to build a sense of who this person is
 

7431
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:21,650
to build a sense of who this person is
once I have a rough sense of that which

7432
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:21,660
once I have a rough sense of that which
 

7433
02:21:21,660 --> 02:21:23,870
once I have a rough sense of that which
is not necessarily right but it's a

7434
02:21:23,870 --> 02:21:23,880
is not necessarily right but it's a
 

7435
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:25,790
is not necessarily right but it's a
starting point

7436
02:21:25,790 --> 02:21:25,800
starting point
 

7437
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:29,330
starting point
then I can go and understand why this

7438
02:21:29,330 --> 02:21:29,340
then I can go and understand why this
 

7439
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:32,090
then I can go and understand why this
idea makes sense in this moment and what

7440
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:32,100
idea makes sense in this moment and what
 

7441
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:34,130
idea makes sense in this moment and what
I'm really trying to do is just kind of

7442
02:21:34,130 --> 02:21:34,140
I'm really trying to do is just kind of
 

7443
02:21:34,140 --> 02:21:37,010
I'm really trying to do is just kind of
like unpack where are the biases that

7444
02:21:37,010 --> 02:21:37,020
like unpack where are the biases that
 

7445
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:40,130
like unpack where are the biases that
may make you you know fail

7446
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:40,140
may make you you know fail
 

7447
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:43,550
may make you you know fail
and then we go back to you

7448
02:21:43,550 --> 02:21:43,560
and then we go back to you
 

7449
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:45,650
and then we go back to you
the thing that Silicon Valley has the

7450
02:21:45,650 --> 02:21:45,660
the thing that Silicon Valley has the
 

7451
02:21:45,660 --> 02:21:46,790
the thing that Silicon Valley has the
benefit of though is that they don't

7452
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:46,800
benefit of though is that they don't
 

7453
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,710
benefit of though is that they don't
have to do any of this stuff

7454
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:48,720
have to do any of this stuff
 

7455
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:51,889
have to do any of this stuff
if there's momentum because then the

7456
02:21:51,889 --> 02:21:51,899
if there's momentum because then the
 

7457
02:21:51,899 --> 02:21:53,389
if there's momentum because then the
rule book goes out the window and people

7458
02:21:53,389 --> 02:21:53,399
rule book goes out the window and people
 

7459
02:21:53,399 --> 02:21:55,670
rule book goes out the window and people
clamor to invest so one of the things

7460
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:55,680
clamor to invest so one of the things
 

7461
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:57,230
clamor to invest so one of the things
that I do

7462
02:21:57,230 --> 02:21:57,240
that I do
 

7463
02:21:57,240 --> 02:21:59,990
that I do
and this is again back to this pugilism

7464
02:21:59,990 --> 02:22:00,000
and this is again back to this pugilism
 

7465
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,849
and this is again back to this pugilism
that I inflict on myself

7466
02:22:01,849 --> 02:22:01,859
that I inflict on myself
 

7467
02:22:01,859 --> 02:22:04,250
that I inflict on myself
is I have these two things that I look

7468
02:22:04,250 --> 02:22:04,260
is I have these two things that I look
 

7469
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:07,090
is I have these two things that I look
at thing number one is I have a table

7470
02:22:07,090 --> 02:22:07,100
at thing number one is I have a table
 

7471
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:08,929
at thing number one is I have a table
that says

7472
02:22:08,929 --> 02:22:08,939
that says
 

7473
02:22:08,939 --> 02:22:10,670
that says
how much did we make from all of our

7474
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:10,680
how much did we make from all of our
 

7475
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:12,889
how much did we make from all of our
best investments how much did we lose

7476
02:22:12,889 --> 02:22:12,899
best investments how much did we lose
 

7477
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:14,990
best investments how much did we lose
from all of our worst Investments what

7478
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:15,000
from all of our worst Investments what
 

7479
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,790
from all of our worst Investments what
is the ratio of winners to losers over

7480
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:16,800
is the ratio of winners to losers over
 

7481
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:18,309
is the ratio of winners to losers over
11 years

7482
02:22:18,309 --> 02:22:18,319
11 years
 

7483
02:22:18,319 --> 02:22:22,370
11 years
and in our case it's 23 to 1. on you

7484
02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:22,380
and in our case it's 23 to 1. on you
 

7485
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:23,750
and in our case it's 23 to 1. on you
know billions of dollars so you can you

7486
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:23,760
know billions of dollars so you can you
 

7487
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,090
know billions of dollars so you can you
can kind of like you can see a lot of

7488
02:22:26,090 --> 02:22:26,100
can kind of like you can see a lot of
 

7489
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:27,290
can kind of like you can see a lot of

02:24:54,359 --> 02:24:56,510
and over time hopefully there's a body
of work that says you've generally hit

of work that says you've generally hit

more than you've missed
 

7621

02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:02,450
but if you look at even the best
Shooters what are they 52 percent

7624
02:25:02,450 --> 02:25:02,460
Shooters what are they 52 percent
 

7625
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:04,910
Shooters what are they 52 percent
so these are razor thin margins at the

7626
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:04,920
so these are razor thin margins at the
 

7627
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:07,130
so these are razor thin margins at the
end of the day which is really so then

7628
02:25:07,130 --> 02:25:07,140
end of the day which is really so then
 

7629
02:25:07,140 --> 02:25:08,809
end of the day which is really so then
what can you control

7630
02:25:08,809 --> 02:25:08,819
what can you control
 

7631
02:25:08,819 --> 02:25:11,389
what can you control
I can't control the defense I can't

7632
02:25:11,389 --> 02:25:11,399
I can't control the defense I can't
 

7633
02:25:11,399 --> 02:25:13,490
I can't control the defense I can't
control what they throw up me I can just

7634
02:25:13,490 --> 02:25:13,500
control what they throw up me I can just
 

7635
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:15,170
control what they throw up me I can just
control my preparation and whether I'm

7636
02:25:15,170 --> 02:25:15,180
control my preparation and whether I'm
 

7637
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:16,610
control my preparation and whether I'm
in the best position to launch a

7638
02:25:16,610 --> 02:25:16,620
in the best position to launch a
 

7639
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:18,590
in the best position to launch a
reasonable shot

7640
02:25:18,590 --> 02:25:18,600
reasonable shot
 

7641
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:20,690
reasonable shot
you said that the world's first

7642
02:25:20,690 --> 02:25:20,700
you said that the world's first
 

7643
02:25:20,700 --> 02:25:22,130
you said that the world's first
trillionaire would be somebody in

7644
02:25:22,130 --> 02:25:22,140
trillionaire would be somebody in
 

7645
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:24,650
trillionaire would be somebody in
climate change in the past

7646
02:25:24,650 --> 02:25:24,660
climate change in the past
 

7647
02:25:24,660 --> 02:25:27,469
climate change in the past
um let's update that what's uh today as

7648
02:25:27,469 --> 02:25:27,479
um let's update that what's uh today as
 

7649
02:25:27,479 --> 02:25:29,389
um let's update that what's uh today as
we stand here today what sector will the

7650
02:25:29,389 --> 02:25:29,399
we stand here today what sector will the
 

7651
02:25:29,399 --> 02:25:31,130
we stand here today what sector will the
world's first trillionaire come from

7652
02:25:31,130 --> 02:25:31,140
world's first trillionaire come from
 

7653
02:25:31,140 --> 02:25:33,590
world's first trillionaire come from
yeah I think it's energy transition so

7654
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:33,600
yeah I think it's energy transition so
 

7655
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:35,090
yeah I think it's energy transition so
energy so the things we've been talking

7656
02:25:35,090 --> 02:25:35,100
energy so the things we've been talking
 

7657
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:37,550
energy so the things we've been talking
about yeah really so isn't it okay well

7658
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:37,560
about yeah really so isn't it okay well
 

7659
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:38,690
about yeah really so isn't it okay well
I think I think the way that I think

7660
02:25:38,690 --> 02:25:38,700
I think I think the way that I think
 

7661
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:40,969
I think I think the way that I think
about so this is a single division it's

7662
02:25:40,969 --> 02:25:40,979
about so this is a single division it's
 

7663
02:25:40,979 --> 02:25:43,730
about so this is a single division it's
hard to interrupt you see their ability

7664
02:25:43,730 --> 02:25:43,740
hard to interrupt you see their ability
 

7665
02:25:43,740 --> 02:25:45,770
hard to interrupt you see their ability
to actually build a company that makes

7666
02:25:45,770 --> 02:25:45,780
to actually build a company that makes
 

7667
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:48,469
to actually build a company that makes
huge amount of money as opposed to this

7668
02:25:48,469 --> 02:25:48,479
huge amount of money as opposed to this
 

7669
02:25:48,479 --> 02:25:49,790
huge amount of money as opposed to this
distributed idea that you've been

7670
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:49,800
distributed idea that you've been
 

7671
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:51,830
distributed idea that you've been
talking about yeah I'll give you my

7672
02:25:51,830 --> 02:25:51,840
talking about yeah I'll give you my
 

7673
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:54,830
talking about yeah I'll give you my
philosophy on wealth

7674
02:25:54,830 --> 02:25:54,840
philosophy on wealth
 

7675
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:55,550
philosophy on wealth
um

7676
02:25:55,550 --> 02:25:55,560
um
 

7677
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:58,849
um
most of it is not you

7678
02:25:58,849 --> 02:25:58,859
most of it is not you
 

7679
02:25:58,859 --> 02:26:01,250
most of it is not you
um an enormous amount of it is

7680
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:01,260
um an enormous amount of it is
 

7681
02:26:01,260 --> 02:26:03,110
um an enormous amount of it is
the genetic distribution of being born

7682
02:26:03,110 --> 02:26:03,120
the genetic distribution of being born
 

7683
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:04,370
the genetic distribution of being born
in the right place and blah blah

7684
02:26:04,370 --> 02:26:04,380
in the right place and blah blah
 

7685
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:06,889
in the right place and blah blah
irrespective of the boundary conditions

7686
02:26:06,889 --> 02:26:06,899
irrespective of the boundary conditions
 

7687
02:26:06,899 --> 02:26:08,990
irrespective of the boundary conditions
of how you were born or where you were

7688
02:26:08,990 --> 02:26:09,000
of how you were born or where you were
 

7689
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,270
of how you were born or where you were
raised right so you know at the end of

7690
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:11,280
raised right so you know at the end of
 

7691
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:12,469
raised right so you know at the end of
the day you and I ended up in the United

7692
02:26:12,469 --> 02:26:12,479
the day you and I ended up in the United
 

7693
02:26:12,479 --> 02:26:16,010
the day you and I ended up in the United
States it's a huge benefit to us

7694
02:26:16,010 --> 02:26:16,020
States it's a huge benefit to us
 

7695
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:19,250
States it's a huge benefit to us
second is the benefit of our age

7696
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:19,260
second is the benefit of our age
 

7697
02:26:19,260 --> 02:26:21,650
second is the benefit of our age
it's much better and much more likely to

7698
02:26:21,650 --> 02:26:21,660
it's much better and much more likely to
 

7699
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:24,050
it's much better and much more likely to
be successful as a 46 year old in 2023

7700
02:26:24,050 --> 02:26:24,060
be successful as a 46 year old in 2023
 

7701
02:26:24,060 --> 02:26:28,550
be successful as a 46 year old in 2023
than a 26 year old in 2023 because in my

7702
02:26:28,550 --> 02:26:28,560
than a 26 year old in 2023 because in my
 

7703
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:31,969
than a 26 year old in 2023 because in my
case I have demographics working for me

7704
02:26:31,969 --> 02:26:31,979
case I have demographics working for me
 

7705
02:26:31,979 --> 02:26:34,370
case I have demographics working for me
with a 26 year old he or she has

7706
02:26:34,370 --> 02:26:34,380
with a 26 year old he or she has
 

7707
02:26:34,380 --> 02:26:35,990
with a 26 year old he or she has
demographics working slightly against

7708
02:26:35,990 --> 02:26:36,000
demographics working slightly against
 

7709
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,370
demographics working slightly against
them can you explain that a little bit

7710
02:26:37,370 --> 02:26:37,380
them can you explain that a little bit
 

7711
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:39,650
them can you explain that a little bit
what are the demographics here

7712
02:26:39,650 --> 02:26:39,660
what are the demographics here
 

7713
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:42,590
what are the demographics here
in the case of me

7714
02:26:42,590 --> 02:26:42,600
in the case of me
 

7715
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:45,590
in the case of me
the distribution of population in

7716
02:26:45,590 --> 02:26:45,600
the distribution of population in
 

7717
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:47,450
the distribution of population in
America looks like a pyramid

7718
02:26:47,450 --> 02:26:47,460
America looks like a pyramid
 

7719
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:49,849
America looks like a pyramid
and in that pyramid

7720
02:26:49,849 --> 02:26:49,859
and in that pyramid
 

7721
02:26:49,859 --> 02:26:52,849
and in that pyramid
I'm swedged in between these two massive

7722
02:26:52,849 --> 02:26:52,859
I'm swedged in between these two massive
 

7723
02:26:52,859 --> 02:26:54,830
I'm swedged in between these two massive
population cohorts the Boomers and then

7724
02:26:54,830 --> 02:26:54,840
population cohorts the Boomers and then
 

7725
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:58,309
population cohorts the Boomers and then
these you know gen Z and millennials

7726
02:26:58,309 --> 02:26:58,319
these you know gen Z and millennials
 

7727
02:26:58,319 --> 02:26:59,990
these you know gen Z and millennials
um and that's a very advantageous

7728
02:26:59,990 --> 02:27:00,000
um and that's a very advantageous
 

7729
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,849
um and that's a very advantageous
position it's not dissimilar to the

7730
02:27:01,849 --> 02:27:01,859
position it's not dissimilar to the
 

7731
02:27:01,859 --> 02:27:03,469
position it's not dissimilar to the
position that Buffett was where he was

7732
02:27:03,469 --> 02:27:03,479
position that Buffett was where he was
 

7733
02:27:03,479 --> 02:27:06,170
position that Buffett was where he was
you know packaged in between Boomers

7734
02:27:06,170 --> 02:27:06,180
you know packaged in between Boomers
 

7735
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:08,150
you know packaged in between Boomers
beneath him and the silent generation

7736
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:08,160
beneath him and the silent generation
 

7737
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:11,090
beneath him and the silent generation
above him and being in between two

7738
02:27:11,090 --> 02:27:11,100
above him and being in between two
 

7739
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:13,790
above him and being in between two
massive population cohorts turns out to

7740
02:27:13,790 --> 02:27:13,800
massive population cohorts turns out to
 

7741
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:16,010
massive population cohorts turns out to
be extremely advantageous because when

7742
02:27:16,010 --> 02:27:16,020
be extremely advantageous because when
 

7743
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:18,410
be extremely advantageous because when
the cohort above you transitions power

7744
02:27:18,410 --> 02:27:18,420
the cohort above you transitions power
 

7745
02:27:18,420 --> 02:27:20,990
the cohort above you transitions power
and capital and all of this stuff you're

7746
02:27:20,990 --> 02:27:21,000
and capital and all of this stuff you're
 

7747
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,670
and capital and all of this stuff you're
the next person that likely gets handed

7748
02:27:22,670 --> 02:27:22,680
the next person that likely gets handed
 

7749
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:24,530
the next person that likely gets handed
it so we have a disproportionate

7750
02:27:24,530 --> 02:27:24,540
it so we have a disproportionate
 

7751
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:26,690
it so we have a disproportionate
likelihood to be you know we are lucky

7752
02:27:26,690 --> 02:27:26,700
likelihood to be you know we are lucky
 

7753
02:27:26,700 --> 02:27:29,809
likelihood to be you know we are lucky
to be older than younger

7754
02:27:29,809 --> 02:27:29,819
to be older than younger
 

7755
02:27:29,819 --> 02:27:31,670
to be older than younger
um so that's that's an advantage and

7756
02:27:31,670 --> 02:27:31,680
um so that's that's an advantage and
 

7757
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:33,050
um so that's that's an advantage and
then the other advantage that has

7758
02:27:33,050 --> 02:27:33,060
then the other advantage that has
 

7759
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:34,490
then the other advantage that has
nothing to do with me

7760
02:27:34,490 --> 02:27:34,500
nothing to do with me
 

7761
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:36,830
nothing to do with me
is that I stumbled into technology I got

7762
02:27:36,830 --> 02:27:36,840
is that I stumbled into technology I got
 

7763
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:38,690
is that I stumbled into technology I got
a degree in electrical engineering and I

7764
02:27:38,690 --> 02:27:38,700
a degree in electrical engineering and I
 

7765
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:40,730
a degree in electrical engineering and I
ended up coming to Silicon Valley

7766
02:27:40,730 --> 02:27:40,740
ended up coming to Silicon Valley
 

7767
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:42,830
ended up coming to Silicon Valley
and it turned out that in that moment it

7768
02:27:42,830 --> 02:27:42,840
and it turned out that in that moment it
 

7769
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:44,270
and it turned out that in that moment it
was such a transformational Wind of

7770
02:27:44,270 --> 02:27:44,280
was such a transformational Wind of
 

7771
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:46,670
was such a transformational Wind of
Change that was at my back

7772
02:27:46,670 --> 02:27:46,680
Change that was at my back
 

7773
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:48,530
Change that was at my back
right so

7774
02:27:48,530 --> 02:27:48,540
right so
 

7775
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:51,950
right so
the wealth that one creates is

7776
02:27:51,950 --> 02:27:51,960
the wealth that one creates is
 

7777
02:27:51,960 --> 02:27:55,730
the wealth that one creates is
a huge part of those variables and then

7778
02:27:55,730 --> 02:27:55,740
a huge part of those variables and then
 

7779
02:27:55,740 --> 02:27:57,410
a huge part of those variables and then
the last variable is your direct

7780
02:27:57,410 --> 02:27:57,420
the last variable is your direct
 

7781
02:27:57,420 --> 02:27:59,450
the last variable is your direct
contributions

7782
02:27:59,450 --> 02:27:59,460
contributions
 

7783
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:03,349
contributions
in that moment and the reason why

7784
02:28:03,349 --> 02:28:03,359
in that moment and the reason why
 

7785
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:05,150
in that moment and the reason why
that can create

7786
02:28:05,150 --> 02:28:05,160
that can create
 

7787
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:07,250
that can create
extreme wealth

7788
02:28:07,250 --> 02:28:07,260
extreme wealth
 

7789
02:28:07,260 --> 02:28:09,290
extreme wealth
is because when those things come

7790
02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:09,300
is because when those things come
 

7791
02:28:09,300 --> 02:28:11,090
is because when those things come
together at the right

7792
02:28:11,090 --> 02:28:11,100
together at the right
 

7793
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:12,770
together at the right
moment

7794
02:28:12,770 --> 02:28:12,780
moment
 

7795
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:14,870
moment
it's like a chemical reaction I mean

7796
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:14,880
it's like a chemical reaction I mean
 

7797
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:18,349
it's like a chemical reaction I mean
it's just crazy so

7798
02:28:18,349 --> 02:28:18,359

 

7799
02:28:18,359 --> 02:28:20,330

that was sort of part number one of what

7800
02:28:20,330 --> 02:28:20,340
that was sort of part number one of what
 

7801
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:22,370
that was sort of part number one of what
I wanted to say the second thing is when

7802
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:22,380
I wanted to say the second thing is when
 

7803
02:28:22,380 --> 02:28:24,349
I wanted to say the second thing is when
you look then inside of these systems

7804
02:28:24,349 --> 02:28:24,359
you look then inside of these systems
 

7805
02:28:24,359 --> 02:28:26,510
you look then inside of these systems
where you have all these Tailwinds right

7806
02:28:26,510 --> 02:28:26,520
where you have all these Tailwinds right
 

7807
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:29,030
where you have all these Tailwinds right
so in Tech I think I benefit from these

7808
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:29,040
so in Tech I think I benefit from these
 

7809
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:31,010
so in Tech I think I benefit from these
three big tail ones

7810
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:31,020
three big tail ones
 

7811
02:28:31,020 --> 02:28:33,170
three big tail ones
if you build the company or are part of

7812
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:33,180
if you build the company or are part of
 

7813
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:35,750
if you build the company or are part of
a company or a part of a movement

7814
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:35,760
a company or a part of a movement
 

7815
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:38,750
a company or a part of a movement
your economic participation

7816
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:38,760
your economic participation
 

7817
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:42,370
your economic participation
tends to be a direct byproduct

7818
02:28:42,370 --> 02:28:42,380
tends to be a direct byproduct
 

7819
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:45,889
tends to be a direct byproduct
of the actual value that that thing

7820
02:28:45,889 --> 02:28:45,899
of the actual value that that thing
 

7821
02:28:45,899 --> 02:28:49,010
of the actual value that that thing
creates in the world

7822
02:28:49,010 --> 02:28:49,020

 

7823
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:51,170

and that the thing that that creates in

7824
02:28:51,170 --> 02:28:51,180
and that the thing that that creates in
 

7825
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:52,370
and that the thing that that creates in
the world

7826
02:28:52,370 --> 02:28:52,380
the world
 

7827
02:28:52,380 --> 02:28:54,469
the world
will be bigger

7828
02:28:54,469 --> 02:28:54,479
will be bigger
 

7829
02:28:54,479 --> 02:28:58,010
will be bigger
if it is not just an economic system

7830
02:28:58,010 --> 02:28:58,020
if it is not just an economic system
 

7831
02:28:58,020 --> 02:29:00,710
if it is not just an economic system
but it's like a philosophical system

7832
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:00,720
but it's like a philosophical system
 

7833
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:02,030
but it's like a philosophical system
it changes the way the governance

7834
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:02,040
it changes the way the governance
 

7835
02:29:02,040 --> 02:29:03,530
it changes the way the governance
happens it changes the way that people

7836
02:29:03,530 --> 02:29:03,540
happens it changes the way that people
 

7837
02:29:03,540 --> 02:29:05,330
happens it changes the way that people
think about all kinds of other things

7838
02:29:05,330 --> 02:29:05,340
think about all kinds of other things
 

7839
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:06,770
think about all kinds of other things
about their lives

7840
02:29:06,770 --> 02:29:06,780
about their lives
 

7841
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:09,110
about their lives
so there's a reason

7842
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,120
so there's a reason
 

7843
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:11,990
so there's a reason
I think why database companies are worth

7844
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:12,000
I think why database companies are worth
 

7845
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,809
I think why database companies are worth
acts social companies are worth why but

7846
02:29:14,809 --> 02:29:14,819
acts social companies are worth why but
 

7847
02:29:14,819 --> 02:29:17,090
acts social companies are worth why but
the military industrial complex is worth

7848
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:17,100
the military industrial complex is worth
 

7849
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:18,950
the military industrial complex is worth
you know as much

7850
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:18,960
you know as much
 

7851
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:22,130
you know as much
and I think there's a reason why that if

7852
02:29:22,130 --> 02:29:22,140
and I think there's a reason why that if
 

7853
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:24,290
and I think there's a reason why that if
you for example were to go off and build

7854
02:29:24,290 --> 02:29:24,300
you for example were to go off and build
 

7855
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:26,929
you for example were to go off and build
some newfangled source of energy that's

7856
02:29:26,929 --> 02:29:26,939
some newfangled source of energy that's
 

7857
02:29:26,939 --> 02:29:29,330
some newfangled source of energy that's
clean and Hyper abundant

7858
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:29,340
clean and Hyper abundant
 

7859
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:31,010
clean and Hyper abundant
and safe

7860
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:31,020
and safe
 

7861
02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:32,630
and safe
that what you're really going to

7862
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:32,640
that what you're really going to
 

7863
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:33,710
that what you're really going to
displace

7864
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:33,720
displace
 

7865
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:36,230
displace
or reshape is trillions and trillions of

7866
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:36,240
or reshape is trillions and trillions of
 

7867
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,510
or reshape is trillions and trillions of
dollars of worldwide GDP so the global

7868
02:29:38,510 --> 02:29:38,520
dollars of worldwide GDP so the global
 

7869
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:41,630
dollars of worldwide GDP so the global
GDP is I call it 85 trillion right it's

7870
02:29:41,630 --> 02:29:41,640
GDP is I call it 85 trillion right it's
 

7871
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:43,610
GDP is I call it 85 trillion right it's
going at two to three percent a year

7872
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:43,620
going at two to three percent a year
 

7873
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:45,110
going at two to three percent a year
so in the next 10 years we'll be dealing

7874
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:45,120
so in the next 10 years we'll be dealing
 

7875
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:48,230
so in the next 10 years we'll be dealing
with a hundred trillion dollars of GDP

7876
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:48,240
with a hundred trillion dollars of GDP
 

7877
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:50,750
with a hundred trillion dollars of GDP
right somebody Who develops clean energy

7878
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:50,760
right somebody Who develops clean energy
 

7879
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:52,610
right somebody Who develops clean energy
in 2035

7880
02:29:52,610 --> 02:29:52,620
in 2035
 

7881
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:54,710
in 2035
will probably shift

7882
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:54,720
will probably shift
 

7883
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:56,510
will probably shift
10 of that around

7884
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:56,520
10 of that around
 

7885
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:59,809
10 of that around
10 trillion dollars

7886
02:29:59,809 --> 02:29:59,819

 

7887
02:29:59,819 --> 02:30:02,870

a company can easily capture thirty

7888
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:02,880
a company can easily capture thirty
 

7889
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:04,429
a company can easily capture thirty
percent of a market three trillion

7890
02:30:04,429 --> 02:30:04,439
percent of a market three trillion
 

7891
02:30:04,439 --> 02:30:05,750
percent of a market three trillion
dollars

7892
02:30:05,750 --> 02:30:05,760
dollars
 

7893
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:08,450
dollars
a human being can typically own a third

7894
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:08,460
a human being can typically own a third
 

7895
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:10,309
a human being can typically own a third
of one of these companies one trillion

7896
02:30:10,309 --> 02:30:10,319
of one of these companies one trillion
 

7897
02:30:10,319 --> 02:30:11,750
of one of these companies one trillion
dollars

7898
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:11,760
dollars
 

7899
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:13,490
dollars
so you can kind of get to this answer

7900
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:13,500
so you can kind of get to this answer
 

7901
02:30:13,500 --> 02:30:15,410
so you can kind of get to this answer
where it's like it's going to happen in

7902
02:30:15,410 --> 02:30:15,420
where it's like it's going to happen in
 

7903
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:17,389
where it's like it's going to happen in
our lifetime

7904
02:30:17,389 --> 02:30:17,399
our lifetime
 

7905
02:30:17,399 --> 02:30:19,610
our lifetime
but you have to I think find these

7906
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:19,620
but you have to I think find these
 

7907
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:21,950
but you have to I think find these
systems that are so gargantuan and they

7908
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:21,960
systems that are so gargantuan and they
 

7909
02:30:21,960 --> 02:30:23,690
systems that are so gargantuan and they
exist today

7910
02:30:23,690 --> 02:30:23,700
exist today
 

7911
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:25,550
exist today
it's more bounded because price

that energy reaches

7920
02:30:32,570 --> 02:30:32,580
that energy reaches
 

7921
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:34,429
that energy reaches
right of that 80 trillion dollars of

right of that 80 trillion dollars of
 

7923
02:30:34,439 --> 02:30:36,710
right of that 80 trillion dollars of
worldwide GDP I bet you if you added up

7924
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:36,720
worldwide GDP I bet you if you added up
 

7925
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:38,510
worldwide GDP I bet you if you added up
all the energy companies but then you

7926
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:38,520
all the energy companies but then you
 

7927
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:40,610
all the energy companies but then you
added up all of manufacturing

7928
02:30:40,610 --> 02:30:40,620
added up all of manufacturing
 

7929
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:42,170
added up all of manufacturing
you know if you added up all of

7930
02:30:42,170 --> 02:30:42,180
you know if you added up all of
 

7931
02:30:42,180 --> 02:30:44,570

Transport you'd probably get to like 60
 

7933
02:30:44,580 --> 02:30:46,190
Transport you'd probably get to like 60
of the 80.

7934
02:30:46,190 --> 02:30:46,200
of the 80.
 

7935
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:49,370
of the 80.
do you have an idea of which energy

7936
02:30:49,370 --> 02:30:49,380
do you have an idea of which energy
 

7937
02:30:49,380 --> 02:30:51,650
do you have an idea of which energy
uh which alternate energy sustainable

7938
02:30:51,650 --> 02:30:51,660
uh which alternate energy sustainable
 

7939
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:52,809
uh which alternate energy sustainable
energy

7940
02:30:52,809 --> 02:30:52,819

7941
02:30:52,819 --> 02:30:55,429
energy
is the most promising well I think that

7942
02:30:55,429 --> 02:30:55,439
is the most promising well I think that
 

7943
02:30:55,439 --> 02:30:57,190
is the most promising well I think that
we

7944
02:30:57,190 --> 02:30:57,200
we
 

7945
02:30:57,200 --> 02:31:00,650
we
have to do a better job of exploring

7946
02:31:00,650 --> 02:31:00,660
have to do a better job of exploring
 

7947
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:03,590
have to do a better job of exploring
what I call the suburbs of the periodic

7948
02:31:03,590 --> 02:31:03,600
what I call the suburbs of the periodic
 

7949
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:04,550
what I call the suburbs of the periodic
table

7950
02:31:04,550 --> 02:31:04,560
table
 

7951
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:07,670
table
so you know we're really good in Seattle

7952
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:07,680
so you know we're really good in Seattle
 

7953
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:09,950
so you know we're really good in Seattle
you know the upper Northwest yes you

7954
02:31:09,950 --> 02:31:09,960
you know the upper Northwest yes you
 

7955
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:11,929
you know the upper Northwest yes you
know we're kind of good in Portland

7956
02:31:11,929 --> 02:31:11,939
know we're kind of good in Portland
 

7957
02:31:11,939 --> 02:31:14,570
know we're kind of good in Portland
but we're not existent in San Diego and

7958
02:31:14,570 --> 02:31:14,580
but we're not existent in San Diego and
 

7959
02:31:14,580 --> 02:31:17,090
but we're not existent in San Diego and
we have zero plan for North Carolina

7960
02:31:17,090 --> 02:31:17,100
we have zero plan for North Carolina
 

7961
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:18,590
we have zero plan for North Carolina
through Florida

7962
02:31:18,590 --> 02:31:18,600
through Florida
 

7963
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:21,770
through Florida
yeah and so is that a fancy way of

7964
02:31:21,770 --> 02:31:21,780
yeah and so is that a fancy way of
 

7965
02:31:21,780 --> 02:31:23,870
yeah and so is that a fancy way of
saying nuclear is should be part of the

7966
02:31:23,870 --> 02:31:23,880
saying nuclear is should be part of the
 

7967
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:26,690
saying nuclear is should be part of the
discussion I think nuclear I think room

7968
02:31:26,690 --> 02:31:26,700
discussion I think nuclear I think room
 

7969
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:28,969
discussion I think nuclear I think room
temperature semiconductors

7970
02:31:28,969 --> 02:31:28,979
temperature semiconductors
 

7971
02:31:28,979 --> 02:31:31,250
temperature semiconductors
I'm I'm not convinced right now that the

7972
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:31,260
I'm I'm not convinced right now that the
 

7973
02:31:31,260 --> 02:31:33,650
I'm I'm not convinced right now that the
existing set of nuclear Solutions will

7974
02:31:33,650 --> 02:31:33,660
existing set of nuclear Solutions will
 

7975
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:35,270
existing set of nuclear Solutions will
do a good job of scaling Beyond bench

7976
02:31:35,270 --> 02:31:35,280
do a good job of scaling Beyond bench
 

7977
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:36,889
do a good job of scaling Beyond bench
scale I think there is a lot of

7978
02:31:36,889 --> 02:31:36,899
scale I think there is a lot of
 

7979
02:31:36,899 --> 02:31:38,929
scale I think there is a lot of
complicated technical problems that make

7980
02:31:38,929 --> 02:31:38,939
complicated technical problems that make
 

7981
02:31:38,939 --> 02:31:40,490
complicated technical problems that make
it work at a bench scale level even

7982
02:31:40,490 --> 02:31:40,500
it work at a bench scale level even
 

7983
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:43,190
it work at a bench scale level even
partially but the energy equation

7984
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:43,200
partially but the energy equation
 

7985
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:44,450
partially but the energy equation
is going to be very difficult to

7986
02:31:44,450 --> 02:31:44,460
is going to be very difficult to
 

7987
02:31:44,460 --> 02:31:46,550
is going to be very difficult to
overcome in the absence of some leaps in

7988
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:46,560
overcome in the absence of some leaps in
 

7989
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:47,870
overcome in the absence of some leaps in
Material Science

7990
02:31:47,870 --> 02:31:47,880
Material Science
 

7991
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:50,389
Material Science
have you seen any leaps is there

7992
02:31:50,389 --> 02:31:50,399
have you seen any leaps is there
 

7993
02:31:50,399 --> 02:31:51,889
have you seen any leaps is there
promising stuff like you're you're

7994
02:31:51,889 --> 02:31:51,899
promising stuff like you're you're
 

7995
02:31:51,899 --> 02:31:53,450
promising stuff like you're you're
seeing The Cutting Edge from a company

7996
02:31:53,450 --> 02:31:53,460
seeing The Cutting Edge from a company
 

7997
02:31:53,460 --> 02:31:56,270
seeing The Cutting Edge from a company
perspective yeah I would say not yet I

7998
02:31:56,270 --> 02:31:56,280
perspective yeah I would say not yet I
 

7999
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:59,030
perspective yeah I would say not yet I
do but the precursor yes I have been

8000
02:31:59,030 --> 02:31:59,040
do but the precursor yes I have been
 

8001
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,610
do but the precursor yes I have been
spending a fair amount of time so

8002
02:32:01,610 --> 02:32:01,620
spending a fair amount of time so
 

8003
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:03,290
spending a fair amount of time so
talking about like a new framework

8004
02:32:03,290 --> 02:32:03,300
talking about like a new framework
 

8005
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:06,650
talking about like a new framework
that's in my mind is around these room

8006
02:32:06,650 --> 02:32:06,660
that's in my mind is around these room
 

8007
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:09,410
that's in my mind is around these room
temp superconductors

8008
02:32:09,410 --> 02:32:09,420
temp superconductors
 

8009
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:11,690
temp superconductors
um and so I've been kind of bumbling

8010
02:32:11,690 --> 02:32:11,700
um and so I've been kind of bumbling
 

8011
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:13,550
um and so I've been kind of bumbling
around in that Forest

8012
02:32:13,550 --> 02:32:13,560
around in that Forest
 

8013
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:15,429
around in that Forest
for about a year

8014
02:32:15,429 --> 02:32:15,439
for about a year
 

8015
02:32:15,439 --> 02:32:18,590
for about a year
I haven't really put together any

8016
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:18,600
I haven't really put together any
 

8017
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:20,090
I haven't really put together any
meaningful perspectives but again

8018
02:32:20,090 --> 02:32:20,100
meaningful perspectives but again
 

8019
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:22,849
meaningful perspectives but again
talking about like trafficking in in

8020
02:32:22,849 --> 02:32:22,859
talking about like trafficking in in
 

8021
02:32:22,859 --> 02:32:25,130
talking about like trafficking in in
companies and Investments that are

8022
02:32:25,130 --> 02:32:25,140
companies and Investments that are
 

8023
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:27,290
companies and Investments that are
very lonely but they allow me to

8024
02:32:27,290 --> 02:32:27,300
very lonely but they allow me to
 

8025
02:32:27,300 --> 02:32:29,450
very lonely but they allow me to
generate returns that are relatively

8026
02:32:29,450 --> 02:32:29,460
generate returns that are relatively
 

8027
02:32:29,460 --> 02:32:31,670
generate returns that are relatively
unique and independent that's an area

8028
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:31,680
unique and independent that's an area
 

8029
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:33,230
unique and independent that's an area
where I don't see anybody else when I'm

8030
02:32:33,230 --> 02:32:33,240
where I don't see anybody else when I'm
 

8031
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:35,570
where I don't see anybody else when I'm
there I'll give you another area

8032
02:32:35,570 --> 02:32:35,580
there I'll give you another area
 

8033
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:37,670
there I'll give you another area
you know we

8034
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:37,680
you know we
 

8035
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:39,889
you know we
um I think are about to unleash in a

8036
02:32:39,889 --> 02:32:39,899
um I think are about to unleash in a
 

8037
02:32:39,899 --> 02:32:42,230
um I think are about to unleash in a
world of zero energy and and zero

8038
02:32:42,230 --> 02:32:42,240
world of zero energy and and zero
 

8039
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:45,230
world of zero energy and and zero
compute costs

8040
02:32:45,230 --> 02:32:45,240

 

8041
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:47,809

computational biology will replace white

8042
02:32:47,809 --> 02:32:47,819
computational biology will replace white
 

8043
02:32:47,819 --> 02:32:49,309
computational biology will replace white
chemistry

8044
02:32:49,309 --> 02:32:49,319
chemistry
 

8045
02:32:49,319 --> 02:32:51,230
chemistry
and when you do that

8046
02:32:51,230 --> 02:32:51,240
and when you do that
 

8047
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:54,110
and when you do that
you will be able to iterate On Tools

8048
02:32:54,110 --> 02:32:54,120
you will be able to iterate On Tools
 

8049
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:55,910
you will be able to iterate On Tools
that will be able to solve a lot of

8050
02:32:55,910 --> 02:32:55,920
that will be able to solve a lot of
 

8051
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:57,530
that will be able to solve a lot of
human disease

8052
02:32:57,530 --> 02:32:57,540
human disease
 

8053
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:59,929
human disease
I think like if you look at the head

8054
02:32:59,929 --> 02:32:59,939
I think like if you look at the head
 

8055
02:32:59,939 --> 02:33:02,990
I think like if you look at the head
of like the top 400 most recurring rare

8056
02:33:02,990 --> 02:33:03,000
of like the top 400 most recurring rare
 

8057
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,190
of like the top 400 most recurring rare
diseases

8058
02:33:04,190 --> 02:33:04,200
diseases
 

8059
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:07,790
diseases
I think like half the number 200 is a

8060
02:33:07,790 --> 02:33:07,800
I think like half the number 200 is a
 

8061
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:10,370
I think like half the number 200 is a
specific point mutation as just the

8062
02:33:10,370 --> 02:33:10,380
specific point mutation as just the
 

8063
02:33:10,380 --> 02:33:12,950
specific point mutation as just the
mismethylation between C and T

8064
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:12,960
mismethylation between C and T
 

8065
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:14,809
mismethylation between C and T
I mean that's like whoa wait you're

8066
02:33:14,809 --> 02:33:14,819
I mean that's like whoa wait you're
 

8067
02:33:14,819 --> 02:33:16,910
I mean that's like whoa wait you're
telling me in billions of lines of code

8068
02:33:16,910 --> 02:33:16,920
telling me in billions of lines of code
 

8069
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:19,490
telling me in billions of lines of code
I forgot you know semicolon right there

8070
02:33:19,490 --> 02:33:19,500
I forgot you know semicolon right there
 

8071
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:21,050
I forgot you know semicolon right there
that's causing this the whole thing to

that's causing this the whole thing to
 

8073
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:22,610
that's causing this the whole thing to
miscompile so I just got to go in there

8074
02:33:22,610 --> 02:33:22,620

02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:54,110
and talking about sort of like the upper
bound is well defined

8102
02:33:54,110 --> 02:33:54,120
bound is well defined
 

8103
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:55,849
bound is well defined
the upper Bound in medicine is not well

8104
02:33:55,849 --> 02:33:55,859
the upper Bound in medicine is not well
 

8105
02:33:55,859 --> 02:33:58,250
the upper Bound in medicine is not well
defined because it is not

8106
02:33:58,250 --> 02:33:58,260
defined because it is not
 

8107
02:33:58,260 --> 02:34:00,050
defined because it is not
the sum total of the market cap of the

8108
02:34:00,050 --> 02:34:00,060
the sum total of the market cap of the
 

8109
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:01,790
the sum total of the market cap of the
Pharma Industries it is actually the sum

8110
02:34:01,790 --> 02:34:01,800
Pharma Industries it is actually the sum
 

8111
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:05,030
Pharma Industries it is actually the sum
total of the value of human life

8112
02:34:05,030 --> 02:34:05,040
total of the value of human life
 

8113
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:07,490
total of the value of human life
and that's an extremely ethical and

8114
02:34:07,490 --> 02:34:07,500
and that's an extremely ethical and
 

8115
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:09,710
and that's an extremely ethical and
moral question isn't there special

8116
02:34:09,710 --> 02:34:09,720
moral question isn't there special
 

8117
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:13,370
moral question isn't there special
interests that are resisting uh moving

8118
02:34:13,370 --> 02:34:13,380
interests that are resisting uh moving
 

8119
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:15,950
interests that are resisting uh moving
making progress on the energy side so

8120
02:34:15,950 --> 02:34:15,960
making progress on the energy side so
 

8121
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:18,710
making progress on the energy side so
like uh governments and how do you break

8122
02:34:18,710 --> 02:34:18,720
like uh governments and how do you break
 

8123
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:19,849
like uh governments and how do you break
through that I mean you have to

8124
02:34:19,849 --> 02:34:19,859
through that I mean you have to
 

8125
02:34:19,859 --> 02:34:21,290
through that I mean you have to
acknowledge the reality of that I think

8126
02:34:21,290 --> 02:34:21,300
acknowledge the reality of that I think
 

8127
02:34:21,300 --> 02:34:22,849
acknowledge the reality of that I think
it's less governments in fact like I

8128
02:34:22,849 --> 02:34:22,859
it's less governments in fact like I
 

8129
02:34:22,859 --> 02:34:25,010
it's less governments in fact like I
said I think President Biden has done a

8130
02:34:25,010 --> 02:34:25,020
said I think President Biden has done a
 

8131
02:34:25,020 --> 02:34:25,969
said I think President Biden has done a
really incredible job while Chuck

8132
02:34:25,969 --> 02:34:25,979
really incredible job while Chuck
 

8133
02:34:25,979 --> 02:34:27,290
really incredible job while Chuck
Schumer really is done a really

8134
02:34:27,290 --> 02:34:27,300
Schumer really is done a really
 

8135
02:34:27,300 --> 02:34:29,389
Schumer really is done a really
incredible job because

8136
02:34:29,389 --> 02:34:29,399
incredible job because
 

8137
02:34:29,399 --> 02:34:31,070
incredible job because
so just to give you the math on this

8138
02:34:31,070 --> 02:34:31,080
so just to give you the math on this
 

8139
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:33,530
so just to give you the math on this
right like back to this so three percent

8140
02:34:33,530 --> 02:34:33,540
right like back to this so three percent
 

8141
02:34:33,540 --> 02:34:36,050
right like back to this so three percent
of everything is of a market or zealots

8142
02:34:36,050 --> 02:34:36,060
of everything is of a market or zealots
 

8143
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:38,090
of everything is of a market or zealots
but when you get past five percent

8144
02:34:38,090 --> 02:34:38,100
but when you get past five percent
 

8145
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:40,610
but when you get past five percent
things tend to just go nuclear to 50 60

8146
02:34:40,610 --> 02:34:40,620
things tend to just go nuclear to 50 60
 

8147
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:42,670
things tend to just go nuclear to 50 60
percent

8148
02:34:42,670 --> 02:34:42,680
percent
 

8149
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:45,889
percent
the way that they wrote this last bill

8150
02:34:45,889 --> 02:34:45,899
the way that they wrote this last bill
 

8151
02:34:45,899 --> 02:34:48,650
the way that they wrote this last bill
the cost I'll just use cars as an

8152
02:34:48,650 --> 02:34:48,660
the cost I'll just use cars as an
 

8153
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:51,349
the cost I'll just use cars as an
example the cost of an average car is 22

8154
02:34:51,349 --> 02:34:51,359
example the cost of an average car is 22
 

8155
02:34:51,359 --> 02:34:53,750
example the cost of an average car is 22
and a half thousand the cost of the

8156
02:34:53,750 --> 02:34:53,760
and a half thousand the cost of the
 

8157
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:55,610
and a half thousand the cost of the
cheapest battery car is thirty thousand

8158
02:34:55,610 --> 02:34:55,620
cheapest battery car is thirty thousand
 

8159
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:58,010
cheapest battery car is thirty thousand
and lo and behold there's a seventy five

8160
02:34:58,010 --> 02:34:58,020
and lo and behold there's a seventy five
 

8161
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:00,170
and lo and behold there's a seventy five
hundred dollar credit and it's like to

8162
02:35:00,170 --> 02:35:00,180
hundred dollar credit and it's like to
 

8163
02:35:00,180 --> 02:35:02,030
hundred dollar credit and it's like to
think the Invisible Hand didn't know

8164
02:35:02,030 --> 02:35:02,040
think the Invisible Hand didn't know
 

8165
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:04,309
think the Invisible Hand didn't know
that that math was right I think is kind

8166
02:35:04,309 --> 02:35:04,319
that that math was right I think is kind
 

8167
02:35:04,319 --> 02:35:05,870
that that math was right I think is kind
of a little bit malarkey

8168
02:35:05,870 --> 02:35:05,880
of a little bit malarkey
 

8169
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:08,570
of a little bit malarkey
and so the battery EV car is going to be

8170
02:35:08,570 --> 02:35:08,580
and so the battery EV car is going to be
 

8171
02:35:08,580 --> 02:35:10,070
and so the battery EV car is going to be
the same price as the thing and it's

8172
02:35:10,070 --> 02:35:10,080
the same price as the thing and it's
 

8173
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:12,770
the same price as the thing and it's
going to go to 40 50 percent

8174
02:35:12,770 --> 02:35:12,780
going to go to 40 50 percent
 

8175
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:14,510
going to go to 40 50 percent
um so we're already at this Tipping

8176
02:35:14,510 --> 02:35:14,520
um so we're already at this Tipping
 

8177
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:17,630
um so we're already at this Tipping
Point so we're kind of ready to go

8178
02:35:17,630 --> 02:35:17,640
Point so we're kind of ready to go
 

8179
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:19,790
Point so we're kind of ready to go
um in these other markets it's a little

8180
02:35:19,790 --> 02:35:19,800
um in these other markets it's a little
 

8181
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:21,349
um in these other markets it's a little
bit more complicated because there's a

8182
02:35:21,349 --> 02:35:21,359
bit more complicated because there's a
 

8183
02:35:21,359 --> 02:35:23,030
bit more complicated because there's a
lot of infrastructure that needs to get

8184
02:35:23,030 --> 02:35:23,040
lot of infrastructure that needs to get
 

8185
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:25,130
lot of infrastructure that needs to get
built so you know the the gene editing

8186
02:35:25,130 --> 02:35:25,140
built so you know the the gene editing
 

8187
02:35:25,140 --> 02:35:27,230
built so you know the the gene editing
thing as an example you know we have to

8188
02:35:27,230 --> 02:35:27,240
thing as an example you know we have to
 

8189
02:35:27,240 --> 02:35:28,910
thing as an example you know we have to
build a tool chain

8190
02:35:28,910 --> 02:35:28,920
build a tool chain
 

8191
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:32,150
build a tool chain
that looks more like

8192
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:32,160
that looks more like
 

8193
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:34,370
that looks more like
um code that you can write to Facebook

8194
02:35:34,370 --> 02:35:34,380
um code that you can write to Facebook
 

8195
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:37,130
um code that you can write to Facebook
is written in I think PHP originally HBO

8196
02:35:37,130 --> 02:35:37,140
is written in I think PHP originally HBO
 

8197
02:35:37,140 --> 02:35:39,650
is written in I think PHP originally HBO
which is I'm still a big fan of

02:35:39,650 --> 02:35:39,660
which is I'm still a big fan of
 

8199
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:42,230
which is I'm still a big fan of
sometimes you have to use the ugly

8200
02:35:42,230 --> 02:35:42,240
sometimes you have to use the ugly
 

8201
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:45,290
sometimes you have to use the ugly
solution and make it look good versus

8202
02:35:45,290 --> 02:35:45,300
solution and make it look good versus
 

8203
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:48,889
solution and make it look good versus
trying to come up with a good solution

8204
02:35:48,889 --> 02:35:48,899
trying to come up with a good solution
 

8205
02:35:48,899 --> 02:35:51,469
trying to come up with a good solution
um which will be too late let me ask you

8206
02:35:51,469 --> 02:35:51,479
um which will be too late let me ask you
 

8207
02:35:51,479 --> 02:35:53,750
um which will be too late let me ask you
you consider a run for governor of

8208
02:35:53,750 --> 02:35:53,760
you consider a run for governor of
 

8209
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:56,510
you consider a run for governor of
California then decided against it what

8210
02:35:56,510 --> 02:35:56,520
California then decided against it what
 

8211
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:59,450
California then decided against it what
went into each of these decisions and

8212
02:35:59,450 --> 02:35:59,460
went into each of these decisions and
 

8213
02:35:59,460 --> 02:36:01,490
went into each of these decisions and
broadly I should have maybe a selfish

02:36:01,490 --> 02:36:01,500
broadly I should have maybe a selfish

8217
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:09,349

is it over as a world leader for new

8218
02:36:09,349 --> 02:36:09,359
is it over as a world leader for new
 

8219
02:36:09,359 --> 02:36:10,790
is it over as a world leader for new
tech companies

8220
02:36:10,790 --> 02:36:10,800
tech companies
 

8221
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:15,830

as a this Beacon of Promise of young

02:36:15,830 --> 02:36:15,840
as a this Beacon of Promise of young
 

8223
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:17,870
as a this Beacon of Promise of young
minds stepping in and creating something

8224

that changes the world
I don't know if those two questions are

8228
02:36:21,290 --> 02:36:21,300
I don't know if those two questions are
 

8229
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:24,770
I don't know if those two questions are
connected so it's not it's not over but

8230
02:36:24,770 --> 02:36:24,780
connected so it's not it's not over but
 

8231
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:26,750
connected so it's not it's not over but
I think it's definitely

8232
02:36:26,750 --> 02:36:26,760
I think it's definitely

02:36:29,570 --> 02:36:29,580
we're in a challenging moment
 

8235
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:33,170
we're in a challenging moment
because

8236
02:36:33,170 --> 02:36:33,180

 

8237
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:35,150

so back to that analogy of the

8238
02:36:35,150 --> 02:36:35,160
so back to that analogy of the
 

8239
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:37,910
so back to that analogy of the
demographics if you think about the like

8240
02:36:37,910 --> 02:36:37,920
demographics if you think about the like
 

8241
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:40,910
demographics if you think about the like
if you bucketed forget like our relative

02:36:45,050 --> 02:36:45,060
but there's a bunch of us in this
 

8247
02:36:45,060 --> 02:36:49,250
but there's a bunch of us in this

mid 50s to mid 30s cohort of people that

02:39:47,630 --> 02:39:47,640
think is the actual cause of all of this
 

8415
02:39:47,640 --> 02:39:49,849
think is the actual cause of all of this
conflict and you try to expel them

8416
02:39:49,849 --> 02:39:49,859
conflict and you try to expel them
 

8417
02:39:49,859 --> 02:39:51,349
conflict and you try to expel them
the thing that wokeism doesn't

8418
02:39:51,349 --> 02:39:51,359
the thing that wokeism doesn't
 

8419
02:39:51,359 --> 02:39:52,790
the thing that wokeism doesn't
understand

8420
02:39:52,790 --> 02:39:52,800
understand
 

8421
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:55,429
understand
is that unless that person is truly to

8422
02:39:55,429 --> 02:39:55,439
is that unless that person is truly to
 

8423
02:39:55,439 --> 02:39:56,270
is that unless that person is truly to

8424
02:39:56,270 --> 02:39:56,280
blame
 

8425
02:39:56,280 --> 02:39:58,790
blame
the cycle just continues

8426
02:39:58,790 --> 02:39:58,800
the cycle just continues
 

8427
02:39:58,800 --> 02:40:01,730
the cycle just continues
and you know that was a that was a

8428
02:40:01,730 --> 02:40:01,740
and you know that was a that was a
 

8429
02:40:01,740 --> 02:40:03,770
and you know that was a that was a
framework that he developed that you

8430
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:03,780
framework that he developed that you
 

8431
02:40:03,780 --> 02:40:05,870
framework that he developed that you
know he's really conclusively proven to

8432
02:40:05,870 --> 02:40:05,880
know he's really conclusively proven to
 

8433
02:40:05,880 --> 02:40:08,030
know he's really conclusively proven to
be true and it's observable in humanity

8434
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:08,040
be true and it's observable in humanity
 

8435
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:09,830
be true and it's observable in humanity
in life

8436
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:09,840
in life
 

8437
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:13,190
in life
so these movements I think the extreme

8438
02:40:13,190 --> 02:40:13,200
so these movements I think the extreme
 

8439
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:15,590
so these movements I think the extreme
left and the extreme right

8440
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:15,600
left and the extreme right
 

8441
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:18,290
left and the extreme right
are trying to interpret away

8442
02:40:18,290 --> 02:40:18,300
are trying to interpret away
 

8443
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:20,510
are trying to interpret away
to allow people to compete for some

8444
02:40:20,510 --> 02:40:20,520
to allow people to compete for some
 

8445
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:23,210
to allow people to compete for some
scarce resource

8446
02:40:23,210 --> 02:40:23,220
scarce resource
 

8447
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:25,250
scarce resource
but I also think that in all of that

8448
02:40:25,250 --> 02:40:25,260
but I also think that in all of that
 

8449
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:27,410
but I also think that in all of that
what they don't realize is that they can

8450
02:40:27,410 --> 02:40:27,420
what they don't realize is that they can
 

8451
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:29,870
what they don't realize is that they can
scapegoat whoever they want but it's not

8452
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:29,880
scapegoat whoever they want but it's not
 

8453
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:32,330
scapegoat whoever they want but it's not
going to work because the the Bull Work

8454
02:40:32,330 --> 02:40:32,340
going to work because the the Bull Work
 

8455
02:40:32,340 --> 02:40:34,610
going to work because the the Bull Work
of people in the middle realize that

8456
02:40:34,610 --> 02:40:34,620
of people in the middle realize that
 

8457
02:40:34,620 --> 02:40:37,010
of people in the middle realize that
it's just not true

8458
02:40:37,010 --> 02:40:37,020
it's just not true
 

8459
02:40:37,020 --> 02:40:39,110
it's just not true
yeah they realize but they're still

8460
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:39,120
yeah they realize but they're still
 

8461
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:41,030
yeah they realize but they're still
because in leadership positions there's

8462
02:40:41,030 --> 02:40:41,040
because in leadership positions there's
 

8463
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:43,790
because in leadership positions there's
still momentum and they still scapegoat

8464
02:40:43,790 --> 02:40:43,800
still momentum and they still scapegoat
 

8465
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:45,349
still momentum and they still scapegoat
and they continue

8466
02:40:45,349 --> 02:40:45,359
and they continue
 

8467
02:40:45,359 --> 02:40:48,050
and they continue
and it seems to hurt the actual ability

8468
02:40:48,050 --> 02:40:48,060
and it seems to hurt the actual ability
 

8469
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:51,170
and it seems to hurt the actual ability
is more successful In fairness though if

8470
02:40:51,170 --> 02:40:51,180
is more successful In fairness though if
 

8471
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:52,790

you had to graph the effectiveness of

8472
02:40:52,790 --> 02:40:52,800
you had to graph the effectiveness of
 

8473
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:55,730
you had to graph the effectiveness of
that function it's decaying rapidly it's

8474
02:40:55,730 --> 02:40:55,740
that function it's decaying rapidly it's
 

8475
02:40:55,740 --> 02:40:57,230
that function it's decaying rapidly it's
the least effective it's ever been

8476
02:40:57,230 --> 02:40:57,240
the least effective it's ever been
 

8477
02:40:57,240 --> 02:40:59,030
the least effective it's ever been
you're absolutely right being canceled

8478
02:40:59,030 --> 02:40:59,040
you're absolutely right being canceled
 

8479
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:01,670
you're absolutely right being canceled
five years ago was a huge deal

8480
02:41:01,670 --> 02:41:01,680
five years ago was a huge deal
 

8481
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:04,490
five years ago was a huge deal
today I think it was Jordan Peterson on

8482
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:04,500
today I think it was Jordan Peterson on
 

8483
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:06,590
today I think it was Jordan Peterson on
your podcast he said I've been canceled

8484
02:41:06,590 --> 02:41:06,600
your podcast he said I've been canceled
 

8485
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:08,690
your podcast he said I've been canceled
and it was amazing he said 38 times or

8486
02:41:08,690 --> 02:41:08,700
and it was amazing he said 38 times or
 

8487
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:10,370
and it was amazing he said 38 times or
40 he said some number which was a

8488
02:41:10,370 --> 02:41:10,380
40 he said some number which was a
 

8489
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:12,770
40 he said some number which was a
ginormous number a that he kept account

8490
02:41:12,770 --> 02:41:12,780
ginormous number a that he kept account
 

8491
02:41:12,780 --> 02:41:14,870
ginormous number a that he kept account
of it and B was able to classify it yeah

8492
02:41:14,870 --> 02:41:14,880
of it and B was able to classify it yeah
 

8493
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:16,670
of it and B was able to classify it yeah
I'm like what classifier is going on in

8494
02:41:16,670 --> 02:41:16,680
I'm like what classifier is going on in
 

8495
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:18,590
I'm like what classifier is going on in
his mind where he's like Ah that's an

8496
02:41:18,590 --> 02:41:18,600
his mind where he's like Ah that's an
 

8497
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:20,030
his mind where he's like Ah that's an
attempt to cancel me but this one is not

8498
02:41:20,030 --> 02:41:20,040
attempt to cancel me but this one is not
 

8499
02:41:20,040 --> 02:41:23,510
attempt to cancel me but this one is not
but my point is was clearly not working

8500
02:41:23,510 --> 02:41:23,520
but my point is was clearly not working
 

8501
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:25,610
but my point is was clearly not working
and so the guy is still there and the

8502
02:41:25,610 --> 02:41:25,620
and so the guy is still there and the
 

8503
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:26,809
and so the guy is still there and the
guy is you know putting his view out

8504
02:41:26,809 --> 02:41:26,819
guy is you know putting his view out
 

8505
02:41:26,819 --> 02:41:28,309
guy is you know putting his view out
into the world

8506
02:41:28,309 --> 02:41:28,319
into the world
 

8507
02:41:28,319 --> 02:41:30,349
into the world
um and so it's not what not to judge

8508
02:41:30,349 --> 02:41:30,359
um and so it's not what not to judge
 

8509
02:41:30,359 --> 02:41:32,270
um and so it's not what not to judge
whether what he says is right or wrong

8510
02:41:32,270 --> 02:41:32,280
whether what he says is right or wrong
 

8511
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:34,130
whether what he says is right or wrong
it's just to observe that this mechanism

8512
02:41:34,130 --> 02:41:34,140
it's just to observe that this mechanism
 

8513
02:41:34,140 --> 02:41:36,950
it's just to observe that this mechanism
mechanism of action is now weakened but

8514
02:41:36,950 --> 02:41:36,960
mechanism of action is now weakened but
 

8515
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:39,050
mechanism of action is now weakened but
it's weakened because it's not the thing

8516
02:41:39,050 --> 02:41:39,060
it's weakened because it's not the thing
 

8517
02:41:39,060 --> 02:41:40,670
it's weakened because it's not the thing
that people think is really to blame

8518
02:41:40,670 --> 02:41:40,680
that people think is really to blame
 

8519
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:43,550
that people think is really to blame

scale a few times so let's not I'm sure
 

8523
02:41:45,720 --> 02:41:47,450
scale a few times so let's not I'm sure
it didn't feel small actually it wasn't

8524
02:41:47,450 --> 02:41:47,460
it didn't feel small actually it wasn't
 

8525
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:50,530
it didn't feel small actually it wasn't
small I'm trying to minimize

8526
02:41:50,530 --> 02:41:50,540
small I'm trying to minimize
 

8527
02:41:50,540 --> 02:41:53,270
small I'm trying to minimize

on is it uh I don't know if you can
share the the list of steps but is the

8550

share the the list of steps but is the
 

8551
02:42:26,399 --> 02:42:29,210
share the the list of steps but is the
fundamental core idea is that just life

you will give in to that Beast
 

8679
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:11,270
you will give in to that Beast
and it's not the end of the world and

8680
02:45:11,270 --> 02:45:11,280
and it's not the end of the world and
 

8681
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:13,610
and it's not the end of the world and
you'll recover from it I've made a lot

8682
02:45:13,610 --> 02:45:13,620

of mistakes
 

8685
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:18,170

but it requires a lot of energy

8686
02:45:18,170 --> 02:45:18,180
but it requires a lot of energy
 

8687
02:45:18,180 --> 02:45:21,050
but it requires a lot of energy
and sometimes it's just easier to just

8688
02:45:21,050 --> 02:45:21,060
and sometimes it's just easier to just
 

8689
02:45:21,060 --> 02:45:22,910
and sometimes it's just easier to just
stop and give up

8690
02:45:22,910 --> 02:45:22,920
stop and give up
 

8691
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:24,830

which made it even worse
 

8935
02:49:46,640 --> 02:49:49,309
which made it even worse
so I do not want absolute power well

so I do not want absolute power well
those are the people you do want to have

8938
02:49:51,110 --> 02:49:51,120
those are the people you do want to have
 

8939
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:53,150
those are the people you do want to have
power is the ones that don't want it

8940
02:49:53,150 --> 02:49:53,160
power is the ones that don't want it
 

8941
02:49:53,160 --> 02:49:56,330
power is the ones that don't want it
which is a a weird system to have

which is a a weird system to have
 

8943
02:49:56,340 --> 02:49:58,670
which is a a weird system to have
because then you in that kind of system

8944
02:49:58,670 --> 02:49:58,680
because then you in that kind of system
 

8945
02:49:58,680 --> 02:50:00,710
because then you in that kind of system
don't get the leaders

don't get the leaders
 

8947
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:03,469
don't get the leaders
that you should have because the ones

system what do you think let me sneak
 

8955
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:10,550
system what do you think let me sneak
this question in there what do you think

this question in there what do you think
is the meaning of life

8958
02:50:13,070 --> 02:50:13,080
is the meaning of life
 

8959
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:16,790
is the meaning of life
I don't well why are we here

8960
02:50:16,790 --> 02:50:16,800
I don't well why are we here
 

8961
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:18,530
I don't well why are we here
look up at the stars and think about

8962
02:50:18,530 --> 02:50:18,540
look up at the stars and think about
 

8963
02:50:18,540 --> 02:50:20,750
look up at the stars and think about
like the big

8964
02:50:20,750 --> 02:50:20,760
like the big
 

8965
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:23,750

8967
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:26,630

I think that it's a chance to just

8968
02:50:26,630 --> 02:50:26,640
I think that it's a chance to just
 

8969
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:29,270
I think that it's a chance to just
enjoy the ride

8970
02:50:29,270 --> 02:50:29,280
enjoy the ride
 

8971
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:31,849
enjoy the ride
I don't think it really like

8972
02:50:31,849 --> 02:50:31,859
I don't think it really like
 

8973
02:50:31,859 --> 02:50:34,250
I don't think it really like
I don't believe in this idea of Legacy

8974
02:50:34,250 --> 02:50:34,260
I don't believe in this idea of Legacy
 

8975
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:35,690
I don't believe in this idea of Legacy
that much

8976
02:50:35,690 --> 02:50:35,700
that much
 

8977
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:38,690
that much
I think it's a real trap

8978
02:50:38,690 --> 02:50:38,700
I think it's a real trap
 

8979
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:41,330
I think it's a real trap
so do you think you'll be forgotten by

8980
02:50:41,330 --> 02:50:41,340
so do you think you'll be forgotten by
 

8981
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:43,910
so do you think you'll be forgotten by
history I hope so I really really hope

8982
02:50:43,910 --> 02:50:43,920
history I hope so I really really hope
 

8983
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:46,070
history I hope so I really really hope
so because if you think about it there

8984
02:50:46,070 --> 02:50:46,080
so because if you think about it there
 

8985
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:47,150
so because if you think about it there
are two or three people that are

8986
02:50:47,150 --> 02:50:47,160
are two or three people that are
 

8987
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:49,190
are two or three people that are
remembered for positive things and

8988
02:50:49,190 --> 02:50:49,200
remembered for positive things and
 

8989
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:50,770
remembered for positive things and
everybody else it's all negative things

8990
02:50:50,770 --> 02:50:50,780
everybody else it's all negative things
 

8991
02:50:50,780 --> 02:50:53,330
everybody else it's all negative things
and the the likelihood that you'll be

8992
02:50:53,330 --> 02:50:53,340
and the the likelihood that you'll be
 

8993
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:55,370
and the the likelihood that you'll be
remembered for a positive thing is

8994
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:55,380
remembered for a positive thing is
 

8995
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:57,290
remembered for a positive thing is
harder and harder and harder and so the

8996
02:50:57,290 --> 02:50:57,300
harder and harder and harder and so the
 

8997
02:50:57,300 --> 02:50:59,450
harder and harder and harder and so the
surface area of being remembered is

8998
02:50:59,450 --> 02:50:59,460
surface area of being remembered is
 

8999
02:50:59,460 --> 02:51:02,090
surface area of being remembered is
negative and then the second what will

9000
02:51:02,090 --> 02:51:02,100
negative and then the second what will
 

9001
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:04,250
negative and then the second what will
it matter I'll be gone

9002
02:51:04,250 --> 02:51:04,260
it matter I'll be gone
 

9003
02:51:04,260 --> 02:51:08,030
it matter I'll be gone

02:55:07,490 --> 02:55:07,500
Offline that you would uh make me feel
 

9205
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:10,550
Offline that you would uh make me feel
like I'm worthwhile well can I just say

like I'm worthwhile well can I just say
something as just a Layman listener

9208
02:55:14,330 --> 02:55:14,340
something as just a Layman listener
 

9209
02:55:14,340 --> 02:55:17,389
something as just a Layman listener
um what you do just so I could give you

9210
02:55:17,389 --> 02:55:17,399
um what you do just so I could give you
 

9211
02:55:17,399 --> 02:55:18,590
um what you do just so I could give you
my version

9212
02:55:18,590 --> 02:55:18,600
my version
 

9213
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:21,769
my version
is that you take things

9214
02:55:21,769 --> 02:55:21,779
is that you take things
 

9215
02:55:21,779 --> 02:55:25,490
is that you take things
and people so ideas and people

9216
02:55:25,490 --> 02:55:25,500
and people so ideas and people
 

9217
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:28,550
and people so ideas and people
that are mostly behind a rope

9218
02:55:28,550 --> 02:55:28,560
that are mostly behind a rope
 

9219
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:31,130
that are mostly behind a rope
and you demystify it

9220
02:55:31,130 --> 02:55:31,140
and you demystify it
 

9221
02:55:31,140 --> 02:55:34,610
and you demystify it
and what that does for all of us is it

9222
02:55:34,610 --> 02:55:34,620
and what that does for all of us is it
 

9223
02:55:34,620 --> 02:55:36,590
and what that does for all of us is it
makes me feel

9224
02:55:36,590 --> 02:55:36,600
makes me feel
 

9225
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:38,150
makes me feel
like

9226
02:55:38,150 --> 02:55:38,160
like
 

9227
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:41,030
like
I can be a part of that

9228
02:55:41,030 --> 02:55:41,040
I can be a part of that
 

9229
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:42,830
I can be a part of that
and that's a really inspiring thing

9230
02:55:42,830 --> 02:55:42,840
and that's a really inspiring thing
 

9231
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:44,389
and that's a really inspiring thing
because you're not giving advice you're

9232
02:55:44,389 --> 02:55:44,399
because you're not giving advice you're
 

9233
02:55:44,399 --> 02:55:46,429
because you're not giving advice you're
not telling us how to solve the problem

9234
02:55:46,429 --> 02:55:46,439
not telling us how to solve the problem
 

9235
02:55:46,439 --> 02:55:49,010
not telling us how to solve the problem
but you're allowing it to be understood

9236
02:55:49,010 --> 02:55:49,020
but you're allowing it to be understood
 

9237
02:55:49,020 --> 02:55:51,950
but you're allowing it to be understood
in a way that's really

9238
02:55:51,950 --> 02:55:51,960
in a way that's really
 

9239
02:55:51,960 --> 02:55:53,750
in a way that's really
accessible

9240
02:55:53,750 --> 02:55:53,760
accessible
 

9241
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:55,550
accessible
and then you're intellectually curious

9242
02:55:55,550 --> 02:55:55,560
and then you're intellectually curious
 

9243
02:55:55,560 --> 02:55:58,010
and then you're intellectually curious
in ways that you know some of us would

9244
02:55:58,010 --> 02:55:58,020
in ways that you know some of us would
 

9245
02:55:58,020 --> 02:55:59,870
in ways that you know some of us would
never expect that we were and then you

9246
02:55:59,870 --> 02:55:59,880
never expect that we were and then you
 

9247
02:55:59,880 --> 02:56:02,269
never expect that we were and then you
kind of end up in this rabbit hole

9248
02:56:02,269 --> 02:56:02,279
kind of end up in this rabbit hole
 

9249
02:56:02,279 --> 02:56:03,530
kind of end up in this rabbit hole
um and then you have the courage to go

9250
02:56:03,530 --> 02:56:03,540
um and then you have the courage to go
 

9251
02:56:03,540 --> 02:56:05,030
um and then you have the courage to go
and talk to people that are really all

9252
02:56:05,030 --> 02:56:05,040
and talk to people that are really all
 

9253
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:06,710
and talk to people that are really all
over the map

9254
02:56:06,710 --> 02:56:06,720
over the map
 

9255
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:08,330
over the map
um like for example like I when I saw

9256
02:56:08,330 --> 02:56:08,340
