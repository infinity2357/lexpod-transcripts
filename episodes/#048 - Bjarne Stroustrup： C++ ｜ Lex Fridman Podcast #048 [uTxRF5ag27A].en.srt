116
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,180
me and then I just covered a simpler and
 

117
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,080
me and then I just covered a simpler and
that was much more fun and from there I

that was much more fun and from there I
 

119
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,310
that was much more fun and from there I
went to micro micro code so you were

120
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:55,320
went to micro micro code so you were
 

121
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,930
went to micro micro code so you were
drawn to the you found the low level

stuff beautiful I went through a lot of

124
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,000
stuff beautiful I went through a lot of
 

125
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,930
stuff beautiful I went through a lot of
languages and then I spent significant

126
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:05,940
languages and then I spent significant
 

127
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,770
languages and then I spent significant
time in in a simpler and micro code that

128
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:09,780
time in in a simpler and micro code that
 

129
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,690
time in in a simpler and micro code that
was sort of the first really profitable

130
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:11,700
was sort of the first really profitable
 

131
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,599
was sort of the first really profitable
things I paid for my Master's actually

133
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,690

and then I discovered Simula which was

and then I discovered Simula which was
 

135
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,539
and then I discovered Simula which was
absolutely great Simula simulation of

into programming at inheritance and
 

143
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,000
into programming at inheritance and
runtime polymorphism when they were

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,010
runtime polymorphism when they were
 

145
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,190
runtime polymorphism when they were
while they were doing it and that was a

146
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,200
while they were doing it and that was a
 

147
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,319
while they were doing it and that was a
language that taught me that you could

a surprise to me it was also a surprise
 

163
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,980
a surprise to me it was also a surprise
to me that a stricter type system than

164
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:05,990
to me that a stricter type system than
 

165
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,340
to me that a stricter type system than
Pascal's was helpful whereas Pascal's

166
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,350
Pascal's was helpful whereas Pascal's
 

167
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,270
Pascal's was helpful whereas Pascal's
type system got in my way all the time

168
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:12,280
type system got in my way all the time
 

169
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,449
type system got in my way all the time
so you need a strong type system to

170
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:16,459
so you need a strong type system to
 

171
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,449
so you need a strong type system to
organize your code well which has to be

172
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:19,459
organize your code well which has to be
 

173
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,270
organize your code well which has to be
extensible and flexible let's get into

the details a little bit what kind of if
 

177
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,720
the details a little bit what kind of if
you remember what kind of type system to

you remember what kind of type system to
 

179
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,690
you remember what kind of type system to
Pascal have what type system typing

180
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:28,700
Pascal have what type system typing
 

181
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,860
Pascal have what type system typing
system did the Algol 60 have basically

182
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:31,870
system did the Algol 60 have basically
 

183
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,070

193
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,600
moral tone to it that is if you can say
it in Pascal it's good and if you can't

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:52,610
it in Pascal it's good and if you can't
 

195
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,440
it in Pascal it's good and if you can't
it's not so good whereas

Simula large is basically to build your
 

199
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,640
Simula large is basically to build your
own type system so instead of trying to

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
dance language allowed you to build your
 

207
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,560
dance language allowed you to build your
own so it's sort of close to the

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,080
were mathematicians and they didn't
 

235
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,160
were mathematicians and they didn't
think in terms of type C but they

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,170
think in terms of type C but they
 

237
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,270
think in terms of type C but they
understood sets and classes of elements

238

understood sets and classes of elements
 

239
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,400
understood sets and classes of elements
and so they caught their types classes

240
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,410
and so they caught their types classes
 

241
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,260
and so they caught their types classes
and basically in C++ as in similar

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,370
and basically in C++ as in similar
classes are user defined type so can you

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:19,380
classes are user defined type so can you

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,500
classes are user defined type so can you

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:12,380
parker's and his team at IBM built a
 

277
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,550
parker's and his team at IBM built a
language that would allow you to to

278
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:15,560
language that would allow you to to
 

279
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,080
language that would allow you to to
write what you really wanted that is you

280
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,090
write what you really wanted that is you
 

281
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,880
write what you really wanted that is you
can write it in a language that was

282
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:21,890
can write it in a language that was
 

283
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,160
can write it in a language that was
natural for people now these people

284
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,170
natural for people now these people
 

285
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,590
natural for people now these people
happen to be engineers and physicists so

286
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:26,600
happen to be engineers and physicists so
 

287
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,630
happen to be engineers and physicists so
the language I came out was somewhat

288
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:28,640
the language I came out was somewhat
 

289
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,760
the language I came out was somewhat
unusual for the rest of the world but

290
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:30,770
unusual for the rest of the world but
 

291
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,010
unusual for the rest of the world but
basically they said formula translation

292
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,020
basically they said formula translation
 

293
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,480
basically they said formula translation
because they wanted to have the

294
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,490
because they wanted to have the
 

295
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,000
because they wanted to have the
mathematical formulas translated into

296
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,010
mathematical formulas translated into
 

297
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,620
mathematical formulas translated into
the machine and as a side effect

298
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:40,630
the machine and as a side effect
 

299
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,110
the machine and as a side effect
they got portability because now they

300
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,120
they got portability because now they
 

301
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,620
they got portability because now they
are writing in the terms that the humans

302
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:47,630
are writing in the terms that the humans
 

303
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,130
are writing in the terms that the humans
used and the way humans thought and then

304
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:51,140
used and the way humans thought and then
 

305
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,620
used and the way humans thought and then
they had a program that translated it

306
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:53,630
they had a program that translated it
 

307
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,100
they had a program that translated it
into the machines needs and that was new

308
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,110
into the machines needs and that was new
 

309
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,190
into the machines needs and that was new
and that was great and it's something to

310
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,200
and that was great and it's something to
 

311
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,400
and that was great and it's something to
remember we want to raise the language

312
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,410
remember we want to raise the language
 

313
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,910
remember we want to raise the language
to the human level but we don't want to

314
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:06,920
to the human level but we don't want to
 

315
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,570
to the human level but we don't want to
lose the efficiency so and the last

316
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:10,580
lose the efficiency so and the last
 

317
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,790
lose the efficiency so and the last
first step towards the human that was

318
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
first step towards the human that was
 

319
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,580
first step towards the human that was
the first step and of course they were

320
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:15,590
the first step and of course they were

back in the 60s Wow so this was one of

496
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
back in the 60s Wow so this was one of
 

497
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,500
back in the 60s Wow so this was one of
the early examples for why you needed

498
00:12:59,500 --> 00:12:59,510
the early examples for why you needed
 

499
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,730
the early examples for why you needed
inheritance and and you needed runtime

500
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:03,740
inheritance and and you needed runtime
 

501
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,000

handle this set of vehicles in a
 

505
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,770
handle this set of vehicles in a
manageable way you you you can't just

506
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:14,780
manageable way you you you can't just
 

507
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,470
manageable way you you you can't just
rewrite your code each time a new kind

508
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:17,480
rewrite your code each time a new kind
 

509
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,410
rewrite your code each time a new kind
of vehicle comes along yeah that's a

510
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:20,420
of vehicle comes along yeah that's a
 

511
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,020
of vehicle comes along yeah that's a
beautiful powerful idea and of course

512
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,030
beautiful powerful idea and of course
 

513
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,060
beautiful powerful idea and of course
that it stretches through your work who

514
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,070
that it stretches through your work who
 

515
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,080
that it stretches through your work who
C++ as we'll talk about but I think you

516
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,090
C++ as we'll talk about but I think you
 

517
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,720
C++ as we'll talk about but I think you
structured it nicely

518
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:30,730
structured it nicely
 

519
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,060
structured it nicely
what other breakthroughs came along in

520
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,070
what other breakthroughs came along in
 

521
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,590
what other breakthroughs came along in
the history of programming languages

522
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
the history of programming languages
 

523
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,110
the history of programming languages
they if we were to tell the history in

524
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,120
they if we were to tell the history in
 

525
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,080
they if we were to tell the history in
that way obviously I'm bitter telling

526
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,090
that way obviously I'm bitter telling
 

527
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,420
that way obviously I'm bitter telling
the part of the history that that is the

528
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,430
the part of the history that that is the
 

529
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,480
the part of the history that that is the

yeah you skipped the hippy

532
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:48,980
yeah you skipped the hippy

John McCarthy and Lisp or my favorite
 

535
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,430
John McCarthy and Lisp or my favorite
languages but listen what Lisp is not

00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
one of my favorite language yes it's
 

539
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,080
one of my favorite language yes it's
obviously important it's obviously

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,660
obviously important it's obviously
interesting lots of people write code in

interesting lots of people write code in
 

543
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,240
interesting lots of people write code in
it and then they rewrite it into C or

544
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,250
it and then they rewrite it into C or
 

545
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,100
it and then they rewrite it into C or
C++ when they want to go to production

like things to be too dynamic it is

556
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:26,840
like things to be too dynamic it is
 

557
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,830
like things to be too dynamic it is
really hard to write a piece of code

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:29,840
really hard to write a piece of code

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,010
really hard to write a piece of code
that's perfectly flexible that you can

00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,730
that's perfectly flexible that you can
also deploy on a small computer and that

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,680
also deploy on a small computer and that
you can also put in say a telephone

that flexibility and I'm quite aware

580
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:02,650
that flexibility and I'm quite aware
 

581
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:08,860
that flexibility and I'm quite aware
that maybe 70 80 percent of all code are

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,320
that maybe 70 80 percent of all code are
not under the kind of constraints I'm

not under the kind of constraints I'm
 

585
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,860
not under the kind of constraints I'm
interested in but somebody has to do the

working on the kind of problems I'm
interested in with the kind of

constraints that that I'm interested in
 

641
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,189
constraints that that I'm interested in
what can actually be done better because

642
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
what can actually be done better because
 

643
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,289
what can actually be done better because
we can surely do better than we do today

644
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:45,299
we can surely do better than we do today

we can surely do better than we do today
you've you've said that it's good for

you've you've said that it's good for
any professional programmer to know at

variety of languages that you've taken
 

653
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,650
variety of languages that you've taken
inspiration from and you've listed the

654
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:58,660
inspiration from and you've listed the
 

655
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,939
inspiration from and you've listed the
yours as being at least at the time C++

657
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:06,059

that list modify it if you don't have to

662
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:12,789
that list modify it if you don't have to
 

663
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:17,069
that list modify it if you don't have to
be constrained to just five but can you

664
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,079
be constrained to just five but can you
 

665
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,319
be constrained to just five but can you
describe what you picked up also from

666
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:19,329
describe what you picked up also from
 

667
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,500
describe what you picked up also from
each of these languages how you see them

668
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,510
each of these languages how you see them
 

669
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,779

00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:24,789
as inspirations for even you're working
 

671
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,409
as inspirations for even you're working
with C++ this is a very hard question to

672
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:28,419
with C++ this is a very hard question to
 

673
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:29,389
with C++ this is a very hard question to
answer

674
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:29,399
answer
 

675
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:33,350
answer
so about languages you should know

676
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
so about languages you should know
 

677
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,580
so about languages you should know
languages I I reckon I knew about

678
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:37,590
languages I I reckon I knew about
 

679
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,019
languages I I reckon I knew about
twenty-five or there abouts when I did

680
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:40,029
twenty-five or there abouts when I did
 

681
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:42,510
twenty-five or there abouts when I did
C++ it was easier than those days

682
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:42,520
C++ it was easier than those days
 

683
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,110
C++ it was easier than those days
because the languages were smaller and

684
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
because the languages were smaller and
 

685
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,370
because the languages were smaller and
you didn't have to learn a whole

686
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:47,380
you didn't have to learn a whole
 

687
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,039
you didn't have to learn a whole
programming environment and such to do

688
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:50,049
programming environment and such to do
 

689
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,539
programming environment and such to do
it you you could learn the language

690
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:51,549
it you you could learn the language
 

691
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:55,019
it you you could learn the language
quite easily and it's good to learn so

692
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:55,029
quite easily and it's good to learn so
 

693
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:58,260
quite easily and it's good to learn so
many languages and I imagine just like

694
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,270
many languages and I imagine just like
 

695
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,610
many languages and I imagine just like
with natural language for communication

696
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:01,620
with natural language for communication
 

697
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,320
with natural language for communication
there's different paradigms that emerge

698
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,330
there's different paradigms that emerge
 

699
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,680
there's different paradigms that emerge
in all of them yeah that there's

700
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:06,690
in all of them yeah that there's
 

701
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,380
in all of them yeah that there's
commonalities and so on so I picked fire

702
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,390
commonalities and so on so I picked fire
 

703
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,410
commonalities and so on so I picked fire
out of a head so far ahead obviously

704
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:13,420
out of a head so far ahead obviously
 

705
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,900
out of a head so far ahead obviously
well the important thing that the number

706
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:15,910
well the important thing that the number
 

707
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,770
well the important thing that the number
is not one that's right it's like I

708
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:19,780
is not one that's right it's like I
 

709
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,140
is not one that's right it's like I
don't like I mean if you're mono clot

710
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,150
don't like I mean if you're mono clot
 

711
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,330
don't like I mean if you're mono clot
you are likely to think that your own

712
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:24,340
you are likely to think that your own
 

713
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,490
you are likely to think that your own
culture is the only ones peer is

714
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:26,500
culture is the only ones peer is
 

715
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,070
culture is the only ones peer is
everybody else's a good learning of a

716
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,080
everybody else's a good learning of a
 

717
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,810
everybody else's a good learning of a
foreign language and a foreign culture

718
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:30,820
foreign language and a foreign culture
 

719
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,350
foreign language and a foreign culture
is important it helps you think and be a

720
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,360
is important it helps you think and be a
 

721
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,750
is important it helps you think and be a
better person with programming languages

722
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:36,760
better person with programming languages
 

723
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,060
better person with programming languages
you become a better programmer better

724
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,070
you become a better programmer better
 

725
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,880
you become a better programmer better
designer with the second language now

726
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:41,890
designer with the second language now
 

727
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,820
designer with the second language now
once you've got to the wage of five is

728
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:44,830
once you've got to the wage of five is
 

729
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,120
once you've got to the wage of five is
not that long it's the second one that's

730
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,130
not that long it's the second one that's
 

731
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,020
not that long it's the second one that's
most important and then when I had to

732
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,030
most important and then when I had to
 

733
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:57,780
most important and then when I had to
pick five I sort of thinking what kinds

734
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:57,790
pick five I sort of thinking what kinds
 

735
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,000
pick five I sort of thinking what kinds
of languages are there well there's a

736
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,010
of languages are there well there's a
 

737
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,370
of languages are there well there's a
really low level stuff it's good it's

738
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:02,380
really low level stuff it's good it's
 

739
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,310
really low level stuff it's good it's
actually good to know machine code movie

yes but I don't think I could appreciate
 

749
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,550
yes but I don't think I could appreciate
them if I actually didn't understand

ideas so cleanly that you can think
about it and the optimizer can

about it and the optimizer can
 

779
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,600
about it and the optimizer can
understand what you're up to

my favorite way of optimizing these days
 

783
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,110
my favorite way of optimizing these days
is to throw out the clever bits and see

if it's dawn runs fast and sometimes it
 

787
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,040
if it's dawn runs fast and sometimes it
runs faster so I need the abstraction

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,110
there was a beautiful keynote by Jason
 

795
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,760
there was a beautiful keynote by Jason
Turner

796
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:23,770
Turner
 

797
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,310
Turner
the CPP con a couple of years ago where

798
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
the CPP con a couple of years ago where
 

799
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,880
the CPP con a couple of years ago where
he decided he was going to program pong

800
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:29,890
he decided he was going to program pong
 

801
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:38,160
he decided he was going to program pong
on Motorola 6800 I think it was and he

802
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,170
on Motorola 6800 I think it was and he
 

803
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,380
on Motorola 6800 I think it was and he
says well this is relevant because it

804
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:40,390
says well this is relevant because it
 

805
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,900
says well this is relevant because it
looks like a microcontroller it has

806
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:42,910
looks like a microcontroller it has
 

807
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,210
looks like a microcontroller it has
specialized hardware it has not very

808
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:45,220
specialized hardware it has not very
 

809
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,880
specialized hardware it has not very
much memory and it's relatively slow and

810
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:47,890
much memory and it's relatively slow and
 

811
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,630
much memory and it's relatively slow and
so he shows in real time how he writes

812
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:51,640
so he shows in real time how he writes
 

813
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,110
so he shows in real time how he writes
pong starting with fairly

814
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
pong starting with fairly
 

815
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,000
pong starting with fairly
straightforward low-level stuff

816
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,010
straightforward low-level stuff
 

817
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,060
straightforward low-level stuff
improving his abstractions and what he's

818
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,070
improving his abstractions and what he's
 

819
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,900
improving his abstractions and what he's
doing he's writing C++ and it translate

820
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:03,910
doing he's writing C++ and it translate
 

821
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,230
doing he's writing C++ and it translate
into

822
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
into
 

823
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,450
into
in 286 assembler which you can do with

824
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:10,460
in 286 assembler which you can do with
 

825
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,980
in 286 assembler which you can do with
playing and you can see it in real-time

826
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:12,990
playing and you can see it in real-time
 

827
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,850
playing and you can see it in real-time
it's the compiled explora which you can

828
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:16,860
it's the compiled explora which you can
 

829
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,769
it's the compiled explora which you can
use on the web and then he wrote a

830
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:18,779
use on the web and then he wrote a
 

831
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,779
use on the web and then he wrote a
little program that translated 86

832
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:20,789
little program that translated 86
 

833
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:23,510
little program that translated 86
assembler into

834
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
assembler into
 

835
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,260
assembler into
Motorola has simpler and so he types and

836
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:27,270
Motorola has simpler and so he types and
 

837
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,000
Motorola has simpler and so he types and
you can see this thing in real time

838
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,010
you can see this thing in real time
 

839
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,740
you can see this thing in real time
while you can see it in real time and

840
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:30,750
while you can see it in real time and
 

841
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,110
while you can see it in real time and
even if you can't read the assembly code

842
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
even if you can't read the assembly code
 

843
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,970
even if you can't read the assembly code
you can just see it

844
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:34,980
you can just see it
 

845
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,639
you can just see it
his code gets better the code the

846
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:37,649
his code gets better the code the
 

847
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:41,180
his code gets better the code the
assembler gets Kimura he increases the

848
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,190
assembler gets Kimura he increases the
 

849
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,019
assembler gets Kimura he increases the
abstraction level uses C++ 11 as it were

850
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:45,029
abstraction level uses C++ 11 as it were
 

851
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:48,289
abstraction level uses C++ 11 as it were
better this code gets clean that gets

852
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:48,299
better this code gets clean that gets
 

853
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,080
better this code gets clean that gets
easier maintain the code shrinks and it

854
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,090
easier maintain the code shrinks and it
 

855
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:56,480
easier maintain the code shrinks and it
keeps shrinking and I could not in any

856
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,490
keeps shrinking and I could not in any
 

857
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,120
keeps shrinking and I could not in any
reasonable amount of time write that a

858
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,130
reasonable amount of time write that a
 

859
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,120
reasonable amount of time write that a
simpler as good as the compiler

860
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,130
simpler as good as the compiler
 

861
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,490
simpler as good as the compiler
generated from really a quite nice

862
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:04,500
generated from really a quite nice
 

863
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,210
generated from really a quite nice
modern C++ and I'll go as far as to say

864
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:08,220
modern C++ and I'll go as far as to say
 

865
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,620
modern C++ and I'll go as far as to say
the the thing that looked like C was

866
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:11,630
the the thing that looked like C was
 

867
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,409
the the thing that looked like C was
significantly uglier and and smaller

868
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:15,419
significantly uglier and and smaller
 

869
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,940
significantly uglier and and smaller
when it becames

870
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:16,950
when it becames
 

871
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,720
when it becames
and and larger when it became machine

872
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:20,730
and and larger when it became machine
 

873
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,350
and and larger when it became machine
code so what the the abstractions that

874
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:24,360
code so what the the abstractions that
 

875
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,860
code so what the the abstractions that
can be optimized important I would love

876
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:27,870
can be optimized important I would love
 

877
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,899
can be optimized important I would love
to see that kind of visualization larger

878
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:29,909
to see that kind of visualization larger
 

879
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:32,060
to see that kind of visualization larger
code bases yeah there might be blood a

880
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,070
code bases yeah there might be blood a
 

881
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,299
code bases yeah there might be blood a
few can't show a larger code base in a

882
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:35,309
few can't show a larger code base in a
 

883
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:37,310
few can't show a larger code base in a
one-hour talk and to have it fit on

884
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,320
one-hour talk and to have it fit on
 

885
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,490
one-hour talk and to have it fit on
screen right so that C is if you love so

886
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:40,500
screen right so that C is if you love so
 

887
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,769
screen right so that C is if you love so
my two languages would be machine code

888
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:42,779
my two languages would be machine code
 

889
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:47,060
my two languages would be machine code
and C++ and then I think you can learn a

890
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,070
and C++ and then I think you can learn a
 

891
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,899
and C++ and then I think you can learn a
lot from the functional languages so pig

892
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:50,909
lot from the functional languages so pig
 

893
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:53,450
lot from the functional languages so pig
has pralaya male I don't care which I

894
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:53,460
has pralaya male I don't care which I
 

895
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,310
has pralaya male I don't care which I
think actually you you'll you'll learn

896
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,320
think actually you you'll you'll learn
 

897
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,620
think actually you you'll you'll learn
the same lessons of expressing

898
00:22:59,620 --> 00:22:59,630
the same lessons of expressing
 

899
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,299
the same lessons of expressing
especially mathematical notions really

900
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:02,309
especially mathematical notions really
 

901
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:06,019
especially mathematical notions really
clearly and having the type system

902
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:06,029
clearly and having the type system
 

903
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:09,110
clearly and having the type system
that's really strict and then you should

904
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
that's really strict and then you should
 

905
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,720
that's really strict and then you should
probably have a language for sort of

906
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:11,730
probably have a language for sort of
 

907
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,769
probably have a language for sort of
quickly churning out something you could

908
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:15,779
quickly churning out something you could
 

909
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:18,680
quickly churning out something you could
pick JavaScript you could pick Python

910
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:18,690
pick JavaScript you could pick Python
 

911
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,019
pick JavaScript you could pick Python
you could pick Ruby really make of

912
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:21,029
you could pick Ruby really make of
 

913
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:23,659
you could pick Ruby really make of
JavaScript in general so you kind of

914
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:23,669
JavaScript in general so you kind of
 

915
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,720
JavaScript in general so you kind of
you're talking in the Platonic sense of

916
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:26,730
you're talking in the Platonic sense of
 

917
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,570
you're talking in the Platonic sense of
all languages about what they're good at

918
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:28,580
all languages about what they're good at
 

919
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,029
all languages about what they're good at
what their philosophy design is but

920
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:32,039
what their philosophy design is but
 

921
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,769
what their philosophy design is but
there's also a large user base behind

922
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:33,779
there's also a large user base behind
 

923
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,110
there's also a large user base behind
each of these languages and they use it

924
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,120
each of these languages and they use it
 

925
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,310
each of these languages and they use it
in the way

926
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,320
in the way
 

927
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,259
in the way
maybe it wasn't really designed for

928
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:39,269
maybe it wasn't really designed for
 

929
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,389
maybe it wasn't really designed for
that's right javascript is used way

930
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:41,399
that's right javascript is used way
 

931
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,700
that's right javascript is used way
beyond I probably put hooks design for

932
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:43,710
beyond I probably put hooks design for
 

933
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,769
beyond I probably put hooks design for
it let let me say it this way when you

934
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:45,779
it let let me say it this way when you
 

935
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:48,049
it let let me say it this way when you
build a tool you do not know how it's

936
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:48,059
build a tool you do not know how it's
 

937
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,899
build a tool you do not know how it's
going to be used you try to improve the

938
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:50,909
going to be used you try to improve the
 

939
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:53,120
going to be used you try to improve the
tool by looking at how it's being used

940
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,130
tool by looking at how it's being used
 

941
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,460
tool by looking at how it's being used
and when people cut their fingers off

942
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:55,470
and when people cut their fingers off
 

943
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,580
and when people cut their fingers off
and try and stop that from happening but

944
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:58,590
and try and stop that from happening but
 

945
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,950
and try and stop that from happening but
really you have no control over how

946
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
really you have no control over how
 

947
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,980
really you have no control over how
something is used so I'm very happy and

948
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:03,990
something is used so I'm very happy and
 

949
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,570
something is used so I'm very happy and
proud of some of the things he plus

950
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:05,580
proud of some of the things he plus
 

951
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,909
proud of some of the things he plus
plaus being used at and some of the

00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:10,370
lead to fatalities so how do you how do
 

1113
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,900
lead to fatalities so how do you how do
we test software systems like these

1114
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:12,910
we test software systems like these
 

1115
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:17,830
we test software systems like these
first of all safety like performance and

1116
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
first of all safety like performance and
 

1117
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,950
first of all safety like performance and
like security is a systems property

1118
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
like security is a systems property
 

1119
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,750
like security is a systems property
people tend to look at one part of a

00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
people tend to look at one part of a
 

1121
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,120
people tend to look at one part of a
system at a time and saying something

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,130
system at a time and saying something
 

1123
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,540
system at a time and saying something
like this is secure that's all right I

1124
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:31,550
like this is secure that's all right I
 

1125
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,570
like this is secure that's all right I
don't need to do that yeah that piece of

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:34,580
don't need to do that yeah that piece of
 

1127
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,760
don't need to do that yeah that piece of
code is secure I'll buy your operator

00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:36,770
code is secure I'll buy your operator
 

1129
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,050

00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,060
right if you want to have reliability if
 

1131
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,240
right if you want to have reliability if
you want to have performance if you want

you want to have performance if you want
 

1133
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,400
you want to have performance if you want
to have security you have to look at the

1134
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,410
to have security you have to look at the
 

1135
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,160
to have security you have to look at the
whole system I did not expect you to say

1167
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,700
I'll probably try SQL injection and it's
very true if you think about safety or

00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:35,670
to make sure that when you want to

about a problem is not in the code there
is a missing piece that's just in your

is a missing piece that's just in your
 

1221
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,830
is a missing piece that's just in your

it's these years to find errors is

1232
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,320
it's these years to find errors is
 

1233
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,680
it's these years to find errors is
easier to make modifications it's

1234
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:15,690
easier to make modifications it's
 

1235
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,590
easier to make modifications it's
actually easier to test it and lo and

1236
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:18,600
actually easier to test it and lo and
 

1237
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,120
actually easier to test it and lo and
behold it runs faster

1238
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,130
behold it runs faster
 

1239
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,120
behold it runs faster
and therefore you can use a smaller

1240
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,130
and therefore you can use a smaller
 

1241
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,310
and therefore you can use a smaller
number of computers which means there's

1242
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,320
number of computers which means there's
 

1243
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,720
number of computers which means there's
less hardware that could possibly break

1244
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:29,730
less hardware that could possibly break
 

1245
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,420
less hardware that could possibly break
so I think the key here is

1246
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:32,430
so I think the key here is
 

1247
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,960
so I think the key here is
simplification but it has to be to use

1248
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:36,970
simplification but it has to be to use
 

1249
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,820
simplification but it has to be to use
the Einstein code as simple as possible

1250
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:38,830
the Einstein code as simple as possible
 

1251
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,880
the Einstein code as simple as possible
and no simpler not simpler well there

1252
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:41,890
and no simpler not simpler well there
 

1253
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,310
and no simpler not simpler well there

00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:48,790
in C++ but in the domain I'm dealing

that's the simplification I'm after so

that's the simplification I'm after so
how do you inspire or ensure that the

how do you inspire or ensure that the
Einstein level simplification is reached

1266
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:02,470
Einstein level simplification is reached
 

1267
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,480
Einstein level simplification is reached
so okay can you do code review can you

1268
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:06,490
so okay can you do code review can you
 

1269
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,140
so okay can you do code review can you
look at code is there if I gave you the

1270
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,150
look at code is there if I gave you the
 

1271
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:15,020
look at code is there if I gave you the
code for the Ford f-150 and said here is

1272
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,030
code for the Ford f-150 and said here is
 

1273
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:19,140
code for the Ford f-150 and said here is
this a mess or is this okay is it

1274
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,150
this a mess or is this okay is it
 

1275
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,000
this a mess or is this okay is it
possible to tell is it possible to

1276
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,010
possible to tell is it possible to
 

1277
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:26,190
possible to tell is it possible to
regulate an experienced developer can do

1278
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:26,200
regulate an experienced developer can do
 

1279
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,310
regulate an experienced developer can do
it code and see if it smells you know

1280
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:29,320
it code and see if it smells you know
 

1281
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,600
it code and see if it smells you know
I'm mixed metaphors deliberately yes the

1282
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:33,610
I'm mixed metaphors deliberately yes the
 

1283
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:40,650
I'm mixed metaphors deliberately yes the
the point is that it is hard to generate

1284
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:40,660
the point is that it is hard to generate
 

1285
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,030
the point is that it is hard to generate
something that is really obviously clean

1286
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,040
something that is really obviously clean
 

1287
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,160
something that is really obviously clean
and can be appreciated but you can

1288
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,170
and can be appreciated but you can
 

1289
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,480
and can be appreciated but you can
usually recognize when you haven't

1290
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:51,490
usually recognize when you haven't
 

1291
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,730
usually recognize when you haven't
reached that point and so if I I've

1292
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:56,740
reached that point and so if I I've
 

1293
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:02,310
reached that point and so if I I've
never looked at me if 150 code so I

1294
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,320
never looked at me if 150 code so I
 

1295
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,530
never looked at me if 150 code so I
wouldn't know but but I know what I

1296
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:04,540
wouldn't know but but I know what I
 

1297
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,240
wouldn't know but but I know what I
ought to be looking for there I'll be

1298
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,250
ought to be looking for there I'll be
 

1299
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,090
ought to be looking for there I'll be
looking for some tricks that correlates

1300
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,100
looking for some tricks that correlates
 

1301
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,440
looking for some tricks that correlates
with bugs and elsewhere and I have tried

1302
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:13,450
with bugs and elsewhere and I have tried
 

1303
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,890
with bugs and elsewhere and I have tried
to formulate rules for what what good

1304
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:16,900
to formulate rules for what what good
 

1305
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:22,350
to formulate rules for what what good
code looks like and the current version

1306
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,360
code looks like and the current version
 

1307
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,180
code looks like and the current version
of that is called the C++ core

1308
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,190
of that is called the C++ core
 

1309
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,820
of that is called the C++ core

1311
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,590

one thing people should remember is

1312
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,600
one thing people should remember is
 

1313
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,919
one thing people should remember is
there's what you can do in a language

1314
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:32,929
there's what you can do in a language
 

1315
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,340
there's what you can do in a language
and what you should do in a language you

1316
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:36,350
and what you should do in a language you
 

1317
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,029
and what you should do in a language you
have lots of things that is necessary in

1318
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:40,039
have lots of things that is necessary in
 

1319
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:42,669
have lots of things that is necessary in
some context but not another's as things

1320
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:42,679
some context but not another's as things
 

1321
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:45,640
some context but not another's as things
that exist just because there's 30 year

1322
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:45,650
that exist just because there's 30 year
 

1323
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,620
that exist just because there's 30 year
old code out there and you can't get rid

1324
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:47,630
old code out there and you can't get rid
 

1325
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,350
old code out there and you can't get rid
of it but you can't have rules it says

1326
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:50,360
of it but you can't have rules it says
 

1327
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,330
of it but you can't have rules it says
when you create it try and follow these

1328
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:52,340
when you create it try and follow these
 

1329
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:58,600
when you create it try and follow these
rules this does not create good programs

1330
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:58,610
rules this does not create good programs
 

1331
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,270
rules this does not create good programs
by themselves but it limits the damage

1332
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:01,280
by themselves but it limits the damage
 

1333
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,390
by themselves but it limits the damage
and off for mistakes it limits the

1334
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:04,400
and off for mistakes it limits the
 

1335
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,659
and off for mistakes it limits the
possibilities of the mistakes and

1336
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:06,669
possibilities of the mistakes and
 

1337
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,520
possibilities of the mistakes and
basically we are trying to say what is

1338
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:09,530
basically we are trying to say what is
 

1339
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,330
basically we are trying to say what is
it that a good programmer does at the

1340
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:13,340
it that a good programmer does at the
 

1341
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,940
it that a good programmer does at the
fairly simple level of where you use the

1342
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:15,950
fairly simple level of where you use the
 

1343
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,090
fairly simple level of where you use the
language and how you use it now I can

1344
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,100
language and how you use it now I can
 

1345
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,240
language and how you use it now I can
move all the rules for chiseling in my

move all the rules for chiseling in my

move all the rules for chiseling in my
marble it doesn't mean that somebody who

marble it doesn't mean that somebody who
 

1349
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,210
marble it doesn't mean that somebody who
follows all of those rules can do a

00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:28,220
follows all of those rules can do a

that is there something else to write a

00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:34,820
that is there something else to write a
 

1355
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,700
that is there something else to write a
good program just is there something

00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:37,710
good program just is there something
 

1357
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,330
good program just is there something
else to create important work of art

1358
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:41,340
else to create important work of art
 

1359
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,370
else to create important work of art
that is there's some kind of inspiration

1360
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:45,380
that is there's some kind of inspiration
 

1361
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:51,500
that is there's some kind of inspiration
understanding gift but we can approach

1362
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,510
understanding gift but we can approach
 

1363
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,120
understanding gift but we can approach
the sort of technical the the

1364
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,130
the sort of technical the the
 

1365
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:00,200
the sort of technical the the
craftsmanship level of it the the the

1366
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,210
craftsmanship level of it the the the
 

1367
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,260
craftsmanship level of it the the the
famous painters the famous cultures was

1368
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:03,270
famous painters the famous cultures was
 

1369
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,960
famous painters the famous cultures was
among other things

1370
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:04,970
among other things
 

1371
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,780
among other things
superb craftsmen they could express

1372
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:08,790
superb craftsmen they could express
 

1373
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,370
superb craftsmen they could express
their ideas using their tools very well

1374
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:13,380
their ideas using their tools very well
 

1375
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,020
their ideas using their tools very well
and so these days I think what I'm doing

1376
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,030
and so these days I think what I'm doing
 

1377
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,700
and so these days I think what I'm doing
what a lot of people are doing we're

1378
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:19,710
what a lot of people are doing we're
 

1379
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,950
what a lot of people are doing we're
still trying to figure out how it is to

1380
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:21,960
still trying to figure out how it is to
 

1381
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,490
still trying to figure out how it is to
use our tools very well for a really

1382
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:25,500
use our tools very well for a really
 

1383
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,110
use our tools very well for a really
good piece of code you need a spark of

1384
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,120
good piece of code you need a spark of
 

1385
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,760
good piece of code you need a spark of
inspiration and you can't

1386
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:31,770
inspiration and you can't
 

1387
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,910
inspiration and you can't
I think regulate that you you cannot say

1388
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:34,920
I think regulate that you you cannot say
 

1389
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,730
I think regulate that you you cannot say
that I'll take a picture

1390
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:37,740
that I'll take a picture
 

1391
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,460
that I'll take a picture
only I'll buy your picture only if

1392
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:40,470
only I'll buy your picture only if
 

1393
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:46,100
only I'll buy your picture only if
you're at least then go there are things

1394
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,110
you're at least then go there are things
 

1395
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,070
you're at least then go there are things
you can regulate but not the inspiration

1396
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:49,080
you can regulate but not the inspiration
 

1397
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,000
you can regulate but not the inspiration
I think that's quite beautifully put it

1398
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,010
I think that's quite beautifully put it
 

1399
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:57,020
I think that's quite beautifully put it
is true that there is there's an

1400
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,030
is true that there is there's an
 

1401
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,090
is true that there is there's an
experienced programmer when you see code

1402
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,100
experienced programmer when you see code
 

1403
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:05,170
experienced programmer when you see code
that's inspired that's like Michelangelo

1404
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:05,180
that's inspired that's like Michelangelo
 

1405
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,310
that's inspired that's like Michelangelo
you know it when you see it

1406
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,320
you know it when you see it
 

1407
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,780
you know it when you see it
and the opposite of that is code that is

1408
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:11,790
and the opposite of that is code that is
 

1409
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,390
and the opposite of that is code that is
messy code that smells you know when you

1410
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,400
messy code that smells you know when you
 

1411
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,550
messy code that smells you know when you
see it and I'm not sure you can describe

1412
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560
see it and I'm not sure you can describe
 

1413
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,130
see it and I'm not sure you can describe
it in words except vaguely through

1414
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:19,140
it in words except vaguely through
 

1415
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,460
it in words except vaguely through
guidelines and so on yes it's easier to

1416
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:22,470
guidelines and so on yes it's easier to
 

1417
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,810
guidelines and so on yes it's easier to
recognize ugly than to recognize beauty

1418
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:25,820
recognize ugly than to recognize beauty
 

1419
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,940
recognize ugly than to recognize beauty
in code and for the reason is that

1420
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:28,950
in code and for the reason is that
 

1421
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,340
in code and for the reason is that
sometimes beauty comes from something

1422
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:31,350
sometimes beauty comes from something
 

1423
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,430
sometimes beauty comes from something
that's innovative and unusual and you

1424
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:34,440
that's innovative and unusual and you
 

1425
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,040
that's innovative and unusual and you
have to sometimes think reasonably hard

1426
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,050
have to sometimes think reasonably hard
 

1427
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,300
have to sometimes think reasonably hard
to appreciate that

1428
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:38,310
to appreciate that
 

1429
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,850
to appreciate that
on the other hand the misses have things

1430
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:42,860
on the other hand the misses have things
 

1431
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,720
on the other hand the misses have things
in common and you can you can have

1432
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:46,730
in common and you can you can have
 

1433
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,330
in common and you can you can have
static checkers dynamic checkers that

1434
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:49,340
static checkers dynamic checkers that
 

1435
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:56,050
static checkers dynamic checkers that
finds large number of the most common

1436
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:56,060
finds large number of the most common
 

1437
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,460
finds large number of the most common
mistakes you can catch a lot of

1438
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:00,470
mistakes you can catch a lot of
 

1439
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,250
mistakes you can catch a lot of
sloppiness mechanically I'm a great fan

1440
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:03,260
sloppiness mechanically I'm a great fan
 

1441
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:08,260
sloppiness mechanically I'm a great fan
of static analysis in particular because

1442
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,270
of static analysis in particular because
 

1443
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,700
of static analysis in particular because
you can check for not just the language

1444
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:09,710
you can check for not just the language
 

1445
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,310
you can check for not just the language
rules but for the usage of language

1446
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,320
rules but for the usage of language
 

1447
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,670
rules but for the usage of language
rules and I think we will see much more

1448
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:15,680
rules and I think we will see much more
 

1449
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,370
rules and I think we will see much more
static analysis in the coming decade

1450
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:18,380
static analysis in the coming decade
 

1451
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,020
static analysis in the coming decade
clear the drive word static analysis you

1452
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,030
clear the drive word static analysis you
 

1453
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:26,740
clear the drive word static analysis you
represent a piece of code so that you

1454
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:26,750
represent a piece of code so that you
 

1455
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,610
represent a piece of code so that you
can write a program that goes or that

1456
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:30,620
can write a program that goes or that
 

1457
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,310
can write a program that goes or that
representation and look for things that

1458
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,320
representation and look for things that
 

1459
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,590
representation and look for things that
are right and not right so for instance

1460
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:38,600
are right and not right so for instance
 

1461
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:45,630
are right and not right so for instance
you can analyze a program to see if

1462
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:45,640

 

1463
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,970

resources are leaked that's one of my

1464
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:48,980
resources are leaked that's one of my
 

1465
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,440
resources are leaked that's one of my
favorite problems it's not actually all

1466
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,450
favorite problems it's not actually all
 

1467
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,530
favorite problems it's not actually all
that hard and one C++ but you can do it

1468
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:56,540
that hard and one C++ but you can do it
 

1469
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,050
that hard and one C++ but you can do it
if you were writing in the C level you

1470
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,060
if you were writing in the C level you
 

1471
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,160
if you were writing in the C level you
have to have a Murloc and a free and

1472
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,170
have to have a Murloc and a free and
 

1473
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,440
have to have a Murloc and a free and
they have to match if you have them in a

1474
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:05,450
they have to match if you have them in a
 

1475
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,590
they have to match if you have them in a
single function you can usually do it

1476
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:08,600
single function you can usually do it
 

1477
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,130
single function you can usually do it
very easily if there's a man log here

1478
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:12,140
very easily if there's a man log here
 

1479
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,680
very easily if there's a man log here
there should be a free there on the

1480
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:14,690
there should be a free there on the
 

1481
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,630
there should be a free there on the
other hand in between can be drawing

1482
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,640
other hand in between can be drawing
 

1483
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,370
other hand in between can be drawing
complete code and then it becomes

1484
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:18,380
complete code and then it becomes
 

1485
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,580
complete code and then it becomes
impossible yeah if you pass that pointer

1486
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:21,590
impossible yeah if you pass that pointer
 

1487
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:26,010
impossible yeah if you pass that pointer
to the memory out of a function and then

1488
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,020
to the memory out of a function and then
 

1489
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,940
to the memory out of a function and then
want to make sure that the free is done

1490
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:29,950
want to make sure that the free is done
 

1491
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,320
want to make sure that the free is done
somewhere else now it gets really

1492
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,330
somewhere else now it gets really
 

1493
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,650
somewhere else now it gets really
difficult and so for static analysis you

1494
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:35,660
difficult and so for static analysis you
 

1495
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,170
difficult and so for static analysis you
can run through a program and you can

1496
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:38,180
can run through a program and you can
 

1497
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,560
can run through a program and you can
try and figure out if there's any leaks

1498
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:41,570
try and figure out if there's any leaks
 

1499
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,330
try and figure out if there's any leaks
and what you will properly find is that

1500
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:46,340
and what you will properly find is that
 

1501
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,910
and what you will properly find is that
you will find some leaks and you'll find

1502
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:48,920
you will find some leaks and you'll find
 

1503
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,370
you will find some leaks and you'll find
quite a few places where your analysis

1504
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:51,380
quite a few places where your analysis
 

1505
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,880
quite a few places where your analysis
can't be complete it might depend on

1506
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:54,890
can't be complete it might depend on
 

1507
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,260
can't be complete it might depend on
runtime it might

1508
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,270
runtime it might
 

1509
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:00,160
runtime it might
depend on the cleverness of your

1510
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,170
depend on the cleverness of your
 

1511
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,430
depend on the cleverness of your
analyzer and it might take a long time

1512
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:03,440
analyzer and it might take a long time
 

1513
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,530
analyzer and it might take a long time
some of these programs run for a long

1514
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:05,540
some of these programs run for a long
 

1515
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:11,640
some of these programs run for a long
time but if you combine such analysis

1516
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:11,650
time but if you combine such analysis
 

1517
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,890
time but if you combine such analysis
with a set of rules it says how people

1518
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:14,900
with a set of rules it says how people
 

1519
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,410
with a set of rules it says how people
could use it you can actually see why

1520
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:17,420
could use it you can actually see why
 

1521
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,890
could use it you can actually see why
the rules are violated and that stops

1522
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:20,900
the rules are violated and that stops
 

1523
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,850
the rules are violated and that stops
you from getting into the impossible

1524
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:23,860
you from getting into the impossible
 

1525
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,530
you from getting into the impossible
complexities you don't want to solve the

1526
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:26,540
complexities you don't want to solve the
 

1527
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,890
complexities you don't want to solve the
halting problem the static analysis is

1528
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:29,900
halting problem the static analysis is
 

1529
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,600
halting problem the static analysis is
looking at the code without running the

1530
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:31,610
looking at the code without running the
 

1531
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:37,600
looking at the code without running the
code yes and thereby it's almost not in

1532
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:37,610
code yes and thereby it's almost not in
 

1533
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,100
code yes and thereby it's almost not in
production code but it's almost like an

1534
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,110
production code but it's almost like an
 

1535
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,650
production code but it's almost like an
educational tool of how the language

1536
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:41,660
educational tool of how the language
 

1537
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,880
educational tool of how the language
should be used it's guys you like it is

1538
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:45,890
should be used it's guys you like it is
 

1539
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,820
should be used it's guys you like it is
best right it would guide you in how you

1540
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:48,830
best right it would guide you in how you
 

1541
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,280
best right it would guide you in how you
write future code as well and you learn

1542
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,290
write future code as well and you learn
 

1543
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,520
write future code as well and you learn
together yes so basically you need a set

1544
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:54,530
together yes so basically you need a set
 

1545
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,560
together yes so basically you need a set
of rules for how you use the language

1546
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:56,570
of rules for how you use the language
 

1547
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,610
of rules for how you use the language
then you need a static analysis that

1548
00:39:59,610 --> 00:39:59,620
then you need a static analysis that
 

1549
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,270
then you need a static analysis that
catches your mistakes when you violate

1550
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:04,280
catches your mistakes when you violate
 

1551
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,970
catches your mistakes when you violate
the rules or when your code ends up

1552
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:06,980
the rules or when your code ends up
 

1553
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,610
the rules or when your code ends up
doing things that it shouldn't despite

1554
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:09,620
doing things that it shouldn't despite
 

1555
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,320
doing things that it shouldn't despite
the rules because there's the language

1556
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,330
the rules because there's the language
 

1557
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:15,280
the rules because there's the language
rules you can go further and again it's

1558
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,290
rules you can go further and again it's
 

1559
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,230
rules you can go further and again it's
back to my idea that I would much rather

1560
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,240
back to my idea that I would much rather
 

1561
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,810
back to my idea that I would much rather
find errors before I start running the

1562
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:19,820
find errors before I start running the
 

1563
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,380
find errors before I start running the
code if nothing else once the code runs

1564
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:23,390
code if nothing else once the code runs
 

1565
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,200
code if nothing else once the code runs
if it catches an error at run times I

1566
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,210
if it catches an error at run times I
 

1567
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,810
if it catches an error at run times I
have to have an error handler and one of

1568
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:28,820
have to have an error handler and one of
 

1569
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,200
have to have an error handler and one of
the hardest things to write in code is

1570
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,210
the hardest things to write in code is
 

1571
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,300
the hardest things to write in code is
their handling code because you know

1572
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:34,310
their handling code because you know
 

1573
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,550
their handling code because you know
something went wrong

1574
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:35,560
something went wrong
 

1575
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,380
something went wrong
do you know really exactly what went

1576
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:38,390
do you know really exactly what went
 

1577
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,380
do you know really exactly what went
wrong usually not how can you recover

1578
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,390
wrong usually not how can you recover
 

1579
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,030
wrong usually not how can you recover
when you don't know what the problem was

1580
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,040
when you don't know what the problem was
 

1581
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,760
when you don't know what the problem was
you can't be a hundred percent sure what

1582
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:45,770
you can't be a hundred percent sure what
 

1583
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,600
you can't be a hundred percent sure what
the problem was in many many cases and

1584
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:48,610
the problem was in many many cases and
 

1585
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:53,260
the problem was in many many cases and
this is this is part of it so yes we

1586
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:53,270
this is this is part of it so yes we
 

1587
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,230
this is this is part of it so yes we
need good languages or good type systems

1588
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,240
need good languages or good type systems
 

1589
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,110
need good languages or good type systems
we need rules for how to use them we

1590
00:40:59,110 --> 00:40:59,120
we need rules for how to use them we
 

1591
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,930
we need rules for how to use them we
need static analysis and the ultimate

1592
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:01,940
need static analysis and the ultimate
 

1593
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,790
need static analysis and the ultimate
for static analysis is of course program

1594
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:03,800
for static analysis is of course program
 

1595
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,970
for static analysis is of course program
proof but that still doesn't scale so

1596
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:06,980
proof but that still doesn't scale so
 

1597
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,700
proof but that still doesn't scale so
the kind of systems we deploy

1598
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:09,710
the kind of systems we deploy
 

1599
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,510
the kind of systems we deploy
then we start needing testing and the

1600
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,520
then we start needing testing and the
 

1601
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,310
then we start needing testing and the
rest of the stuff so C++ is an

1602
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:18,320
rest of the stuff so C++ is an
 

1603
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,930
rest of the stuff so C++ is an
object-oriented programming language

1604
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:19,940
object-oriented programming language
 

1605
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,540
object-oriented programming language
that creates especially with its newer

1606
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:22,550
that creates especially with its newer
 

1607
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,370
that creates especially with its newer
versions as we'll talk about higher and

1608
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:24,380
versions as we'll talk about higher and
 

1609
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,420
versions as we'll talk about higher and
higher levels of abstraction so how do

1610
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:28,430
higher levels of abstraction so how do
 

1611
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,690
higher levels of abstraction so how do
you design let's even go back to the

1612
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:31,700
you design let's even go back to the
 

1613
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,880
you design let's even go back to the
origin C++ how you design something with

1614
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:33,890
origin C++ how you design something with
 

1615
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,880
origin C++ how you design something with
so much abstraction that's still

1616
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:36,890
so much abstraction that's still
 

1617
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,680
so much abstraction that's still
efficient and is still something that

1618
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:41,690
efficient and is still something that
 

1619
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:46,540
efficient and is still something that
you can manage do static analysis on you

1620
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:46,550
you can manage do static analysis on you
 

1621
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,290
you can manage do static analysis on you
can have constraints on they can be

1622
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:49,300
can have constraints on they can be
 

1623
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,310
can have constraints on they can be
reliable those things we've talked about

1624
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:51,320
reliable those things we've talked about
 

1625
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,290
reliable those things we've talked about
so create the to me slightly there's a

1626
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:56,300
so create the to me slightly there's a
 

1627
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
so create the to me slightly there's a
slight tension between high-level

1628
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:58,310
slight tension between high-level
 

1629
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,109
slight tension between high-level
abstraction and efficiency that's a good

1630
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:02,119
abstraction and efficiency that's a good
 

1631
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,450
abstraction and efficiency that's a good
question I could probably have a year's

1632
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:04,460
question I could probably have a year's
 

1633
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,710
question I could probably have a year's
course just trying to answer it yes

1634
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:08,720
course just trying to answer it yes
 

1635
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,870
course just trying to answer it yes
there's a tension between efficiency and

1636
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:10,880
there's a tension between efficiency and
 

1637
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,980
there's a tension between efficiency and
abstraction but you also get the

1638
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:14,990
abstraction but you also get the
 

1639
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,720
abstraction but you also get the
interesting situation that you get the

1640
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:16,730
interesting situation that you get the
 

1641
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,520
interesting situation that you get the
best efficiency out of the best

1642
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:18,530
best efficiency out of the best
 

1643
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:23,640
best efficiency out of the best
abstraction and my main tool for

1644
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:23,650
abstraction and my main tool for
 

1645
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,200
abstraction and my main tool for
efficiency for performance actually is

1646
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,210
efficiency for performance actually is
 

1647
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,099
efficiency for performance actually is
abstraction so let's go back to how C++

1648
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:30,109
abstraction so let's go back to how C++
 

1649
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:33,190
abstraction so let's go back to how C++
got there yeah you said it was up to

1650
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,200
got there yeah you said it was up to
 

1651
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,900
got there yeah you said it was up to
Rory in the programming language I

1652
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:34,910
Rory in the programming language I
 

1653
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,990
Rory in the programming language I
actually never said that it's always

1654
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,000
actually never said that it's always
 

1655
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,630
actually never said that it's always
quoted but I never did I said C++

1656
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:40,640
quoted but I never did I said C++
 

1657
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,300
quoted but I never did I said C++
supports object-oriented programming but

1658
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:43,310
supports object-oriented programming but
 

1659
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,870
supports object-oriented programming but
it's nine other techniques and that

1660
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:46,880
it's nine other techniques and that
 

1661
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,089
it's nine other techniques and that
that's important because I think that

1662
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:49,099
that's important because I think that
 

1663
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,380
that's important because I think that
the best solution to most complex

1664
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,390
the best solution to most complex
 

1665
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,240
the best solution to most complex
interesting problems require ideas and

1666
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,250
interesting problems require ideas and
 

1667
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,490
interesting problems require ideas and
techniques from things that has been

1668
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:00,500
techniques from things that has been

of the above and so when I was designing

1674
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:16,540
of the above and so when I was designing
 

1675
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,010
of the above and so when I was designing
C++ I soon realized I couldn't just add

says that if you have an abstraction it

1722
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:30,720
says that if you have an abstraction it
 

1723
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,960
says that if you have an abstraction it
should not cost anything compared to

00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:43,880
write the equivalent code at a lower
level so if I have say a matrix

1728
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:43,890
level so if I have say a matrix
 

1729
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,839
level so if I have say a matrix
multiplied it should be written in such

1730
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:47,849
multiplied it should be written in such

00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:51,500
multiplied it should be written in such
a way that you could not drop to the C

1732
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:51,510
a way that you could not drop to the C
 

1733
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,930
a way that you could not drop to the C
level of abstraction and use arrays and

1734
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:53,940
level of abstraction and use arrays and
 

1735
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,160
level of abstraction and use arrays and
pointers and such and run faster and so

1736
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,170
pointers and such and run faster and so
 

1737
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,370
pointers and such and run faster and so
people have written such matrix

1738
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:01,380
people have written such matrix
 

1739
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,040
people have written such matrix
multiplications and we have actually

1740
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,050
multiplications and we have actually
 

1741
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,740
multiplications and we have actually
gotten code that ran faster than Fortran

1742
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:06,750
gotten code that ran faster than Fortran
 

1743
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,450
gotten code that ran faster than Fortran
because once you had the right

because once you had the right
 

1745
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,900

abstraction you can eliminate you can

1746
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:11,910
abstraction you can eliminate you can
 

1747
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,830
abstraction you can eliminate you can
eliminate temporaries and you can do

1748
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:14,840
eliminate temporaries and you can do
 

1749
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,630
eliminate temporaries and you can do
loop fusion and other good stuff like

1750
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:17,640
loop fusion and other good stuff like
 

1751
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,089
loop fusion and other good stuff like
that that's quite hard to do by hand and

1752
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:20,099
that that's quite hard to do by hand and
 

1753
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:22,550
that that's quite hard to do by hand and
in a lower level language and there's

1754
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
in a lower level language and there's
 

1755
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,660
in a lower level language and there's
some really nice examples of that and

1756
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:25,670
some really nice examples of that and
 

1757
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:28,730
some really nice examples of that and
the key here is that that matrix

1758
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:28,740
the key here is that that matrix
 

1759
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,910
the key here is that that matrix
multiplication the matrix abstraction

1760
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920
multiplication the matrix abstraction
 

1761
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,480
multiplication the matrix abstraction
allows you to write code that's simple

1762
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:35,490
allows you to write code that's simple
 

1763
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,920
allows you to write code that's simple
and easy you can do that in any language

1764
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:36,930
and easy you can do that in any language
 

1765
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,770
and easy you can do that in any language
but with C++ it has the features so that

1766
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:39,780
but with C++ it has the features so that
 

1767
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,740
but with C++ it has the features so that
you can also have this thing run faster

you can also have this thing run faster
 

1769
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,160
you can also have this thing run faster
than if you hand coded it now people

how much faster would have run the
 

1787
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:11,060
how much faster would have run the
answer is much slower this happened the

00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:38,910
Brian Kearney and pointed out that one
 

1889
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:46,729
Brian Kearney and pointed out that one
of the reason c++ succeeded was some of

1890
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:46,739
of the reason c++ succeeded was some of
 

1891
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:49,069
of the reason c++ succeeded was some of
the craftsmanship I put into the early

1892
00:48:49,069 --> 00:48:49,079
the craftsmanship I put into the early
 

1893
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,859
the craftsmanship I put into the early
compilers and of course I did the

1894
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:51,869
compilers and of course I did the
 

1895
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:54,049
compilers and of course I did the
languages sign of course I wrote a fair

1896
00:48:54,049 --> 00:48:54,059
languages sign of course I wrote a fair
 

1897
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:56,059
languages sign of course I wrote a fair
amount of code using this kind of stuff

1898
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:56,069
amount of code using this kind of stuff
 

1899
00:48:56,069 --> 00:49:00,219
amount of code using this kind of stuff
and I think most of the successes

1900
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:00,229
and I think most of the successes
 

1901
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,979
and I think most of the successes
involves progress in all three areas

1902
00:49:02,979 --> 00:49:02,989

00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:12,269
together to do something like that it's
 

1909
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:14,209
together to do something like that it's
ideal if it's one person that has all

the skills necessary in all the fields
 

1915
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,579
the skills necessary in all the fields
where C++ is used so if you want to

00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:22,589
where C++ is used so if you want to
 

1917
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:25,519
where C++ is used so if you want to

lock-free programming you need to know
 

1927
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,880
lock-free programming you need to know
something about compiler techniques and

1928
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:37,890
something about compiler techniques and
 

1929
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:39,709
something about compiler techniques and
then you have to know some of the

1930
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:39,719
then you have to know some of the
 

1931
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:42,769
then you have to know some of the

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:22,140
GCC clang so this is a very reasonable
 

1957
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:28,520
GCC clang so this is a very reasonable
question when I designed C++

1958
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,530

 

1959
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,710

many of them and I wrote C front

1974
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:51,120
many of them and I wrote C front

00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:07,520
the backend infrastructure were
available I soon realized that my users

were using 25 different linkers I

1986
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:09,660
were using 25 different linkers I
 

1987
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,580
were using 25 different linkers I
couldn't write my own linker yes I could

1988
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:13,590
couldn't write my own linker yes I could
 

1989
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:17,300
couldn't write my own linker yes I could
but I couldn't write 25 linkers and also

1990
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:17,310
but I couldn't write 25 linkers and also
 

1991
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:20,690
but I couldn't write 25 linkers and also
get any work done on the language and so

1992
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:20,700
get any work done on the language and so
 

1993
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,060
get any work done on the language and so

now I also happen to dislike

2046
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:51,330
now I also happen to dislike
 

2047
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,950
now I also happen to dislike
monocultures monocultures they are

2048
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:54,960
monocultures monocultures they are
 

2049
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,420
monocultures monocultures they are
dangerous because whoever owns the

2050
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:58,430
dangerous because whoever owns the
 

2051
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,970
dangerous because whoever owns the
monoculture can go stale and there's no

2052
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:01,980
monoculture can go stale and there's no
 

2053
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,910
monoculture can go stale and there's no
competition and there's no incentive to

2054
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:04,920
competition and there's no incentive to
 

2055
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,910
competition and there's no incentive to
innovate there's a lot of incentive to

2056
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:07,920
innovate there's a lot of incentive to
 

2057
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,370
innovate there's a lot of incentive to
put barriers in the way of change

2058
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:10,380
put barriers in the way of change
 

2059
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,790
put barriers in the way of change
because hey we own the world and it's a

2060
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:13,800
because hey we own the world and it's a
 

2061
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,680
because hey we own the world and it's a
very comfortable world for us and who

2062
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:15,690
very comfortable world for us and who
 

2063
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:20,750
very comfortable world for us and who
are you to to mess with that so I really

2064
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:20,760
are you to to mess with that so I really
 

2065
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,050
are you to to mess with that so I really
am very happy that this for front-ends

2066
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:24,060
am very happy that this for front-ends
 

2067
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:30,530
am very happy that this for front-ends
for C++ clanks great but GCC was great

2068
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:30,540
for C++ clanks great but GCC was great
 

2069
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,680
for C++ clanks great but GCC was great
but then it got somewhat stale Tran came

2070
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:33,690
but then it got somewhat stale Tran came
 

2071
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,060
but then it got somewhat stale Tran came
along and GCC's much better now

2072
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,070
along and GCC's much better now
 

2073
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,070
along and GCC's much better now
competition my Microsoft is much better

2074
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:40,080
competition my Microsoft is much better
 

2075
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,580
competition my Microsoft is much better
now

2076
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:40,590
now
 

2077
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:45,109
now
so hello at least a low number our front

2078
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:45,119
so hello at least a low number our front
 

2079
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:50,910
so hello at least a low number our front
end puts a lot of pressure on

2080
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:50,920

 

2081
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,370

stand-ups compliance and also on

00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:53,380
stand-ups compliance and also on
 

2083
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,190
stand-ups compliance and also on

00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:56,200
performance and error messages and
 

2085
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,710
performance and error messages and
compile time speed all this good stuff

2086
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:58,720
compile time speed all this good stuff
 

2087
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,170

00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:03,180
that we want do you think crazy question
 

2089
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,420
that we want do you think crazy question
there might come along you hope that

2090
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:06,430
there might come along you hope that
 

2091
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:10,069
there might come along you hope that
might come along implementation of C++

2092
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
might come along implementation of C++
 

2093
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,640
might come along implementation of C++
written given all its history written

2094
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:14,650
written given all its history written
 

2095
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,569
written given all its history written
from scratch so written today from

00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:18,579
from scratch so written today from
 

2097
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:22,650
from scratch so written today from
scratch well playing and the LLVM this

2098
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:22,660
scratch well playing and the LLVM this
 

2099
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,109
scratch well playing and the LLVM this
more less written by from scratch but

2100
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:25,119
more less written by from scratch but
 

2101
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,269
more less written by from scratch but
there's been c++ 11 14 17 20 you know

2102
00:54:30,269 --> 00:54:30,279
there's been c++ 11 14 17 20 you know
 

2103
00:54:30,279 --> 00:54:31,680
there's been c++ 11 14 17 20 you know
there's been a lot you know later

2104
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:31,690
there's been a lot you know later
 

2105
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:34,289
there's been a lot you know later
somebody's going to try again there has

2106
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:34,299
somebody's going to try again there has
 

2107
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:38,220
somebody's going to try again there has
been attempts to write new C++ compilers

2108
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:38,230
been attempts to write new C++ compilers
 

2109
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:40,920
been attempts to write new C++ compilers
and some of them has been used and some

2110
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:40,930
and some of them has been used and some
 

2111
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,779
and some of them has been used and some
of them has been absorbed into others

2112
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:42,789
of them has been absorbed into others
 

2113
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:46,680
of them has been absorbed into others
and so yeah I don't happen so what are

2114
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:46,690
and so yeah I don't happen so what are
 

2115
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:51,029
and so yeah I don't happen so what are
the key features of C++ and let's use

2116
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:51,039
the key features of C++ and let's use
 

2117
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:54,589
the key features of C++ and let's use
that as a way to sort of talk about the

2118
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:54,599
that as a way to sort of talk about the
 

2119
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:57,779
that as a way to sort of talk about the
evolution of C++ the new feature so at

2120
00:54:57,779 --> 00:54:57,789
evolution of C++ the new feature so at
 

2121
00:54:57,789 --> 00:55:00,660
evolution of C++ the new feature so at
the highest level what are the features

2122
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:00,670
the highest level what are the features
 

2123
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,220
the highest level what are the features
that were there in the beginning what

2124
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,230
that were there in the beginning what
 

2125
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:06,410
that were there in the beginning what
features got added its first get a

2126
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:06,420
features got added its first get a
 

2127
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:12,480
features got added its first get a
principal on aim in place C++ is for

2128
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:12,490
principal on aim in place C++ is for
 

2129
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:15,089
principal on aim in place C++ is for
people who want to use hardware really

2130
00:55:15,089 --> 00:55:15,099
people who want to use hardware really
 

2131
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:18,359
people who want to use hardware really
well and then manage the complexity of

2132
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:18,369
well and then manage the complexity of
 

2133
00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:22,079
well and then manage the complexity of
doing that through abstraction and so

2134
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:22,089
doing that through abstraction and so
 

2135
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:26,849
doing that through abstraction and so
the first facility you you have is a way

2136
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:26,859
the first facility you you have is a way
 

2137
00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:29,880
the first facility you you have is a way
of manipulating the machines at a fairly

2138
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:29,890
of manipulating the machines at a fairly
 

2139
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,870
of manipulating the machines at a fairly
low level that looks very much like see

2140
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:32,880
low level that looks very much like see
 

2141
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,249
low level that looks very much like see
it has loops it has variables it has

2142
00:55:38,249 --> 00:55:38,259
it has loops it has variables it has
 

2143
00:55:38,259 --> 00:55:41,640
it has loops it has variables it has
pointers like machine addresses it can

2144
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:41,650
pointers like machine addresses it can
 

2145
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:44,700
pointers like machine addresses it can
access memory directly it can allocate

2146
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:44,710
access memory directly it can allocate
 

2147
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:48,960
access memory directly it can allocate
stuff in the absolute minimum of space

2148
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:48,970
stuff in the absolute minimum of space
 

2149
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,599
stuff in the absolute minimum of space
needed on the machine there's a machine

2150
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:51,609
needed on the machine there's a machine
 

2151
00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:55,440
needed on the machine there's a machine
facing part of C++ which is roughly

2152
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:55,450
facing part of C++ which is roughly
 

2153
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:59,190
facing part of C++ which is roughly
equivalent to C I said C++ could beat C

2154
00:55:59,190 --> 00:55:59,200
equivalent to C I said C++ could beat C
 

2155
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,799
equivalent to C I said C++ could beat C
and it can doesn't mean I dislike see if

2156
00:56:01,799 --> 00:56:01,809
and it can doesn't mean I dislike see if
 

2157
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:03,640
and it can doesn't mean I dislike see if
I disliked C

2158
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:03,650
I disliked C
 

2159
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,910
I disliked C
wouldn't have built on it furthermore

2160
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:06,920
wouldn't have built on it furthermore
 

2161
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,090
wouldn't have built on it furthermore
after Dennis Ritchie I'm probably the

2162
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:10,100
after Dennis Ritchie I'm probably the
 

2163
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,250
after Dennis Ritchie I'm probably the
major contributor to modern C and well I

2164
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:15,260
major contributor to modern C and well I
 

2165
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,030
major contributor to modern C and well I
had lunch with Dennis most days for 16

2166
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:19,040
had lunch with Dennis most days for 16
 

2167
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,500
had lunch with Dennis most days for 16
years and we never had a harsh word

2168
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:23,510
years and we never had a harsh word
 

2169
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:27,910
years and we never had a harsh word
between us so these C versus C++ fights

2170
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:27,920
between us so these C versus C++ fights
 

2171
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,830
between us so these C versus C++ fights
are for people who don't quite

2172
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:29,840
are for people who don't quite
 

2173
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,740
are for people who don't quite
understand what's going on then the

2174
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:32,750
understand what's going on then the
 

2175
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,980
understand what's going on then the
other part is the abstraction and there

2176
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:35,990
other part is the abstraction and there
 

2177
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,530
other part is the abstraction and there
the key is the class which is a user

2178
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:38,540
the key is the class which is a user
 

2179
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,980
the key is the class which is a user
defined type and my idea for the class

2180
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:41,990
defined type and my idea for the class
 

2181
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,750
defined type and my idea for the class
is that you should be able to build a

2182
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:43,760
is that you should be able to build a
 

2183
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,680
is that you should be able to build a
type that's just like the building types

2184
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:46,690
type that's just like the building types
 

2185
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,570
type that's just like the building types
in in the way you use them in the way

2186
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:49,580
in in the way you use them in the way
 

2187
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,930
in in the way you use them in the way
you declare them and the way you get the

2188
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:52,940
you declare them and the way you get the
 

2189
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,450
you declare them and the way you get the
memory and you can do just as well

2190
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:55,460
memory and you can do just as well
 

2191
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:01,180
memory and you can do just as well
so in C++ there's an int as in C you

2192
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:01,190
so in C++ there's an int as in C you
 

2193
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,820
so in C++ there's an int as in C you
should be able to build an abstraction a

2194
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:03,830
should be able to build an abstraction a
 

2195
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:07,840
should be able to build an abstraction a
class which we can call capital int that

2196
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:07,850
class which we can call capital int that
 

2197
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:10,270
class which we can call capital int that
you could use exactly like an integer

2198
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:10,280
you could use exactly like an integer
 

2199
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,900
you could use exactly like an integer
and run just as fast as an integer

the idea of a vector and the variations
 

2317
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:10,559
the idea of a vector and the variations
come through parameterization and so

2318
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:10,569
come through parameterization and so
 

2319
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:13,799
come through parameterization and so
here we get the two fundamental ways of

01:00:26,109 --> 01:00:28,660
there's the object-oriented programming
in this generic programming

01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:34,700
program yeah so you you've presented it
 

2337
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,510
program yeah so you you've presented it
very nicely but now you have to make all

2338
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:37,520
very nicely but now you have to make all
 

2339
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,049
very nicely but now you have to make all
that happen and make it efficient so

2340
01:00:41,049 --> 01:00:41,059
that happen and make it efficient so
 

2341
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:43,180
that happen and make it efficient so

01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:48,549
there's all kinds of magic going on
especially recently that you can help

especially recently that you can help
 

2347
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,309
especially recently that you can help
catch up on but it feels to me like you

2348
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:51,319
catch up on but it feels to me like you
 

2349
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:53,470
catch up on but it feels to me like you
can do way more than what you just said

2350
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:53,480
can do way more than what you just said

can do meta programming also I I didn't

2356
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:01,430
can do meta programming also I I didn't
 

2357
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:04,539
can do meta programming also I I didn't
go there and in that explanation we're

2358
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:04,549
go there and in that explanation we're
 

2359
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:06,640
go there and in that explanation we're
trying to be very basics but go back on

2360
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:06,650
trying to be very basics but go back on
 

2361
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,799
trying to be very basics but go back on
so the implementation implementation if

2362
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:08,809
so the implementation implementation if
 

2363
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:10,630
so the implementation implementation if
you couldn't implement this efficiently

2364
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:10,640
you couldn't implement this efficiently
 

2365
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,680
you couldn't implement this efficiently
if you couldn't use it so that it became

2366
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:14,690
if you couldn't use it so that it became
 

2367
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:17,799
if you couldn't use it so that it became
efficient it has no place in C++ because

2368
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:17,809
efficient it has no place in C++ because
 

2369
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:19,420
efficient it has no place in C++ because
it were violates the zero overhead

2370
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:19,430
it were violates the zero overhead
 

2371
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:25,270
it were violates the zero overhead
principle so when I had to get up during

2372
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:25,280
principle so when I had to get up during
 

2373
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,930
principle so when I had to get up during
programming inheritance I took the idea

2374
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:28,940
programming inheritance I took the idea
 

2375
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:32,829
programming inheritance I took the idea
of virtual functions from Simula virtual

2376
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:32,839
of virtual functions from Simula virtual
 

2377
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:35,410
of virtual functions from Simula virtual
functions is a similar term class is a

2378
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:35,420
functions is a similar term class is a
 

2379
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,410
functions is a similar term class is a
similar term if you ever use those words

2380
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:38,420
similar term if you ever use those words
 

2381
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,500
similar term if you ever use those words
say thanks to question you go and all

2382
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:41,510
say thanks to question you go and all
 

2383
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:45,760
say thanks to question you go and all
you and I'll and I did the simplest

2384
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:45,770
you and I'll and I did the simplest
 

2385
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,490
you and I'll and I did the simplest
implementation I knew off which was

2386
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:48,500
implementation I knew off which was
 

2387
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,059
implementation I knew off which was
basically a jump table so you get the

2388
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:52,069
basically a jump table so you get the
 

2389
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:54,039
basically a jump table so you get the
virtual function table or the function

2390
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:54,049
virtual function table or the function
 

2391
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:56,859
virtual function table or the function
goes in do it does an indirection

2392
01:01:56,859 --> 01:01:56,869
goes in do it does an indirection
 

2393
01:01:56,869 --> 01:01:58,359
goes in do it does an indirection
through a table and get the right

2394
01:01:58,359 --> 01:01:58,369
through a table and get the right
 

2395
01:01:58,369 --> 01:02:00,490
through a table and get the right
function that's how you pick the right

2396
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:00,500
function that's how you pick the right
 

2397
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,370
function that's how you pick the right
thing there and I thought that was

2398
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:03,380
thing there and I thought that was
 

2399
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:08,230
thing there and I thought that was
trivial it's close to optimal it's endo

2400
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240
trivial it's close to optimal it's endo
 

2401
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,120
trivial it's close to optimal it's endo
is obvious it turned out the Simula had

2402
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:10,130
is obvious it turned out the Simula had
 

2403
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,010
is obvious it turned out the Simula had
a more complicated way of doing it

2404
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:12,020
a more complicated way of doing it
 

2405
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,760
a more complicated way of doing it
therefore slower and it turns out that

2406
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:15,770
therefore slower and it turns out that
 

2407
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,559
therefore slower and it turns out that
most languages have something that's a

2408
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:17,569
most languages have something that's a
 

2409
01:02:17,569 --> 01:02:19,150
most languages have something that's a
little bit more complicated sometimes

2410
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:19,160
little bit more complicated sometimes
 

2411
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,990
little bit more complicated sometimes
more flexible but you pay for it and one

2412
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:23,000
more flexible but you pay for it and one
 

2413
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,970
more flexible but you pay for it and one
of the strengths of C++ was that you

2414
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:24,980
of the strengths of C++ was that you
 

2415
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,890
of the strengths of C++ was that you
could actually do this object-oriented

2416
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:26,900
could actually do this object-oriented
 

2417
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:30,539
could actually do this object-oriented
stuff and your overhead compared to

2418
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:30,549
stuff and your overhead compared to
 

2419
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:32,950
stuff and your overhead compared to
ordinary functions there's no

2420
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:32,960
ordinary functions there's no
 

2421
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,520
ordinary functions there's no
interactions it's not open five ten

2422
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:36,530
interactions it's not open five ten
 

2423
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:39,789
interactions it's not open five ten
twenty five percent for just the core it

2424
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:39,799
twenty five percent for just the core it
 

2425
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:41,500
twenty five percent for just the core it
sits down there it's not too

2426
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:41,510
sits down there it's not too
 

2427
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:45,140
sits down there it's not too
and that means you can afford to use it

2428
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:45,150
and that means you can afford to use it
 

2429
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,600
and that means you can afford to use it
furthermore in C++ you have the

2430
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:47,610
furthermore in C++ you have the
 

2431
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,180
furthermore in C++ you have the
distinction between a virtual function

2432
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:50,190
distinction between a virtual function
 

2433
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:52,430
distinction between a virtual function
and a non-virtual function if you don't

2434
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:52,440
and a non-virtual function if you don't
 

2435
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,160
and a non-virtual function if you don't
want any overhead if you don't need the

2436
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:55,170
want any overhead if you don't need the
 

2437
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,810
want any overhead if you don't need the
interaction that gives you the

2438
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:56,820
interaction that gives you the
 

2439
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,310
interaction that gives you the
flexibility in object-oriented

2440
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:58,320
flexibility in object-oriented
 

2441
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,080
flexibility in object-oriented
programming just don't ask for it so the

2442
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,090
programming just don't ask for it so the
 

2443
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:05,450
programming just don't ask for it so the
idea is that you only use virtual

2444
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:05,460
idea is that you only use virtual
 

2445
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,190
idea is that you only use virtual
functions if you actually need the

2446
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:07,200
functions if you actually need the
 

2447
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,220
functions if you actually need the
flexibility so it's not zero overhead

2448
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:10,230
flexibility so it's not zero overhead
 

2449
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,770
flexibility so it's not zero overhead
but zero overhead compared to any other

2450
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:12,780
but zero overhead compared to any other
 

2451
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,760
but zero overhead compared to any other
way of achieving the flexibility now

2452
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:16,770
way of achieving the flexibility now
 

2453
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:22,580
way of achieving the flexibility now
also parameterization basically the

2454
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:22,590
also parameterization basically the
 

2455
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:28,150
also parameterization basically the
compiler looks at at the the template

2456
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:28,160
compiler looks at at the the template
 

2457
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,370
compiler looks at at the the template
say the vector and it looks at the

2458
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:33,380
say the vector and it looks at the
 

2459
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:37,100
say the vector and it looks at the
parameter and then combines the two and

2460
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:37,110
parameter and then combines the two and
 

2461
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:39,230
parameter and then combines the two and
generates a piece of code that is

2462
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:39,240
generates a piece of code that is
 

2463
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,170
generates a piece of code that is
exactly as if you're written a vector

2464
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:42,180
exactly as if you're written a vector
 

2465
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,320
exactly as if you're written a vector
off that specific type yes so that's the

2466
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:45,330
off that specific type yes so that's the
 

2467
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:48,050
off that specific type yes so that's the
that's the minimal overhead if you have

2468
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:48,060
that's the minimal overhead if you have
 

2469
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,270
that's the minimal overhead if you have
many template parameters you can

2470
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:50,280
many template parameters you can
 

2471
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,400
many template parameters you can
actually combine code that the compiler

2472
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:52,410
actually combine code that the compiler
 

2473
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,860
actually combine code that the compiler
couldn't usually see at the same time

2474
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:54,870
couldn't usually see at the same time
 

2475
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:58,760
couldn't usually see at the same time
and therefore get code that is faster

2476
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:58,770
and therefore get code that is faster
 

2477
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:03,470
and therefore get code that is faster
then if you had handwritten stuff on

2478
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:03,480
then if you had handwritten stuff on
 

2479
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,540
then if you had handwritten stuff on
this you are very very clever so the

2480
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:05,550
this you are very very clever so the
 

2481
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,440
this you are very very clever so the
thing is Parature i's code the compiler

2482
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:09,450
thing is Parature i's code the compiler
 

2483
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,230
thing is Parature i's code the compiler
fills stuff in during the compilation

2484
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:12,240
fills stuff in during the compilation
 

2485
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,560
fills stuff in during the compilation
process not during runtime that's right

2486
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:15,570
process not during runtime that's right
 

2487
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:19,220
process not during runtime that's right
and so in furthermore it gives all the

2488
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:19,230
and so in furthermore it gives all the
 

2489
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,160
and so in furthermore it gives all the
information it's gotten which is the

2490
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:22,170
information it's gotten which is the
 

2491
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:25,160
information it's gotten which is the
template the parameter and the context

2492
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:25,170
template the parameter and the context
 

2493
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:28,460
template the parameter and the context
of use it combines the three and

2494
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:28,470
of use it combines the three and
 

2495
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:32,950
of use it combines the three and
generates good code but it can generate

2496
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960
generates good code but it can generate
 

2497
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,440
generates good code but it can generate
now it's a little outside of what I'm

2498
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:36,450
now it's a little outside of what I'm
 

2499
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:38,030
now it's a little outside of what I'm
even comfortable thinking about but it

2500
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:38,040
even comfortable thinking about but it
 

2501
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,080
even comfortable thinking about but it
can generate a lot of code yes and how

2502
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:42,090
can generate a lot of code yes and how
 

2503
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:46,670
can generate a lot of code yes and how
do you remember being both amazed at the

2504
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:46,680
do you remember being both amazed at the
 

2505
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:51,890
do you remember being both amazed at the
power of that idea and how ugly the

2506
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:51,900
power of that idea and how ugly the
 

2507
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,670
power of that idea and how ugly the
debugging look

2508
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:53,680
debugging look
 

2509
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,120
debugging look
the debugging can be truly horrid come

2510
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:57,130
the debugging can be truly horrid come
 

2511
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:59,060
the debugging can be truly horrid come

people often do for debugging is they
turn the optimizer off and so you get

2576
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:37,990
turn the optimizer off and so you get
 

2577
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:41,700
turn the optimizer off and so you get
code that when you when when something

2578
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:41,710
code that when you when when something
 

2579
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,260
code that when you when when something
in your source code looks like a

01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:43,270
in your source code looks like a
 

2581
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:47,130
in your source code looks like a
function call it is a function call when

2582
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:47,140
function call it is a function call when
 

2583
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,650
function call it is a function call when
the optimizer is turned on it may

01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:49,660
the optimizer is turned on it may
 

2585
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,750
the optimizer is turned on it may
disappear the function call it may

inline and so one of the things you can

2588
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:55,060
inline and so one of the things you can
 

2589
01:06:55,060 --> 01:07:00,380
inline and so one of the things you can
do is you can actually get code that is

2590
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:00,390
do is you can actually get code that is
 

2591
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:03,060
do is you can actually get code that is
smaller than the function call because

2592
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,070
smaller than the function call because
 

2593
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:06,270
smaller than the function call because
you eliminate the function preamble and

2594
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:06,280
you eliminate the function preamble and
 

2595
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,630
you eliminate the function preamble and
returned and that's just the operation

2596
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:09,640
returned and that's just the operation
 

2597
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,089
returned and that's just the operation
there one of the key things when I did

2598
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:14,099
there one of the key things when I did
 

2599
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:17,099
there one of the key things when I did
templates was I wanted to make sure that

01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:19,770

if you have say a sort algorithm and you

2602
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:19,780
if you have say a sort algorithm and you
 

2603
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:26,609
if you have say a sort algorithm and you
give it a sorting criteria if that

2604
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:26,619
give it a sorting criteria if that
 

2605
01:07:26,619 --> 01:07:29,609
give it a sorting criteria if that
sorting criteria is simply comparing

2668
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:19,490
do it expect a wall of C++ 20 to be
 

2669
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,540
do it expect a wall of C++ 20 to be
available so in all the major compilers

2670
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:22,550
available so in all the major compilers
 

2671
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:27,820
available so in all the major compilers
in 20 but this kind of stuff is it's

2672
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:27,830
in 20 but this kind of stuff is it's
 

2673
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,370
in 20 but this kind of stuff is it's
available now I'm just saying that

2674
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:30,380
available now I'm just saying that
 

2675
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:32,320
available now I'm just saying that
because otherwise people might think I

2676
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:32,330
because otherwise people might think I
 

2677
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:35,200
because otherwise people might think I
was talking about science fiction and so

2678
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:35,210
was talking about science fiction and so
 

2679
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,060
was talking about science fiction and so
what I'm going to say Israel on Crete

2680
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:37,070
what I'm going to say Israel on Crete
 

2681
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,439
what I'm going to say Israel on Crete
you can write it today

2682
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:39,449
you can write it today
 

2683
01:09:39,449 --> 01:09:42,079
you can write it today
and there's production users of it so

2684
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:42,089
and there's production users of it so
 

2685
01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:47,349
and there's production users of it so
the basic idea is that when you have a a

2686
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:47,359
the basic idea is that when you have a a
 

2687
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,640
the basic idea is that when you have a a
generic component like a sort function

2688
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:51,650
generic component like a sort function
 

2689
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:55,189
generic component like a sort function
the sort function will will require at

2690
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:55,199
the sort function will will require at
 

2691
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,280
the sort function will will require at
least two parameters one a data

2692
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:58,290
least two parameters one a data
 

2693
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:01,510
least two parameters one a data
structure with a given type and

2694
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
structure with a given type and
 

2695
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,660
structure with a given type and
comparison criteria and these things are

2696
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:05,670
comparison criteria and these things are
 

2697
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:08,630
comparison criteria and these things are
related but obviously you can't compare

2698
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:08,640
related but obviously you can't compare
 

2699
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,189
related but obviously you can't compare
things if you don't know what the type

2700
01:10:10,189 --> 01:10:10,199
things if you don't know what the type
 

2701
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:12,830
things if you don't know what the type
of things you compare

2702
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:12,840
of things you compare
 

2703
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:17,160
of things you compare
and so you want to be able to say I'm

2704
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:17,170
and so you want to be able to say I'm
 

2705
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:19,590
and so you want to be able to say I'm
going to sort something and did this to

2706
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:19,600
going to sort something and did this to
 

2707
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,360
going to sort something and did this to
be sortable what does it mean to be

2708
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:21,370
be sortable what does it mean to be
 

2709
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:23,160
be sortable what does it mean to be
sortable you look it up in the standard

2710
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:23,170
sortable you look it up in the standard
 

2711
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:25,920
sortable you look it up in the standard
it has to have it has to be a sequence

2712
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:25,930
it has to have it has to be a sequence
 

2713
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,770
it has to have it has to be a sequence
with a beginning and an end there has to

2714
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:28,780
with a beginning and an end there has to
 

2715
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,900
with a beginning and an end there has to
be random access to that sequence and

2716
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:30,910
be random access to that sequence and
 

2717
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:36,330
be random access to that sequence and
there has to be the element types has to

2718
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:36,340
there has to be the element types has to
 

2719
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:39,240
there has to be the element types has to
be comparable like you more like an

2720
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:39,250
be comparable like you more like an
 

2721
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,150
be comparable like you more like an
operator can I do it yes what illogical

2722
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:42,160
operator can I do it yes what illogical
 

2723
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,940
operator can I do it yes what illogical
already cannot basically what concepts

2724
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:44,950
already cannot basically what concepts
 

2725
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:47,490
already cannot basically what concepts
are there compile-time predicates there

2726
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:47,500
are there compile-time predicates there
 

2727
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,380
are there compile-time predicates there
predicates you can ask are you a

2728
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:49,390
predicates you can ask are you a
 

2729
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:53,340
predicates you can ask are you a
sequence yes I have begin an end

2730
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:53,350
sequence yes I have begin an end
 

2731
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:56,910
sequence yes I have begin an end
are you a random exit sequence yes I

2732
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:56,920
are you a random exit sequence yes I
 

2733
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,560
are you a random exit sequence yes I
have subscripting and plus it's your

2734
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:01,570
have subscripting and plus it's your
 

2735
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:03,360
have subscripting and plus it's your
element type something that has a less

2736
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:03,370
element type something that has a less
 

2737
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:07,560
element type something that has a less
then yes I have a less than hits and so

2738
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:07,570
then yes I have a less than hits and so
 

2739
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:09,960
then yes I have a less than hits and so
basically that's the system and so

2740
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:09,970
basically that's the system and so
 

2741
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,820
basically that's the system and so
instead of saying I will take a

2742
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:11,830
instead of saying I will take a
 

2743
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:13,890
instead of saying I will take a
parameter of any type it'll say I'll

2744
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:13,900
parameter of any type it'll say I'll
 

2745
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:18,060
parameter of any type it'll say I'll
take something that's audible and it's

2746
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:18,070
take something that's audible and it's
 

2747
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:21,060
take something that's audible and it's
well defined and so we say okay you can

2748
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:21,070
well defined and so we say okay you can
 

2749
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:23,010
well defined and so we say okay you can
sorta less then I don't want less then I

2750
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:23,020
sorta less then I don't want less then I
 

2751
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,020
sorta less then I don't want less then I
want greater then also something I

2752
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:25,030
want greater then also something I
 

2753
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,450
want greater then also something I
invent so you have two parameters the

2754
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:27,460
invent so you have two parameters the
 

2755
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:30,510
invent so you have two parameters the
sortable thing and the compassion

2756
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:30,520
sortable thing and the compassion
 

2757
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,210
sortable thing and the compassion
criteria and the comparison criteria

2758
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:33,220
criteria and the comparison criteria
 

2759
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:38,070
criteria and the comparison criteria
will say well I can you you can write it

2760
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:38,080
will say well I can you you can write it
 

2761
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,650
will say well I can you you can write it
saying it should operate on the element

2762
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:40,660
saying it should operate on the element
 

2763
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:44,430
saying it should operate on the element
type and it has the compassion

2764
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:44,440
type and it has the compassion
 

2765
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,220
type and it has the compassion
operations so that's the simply the

2766
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:47,230
operations so that's the simply the
 

2767
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,260
operations so that's the simply the
fundamental thing it's compile-time

2768
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:49,270
fundamental thing it's compile-time
 

2769
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:51,540
fundamental thing it's compile-time
predicates do you have the properties I

2770
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:51,550
predicates do you have the properties I
 

2771
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:54,710
predicates do you have the properties I
need so it specifies the requirements of

2772
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:54,720
need so it specifies the requirements of
 

2773
01:11:54,720 --> 01:12:00,000
need so it specifies the requirements of
the code on the parameters that gets yes

2774
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,010
the code on the parameters that gets yes
 

2775
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:03,450
the code on the parameters that gets yes
there are lots of types actually but

2776
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:03,460
there are lots of types actually but
 

2777
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:06,950
there are lots of types actually but
operating in the space of concepts

2778
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:06,960
operating in the space of concepts
 

2779
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,240
operating in the space of concepts
concepts the word concept was used by

2780
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:12,250
concepts the word concept was used by
 

2781
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:14,670
concepts the word concept was used by
Alec Stephan of who is sort of the

2782
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:14,680
Alec Stephan of who is sort of the
 

2783
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,680
Alec Stephan of who is sort of the
father of generic programming in the

2784
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:16,690
father of generic programming in the
 

2785
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:19,350
father of generic programming in the
context of C++

2786
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:19,360
context of C++
 

2787
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,840
context of C++
there's other places that use that word

2788
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:22,850
there's other places that use that word
 

2789
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:24,490
there's other places that use that word
but the way we call Genetic Programming

2790
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:24,500
but the way we call Genetic Programming
 

2791
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,760
but the way we call Genetic Programming
is Alex's and he called them concepts

2792
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:27,770
is Alex's and he called them concepts
 

2793
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:29,530
is Alex's and he called them concepts
because he said there they are the sort

2794
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:29,540
because he said there they are the sort
 

2795
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,780
because he said there they are the sort
of the fundamental concepts of an area

2796
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:31,790
of the fundamental concepts of an area
 

2797
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:34,689
of the fundamental concepts of an area
so they should be called concepts and

2798
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:34,699
so they should be called concepts and
 

2799
01:12:34,699 --> 01:12:36,850
so they should be called concepts and
we've had concepts all the time if you

2800
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:36,860
we've had concepts all the time if you
 

2801
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:40,479
we've had concepts all the time if you
look at the knr book about si si has

2802
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:40,489
look at the knr book about si si has
 

2803
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:46,330
look at the knr book about si si has
arithmetic types and it has integral

2804
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:46,340
arithmetic types and it has integral
 

2805
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:49,840
arithmetic types and it has integral
types it says so in the book and then it

2806
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:49,850
types it says so in the book and then it
 

2807
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:52,060
types it says so in the book and then it
lists what they are and they have

2808
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:52,070
lists what they are and they have
 

2809
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:54,280
lists what they are and they have
certain properties the difference today

2810
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:54,290
certain properties the difference today
 

2811
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:57,070
certain properties the difference today
is that we can actually write a concept

2812
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:57,080
is that we can actually write a concept
 

2813
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:00,310
is that we can actually write a concept
that will ask a type are you an integral

2814
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:00,320
that will ask a type are you an integral
 

2815
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,890
that will ask a type are you an integral
type do you have the properties

2816
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:02,900
type do you have the properties
 

2817
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,620
type do you have the properties
necessary to be an integral type do you

2818
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:05,630
necessary to be an integral type do you
 

2819
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:10,090
necessary to be an integral type do you
have Proust - divide so what may be the

2820
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:10,100
have Proust - divide so what may be the
 

2821
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:15,160
have Proust - divide so what may be the
story of concepts because I thought it

2822

why didn't it look like what we'll talk

2828
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:27,920
why didn't it look like what we'll talk
 

2829
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,320
why didn't it look like what we'll talk
a little bit about this fascinating

2830
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:29,330
a little bit about this fascinating
 

2831
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:31,270
a little bit about this fascinating
process of standards because I think

2832
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:31,280
process of standards because I think
 

2833
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,830
process of standards because I think
it's really interesting for people it's

2834
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:32,840
it's really interesting for people it's
 

2835
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,160
it's really interesting for people it's
interesting for me but why did it take

2836
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:36,170
interesting for me but why did it take
 

2837
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:39,130
interesting for me but why did it take
so long what shapes the the idea of

2838
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:39,140
so long what shapes the the idea of
 

2839
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:42,959
so long what shapes the the idea of
concepts take what were the challenges

2840
01:13:42,959 --> 01:13:42,969
concepts take what were the challenges
 

2841
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:50,410
concepts take what were the challenges
back in 87 of there abouts 97 well 1987

2842
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:50,420
back in 87 of there abouts 97 well 1987
 

2843
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,729
back in 87 of there abouts 97 well 1987
like they are about so when I was

2844
01:13:51,729 --> 01:13:51,739
like they are about so when I was
 

2845
01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:54,189
like they are about so when I was
designing templates obviously I wanted

2846
01:13:54,189 --> 01:13:54,199
designing templates obviously I wanted
 

2847
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:56,920
designing templates obviously I wanted
to express the notion of what is

2848
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:56,930
to express the notion of what is
 

2849
01:13:56,930 --> 01:14:00,070
to express the notion of what is
required by a template of its arguments

2850
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:00,080
required by a template of its arguments
 

2851
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,729
required by a template of its arguments
and so I looked at this and basically

2852
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:03,739
and so I looked at this and basically
 

2853
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:05,740
and so I looked at this and basically
for for templates I wanted three

2854
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:05,750
for for templates I wanted three
 

2855
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:10,170
for for templates I wanted three
properties I wanted to be very flexible

2856
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:10,180
properties I wanted to be very flexible
 

2857
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:14,590
properties I wanted to be very flexible
it had to be able to express things I

2858
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:14,600
it had to be able to express things I
 

2859
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,070
it had to be able to express things I
couldn't imagine because I know I can't

2860
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,080
couldn't imagine because I know I can't
 

2861
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,660
couldn't imagine because I know I can't
imagine everything and I've been

2862
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:19,670
imagine everything and I've been
 

2863
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:21,670
imagine everything and I've been
suffering from languages and try to

2864
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:21,680
suffering from languages and try to
 

2865
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,180
suffering from languages and try to
constrain you to only do what you're the

2866
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:25,190
constrain you to only do what you're the
 

2867
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:27,820
constrain you to only do what you're the
designer thought good didn't want to do

2868
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:27,830
designer thought good didn't want to do
 

2869
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:28,380
designer thought good didn't want to do
that

2870
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:28,390
that
 

2871
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:32,020
that
secondly it had to run faster

2872
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,030
secondly it had to run faster
 

2873
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:34,900
secondly it had to run faster
as faster faster that hand written code

2874
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:34,910
as faster faster that hand written code
 

2875
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:37,720
as faster faster that hand written code
so basically if I have a vector of T and

2876
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:37,730
so basically if I have a vector of T and
 

2877
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:41,500
so basically if I have a vector of T and
I take a vector of cha it should run as

2878
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:41,510
I take a vector of cha it should run as
 

2879
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,990
I take a vector of cha it should run as
fast as you built a vector of cha

2880
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:44,000
fast as you built a vector of cha
 

2881
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,400
fast as you built a vector of cha
yourself without parameterization and

2882
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:47,410
yourself without parameterization and
 

2883
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:50,740
yourself without parameterization and
second and thirdly I wanted to be able

2884
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:50,750
second and thirdly I wanted to be able
 

2885
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:57,370
second and thirdly I wanted to be able
to express the constraints of of the

2886
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:57,380
to express the constraints of of the
 

2887
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:59,680
to express the constraints of of the
arguments have proper type checking of

2888
01:14:59,680 --> 01:14:59,690
arguments have proper type checking of
 

2889
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:03,310
arguments have proper type checking of
the interfaces and neither I nor anybody

2890
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:03,320
the interfaces and neither I nor anybody
 

2891
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,130
the interfaces and neither I nor anybody
else at the time knew how to get all

2892
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:06,140
else at the time knew how to get all
 

2893
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:10,120
else at the time knew how to get all
three and I thought for C++ I must have

2894
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:10,130
three and I thought for C++ I must have
 

2895
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:14,430
three and I thought for C++ I must have
the two first otherwise it's not C++ and

2896
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:14,440
the two first otherwise it's not C++ and
 

2897
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,110
the two first otherwise it's not C++ and
it bothered me for an hour a couple of

2898
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:17,120
it bothered me for an hour a couple of
 

2899
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,730
it bothered me for an hour a couple of
decades that I couldn't solve the third

2900
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:18,740
decades that I couldn't solve the third
 

2901
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:22,170
decades that I couldn't solve the third
one I mean I was the one that put

2902
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:22,180
one I mean I was the one that put
 

2903
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:24,640
one I mean I was the one that put
function argument type checking in to

2904
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:24,650
function argument type checking in to
 

2905
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:27,850
function argument type checking in to

01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:29,660
I didn't invent that idea it's very
 

2909
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:34,120
I didn't invent that idea it's very
common but I did it and I wanted to do

01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:34,130
common but I did it and I wanted to do
 

2911
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,910
common but I did it and I wanted to do
the same for templates of course and I

01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:36,920
the same for templates of course and I
 

2913
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,570
the same for templates of course and I
could so it bothered me then we try it

01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
of the art they still are so we had to
 

2977
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,280
of the art they still are so we had to
do something else basically it was the

2978
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:44,290
do something else basically it was the
 

2979
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:48,780
do something else basically it was the
idea that a set of parameters has

2980
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:48,790
idea that a set of parameters has
 

2981
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:52,050
idea that a set of parameters has
defines a set of operations and you go

2982
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:52,060
defines a set of operations and you go
 

2983
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,270
defines a set of operations and you go
through an interaction table just like

2984
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:54,280
through an interaction table just like
 

2985
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,490
through an interaction table just like
for virtual functions and then you try

2986
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:56,500
for virtual functions and then you try
 

2987
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,840
for virtual functions and then you try
to optimize the interaction away to get

2988
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:00,850
to optimize the interaction away to get
 

2989
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:03,810
to optimize the interaction away to get
performance and we just couldn't do all

2990
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:03,820
performance and we just couldn't do all
 

2991
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:07,410
performance and we just couldn't do all
of that but get back to the

2992
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:07,420
of that but get back to the
 

2993
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:10,740
of that but get back to the
standardization we are standardizing C++

2994
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:10,750
standardization we are standardizing C++
 

2995
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:14,490
standardization we are standardizing C++
on the ISO rules which a very open

2996
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:14,500
on the ISO rules which a very open
 

2997
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,890
on the ISO rules which a very open
process people come in there's no

2998
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:16,900
process people come in there's no
 

2999
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,090
process people come in there's no
requirements for education or experience

3000
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:20,100
requirements for education or experience
 

3001
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:25,640
requirements for education or experience
they start develop C++ and there's a

3002
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:25,650
they start develop C++ and there's a
 

3003
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:28,500
they start develop C++ and there's a
hope when was the first standard

3004
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:28,510
hope when was the first standard
 

3005
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:31,649
hope when was the first standard
established what is that like the ISO

3006
01:18:31,649 --> 01:18:31,659
established what is that like the ISO
 

3007
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:33,959
established what is that like the ISO
standard is there committee that you're

3008
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:33,969
standard is there committee that you're
 

3009
01:18:33,969 --> 01:18:35,760
standard is there committee that you're
referring to she was a group of people

3010
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:35,770
referring to she was a group of people
 

3011
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:38,310
referring to she was a group of people
what it was that like how often do you

3012
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:38,320
what it was that like how often do you
 

3013
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,530
what it was that like how often do you
meet what's the disguise I'll try and

3014
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:40,540
meet what's the disguise I'll try and
 

3015
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:48,859
meet what's the disguise I'll try and
explain that so sometime in early 1989

3016
01:18:48,859 --> 01:18:48,869

 

3017
01:18:48,869 --> 01:18:52,770

two people one from IBM one from HP

3018
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:52,780
two people one from IBM one from HP
 

3019
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:55,830
two people one from IBM one from HP
turned up in my office and told me I

3020
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:55,840
turned up in my office and told me I
 

3021
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,040
turned up in my office and told me I
would like to standardize it PLAs PLAs

3022
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:00,050
would like to standardize it PLAs PLAs
 

3023
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:03,820
would like to standardize it PLAs PLAs
this was a new idea to me and I pointed

3024
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:03,830
this was a new idea to me and I pointed
 

3025
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:07,270
this was a new idea to me and I pointed
out that it wasn't finished yet it

3026
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,280
out that it wasn't finished yet it
 

3027
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,820
out that it wasn't finished yet it
wasn't ready for former standardization

3028
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:09,830
wasn't ready for former standardization
 

3029
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,890
wasn't ready for former standardization
and such and they say no beyond even

3030
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:11,900
and such and they say no beyond even
 

3031
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:15,600
and such and they say no beyond even
gotten it you you really want to do this

3032
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:15,610
gotten it you you really want to do this
 

3033
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:19,570
gotten it you you really want to do this
our organizations depend on c++ we

3034
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:19,580
our organizations depend on c++ we
 

3035
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:23,140
our organizations depend on c++ we
cannot depend on something that's owned

3036
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:23,150
cannot depend on something that's owned
 

3037
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:25,470
cannot depend on something that's owned
by another corporation that might be a

3038
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:25,480
by another corporation that might be a
 

3039
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,390
by another corporation that might be a
competitor of course we could rely on

3040
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
competitor of course we could rely on
 

3041
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,200
competitor of course we could rely on
you

3042
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:29,210
you
 

3043
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:31,630
you
but you might get run over by a bus

3044
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:31,640
but you might get run over by a bus
 

3045
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,380
but you might get run over by a bus
right the old really needs to get this

3046
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:35,390
right the old really needs to get this
 

3047
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:39,870
right the old really needs to get this
out new it has to be standardized under

3048
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:39,880
out new it has to be standardized under
 

3049
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,660
out new it has to be standardized under
formal rules and we are going to

3050
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:43,670
formal rules and we are going to
 

3051
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:49,210
formal rules and we are going to
standardize it under ISO rules and you

3052
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:49,220
standardize it under ISO rules and you
 

3053
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,890
standardize it under ISO rules and you
really want to be part of it because

3054
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:50,900
really want to be part of it because
 

3055
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,600
really want to be part of it because
basically otherwise we will do it

3056
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:52,610
basically otherwise we will do it
 

3057
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:56,080
basically otherwise we will do it
ourselves and we know you can do it

3058
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:56,090
ourselves and we know you can do it
 

3059
01:19:56,090 --> 01:20:01,110
ourselves and we know you can do it
better so through a combination of

3060
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,120
better so through a combination of
 

3061
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:04,110
better so through a combination of
arm-twisting and flattery

3062
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:04,120
arm-twisting and flattery
 

3063
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:08,160
arm-twisting and flattery
Carolus started so in late

3064
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,170
Carolus started so in late
 

3065
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:13,680
Carolus started so in late
in late 89 there was a meeting in DC at

3066
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:13,690
in late 89 there was a meeting in DC at
 

3067
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:18,000
in late 89 there was a meeting in DC at
the x-ray no it was not ISO then it was

3068
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:18,010
the x-ray no it was not ISO then it was
 

3069
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,919
the x-ray no it was not ISO then it was
an SI the American national standard

3070
01:20:19,919 --> 01:20:19,929
an SI the American national standard
 

3071
01:20:19,929 --> 01:20:22,860
an SI the American national standard
were doing

3072
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:22,870

 

3073
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:26,010

we met there we were lectured on the

3074
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:26,020
we met there we were lectured on the
 

3075
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,350
we met there we were lectured on the
rules of how to do when ANSI standard

3076
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:28,360
rules of how to do when ANSI standard
 

3077
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:31,680
rules of how to do when ANSI standard
there was about 25 of us there which

3078
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:31,690
there was about 25 of us there which
 

3079
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:33,600
there was about 25 of us there which
apparently was a new record for that

3080
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:33,610
apparently was a new record for that
 

3081
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:38,190
apparently was a new record for that
kind of meeting and some of the old see

3082
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:38,200
kind of meeting and some of the old see
 

3083
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,230
kind of meeting and some of the old see
guys that it's been standardizing see

3084
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:40,240
guys that it's been standardizing see
 

3085
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,260
guys that it's been standardizing see
was there so we got some expertise in so

3086
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:43,270
was there so we got some expertise in so
 

3087
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:46,050
was there so we got some expertise in so
the way this works is that it's an open

3088
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:46,060
the way this works is that it's an open
 

3089
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:46,710
the way this works is that it's an open
process

3090
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:46,720
process
 

3091
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,290
process
anybody can consign up if they pay the

3092
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:49,300
anybody can consign up if they pay the
 

3093
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:52,830
anybody can consign up if they pay the
minimal fee which is about a thousand

3094
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:52,840
minimal fee which is about a thousand
 

3095
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,450
minimal fee which is about a thousand
dollars still less then just a little

3096
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:54,460
dollars still less then just a little
 

3097
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:58,170
dollars still less then just a little
bit more now and I think it's twelve

3098
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:58,180
bit more now and I think it's twelve
 

3099
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,210
bit more now and I think it's twelve
hundred and eighty dollars it's not it's

3100
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:00,220
hundred and eighty dollars it's not it's
 

3101
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,230
hundred and eighty dollars it's not it's
not going to kill you

3102
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:01,240
not going to kill you
 

3103
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:06,210
not going to kill you
and we have three meetings a year this

3104
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:06,220
and we have three meetings a year this
 

3105
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:07,520
and we have three meetings a year this
is fairly standard

3106
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:07,530
is fairly standard
 

3107
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:11,250
is fairly standard
we try to meetings a year for a couple

3108
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:11,260
we try to meetings a year for a couple
 

3109
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,800
we try to meetings a year for a couple
years that didn't work too well so three

3110
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:13,810
years that didn't work too well so three
 

3111
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:17,190
years that didn't work too well so three
weeks is three one-week meetings a year

3112
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:17,200
weeks is three one-week meetings a year
 

3113
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:22,830
weeks is three one-week meetings a year
and you meet and you have taken meet

3114
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:22,840
and you meet and you have taken meet
 

3115
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,530
and you meet and you have taken meet
technical discussions and then you bring

3116
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:25,540
technical discussions and then you bring
 

3117
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:29,160
technical discussions and then you bring
proposals forward for votes the votes

3118
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:29,170
proposals forward for votes the votes
 

3119
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:34,280
proposals forward for votes the votes
are done one person per one vote per

3120
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:34,290
are done one person per one vote per
 

3121
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:38,130
are done one person per one vote per
organization so you can't have say IBM

3122
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:38,140
organization so you can't have say IBM
 

3123
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,100
organization so you can't have say IBM
come in with 10 people and dominate

3124
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:41,110
come in with 10 people and dominate
 

3125
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:43,080
come in with 10 people and dominate
things that's not allowed and these

3126
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:43,090
things that's not allowed and these
 

3127
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:45,150
things that's not allowed and these
organizations that extends to the UC bus

3128
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:45,160
organizations that extends to the UC bus
 

3129
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,930
organizations that extends to the UC bus
bus this yes this is all individuals or

3130
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:48,940
bus this yes this is all individuals or
 

3131
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,750

01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:18,530
six seven or eight the confidence of
 

3263
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,370
six seven or eight the confidence of
youth yes right well the point is that

3264

youth yes right well the point is that
 

3265
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:24,700
youth yes right well the point is that
this was sort of like a second system

3266
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:24,710
this was sort of like a second system
 

3267
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:26,950
this was sort of like a second system
effect that is we now knew how to do it

dicho penguia furthermore there is this

3274
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:35,060
dicho penguia furthermore there is this
 

3275
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:39,490
dicho penguia furthermore there is this
tendency because it's a 10-year cycle or

3285
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:02,040
that in we did that successfully with
the STL we got the the standard Liars

3286
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:02,050
the STL we got the the standard Liars
 

3287
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:05,710
the STL we got the the standard Liars
all the STL stuff that that my base be I

3288
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:05,720
all the STL stuff that that my base be I
 

3289
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,140
all the STL stuff that that my base be I
think it saved C++ it was beautiful

3290
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:08,150
think it saved C++ it was beautiful
 

3291
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:10,930
think it saved C++ it was beautiful
yes and then people tried it with all

3292
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:10,940
yes and then people tried it with all
 

3293
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:13,600
yes and then people tried it with all
our things and it didn't work so well

3294
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:13,610
our things and it didn't work so well
 

3295
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,970
our things and it didn't work so well
they got things in but it wasn't as

3296
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:15,980
they got things in but it wasn't as
 

3297
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,220
they got things in but it wasn't as
dramatic and it took longer and longer

3298
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:18,230
dramatic and it took longer and longer
 

3299
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:19,350
dramatic and it took longer and longer
and longer

3300
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:19,360
and longer
 

3301
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:23,470
and longer
so after C++ 11 which was a huge

3302
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:23,480
so after C++ 11 which was a huge
 

3303
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,220
so after C++ 11 which was a huge
improvement and what basically what most

3304
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:27,230
improvement and what basically what most
 

3305
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:31,180
improvement and what basically what most
people are using today we decided ever

3306
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:31,190
people are using today we decided ever
 

3307
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:32,629
people are using today we decided ever
again

3308
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:32,639
again
 

3309
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:36,020
again
and so how do you avoid those slips and

3310
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:36,030
and so how do you avoid those slips and
 

3311
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:38,840
and so how do you avoid those slips and
the answer is that you shipped more

3312
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:38,850
the answer is that you shipped more
 

3313
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:42,770
the answer is that you shipped more
often so that if you if you if you have

3314
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:42,780
often so that if you if you if you have
 

3315
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:47,090
often so that if you if you if you have
a slip on the 10-year cycle by the time

3316
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:47,100
a slip on the 10-year cycle by the time
 

3317
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,830
a slip on the 10-year cycle by the time
you know it's a slip there's 11 years

3318
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:48,840
you know it's a slip there's 11 years
 

3319
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,649
you know it's a slip there's 11 years
till you get it yeah now with a three

3320
01:26:51,649 --> 01:26:51,659
till you get it yeah now with a three
 

3321
01:26:51,659 --> 01:26:55,399
till you get it yeah now with a three
year cycle there is about three or four

3322
01:26:55,399 --> 01:26:55,409
year cycle there is about three or four
 

3323
01:26:55,409 --> 01:26:58,729
year cycle there is about three or four
years till you get it like the delay

3324
01:26:58,729 --> 01:26:58,739
years till you get it like the delay
 

3325
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:03,290
years till you get it like the delay
between feature freeze and shipping so

3326
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:03,300
between feature freeze and shipping so
 

3327
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,359
between feature freeze and shipping so
you always get one or two years more and

3328
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:05,369
you always get one or two years more and
 

3329
01:27:05,369 --> 01:27:09,290
you always get one or two years more and
so we were shipped fourteen on time we

3330
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:09,300
so we were shipped fourteen on time we
 

3331
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,040
so we were shipped fourteen on time we
shipped seventeen on time and we ship we

3332
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:13,050
shipped seventeen on time and we ship we
 

3333
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:14,959
shipped seventeen on time and we ship we
will ship 20 on time

3334
01:27:14,959 --> 01:27:14,969
will ship 20 on time
 

3335
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:19,490
will ship 20 on time
it's it'll happen and furthermore this

3336
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:19,500
it's it'll happen and furthermore this
 

3337
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,490
it's it'll happen and furthermore this
allow this gives a predictability that

3338
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:22,500
allow this gives a predictability that
 

3339
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,950
allow this gives a predictability that
allows the implementers the compiler

3340
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:24,960
allows the implementers the compiler
 

3341
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,859
allows the implementers the compiler
implementers the library implementers so

3342
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:27,869
implementers the library implementers so
 

3343
01:27:27,869 --> 01:27:29,750
implementers the library implementers so
they have a target and they deliver on

3344
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:29,760
they have a target and they deliver on
 

3345
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,640
they have a target and they deliver on
it 11 took two years before most

3346
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:34,650
it 11 took two years before most
 

3347
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:38,750
it 11 took two years before most
compilers were good enough 14 most

3348
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:38,760
compilers were good enough 14 most
 

3349
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,700
compilers were good enough 14 most
compilers were actually getting pretty

3350
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:40,710
compilers were actually getting pretty
 

3351
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:45,590
compilers were actually getting pretty
good in 14 17 everybody shipped in 17

3352
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,600
good in 14 17 everybody shipped in 17
 

3353
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,550
good in 14 17 everybody shipped in 17
well we are going to have at least

3354
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:49,560
well we are going to have at least
 

3355
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,800
well we are going to have at least
almost everybody's ship almost

3356
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:51,810
almost everybody's ship almost
 

3357
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:54,439
almost everybody's ship almost
everything in 20 and I know this because

3358
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:54,449
everything in 20 and I know this because
 

3359
01:27:54,449 --> 01:27:58,129
everything in 20 and I know this because
they're shipping in nineteen predictably

3360
01:27:58,129 --> 01:27:58,139
they're shipping in nineteen predictably
 

3361
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,530
they're shipping in nineteen predictably
this is good delivery on time is good

3362
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:00,540
this is good delivery on time is good
 

3363
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:03,620
this is good delivery on time is good
and so yeah that's great those how it

3364
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:03,630
and so yeah that's great those how it
 

3365
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:07,040
and so yeah that's great those how it
works there's a lot of features that

3366
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:07,050
works there's a lot of features that
 

3367
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:10,760
works there's a lot of features that
came in in C++ 11 there's a lot of

3368
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:10,770
came in in C++ 11 there's a lot of
 

3369
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:13,550
came in in C++ 11 there's a lot of
features at the birth of C++ they were

3370
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:13,560
features at the birth of C++ they were
 

3371
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:17,709
features at the birth of C++ they were
amazing and ideas with concepts in 2020

3372
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:17,719
amazing and ideas with concepts in 2020
 

3373
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:22,669
amazing and ideas with concepts in 2020
what to you is the most justjust to you

3374
01:28:22,669 --> 01:28:22,679
what to you is the most justjust to you
 

3375
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:28,910
what to you is the most justjust to you
personally beautiful or just you sit

3376
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:28,920
personally beautiful or just you sit
 

3377
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,780
personally beautiful or just you sit
back and think wow that's just nice and

3378
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:32,790
back and think wow that's just nice and
 

3379
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:39,169
back and think wow that's just nice and
clean feature of C++ I have written two

3380
01:28:39,169 --> 01:28:39,179
clean feature of C++ I have written two
 

3381
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:41,660
clean feature of C++ I have written two
papers for the history of programming

3382
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:41,670
papers for the history of programming
 

3383
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:44,030
papers for the history of programming
languages conference which basically

3384
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:44,040
languages conference which basically
 

3385
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,810
languages conference which basically
asked me such questions

3386
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:45,820
asked me such questions
 

3387
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,120
asked me such questions
and I'm writing a third one which I will

3388
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:48,130
and I'm writing a third one which I will
 

3389
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:51,090
and I'm writing a third one which I will
deliver at the history of programming

3390
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:51,100
deliver at the history of programming
 

3391
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,450
deliver at the history of programming
languages conference in London next year

3392
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:53,460
languages conference in London next year
 

3393
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,950
languages conference in London next year
so I've been thinking about that and

3394
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:55,960
so I've been thinking about that and
 

3395
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,770
so I've been thinking about that and
there is one play answer constructors

3396
01:28:58,770 --> 01:28:58,780
there is one play answer constructors
 

3397
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:02,190
there is one play answer constructors
and destructors the way a constructor

3398
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:02,200
and destructors the way a constructor
 

3399
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,130
and destructors the way a constructor
can establish the environment for the

3400
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:05,140
can establish the environment for the
 

3401
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:09,000
can establish the environment for the
use of the Java type for object and the

3402
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:09,010
use of the Java type for object and the
 

3403
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:11,340
use of the Java type for object and the
destructor that cleans up any messes at

3404
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:11,350
destructor that cleans up any messes at
 

3405
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:14,160
destructor that cleans up any messes at
the end of it that is the key to C++

3406
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:14,170
the end of it that is the key to C++
 

3407
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:17,190
the end of it that is the key to C++
that's why we don't have to use garbage

3408
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:17,200
that's why we don't have to use garbage
 

3409
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,170
that's why we don't have to use garbage
collection that's how we can get

3410
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:19,180
collection that's how we can get
 

3411
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:22,200
collection that's how we can get
predictable performance that's how you

3412
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:22,210
predictable performance that's how you
 

3413
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:25,650
predictable performance that's how you
can get the minimal overhead in many

3414
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:25,660
can get the minimal overhead in many
 

3415
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:29,690
can get the minimal overhead in many
many cases and have really clean types

3416
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:29,700
many cases and have really clean types
 

3417
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:33,240
many cases and have really clean types
it's the idea of constructor destructor

3418
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:33,250
it's the idea of constructor destructor
 

3419
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:36,210
it's the idea of constructor destructor
pairs sometimes it comes out under the

3420
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:36,220
pairs sometimes it comes out under the
 

3421
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:40,980
pairs sometimes it comes out under the
name our high AIII resource acquisition

3422
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:40,990
name our high AIII resource acquisition
 

3423
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:43,500
name our high AIII resource acquisition
is initialization which is the idea that

3424
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:43,510
is initialization which is the idea that
 

3425
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:45,750
is initialization which is the idea that
you grab resources and the constructor

3426
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:45,760
you grab resources and the constructor
 

3427
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,840
you grab resources and the constructor
and release them and destructor it's

3428
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:48,850
and release them and destructor it's
 

3429
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:51,000
and release them and destructor it's
also the best example of why I shouldn't

3430
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,010
also the best example of why I shouldn't
 

3431
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:53,940
also the best example of why I shouldn't
be in advertising I get the best idea

3432
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:53,950
be in advertising I get the best idea
 

3433
01:29:53,950 --> 01:29:56,760
be in advertising I get the best idea
and I call it resource acquisition is

3434
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:56,770
and I call it resource acquisition is
 

3435
01:29:56,770 --> 01:30:00,780
and I call it resource acquisition is
initialization not the greatest naming

3436
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:00,790
initialization not the greatest naming
 

3437
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:07,370
initialization not the greatest naming
I've ever heard so it's types

3438
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:07,380
I've ever heard so it's types
 

3439
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:12,180
I've ever heard so it's types
abstraction of types you said I want to

3440
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:12,190
abstraction of types you said I want to
 

3441
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:14,400
abstraction of types you said I want to
create my own types so types is an

3442
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:14,410
create my own types so types is an
 

3443
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:17,660
create my own types so types is an
essential part of C++ and making them

3444
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:17,670
essential part of C++ and making them
 

3445
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:20,850
essential part of C++ and making them
efficient as the if it is the key part

3446
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:20,860
efficient as the if it is the key part
 

3447
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:24,720
efficient as the if it is the key part
and GU the this is almost getting

3448
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:24,730
and GU the this is almost getting
 

3449
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:27,810
and GU the this is almost getting
philosophical but the construction and

3450
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:27,820
philosophical but the construction and
 

3451
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:30,360
philosophical but the construction and
the destruction the creation of an

3452
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:30,370
the destruction the creation of an
 

3453
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:34,190
the destruction the creation of an
instance of a type and the freeing of

3454
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:34,200
instance of a type and the freeing of
 

3455
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,290
instance of a type and the freeing of
resources from that instance of a type

3456
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:37,300
resources from that instance of a type
 

3457
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:42,120
resources from that instance of a type
is what defines the object is uh that's

3458
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:42,130
is what defines the object is uh that's
 

3459
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:44,880
is what defines the object is uh that's
like birth and death is what defines

3460
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:44,890
like birth and death is what defines
 

3461
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:47,640
like birth and death is what defines
human life yeah that's right

3462
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:47,650
human life yeah that's right
 

3463
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:50,280
human life yeah that's right
by the way philosophy is important you

3464
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:50,290
by the way philosophy is important you
 

3465
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:53,850
by the way philosophy is important you
can't do good language design without

3466
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:53,860
can't do good language design without
 

3467
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:55,620
can't do good language design without
philosophy because what you are

3468
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:55,630
philosophy because what you are
 

3469
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:58,450
philosophy because what you are
determining is what people can express

3470
01:30:58,450 --> 01:30:58,460
determining is what people can express
 

3471
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:02,240
determining is what people can express
this is very important by the way

3472
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:02,250
this is very important by the way
 

3473
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:04,670
this is very important by the way
constructors destructors came into C++

3474
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:04,680
constructors destructors came into C++
 

3475
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:09,260
constructors destructors came into C++
in 79 in about the second week of my

3476
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:09,270
in 79 in about the second week of my
 

3477
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,750
in 79 in about the second week of my
work with what was then Corsi of the

3478
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:11,760
work with what was then Corsi of the
 

3479
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:12,470
work with what was then Corsi of the
classes

3480
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:12,480
classes
 

3481
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:16,070
classes
it is a fundamental idea next comes the

3482
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:16,080
it is a fundamental idea next comes the
 

3483
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,460
it is a fundamental idea next comes the
fact that you need to control copying

3484
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:18,470
fact that you need to control copying
 

3485
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:21,260
fact that you need to control copying
because once you control as you says

3486
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:21,270
because once you control as you says
 

3487
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:24,110
because once you control as you says
birth and death you have to control

3488
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:24,120
birth and death you have to control
 

3489
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:27,320
birth and death you have to control
taking copies which is another way of

3490
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:27,330
taking copies which is another way of
 

3491
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:30,230
taking copies which is another way of
creating an object and finally you have

3492
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:30,240
creating an object and finally you have
 

3493
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,590
creating an object and finally you have
to be able to move things around so you

3494
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:33,600
to be able to move things around so you
 

3495
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,870
to be able to move things around so you
get the move operations and that's the

3496
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:35,880
get the move operations and that's the
 

3497
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:39,440
get the move operations and that's the
set of key operations you can define on

3498
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:39,450
set of key operations you can define on
 

3499
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:45,050
set of key operations you can define on
a C++ type inserts you those things are

3500
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:45,060
a C++ type inserts you those things are
 

3501
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:50,120
a C++ type inserts you those things are
just a beautiful part of C++ that is at

3502
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:50,130
just a beautiful part of C++ that is at
 

3503
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:53,330
just a beautiful part of C++ that is at
the core of it all yes you mentioned

3504
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:53,340
the core of it all yes you mentioned
 

3505
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,550
the core of it all yes you mentioned
that you hope there will be one unified

3506
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:55,560
that you hope there will be one unified
 

3507
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,980
that you hope there will be one unified
set of guidelines in the future for how

3508
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:57,990
set of guidelines in the future for how
 

3509
01:31:57,990 --> 01:32:00,260
set of guidelines in the future for how
to construct the programming language so

3510
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:00,270
to construct the programming language so
 

3511
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:02,480
to construct the programming language so
perhaps not one programming language but

3512
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:02,490
perhaps not one programming language but
 

3513
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:06,170
perhaps not one programming language but
a unification of how we build

3514
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:06,180
a unification of how we build
 

3515
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:09,230
a unification of how we build
programming languages if you remember

3516
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:09,240
programming languages if you remember
 

3517
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,780
programming languages if you remember
the statement I I have some trouble

3518
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:11,790
the statement I I have some trouble
 

3519
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:13,970
the statement I I have some trouble
remembering it but I know the origin of

3520
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:13,980
remembering it but I know the origin of
 

3521
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:16,420
remembering it but I know the origin of
that idea so maybe you can talk about

3522
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:16,430
that idea so maybe you can talk about
 

3523
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:19,100
that idea so maybe you can talk about
sort of C++ has been improving there's

3524
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:19,110
sort of C++ has been improving there's
 

3525
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:21,080
sort of C++ has been improving there's
been a lot of programming language do

3526
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:21,090
been a lot of programming language do

01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:23,690
been a lot of programming language do
you word is the arc of history taking us

3528
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:23,700
you word is the arc of history taking us
 

3529
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,910
you word is the arc of history taking us
do you hope that there is a unification

3530
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:25,920
do you hope that there is a unification
 

3531
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,490
do you hope that there is a unification
about the languages with which we

3532
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:28,500
about the languages with which we
 

3533
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:32,890
about the languages with which we
communicate in the digital space well

3534
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:32,900
communicate in the digital space well
 

3535
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:37,820
communicate in the digital space well
III think that languages should be

3536
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:37,830
III think that languages should be
 

3537
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:41,090
III think that languages should be
designed not by clobbering language

3538
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:41,100
designed not by clobbering language
 

3539
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,330
designed not by clobbering language

different versions or somebody else's
 

3543
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:50,450
different versions or somebody else's
ideas but through the creation of a set

3544
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:50,460
ideas but through the creation of a set
 

3545
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:55,430
ideas but through the creation of a set
of principles rules of thumbs whatever

01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:55,440
of principles rules of thumbs whatever
 

3547
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:00,200
of principles rules of thumbs whatever
you call them I I made them for C++ and

3548
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:00,210
you call them I I made them for C++ and
 

3549
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:03,890
you call them I I made them for C++ and
we're trying to teach people in the

3550
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:03,900
we're trying to teach people in the
 

3551
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,630
we're trying to teach people in the
Standards Committee about these rules

3552
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:05,640
Standards Committee about these rules
 

3553
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,520
Standards Committee about these rules
because a lot of people come in and says

3554
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:07,530
because a lot of people come in and says
 

3555
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:09,290
because a lot of people come in and says
I've got a great idea let's put it in

3556
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:09,300
I've got a great idea let's put it in
 

3557
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:09,900
I've got a great idea let's put it in
language

3558
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:09,910
language
 

3559
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:13,140
language
and then you have to ask why does it fit

3560
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:13,150
and then you have to ask why does it fit
 

3561
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:14,880
and then you have to ask why does it fit
in the language why does it fit in this

3562
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:14,890
in the language why does it fit in this
 

3563
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:16,860
in the language why does it fit in this
language it may fit in on our language

3564
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:16,870
language it may fit in on our language
 

3565
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:18,750
language it may fit in on our language
and not here

3566
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:18,760
and not here
 

3567
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,240
and not here
or may fit here not the other language

3568
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:21,250
or may fit here not the other language
 

3569
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:23,580
or may fit here not the other language
so you have to work from a set of

3570
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:23,590
so you have to work from a set of
 

3571
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:25,290
so you have to work from a set of
principles and you have to develop that

3572
01:33:25,290 --> 01:33:25,300
principles and you have to develop that
 

3573
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:32,210
principles and you have to develop that
set of principles and it's one example

3574
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:32,220
set of principles and it's one example
 

3575
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,830
set of principles and it's one example
that I sometimes remember is I was

3576
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:34,840
that I sometimes remember is I was
 

3577
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,760
that I sometimes remember is I was
sitting down with some of the designers

3578
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:38,770
sitting down with some of the designers
 

3579
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:43,220
sitting down with some of the designers
of common lisp and we are talking about

3580
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:43,230
of common lisp and we are talking about
 

3581
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:46,460
of common lisp and we are talking about
languages and language features and

3582
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:46,470
languages and language features and
 

3583
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:49,100
languages and language features and
obviously we didn't agree about anything

3584
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:49,110
obviously we didn't agree about anything
 

3585
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:52,920
obviously we didn't agree about anything
because well this was not C++ and vice

3586
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:52,930
because well this was not C++ and vice
 

3587
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:53,520
because well this was not C++ and vice
versa

3588
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:53,530
versa
 

3589
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:57,540

too many parenthesis but suddenly we

3590
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:57,550
too many parenthesis but suddenly we
 

3591
01:33:57,550 --> 01:34:01,320
too many parenthesis but suddenly we
started making progress I said I had

3592
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:01,330
started making progress I said I had
 

3593
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:05,100
started making progress I said I had
this problem and I developed it

3594
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:05,110
this problem and I developed it
 

3595
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:06,930
this problem and I developed it
according to these ideas and they said

3596
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:06,940
according to these ideas and they said
 

3597
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:09,270
according to these ideas and they said
what why we had that problem different

3598
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
what why we had that problem different
 

3599
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,820
what why we had that problem different
problem and we develop it the same kind

3600
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:11,830
problem and we develop it the same kind
 

3601
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:15,800
problem and we develop it the same kind
of principles and so we worked through

3602
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:15,810
of principles and so we worked through
 

3603
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:20,370
of principles and so we worked through
large chunks of C++ and large chunks of

3604
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:20,380
large chunks of C++ and large chunks of
 

3605
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:23,310
large chunks of C++ and large chunks of
Common Lisp and figure out we actually

3606
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:23,320
Common Lisp and figure out we actually
 

3607
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:27,300
Common Lisp and figure out we actually
had similar sets of principles of how to

3608
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:27,310
had similar sets of principles of how to
 

3609
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:30,630
had similar sets of principles of how to
do it but the constraints on our designs

3610
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:30,640
do it but the constraints on our designs
 

3611
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,540
do it but the constraints on our designs
were very different and the aims for the

3612
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:33,550
were very different and the aims for the
 

3613
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:37,590
were very different and the aims for the
usage was very different but there was

3614
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:37,600
usage was very different but there was
 

3615
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,400
usage was very different but there was
commonality in the way you reason about

3616
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:41,410
commonality in the way you reason about
 

3617
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:44,400
commonality in the way you reason about
language features and the fundamental

3618
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:44,410
language features and the fundamental
 

3619
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:46,800
language features and the fundamental
principles you are trying to do so do

3620
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:46,810
principles you are trying to do so do
 

3621
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:48,990
principles you are trying to do so do
you think that's possible to so they're

3622
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:49,000
you think that's possible to so they're
 

3623
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,140
you think that's possible to so they're
just like there is perhaps a unified

3624
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:52,150
just like there is perhaps a unified
 

3625
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:55,800
just like there is perhaps a unified
theory of physics of the fundamental

01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:55,810
theory of physics of the fundamental
 

3627
01:34:55,810 --> 01:34:59,870
theory of physics of the fundamental
forces of physics now I'm sure there is

3628
01:34:59,870 --> 01:34:59,880
forces of physics now I'm sure there is
 

3629
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:03,030
forces of physics now I'm sure there is
commonalities among the languages but

3630
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,040
commonalities among the languages but
 

3631
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,340
commonalities among the languages but
there's also people involved you know

3632
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:05,350
there's also people involved you know
 

3633
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:06,930
there's also people involved you know
that help drive these developing these

3634
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:06,940
that help drive these developing these
 

3635
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:10,830
that help drive these developing these
languages do you have a hope or an

3636
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:10,840
languages do you have a hope or an
 

3637
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:13,470
languages do you have a hope or an
optimism that there will be a

3638
01:35:13,470 --> 01:35:13,480
optimism that there will be a
 

3639
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:17,460
optimism that there will be a
unification if you think about physics

3640
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:17,470
unification if you think about physics
 

3641
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:19,350
unification if you think about physics
and Einstein towards a simplified

3642
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:19,360
and Einstein towards a simplified
 

3643
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:23,900
and Einstein towards a simplified

3644
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:23,910
language do you think that it's possible
 

3645
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:28,020
language do you think that it's possible
let's remember sort of modern physics I

3646
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:28,030
let's remember sort of modern physics I
 

3647
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:30,930
let's remember sort of modern physics I
think started with Galileo in the 1300s

3648
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:30,940
think started with Galileo in the 1300s
 

3649
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:33,930
think started with Galileo in the 1300s
so they have had seven hundred years to

3650
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:33,940
so they have had seven hundred years to
 

3651
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:34,880
so they have had seven hundred years to
get going

3652
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:34,890
get going
 

3653
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:39,770
get going
modern computing started in about 49

3654
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:39,780
modern computing started in about 49
 

3655
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:44,220
modern computing started in about 49
we've got what's that 70 years they have

3656
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:44,230
we've got what's that 70 years they have
 

3657
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:46,530
we've got what's that 70 years they have
10 10 times yeah

3658
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:46,540
10 10 times yeah
 

3659
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:48,720
10 10 times yeah
and furthermore they they are not as

3660
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:48,730
and furthermore they they are not as
 

3661
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:52,050
and furthermore they they are not as
bothered with people using physics the

3662
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:52,060
bothered with people using physics the
 

3663
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:54,870
bothered with people using physics the
way we are worried about programming

3664
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:54,880
way we are worried about programming
 

3665
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,990
way we are worried about programming
it's done by humans so each have

3666
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:00,000
it's done by humans so each have
 

3667
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,460
it's done by humans so each have
problems and constraints the others have

3668
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:02,470
problems and constraints the others have
 

3669
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:04,290
problems and constraints the others have
but we are very immature compared to

3670
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:04,300
but we are very immature compared to
 

3671
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:09,780
but we are very immature compared to
physics so I would look at sort of the

3672
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:09,790
physics so I would look at sort of the
 

3673
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:12,780
physics so I would look at sort of the
philosophical level and and look for

3674
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:12,790
philosophical level and and look for
 

3675
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:17,100
philosophical level and and look for
fundamental principles like you don't

3676
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:17,110
fundamental principles like you don't
 

3677
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:20,940
fundamental principles like you don't
leak resources you shouldn't you don't

3678
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:20,950
leak resources you shouldn't you don't
 

3679
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:24,150
leak resources you shouldn't you don't
take errors at runtime that you don't

3680
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:24,160
take errors at runtime that you don't
 

3681
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:29,760
take errors at runtime that you don't
need to you don't violate some kind of

3682
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:29,770
need to you don't violate some kind of
 

3683
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:31,560
need to you don't violate some kind of
type system there's many kinds of type

3684
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:31,570
type system there's many kinds of type
 

3685
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:33,750
type system there's many kinds of type
systems but when you have one you don't

3686
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:33,760
systems but when you have one you don't
 

3687
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,430
systems but when you have one you don't
break it

3688
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:35,440
break it
 

3689
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:40,350
break it
etc etc there will be quite a few and it

3690
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:40,360
etc etc there will be quite a few and it
 

3691
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:42,420
etc etc there will be quite a few and it
will not be be the same for all

3692
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:42,430
will not be be the same for all
 

3693
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:46,080
will not be be the same for all
languages but I think if we step back at

3694
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,090
languages but I think if we step back at
 

3695
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:48,590
languages but I think if we step back at
some kind of philosophical level we can

3696
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:48,600
some kind of philosophical level we can
 

3697
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:52,080
some kind of philosophical level we can
we would be able to agree on sets of

3698
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:52,090
we would be able to agree on sets of
 

3699
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:55,290
we would be able to agree on sets of
principles that applied to two sets of

3700
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:55,300
principles that applied to two sets of
 

3701
01:36:55,300 --> 01:37:02,040
principles that applied to two sets of
problem areas and within an area of use

3702
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:02,050
problem areas and within an area of use
 

3703
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:06,000
problem areas and within an area of use
by in C++ this case what used to be

3704
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:06,010
by in C++ this case what used to be
 

3705
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:08,160
by in C++ this case what used to be
called systems programming the area

3706
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:08,170
called systems programming the area
 

3707
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:11,670
called systems programming the area
between the hardware and the the the

3708
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:11,680
between the hardware and the the the
 

3709
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,850
between the hardware and the the the
fluffier parts of the system you you

3710
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:14,860
fluffier parts of the system you you
 

3711
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,580
fluffier parts of the system you you
might very well see a convergence so

3712
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:17,590
might very well see a convergence so
 

3713
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:20,550
might very well see a convergence so
these days you see rust having a adopted

3714
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:20,560
these days you see rust having a adopted
 

3715
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,730
these days you see rust having a adopted
ra íí- and sometime accuses me for

3716
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:23,740
ra íí- and sometime accuses me for
 

3717
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:26,130
ra íí- and sometime accuses me for
having borrowed it 20 years before they

3718
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:26,140
having borrowed it 20 years before they
 

3719
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:30,380
having borrowed it 20 years before they
discovered it but it's

3720
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:30,390
discovered it but it's
 

3721
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:32,980
discovered it but it's
we're seeing some kind of conversion

3722
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:32,990
we're seeing some kind of conversion
 

3723
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:36,980
we're seeing some kind of conversion
convergence here instead of relying on

3724
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:36,990
convergence here instead of relying on
 

3725
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:38,900
convergence here instead of relying on
garbage collection all the time the

3726
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:38,910
garbage collection all the time the
 

3727
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:41,450
garbage collection all the time the
garbage collection languages are doing

3728
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:41,460
garbage collection languages are doing
 

3729
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:45,680
garbage collection languages are doing
things like the dispose patterns and

3730
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:45,690
things like the dispose patterns and
 

3731
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:47,870
things like the dispose patterns and
such that imitates some of the

3732
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:47,880
such that imitates some of the
 

3733
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:50,120
such that imitates some of the
construction destruction stuff and

3734
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:50,130
construction destruction stuff and
 

3735
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:52,370
construction destruction stuff and
they're trying not to use the garbage

3736
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:52,380
they're trying not to use the garbage
 

3737
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:55,100
they're trying not to use the garbage
collection all the time things like that

3738
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:55,110
collection all the time things like that
 

3739
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:57,410
collection all the time things like that
so there's there there's conversion but

3740
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:57,420
so there's there there's conversion but
 

3741
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:58,880
so there's there there's conversion but
I think we have to step back to the

3742
01:37:58,880 --> 01:37:58,890
I think we have to step back to the
 

3743
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:00,530
I think we have to step back to the
philosophical level and agree on

3744
01:38:00,530 --> 01:38:00,540
philosophical level and agree on
 

3745
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,360
philosophical level and agree on
principles and then we'll see some

3746
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:02,370
principles and then we'll see some
 

3747
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:08,050
principles and then we'll see some
conversions convergences and it will be

3748
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:08,060
conversions convergences and it will be
 

3749
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:12,950
conversions convergences and it will be
application domain-specific so a crazy

3750
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:12,960
application domain-specific so a crazy
 

3751
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,070
application domain-specific so a crazy

have this AI system machine learning all

3906
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:25,949
have this AI system machine learning all
 

3907
01:42:25,949 --> 01:42:31,819
have this AI system machine learning all
of these trained neural nets and when

3908
01:42:31,819 --> 01:42:31,829
of these trained neural nets and when
 

3909
01:42:31,829 --> 01:42:33,200
of these trained neural nets and when
they're something is too complicated

3910
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:33,210
they're something is too complicated
 

3911
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:38,120
they're something is too complicated
they asked the human for help but human

01:42:48,379 --> 01:42:48,389
what the problem was that the AI system
 

3919
01:42:48,389 --> 01:42:50,290
what the problem was that the AI system
couldn't handle and do the right thing

between the Machine and the human it's
 

3927
01:42:58,650 --> 01:43:04,280
between the Machine and the human it's
very very difficult and for the designer

01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,790
interaction right but I think it's
possible but it's very very hard it is
