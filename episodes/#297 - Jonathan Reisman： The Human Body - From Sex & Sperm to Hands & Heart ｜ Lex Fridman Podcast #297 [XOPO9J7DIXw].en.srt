to the human civilization
um is there any truth to that

182
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
um is there any truth to that
 

183

how important is it to save you know
 

211
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,750
how important is it to save you know
let's say the kind of

212
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
let's say the kind of
 

213
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,309
let's say the kind of
tip uh the one-third the tip one-third

214
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
tip uh the one-third the tip one-third
 

215
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,430
tip uh the one-third the tip one-third
of one of your fingers you know it

216
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
of one of your fingers you know it
 

217
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,949
of one of your fingers you know it
depends on the length that you'll lose

218
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
depends on the length that you'll lose
 

219
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,110
depends on the length that you'll lose
it depends on which finger and so the

220
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
it depends on which finger and so the
 

221
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,149
it depends on which finger and so the
thumb really is the most crucial um just

222
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
thumb really is the most crucial um just
 

223
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,070
thumb really is the most crucial um just
you know for your occupation in most

224
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
you know for your occupation in most
 

225
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,270
you know for your occupation in most
cases to

226
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
cases to
 

227
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,589
cases to
just daily life um and your ability to

228
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
just daily life um and your ability to
 

229
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,869
just daily life um and your ability to
get around take care of yourself and

230
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
get around take care of yourself and
 

231
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,830
get around take care of yourself and
others so

232
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
others so
 

233
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,910
others so
you know they'll be more they're willing

234
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
you know they'll be more they're willing
 

235
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,070
you know they'll be more they're willing
to go further do more surgeries more

236
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
to go further do more surgeries more
 

237
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,390
to go further do more surgeries more
aggressive therapy to save a thumb let's

238
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
aggressive therapy to save a thumb let's
 

239
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,270
aggressive therapy to save a thumb let's
say

240
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
say
 

241
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,949
say
than you know the tip of your pinky

242
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
than you know the tip of your pinky
 

243
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,949
than you know the tip of your pinky
finger so in that way i do think the

244
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
finger so in that way i do think the
 

245
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,630
finger so in that way i do think the
thumb you know does seem like the most

246
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
thumb you know does seem like the most
 

247
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,229
thumb you know does seem like the most
important in many ways it's nice that

248
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
important in many ways it's nice that
 

249
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,070
important in many ways it's nice that
there's backups i wonder if that's part

250
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
there's backups i wonder if that's part
 

251
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,750
there's backups i wonder if that's part
of the feature or is it just the

252
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
of the feature or is it just the
 

253
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,469
of the feature or is it just the
symmetry that nature produces you think

254
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
symmetry that nature produces you think
 

255
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,870
symmetry that nature produces you think
you think that two hands is like is it

256
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
you think that two hands is like is it
 

257
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,349
you think that two hands is like is it
about the symmetry or is it about backup

258
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
about the symmetry or is it about backup
 

259
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,070
about the symmetry or is it about backup
we'd be much less formidable hunters

260
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
we'd be much less formidable hunters
 

261
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,510
we'd be much less formidable hunters
gatherers

262
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
gatherers
 

263
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,749
gatherers
survivors in any way

264
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
survivors in any way
 

265
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,710
survivors in any way
if we only had one hand so i think

266
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
if we only had one hand so i think
 

267
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,790
if we only had one hand so i think
that is important to have two so we can

268
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
that is important to have two so we can
 

269
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,790
that is important to have two so we can
you know even everything from kind of

270
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
you know even everything from kind of
 

271
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,550
you know even everything from kind of
spearing an animal to firing a bow and

272
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
spearing an animal to firing a bow and
 

273
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,990
spearing an animal to firing a bow and
arrow to butchering an animal you really

274
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
arrow to butchering an animal you really
 

275
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,150
arrow to butchering an animal you really
need two hands to do it very effectively

276
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
need two hands to do it very effectively
 

277
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,030
need two hands to do it very effectively
but can you do a better job with three

278
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
but can you do a better job with three
 

279
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,629
but can you do a better job with three
great question

280
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
great question
 

281
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,790
great question
and we'll never know perhaps

282
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
and we'll never know perhaps
 

283
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,629
and we'll never know perhaps
um

284
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
um

um
you tweeted now i'm gonna analyze your

286
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
you tweeted now i'm gonna analyze your
 

287
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,990
you tweeted now i'm gonna analyze your
tweets like it's shakespeare sometimes

288
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
tweets like it's shakespeare sometimes
 

289

00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
you tweeted that quote millions of years
 

291
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,590
you tweeted that quote millions of years
of sex and death

292
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
of sex and death
 

293
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,909
of sex and death
designed the human body

294
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
designed the human body
 

295
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,430
designed the human body
it's like poetry

296
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
it's like poetry

are those two basic activities

298
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
are those two basic activities
 

299
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,870
are those two basic activities

uh
basically summarize everything that

302
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
basically summarize everything that
 

303
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,430
basically summarize everything that
that resulted in humans on earth so like

304
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
that resulted in humans on earth so like
 

305
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,909
that resulted in humans on earth so like
uh is it is that a good summary

306
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
uh is it is that a good summary
 

307
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,310
uh is it is that a good summary
of the evolutionary process that led to

308
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
of the evolutionary process that led to
 

309
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,270
of the evolutionary process that led to
this conscious intelligent being is

310
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
this conscious intelligent being is
 

311
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,110
this conscious intelligent being is
death and sex

312
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
death and sex
 

313
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,830
death and sex
in a way yeah and so sex is how more of

314
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
in a way yeah and so sex is how more of
 

315
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,469
in a way yeah and so sex is how more of
us get made obviously and death is how

316
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
us get made obviously and death is how
 

317
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,189
us get made obviously and death is how
we get weeded out or the gene pool gets

318
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
we get weeded out or the gene pool gets
 

319
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,110
we get weeded out or the gene pool gets
weeded out and certain genes survive and

320
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
weeded out and certain genes survive and
 

321
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,990
weeded out and certain genes survive and
others don't and you know the age at

322
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
others don't and you know the age at
 

323
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,430
others don't and you know the age at
which we die

324
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
which we die
 

325
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,749
which we die
whether it's before we've you know had

326
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
whether it's before we've you know had
 

327
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,070
whether it's before we've you know had
sex and reproduced ourselves is a big

328
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
sex and reproduced ourselves is a big

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,990
sex and reproduced ourselves is a big
factor and who survives who doesn't who

330
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
factor and who survives who doesn't who
 

331
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,510
factor and who survives who doesn't who
passes on their genes and what the

332
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
passes on their genes and what the
 

333
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,550
passes on their genes and what the
future

334
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
future
 

335
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,629
future
of the body looks like you know who

336
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
of the body looks like you know who
 

337
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,230
of the body looks like you know who
lived and who died

338
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
lived and who died
 

339
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,990
lived and who died
before they were able to be at

340
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
before they were able to be at
 

341
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,070
before they were able to be at
reproductive age a million years ago was

342
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
reproductive age a million years ago was
 

343
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,749
reproductive age a million years ago was
pretty important in what we look like

344
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
pretty important in what we look like
 

345
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,550
pretty important in what we look like
now

346
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
now
 

347
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,150
now
um and perhaps

348
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
um and perhaps
 

349
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,990
um and perhaps
how we have sex and die now will

350
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
how we have sex and die now will
 

351
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,990
how we have sex and die now will
determine what we're shaped like

352
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
determine what we're shaped like
 

353
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,590
determine what we're shaped like
unless technology has an even bigger

354
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
unless technology has an even bigger
 

355
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,950
unless technology has an even bigger
role in that you know a million years

356
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
role in that you know a million years
 

357
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,710
role in that you know a million years
from now do you think that's fundamental

358
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
from now do you think that's fundamental
 

359
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,710
from now do you think that's fundamental
to like if there's alien civilizations

360
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
to like if there's alien civilizations
 

361
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,110
to like if there's alien civilizations
out there that have uh the same order of

362
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
out there that have uh the same order of
 

363
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,430
out there that have uh the same order of
magnitude of intelligence or greater do

364
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
magnitude of intelligence or greater do
 

365
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,350
magnitude of intelligence or greater do
you think that we will see something

366
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
you think that we will see something
 

367
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,710
you think that we will see something
like sex and something like death so the

368
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
like sex and something like death so the
 

369
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,230
like sex and something like death so the
reproducing

370
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
reproducing
 

371
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,909
reproducing
and this selection process plus the

372
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
and this selection process plus the
 

373
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,110
and this selection process plus the
weeding out

374
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
weeding out
 

375
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,189
weeding out
of the old to make room for the new is

376
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
of the old to make room for the new is
 

377
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,230
of the old to make room for the new is
that kind of

378
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
that kind of
 

379
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,230
that kind of
foundational to life i would think so i

380
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
foundational to life i would think so i
 

381
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,830
foundational to life i would think so i
mean it sure seems to be on earth you

382
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
mean it sure seems to be on earth you
 

383
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,710
mean it sure seems to be on earth you
know perhaps in some distant future when

384
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
know perhaps in some distant future when
 

385
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,110
know perhaps in some distant future when
medicine is nearing you know perfection

386
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
medicine is nearing you know perfection
 

387
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,990
medicine is nearing you know perfection
and people can live a really long time

388
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
and people can live a really long time
 

389
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,309
and people can live a really long time
uh maybe we won't even need to reproduce

390
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
uh maybe we won't even need to reproduce
 

391
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,670
uh maybe we won't even need to reproduce
as much

392
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
as much
 

393
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,029
as much
or something like that you know it's

394
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
or something like that you know it's
 

395
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,790
or something like that you know it's
hard to even know what

396
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
hard to even know what
 

397
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,150
hard to even know what
what life will be like in the distant

398
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
what life will be like in the distant
 

399
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,230
what life will be like in the distant
future but i would guess that any alien

400
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
future but i would guess that any alien
 

401
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,430
future but i would guess that any alien
civilization will have the same

402
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
civilization will have the same
 

403
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,510
civilization will have the same
dependence on who who has sex and who

404
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
dependence on who who has sex and who
 

405
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,790
dependence on who who has sex and who
dies well that's the problem with

406
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
dies well that's the problem with
 

407
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,710
dies well that's the problem with
immortality how are we going to clear

408
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
immortality how are we going to clear
 

409
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,230
immortality how are we going to clear
out

410
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
out
 

411
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,749
out
the old

412
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
the old
 

413
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,070
the old
to make room for the new which is as

414
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
to make room for the new which is as
 

415
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,550
to make room for the new which is as
kind of um

416
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
kind of um
 

417
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,510
kind of um
it's like a framework of adaptability to

418
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
it's like a framework of adaptability to
 

419
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,189
it's like a framework of adaptability to
changing environments so as long as the

420
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
changing environments so as long as the
 

421
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,350
changing environments so as long as the
environment is changing and it seems to

422
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
environment is changing and it seems to
 

423
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,950
environment is changing and it seems to
always be

424
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
always be
 

425
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,790
always be
because this the entirety of the earth

426
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
because this the entirety of the earth
 

427
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,270
because this the entirety of the earth
system is a complex system it seems like

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
system is a complex system it seems like
 

429
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,790
system is a complex system it seems like
you have to adapt and to adapt you have

430
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
you have to adapt and to adapt you have
 

431
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,749
you have to adapt and to adapt you have
to kill off the stubborn old

432
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
to kill off the stubborn old
 

433
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,430
to kill off the stubborn old
ideas

434
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
ideas
 

435
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,390
ideas
and uh unless there's a way to like not

like
 

441
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,270
like
the nature of wisdom

442
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
the nature of wisdom
 

443
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,029
the nature of wisdom
is stubborn and old like that's that's

is stubborn and old like that's that's
 

445
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,189
is stubborn and old like that's that's
what wisdom is it's like the lessons of

what wisdom is it's like the lessons of
 

447
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,670
what wisdom is it's like the lessons of
life solid the lessons of experience

solidified
 

451
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,430
solidified
and the solidification is the thing that

452
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
and the solidification is the thing that
 

453
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,029
and the solidification is the thing that
actually prevents you

454
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
actually prevents you
 

455
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,189
actually prevents you
from reinventing yourself

456
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
from reinventing yourself
 

457
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,950
from reinventing yourself
to adapt to the new

um
changing conditions but then again why

462
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
changing conditions but then again why
 

463
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,990
changing conditions but then again why
not have that both of those modes like i

464
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
not have that both of those modes like i
 

465
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,749
not have that both of those modes like i
have two minds and one person one

man
that's possible so you can imagine

476
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
that's possible so you can imagine
 

477
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,270
that's possible so you can imagine
within one mind

478
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
within one mind
 

479
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,029
within one mind
both modes

480
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
both modes
 

481
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,830
both modes
but those are required you have to have

482
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
but those are required you have to have
 

483
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,749
but those are required you have to have
you have to have the ability to

484
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
you have to have the ability to
 

485
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,909
you have to have the ability to
completely reinvent yourself which is

486
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
completely reinvent yourself which is
 

487
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,749
completely reinvent yourself which is
what death does

488
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
what death does
 

489
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,390
what death does
in an ugly way

490
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
in an ugly way
 

491
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,990
in an ugly way
or a beautiful way depending on your

or a beautiful way depending on your
 

493
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,430
or a beautiful way depending on your
perspective depending whether you take

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
perspective depending whether you take
 

495
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,110

697
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,910
the dirty hand that you use for wiping
your own bottom you know that's the

698
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
your own bottom you know that's the
 

699
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,069
your own bottom you know that's the
toilet paper as your left hand so

700
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
toilet paper as your left hand so
 

701
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,990
toilet paper as your left hand so
um while the body is anatomically

702
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
um while the body is anatomically
 

703
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,310
um while the body is anatomically
symmetric the taboo creates this pretty

704
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
symmetric the taboo creates this pretty
 

705
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,790
symmetric the taboo creates this pretty
intense asymmetry uh but for a good

706
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
intense asymmetry uh but for a good
 

707
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,150
intense asymmetry uh but for a good
reason you know you probably shouldn't

708
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
reason you know you probably shouldn't
 

709
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,990
reason you know you probably shouldn't
be shaking hands with other people with

710
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
be shaking hands with other people with
 

711
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,430
be shaking hands with other people with
the same hand that you use to kind of

712
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
the same hand that you use to kind of
 

713
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,590
the same hand that you use to kind of
clean your bottom so in that sense it

714
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
clean your bottom so in that sense it
 

715
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,269
clean your bottom so in that sense it
makes sense

716
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
makes sense
 

717
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,190
makes sense
yeah maybe the roots of it make sense

718
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
yeah maybe the roots of it make sense
 

719
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,670
yeah maybe the roots of it make sense
but the way it propagates especially as

720
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
but the way it propagates especially as
 

721
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,750
but the way it propagates especially as
the times change might not because you

722
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
the times change might not because you
 

723
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,150
the times change might not because you
can wash your hands

724
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
can wash your hands
 

725
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,710
can wash your hands
but the the taboo remains right society

726
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
but the the taboo remains right society
 

727
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,949
but the the taboo remains right society
is very slow to change

728
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
is very slow to change
 

729
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,030
is very slow to change
what is the most fascinating part

730
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
what is the most fascinating part
 

731
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,670
what is the most fascinating part
function or concept in the human body

732

function or concept in the human body
 

733
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,389

735
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,990

you know something that fills you with

736
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
you know something that fills you with
 

737
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,230
you know something that fills you with
awe

738
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
awe
 

739
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,750
awe
i guess the most obvious one is the

740
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
i guess the most obvious one is the
 

741
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,790
i guess the most obvious one is the
brain partly because it's so you know

742
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
brain partly because it's so you know
 

743
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,710
brain partly because it's so you know
sort of poorly understood that we

744
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
sort of poorly understood that we
 

745
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,750
sort of poorly understood that we
understood

746
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
understood
 

747
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,190
understood
understand more than we ever have in the

748
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
understand more than we ever have in the
 

749
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,870
understand more than we ever have in the
past there's still so much that we don't

750
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
past there's still so much that we don't
 

751

past there's still so much that we don't
understand about

752
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
understand about
 

753
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,389
understand about
how the lump of matter and our skulls

754
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
how the lump of matter and our skulls
 

755
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,750
how the lump of matter and our skulls
kind of creates this subjective

756
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
kind of creates this subjective
 

757
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,910
kind of creates this subjective
experience that we all kind of

758
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
experience that we all kind of
 

759
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,550
experience that we all kind of
understand quite viscerally

760
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
understand quite viscerally
 

761
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,069
understand quite viscerally
that's an easy one i would say the

762
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
that's an easy one i would say the
 

763
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,629
that's an easy one i would say the
kidneys are an underappreciated organ uh

764
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
kidneys are an underappreciated organ uh
 

765
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,509
kidneys are an underappreciated organ uh
they

766
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
they
 

767
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,190
they
the the way they tinker with the

768
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
the the way they tinker with the
 

769
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,470
the the way they tinker with the
bloodstream

770
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
bloodstream
 

771
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,470

that kind of our entire lives from
 

775
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,829
that kind of our entire lives from
uh inside the womb until we die is just

776
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
uh inside the womb until we die is just
 

777
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,150
uh inside the womb until we die is just
really incredible and when you look at

778
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
really incredible and when you look at
 

779
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,389
really incredible and when you look at
how much energy different organs consume

780
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
how much energy different organs consume
 

781
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,470

the brain and the kidneys are two of the
 

783
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,110
the brain and the kidneys are two of the
biggest ones because the brain obviously

784
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
biggest ones because the brain obviously
 

785
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,110
biggest ones because the brain obviously
in us is always active and controlling

first day of medical school

856
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
first day of medical school
 

857
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,150
first day of medical school
we started the dissection of a cadaver

858
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
we started the dissection of a cadaver
 

859
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,150
we started the dissection of a cadaver
in the class called anatomy lab and so

860
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
in the class called anatomy lab and so
 

861
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,629
in the class called anatomy lab and so
in a way we were kind of thrown right in

862
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
in a way we were kind of thrown right in
 

863
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,470
in a way we were kind of thrown right in
there in the beginning like this is the

864
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
there in the beginning like this is the
 

865
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,710
there in the beginning like this is the
end of the human story you know

866
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
end of the human story you know
 

867
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,150
end of the human story you know
understand this and then we sort of

868
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
understand this and then we sort of
 

869
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,269
understand this and then we sort of
backed up to the beginning with

870
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
backed up to the beginning with
 

871
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,750
backed up to the beginning with
embryology and reproduction and stuff so

872
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
embryology and reproduction and stuff so
 

873
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,590
embryology and reproduction and stuff so
it's kind of like we got and i got

874
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
it's kind of like we got and i got
 

875
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,949
it's kind of like we got and i got
thrown into that

876
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
thrown into that
 

877
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,710
thrown into that
right right away right in the beginning

878
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
right right away right in the beginning
 

879
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,629
right right away right in the beginning
kind of like here's a dead body now

880
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
kind of like here's a dead body now
 

881
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,990
kind of like here's a dead body now
start cutting it apart and learn the

882
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
start cutting it apart and learn the
 

883
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,670
start cutting it apart and learn the
name and function of absolutely every

884

that first
 

889
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,310
that first
experience with the cold honesty of

890
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
experience with the cold honesty of
 

891
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,310
experience with the cold honesty of
human biology all right that's exactly

892
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
human biology all right that's exactly
 

893
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,069
human biology all right that's exactly
what it was it's cold honesty about the

894
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
what it was it's cold honesty about the
 

895
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,990
what it was it's cold honesty about the
kind of the story of of each individual

kind of the story of of each individual
 

897

human body it has an end and that's it
 

899
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,870
human body it has an end and that's it
um i think that well

900
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
um i think that well
 

901
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,710
um i think that well
actually before the end of that first

902
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
actually before the end of that first
 

903
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,389
actually before the end of that first
day so what we did on that first day was

904
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
day so what we did on that first day was
 

905
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,910
day so what we did on that first day was
study the superficial muscles of the

906
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
study the superficial muscles of the
 

907
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,230
study the superficial muscles of the
back like the lats or latissimus dorsi

908
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
back like the lats or latissimus dorsi
 

909
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,990
back like the lats or latissimus dorsi
and some other muscles you know we cut

910
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
and some other muscles you know we cut
 

911
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,750
and some other muscles you know we cut
through the skin of the back my cadaver

912
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
through the skin of the back my cadaver
 

913
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,189
through the skin of the back my cadaver
was laying face down on this metal

914
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
was laying face down on this metal
 

915
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,949
was laying face down on this metal
gurney we pulled back the kind of

916
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
gurney we pulled back the kind of
 

917
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,110
gurney we pulled back the kind of
plastic sheets that would keep him moist

918
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
plastic sheets that would keep him moist
 

919
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,030
plastic sheets that would keep him moist
for the next four months as we dissected

920
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
for the next four months as we dissected
 

921
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,670
for the next four months as we dissected
him

922
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
him
 

923
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,030
him
cut through the skin on his back and

924
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
cut through the skin on his back and
 

925
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,310
cut through the skin on his back and
then started dissecting through the

926
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
then started dissecting through the
 

927
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,230
then started dissecting through the
superficial muscles of the back and that

928
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,240
superficial muscles of the back and that
 

929
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,310
superficial muscles of the back and that
was really all we saw that first day

930
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
was really all we saw that first day
 

931
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,910
was really all we saw that first day

the abdominal or
 

935
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,670
the abdominal or
chest cavity to see internal organs but

936
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
chest cavity to see internal organs but
 

937
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,470
chest cavity to see internal organs but
i was so fascinated with this sort of

938
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
i was so fascinated with this sort of
 

939
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,949
i was so fascinated with this sort of
behind the scenes look at how things

940
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
behind the scenes look at how things
 

941
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,949
behind the scenes look at how things
work in the body how you move your arms

942
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
work in the body how you move your arms
 

943
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,629
work in the body how you move your arms
how you arch your back you know these

944
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
how you arch your back you know these
 

945
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,389
how you arch your back you know these
are the muscles that do it

946
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
are the muscles that do it
 

947
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,310
are the muscles that do it
that i decided i wanted to donate my own

948
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
that i decided i wanted to donate my own
 

949
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,870
that i decided i wanted to donate my own
body for the same purpose um so i made

950
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
body for the same purpose um so i made
 

951
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,310
body for the same purpose um so i made
that decision literally before the end

952
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
that decision literally before the end
 

953
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,030
that decision literally before the end

still sticking to it
 

957
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,230
still sticking to it
so someday there will be a medical

958
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
so someday there will be a medical
 

959
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,269
so someday there will be a medical
student

960
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
student
 

961
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,230
student
that can

962
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
that can
 

963
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,269
that can
watch and listen to this podcast and

964
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
watch and listen to this podcast and
 

965
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,590
watch and listen to this podcast and
while dissecting your body it could

966
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
while dissecting your body it could
 

967
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,430
while dissecting your body it could
happen they might not know that that

968
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
happen they might not know that that
 

969
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,550
happen they might not know that that
person they're listening to on the

person they're listening to on the
 

971
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,470
person they're listening to on the
podcast will be the carcass in front of

972
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
podcast will be the carcass in front of
 

973
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,710
podcast will be the carcass in front of
them but uh like we don't we never learn

974
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
them but uh like we don't we never learn
 

975
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,949
them but uh like we don't we never learn
the universe will know the universe and

976

977
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,790
the universe will know the universe and
they will acknowledge

978
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
they will acknowledge
 

979
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,670
they will acknowledge
the irony or the humor the absurdity of

980
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
the irony or the humor the absurdity of
 

981
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,829
the irony or the humor the absurdity of
that the universe will chuckle but the

982
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
that the universe will chuckle but the
 

983
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,749
that the universe will chuckle but the
medical student won't know

is a story there that's such an
interesting way that the skin does tell

1151
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,710

some of the damage you've done right and

some of the damage you've done right and
 

1153
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,270
some of the damage you've done right and
even when i when i evaluate a patient i

1154
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
even when i when i evaluate a patient i
 

1155
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,710
even when i when i evaluate a patient i
can use scars

1156
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
can use scars
 

1157
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,630
can use scars
to help me make medical decisions so for

1158
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
to help me make medical decisions so for
 

1159
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,909
to help me make medical decisions so for
instance someone that comes in with

1160
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
instance someone that comes in with
 

1161
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,150
instance someone that comes in with
abdominal pain into the emergency room

1162
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
abdominal pain into the emergency room
 

1163
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,070
abdominal pain into the emergency room
you can see scars on their abdomen that

1164
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
you can see scars on their abdomen that
 

1165
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,549
you can see scars on their abdomen that
tell you about you know the past kind of

1166
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
tell you about you know the past kind of
 

1167
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,029
tell you about you know the past kind of
activities of a surgeon perhaps i know i

1168
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
activities of a surgeon perhaps i know i
 

1169
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,350
activities of a surgeon perhaps i know i
recognize the scars that are left when

1170
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
recognize the scars that are left when
 

1171
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,950
recognize the scars that are left when
someone has their gallbladder removed

1172
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960
someone has their gallbladder removed
 

1173
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,150
someone has their gallbladder removed
the scars when someone has their

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
the scars when someone has their
 

1175
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,669
the scars when someone has their
appendix removed when maybe when

1176
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
appendix removed when maybe when
 

1177
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,950

someone's had a hysterectomy and that
 

1179
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,310
someone's had a hysterectomy and that
can tell you

1180
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
can tell you
 

1181
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,310
can tell you
what it might be or what it isn't you

1182
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
what it might be or what it isn't you
 

1183
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,750
what it might be or what it isn't you
know if someone doesn't have an appendix

1184
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
know if someone doesn't have an appendix
 

1185
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,590
know if someone doesn't have an appendix
their abdominal pain is not appendicitis

1186
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
their abdominal pain is not appendicitis
 

1187
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,150
their abdominal pain is not appendicitis
end of story so in that way

1188
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
end of story so in that way
 

1189
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,070
end of story so in that way
i'm sort of looking at these the the

1190
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
i'm sort of looking at these the the
 

1191
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,909
i'm sort of looking at these the the
tracks or the footprints of past

surgeries to tell me what what might and

1194
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
surgeries to tell me what what might and
 

1195
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,750
surgeries to tell me what what might and
might not be the cause of this patient's

1196
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
might not be the cause of this patient's
 

1197
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,190
might not be the cause of this patient's
abdominal pain which is kind of my main

1198
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
abdominal pain which is kind of my main
 

1199
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,789
abdominal pain which is kind of my main
job in the er is figuring out what's

1200
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
job in the er is figuring out what's
 

1201
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,510
job in the er is figuring out what's
causing it and to help them

1202
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
causing it and to help them
 

1203
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,190
causing it and to help them
is there

1204
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
is there
 

1205
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,950
is there
ways to get more data about the human

1206
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
ways to get more data about the human
 

1207
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,430
ways to get more data about the human
body as we look into the future of

1208
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
body as we look into the future of
 

1209
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,909
body as we look into the future of
medicine biology that would be helpful

1210
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
medicine biology that would be helpful
 

1211
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,549
medicine biology that would be helpful
to fill in some of the gaps of the story

1212
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
to fill in some of the gaps of the story
 

1213
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,510
to fill in some of the gaps of the story
so

1214
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
so
 

1215
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,750
so
you know you have

1216
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
you know you have
 

1217
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,230
you know you have
you have companies you have research

1218
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
you have companies you have research
 

1219
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,029
you have companies you have research
that looks at you know uh collection of

1220
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
that looks at you know uh collection of
 

1221
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,909
that looks at you know uh collection of
blood over long periods of time to see

1222
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
blood over long periods of time to see
 

1223
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,669
blood over long periods of time to see
sort of

1224
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
sort of
 

1225
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,870
sort of
you know paint the picture of what's

1226
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
you know paint the picture of what's
 

1227
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,630
you know paint the picture of what's
happening in your body mostly to help

1228
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
happening in your body mostly to help
 

1229
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,950
happening in your body mostly to help
with lifestyle decisions but

1230
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
with lifestyle decisions but
 

1231
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,110
with lifestyle decisions but
but also just you know to anticipate

1232
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
but also just you know to anticipate
 

1233
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,470
but also just you know to anticipate
things that can go wrong and all that

1234
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
things that can go wrong and all that
 

1235
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,149
things that can go wrong and all that
kind of stuff is there can you just

1236
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
kind of stuff is there can you just
 

1237
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,350
kind of stuff is there can you just
speak to

1238
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
speak to
 

1239
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,390
speak to
um

1240
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
um
 

1241
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,149
um
a greater digital world that we're

1242
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
a greater digital world that we're
 

1243
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,549
a greater digital world that we're
stepping in how that can help

1244
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
stepping in how that can help
 

1245
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,950
stepping in how that can help
tell a richer story

1246
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
tell a richer story
 

1247
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,510
tell a richer story
i certainly think that we

1248
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
i certainly think that we
 

1249
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,430
i certainly think that we
have more data than we know what to do

1250
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
have more data than we know what to do
 

1251
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,990
have more data than we know what to do
with right now especially with kind of

1252
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
with right now especially with kind of
 

1253
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,230
with right now especially with kind of
direct-to-consumer medical devices you

1254
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
direct-to-consumer medical devices you
 

1255
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,870
direct-to-consumer medical devices you
know smart watches etc that are just

1256
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
know smart watches etc that are just
 

1257
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,950
know smart watches etc that are just
collecting these reams of data i have

1258
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
collecting these reams of data i have
 

1259
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,430
collecting these reams of data i have
not seen them put to i think the

1260
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
not seen them put to i think the
 

1261
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,590
not seen them put to i think the
eventual use that they will

1262
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
eventual use that they will
 

1263
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,510
eventual use that they will
um i think that the

1264
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,520
um i think that the
 

1265
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,310
um i think that the
potential is is sort of just um you know

1266
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
potential is is sort of just um you know
 

1267
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,630
potential is is sort of just um you know
unimaginable and i hope we're heading

1268
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
unimaginable and i hope we're heading
 

1269
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,470
unimaginable and i hope we're heading
into a new age where you know you can

1270
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
into a new age where you know you can
 

1271
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,789
into a new age where you know you can
determine for instance is a person going

1272
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
determine for instance is a person going
 

1273
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,630
determine for instance is a person going
to have more of the dangerous side

1274
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
to have more of the dangerous side
 

1275
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,909
to have more of the dangerous side
effects to a drug based on their

1276
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
effects to a drug based on their
 

1277
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,870
effects to a drug based on their
genetics or are they going to tolerate

1278
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
genetics or are they going to tolerate
 

1279
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,110
genetics or are they going to tolerate
one drug better than the other you know

1280
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
one drug better than the other you know
 

1281
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,190
one drug better than the other you know
based on on their genetics and

1282
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
based on on their genetics and
 

1283
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,750
based on on their genetics and
we are slowly moving into that age and

1284
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
we are slowly moving into that age and
 

1285
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,830
we are slowly moving into that age and
especially the age of kind of completely

1286
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:29,840
especially the age of kind of completely
 

1287
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,430
especially the age of kind of completely
synthesizing drugs in a lab

1288
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,440
synthesizing drugs in a lab
 

1289
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,510
synthesizing drugs in a lab
um you know much like

1290
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
um you know much like
 

1291
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,590
um you know much like
for instance some of the covid vaccines

1292
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600
for instance some of the covid vaccines
 

1293
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,830
for instance some of the covid vaccines
actually like moderna never had a vir

1294
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
actually like moderna never had a vir
 

1295
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,510
actually like moderna never had a vir
the virus in their lab they made that

1296
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
the virus in their lab they made that
 

1297
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,190
the virus in their lab they made that
vaccine completely without ever having

1298
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
vaccine completely without ever having
 

1299
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,549
vaccine completely without ever having
the virus themselves just by having the

1300
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
the virus themselves just by having the
 

1301
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,110
the virus themselves just by having the
genome which is sort of astounding and

1302
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
genome which is sort of astounding and
 

1303
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,870
genome which is sort of astounding and
there's a lot of potential going forward

1304
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
there's a lot of potential going forward
 

1305
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,310
there's a lot of potential going forward
you know based on that technology and

1306
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
you know based on that technology and
 

1307
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,909
you know based on that technology and
some others well i didn't know that so

1308
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
some others well i didn't know that so
 

1309
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,830
some others well i didn't know that so
they basically it's all in the computer

1310
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
they basically it's all in the computer
 

1311
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,270
they basically it's all in the computer
it's computational right you have the

1312
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
it's computational right you have the
 

1313
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,430
it's computational right you have the
genetic code you have tremendous power

1314
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,440
genetic code you have tremendous power
 

1315
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,789
genetic code you have tremendous power
even if you don't have the organism

1316
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
even if you don't have the organism
 

1317
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,669
even if you don't have the organism
itself

1318
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
itself
 

1319
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,909

00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
what do you make of elizabeth
 

1321
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,789
what do you make of elizabeth
holmes and efforts like that first of

i'm drawn
 

1333
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,390
i'm drawn
to the darkness in human nature because

1334
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400
to the darkness in human nature because
 

1335
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,270
to the darkness in human nature because
that somehow reveals

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
that somehow reveals
 

1337
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,230
that somehow reveals
um

the full spectrum of what humans could

1340
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
the full spectrum of what humans could
 

1341
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,029
the full spectrum of what humans could
be

1342
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:23,039
be
 

1343
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,110
be
so there's a lot of controversial

1344
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
so there's a lot of controversial
 

1345
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,029
so there's a lot of controversial
thoughts about who she is and her

1346
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
thoughts about who she is and her
 

1347
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,630
thoughts about who she is and her
efforts and so on

1348
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
efforts and so on
 

1349
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,310
efforts and so on
i think you may have even tweeted about

1350
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
i think you may have even tweeted about
 

1351
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,070
i think you may have even tweeted about
it but i've read a lot of your tweets so

1352
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
it but i've read a lot of your tweets so
 

1353
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,390
it but i've read a lot of your tweets so
i'm not forgetting um but what do you

1354
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
i'm not forgetting um but what do you
 

1355
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,390
i'm not forgetting um but what do you
make of her and those that both those

1356
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400
make of her and those that both those
 

1357
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,870
make of her and those that both those
efforts and the charlatans

1358
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880

 

1359
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,270

that sort of

1360
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
that sort of
 

1361
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,510
that sort of
snake oil salesmen

1362
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
snake oil salesmen
 

1363
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,549
snake oil salesmen
that's

1364
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
that's
 

1365
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,470
that's
promised those efforts

1366
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
promised those efforts
 

1367
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,190
promised those efforts
to do more than they currently can

1368
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
to do more than they currently can
 

1369
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,230
to do more than they currently can
i think that her you know that goal that

1370
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
i think that her you know that goal that
 

1371
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,549
i think that her you know that goal that
she had that she created theranos to try

1372
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
she had that she created theranos to try
 

1373
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,909
she had that she created theranos to try
to achieve

1374
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
to achieve
 

1375
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,549
to achieve
to use less blood in tests is a very

1376
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
to use less blood in tests is a very
 

1377
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,870
to use less blood in tests is a very
worthy goal and a huge frontier that we

1378
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
worthy goal and a huge frontier that we
 

1379
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,149
worthy goal and a huge frontier that we
have not

1380
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
have not
 

1381
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,070
have not
achieved and that i hope we will achieve

1382
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
achieved and that i hope we will achieve
 

1383
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,029
achieved and that i hope we will achieve
so i understand why you know what

1384
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:09,039
so i understand why you know what
 

1385
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,270
so i understand why you know what
someone describes what a huge step

1386
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280
someone describes what a huge step
 

1387
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,710
someone describes what a huge step
forward that would be and it would be

1388
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
forward that would be and it would be
 

1389
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,470
forward that would be and it would be
indeed i understand why people put a ton

1390
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
indeed i understand why people put a ton
 

1391
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,870
indeed i understand why people put a ton
of money behind it can you describe what

1392
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
of money behind it can you describe what
 

1393
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,789
of money behind it can you describe what
was the promise what what are we even

1394
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
was the promise what what are we even
 

1395
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,390
was the promise what what are we even
talking about what's their nose what

1396
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
talking about what's their nose what
 

1397
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,310
talking about what's their nose what
just uh for people who don't know so

1398
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
just uh for people who don't know so
 

1399
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,390
just uh for people who don't know so
theranose is a company that was

1400
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
theranose is a company that was
 

1401
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,110
theranose is a company that was
basically started to revolutionize the

1402
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120
basically started to revolutionize the
 

1403
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,669
basically started to revolutionize the
way medical blood tests are done

1404
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
way medical blood tests are done
 

1405
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,390
way medical blood tests are done
both to use a whole lot less blood in

1406
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
both to use a whole lot less blood in
 

1407
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,990
both to use a whole lot less blood in
doing it you know if anyone's ever been

1408
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
doing it you know if anyone's ever been
 

1409
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,470
doing it you know if anyone's ever been
to the doctor and had five to ten tubes

1410
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
to the doctor and had five to ten tubes
 

1411
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,549
to the doctor and had five to ten tubes
of blood removed from them it can be uh

1412
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
of blood removed from them it can be uh
 

1413
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,029
of blood removed from them it can be uh
quite surprising how much they take out

1414
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
quite surprising how much they take out
 

1415
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,549
quite surprising how much they take out
uh and and it's

1416
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
uh and and it's
 

1417
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,310
uh and and it's
you know that's the limitation of our

1418
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
you know that's the limitation of our
 

1419
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,990
you know that's the limitation of our
technology that we need those volumes of

1420
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
technology that we need those volumes of
 

1421
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,510
technology that we need those volumes of
blood to run all the tests that we want

1422
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,520
blood to run all the tests that we want
 

1423
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,430
blood to run all the tests that we want
to and so the promise of theranos was

1424
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
to and so the promise of theranos was
 

1425
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,669
to and so the promise of theranos was
that perhaps with a single drop of blood

1426
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
that perhaps with a single drop of blood
 

1427
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,750
that perhaps with a single drop of blood
we would be able to know as much about

1428
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
we would be able to know as much about
 

1429
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,909
we would be able to know as much about
the person's the condition of their

1430
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
the person's the condition of their
 

1431
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,149
the person's the condition of their
their body um without drawing all that

1432
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
their body um without drawing all that
 

1433
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,149
their body um without drawing all that
blood and and thereby you know there

1434
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159
blood and and thereby you know there
 

1435
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,909
blood and and thereby you know there
would be these devices she was going to

1436
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
would be these devices she was going to
 

1437
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,909
would be these devices she was going to
create that would sort of do it you put

1438
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:03,919
create that would sort of do it you put
 

1439
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,269
create that would sort of do it you put
a drop of blood in it spits out

1440
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:05,279
a drop of blood in it spits out
 

1441
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,470
a drop of blood in it spits out
everything you ever wanted to know about

1442
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
everything you ever wanted to know about
 

1443
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,310
everything you ever wanted to know about
what's in your bloodstream and in a way

1444
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
what's in your bloodstream and in a way
 

1445
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,909
what's in your bloodstream and in a way
that would make it so much easier you

1446
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
that would make it so much easier you
 

1447
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,190
that would make it so much easier you
know it could be you could have one in

1448
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
know it could be you could have one in
 

1449
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,350
know it could be you could have one in
your home theoretically and you i don't

1450
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
your home theoretically and you i don't
 

1451
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,390
your home theoretically and you i don't
know why you'd wonder what your

1452
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
know why you'd wonder what your
 

1453
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,310
know why you'd wonder what your
potassium level is on any given day but

1454
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
potassium level is on any given day but
 

1455
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,190
potassium level is on any given day but
you could check if you wanted to um and

1456
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
you could check if you wanted to um and
 

1457
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,269
you could check if you wanted to um and
so that that goal is very worthy you

1458
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
so that that goal is very worthy you
 

1459
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,750
so that that goal is very worthy you
know i i put that goal up there with

1460
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
know i i put that goal up there with
 

1461
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,750
know i i put that goal up there with
uh the the frontier of making

1462
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
uh the the frontier of making
 

1463
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,510
uh the the frontier of making
painkillers that are as good as opioids

1464
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:27,520
painkillers that are as good as opioids
 

1465
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,950
painkillers that are as good as opioids
without the addictive quality you know

1466
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
without the addictive quality you know
 

1467
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,630
without the addictive quality you know
that would be such a huge revolution if

1468
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
that would be such a huge revolution if
 

1469
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,789
that would be such a huge revolution if
we did have that in medicine but

1470
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
we did have that in medicine but
 

1471
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,630
we did have that in medicine but
and particularly for me because i

1472
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
and particularly for me because i
 

1473
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,789
and particularly for me because i
trained in both pediatrics and internal

1474
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
trained in both pediatrics and internal
 

1475
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,870
trained in both pediatrics and internal
medicine so i learned to care for both

1476
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
medicine so i learned to care for both
 

1477
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,950
medicine so i learned to care for both
children and adults in children we do

1478
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
children and adults in children we do
 

1479
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,630
children and adults in children we do
draw much less blood they have a much

1480
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:42,640
draw much less blood they have a much
 

1481
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,789
draw much less blood they have a much
lower blood volume and we use these tiny

1482
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
lower blood volume and we use these tiny
 

1483
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,190
lower blood volume and we use these tiny
little tubes to draw their blood

1484
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
little tubes to draw their blood
 

1485
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,710
little tubes to draw their blood
and we seemingly get

1486
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
and we seemingly get
 

1487
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,549
and we seemingly get
equivalent information out of the larger

1488
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:50,559
equivalent information out of the larger
 

1489
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,549
equivalent information out of the larger
tubes we draw from adults and i'm still

1490
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
tubes we draw from adults and i'm still
 

1491
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,230
tubes we draw from adults and i'm still
unclear to be honest why we can't draw

1492
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
unclear to be honest why we can't draw
 

1493
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,149
unclear to be honest why we can't draw
that little amount of blood from adults

1494
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
that little amount of blood from adults
 

1495
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,390
that little amount of blood from adults
it seems technically possible i don't

1496
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
it seems technically possible i don't
 

1497
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,590
it seems technically possible i don't
know what the barriers are i'm sure

1498
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600
know what the barriers are i'm sure
 

1499
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,070
know what the barriers are i'm sure
there are or else we'd be doing it

1500
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
there are or else we'd be doing it
 

1501
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,830
there are or else we'd be doing it
but i do think that that is a very

1502
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
but i do think that that is a very
 

1503
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,830
but i do think that that is a very
important goal and if theranos had done

1504
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
important goal and if theranos had done
 

1505
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,190
important goal and if theranos had done
it they would have really revolutionized

1506
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
it they would have really revolutionized
 

1507
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,870
it they would have really revolutionized
the practice of medicine

1508
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
the practice of medicine
 

1509
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,470
the practice of medicine
so to

1510
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
so to
 

1511
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,110
so to
return to that

1512
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,120
return to that
 

1513
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,669
return to that
cadaver that first day

1514
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
cadaver that first day
 

1515
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,510
cadaver that first day
uh when you got to meet with the with

1516
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
uh when you got to meet with the with
 

1517

the dead with a
 

1519
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,350
the dead with a
human body that's no longer living so

1520
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
human body that's no longer living so
 

1521
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,470
human body that's no longer living so
how

1522
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480
how
 

1523
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,870
how
how quickly

1524
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
how quickly
 

1525
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,110
how quickly
did it take for you to get used to sort

1526
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,120
did it take for you to get used to sort
 

1527
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,029
did it take for you to get used to sort
of uh he said looking at the surface

muscles of the back

1530

muscles of the back
 

1531
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,549
muscles of the back
i mean

1532
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
i mean
 

1533
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,789
i mean
that can be overwhelming as a thought

1534
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:34,799
that can be overwhelming as a thought
 

1535
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,230
that can be overwhelming as a thought
and people listening to this that have

1536
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
and people listening to this that have
 

1537
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,789
and people listening to this that have
never dissected anything might might be

1538
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:38,799
never dissected anything might might be
 

1539
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,669
never dissected anything might might be
overwhelmed by that thought so like how

1540
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
overwhelmed by that thought so like how
 

1541
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,630
overwhelmed by that thought so like how
quickly were you able to get used to

1542
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
quickly were you able to get used to
 

1543
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,269
quickly were you able to get used to
the brutal honesty of the biology before

1544
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
the brutal honesty of the biology before
 

1545
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,390
the brutal honesty of the biology before
you

1546
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,400
you
 

1547

for me it did not take long at all i

1548
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
for me it did not take long at all i
 

1549
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,470
for me it did not take long at all i
guess i've not never been a squeamish

1550
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480
guess i've not never been a squeamish
 

1551
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,950
guess i've not never been a squeamish
person so for me it was kind of riveting

1552
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
person so for me it was kind of riveting
 

1553
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,390
person so for me it was kind of riveting
and fascinating right from the first

1554
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
and fascinating right from the first
 

1555
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,950
and fascinating right from the first
moment but i do know some of my fellow

1556
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:58,960
moment but i do know some of my fellow
 

1557
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,669
moment but i do know some of my fellow
classmates did have some trouble with it

1558
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
classmates did have some trouble with it
 

1559
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,190
classmates did have some trouble with it
some of them i

1560
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
some of them i
 

1561
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,269
some of them i
heard had nightmares in the first few

1562
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
heard had nightmares in the first few
 

1563
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,510
heard had nightmares in the first few
weeks of anatomy lab

1564
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
weeks of anatomy lab
 

1565
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,510
weeks of anatomy lab
and but then everyone as far as i know

1566
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
and but then everyone as far as i know
 

1567
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,909
and but then everyone as far as i know
got used to it and that was also

1568
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
got used to it and that was also
 

1569
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,669
got used to it and that was also
actually a big lesson for me that it's

1570
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
actually a big lesson for me that it's
 

1571
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,510
actually a big lesson for me that it's
pretty amazing what people can get used

1572
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,520
pretty amazing what people can get used
 

1573
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,029
pretty amazing what people can get used
to in their daily lives and i kind of

1574
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:17,039
to in their daily lives and i kind of
 

1575
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,190
to in their daily lives and i kind of
extrapolated that to people living

1576
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
extrapolated that to people living
 

1577
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,029
extrapolated that to people living
through war and through you know just

1578
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039
through war and through you know just
 

1579
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,750
through war and through you know just
terrible uh situations and

1580
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
terrible uh situations and
 

1581
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,070
terrible uh situations and
living under um you know oppressive

1582
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
living under um you know oppressive
 

1583
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,390
living under um you know oppressive
regimes and it it really is amazing what

1584
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400
regimes and it it really is amazing what
 

1585
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,269
regimes and it it really is amazing what
people can get used to almost anything

1586
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
people can get used to almost anything
 

1587
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,430
people can get used to almost anything
but you know in war

1588
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,440
but you know in war
 

1589
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,390
but you know in war
people

1590
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
people
 

1591
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,110
people
often come back and they have nightmares

1592
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,120
often come back and they have nightmares
 

1593

they suffer through it there's ptsd
 

1595
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,110
they suffer through it there's ptsd
there's uh there's a lot of complicated

1596
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
there's uh there's a lot of complicated
 

1597
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,669
there's uh there's a lot of complicated
feelings with that

1598
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:43,679
feelings with that
 

1599
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,510
feelings with that
are echoes of those same complicated

1600
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
are echoes of those same complicated
 

1601
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,590
are echoes of those same complicated
feelings possible

1602
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
feelings possible
 

1603
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,669
feelings possible
in the case of training to be and

1604
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
in the case of training to be and
 

1605
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,669
in the case of training to be and
becoming a doctor

1606
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
becoming a doctor
 

1607
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,190
becoming a doctor
that's a good point yeah i think you

1608
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,200
that's a good point yeah i think you
 

1609
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,590
that's a good point yeah i think you
know sometimes just as you know a barbed

1610
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
know sometimes just as you know a barbed
 

1611
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,070
know sometimes just as you know a barbed
wire fence can leave a scar on your skin

1612
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080

you know emotional uh psychological

1614
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
you know emotional uh psychological
 

1615
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,230
you know emotional uh psychological
experiences can leave a mark on your

1616
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
experiences can leave a mark on your
 

1617
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,669
experiences can leave a mark on your
brain or your memory and i think that

1618
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
brain or your memory and i think that
 

1619
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,630
brain or your memory and i think that
that definitely could be um

1620
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:08,640
that definitely could be um
 

1621
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,630
that definitely could be um
could be a problem in medical training

1622

seeing inside her first dead body
 

1637
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,350
seeing inside her first dead body
because she sees inside them all day

1638
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,360
because she sees inside them all day
 

1639
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,470
because she sees inside them all day
every day now

but i'm sure it it could you know we we
 

1643
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,669
but i'm sure it it could you know we we
go on to see so many um kind of

1644

things in medical training through

1648
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,200
things in medical training through
 

1649
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,630
things in medical training through
medical school and then by working with

1650
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
medical school and then by working with
 

1651
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,669
medical school and then by working with
actual living patients not just dead and

1652
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
actual living patients not just dead and
 

1653
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,510
actual living patients not just dead and
embalmed bodies

1654
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:43,520
embalmed bodies
 

1655
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,070
embalmed bodies
so i do think that things can leave a

1656
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
so i do think that things can leave a
 

1657
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,470
so i do think that things can leave a
mark but i don't think that initial

1658
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
mark but i don't think that initial
 

1659
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,830
mark but i don't think that initial
cadaver would be the most traumatic

1660
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
cadaver would be the most traumatic
 

1661
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,710
cadaver would be the most traumatic
yeah but maybe some of that trauma the

1662
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
yeah but maybe some of that trauma the
 

1663
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,110
yeah but maybe some of that trauma the

1668
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
some of your own psychological trauma
 

1669
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,950

returning to the ordering
 

1673
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,470

00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,430
are we talking about
when that hole actually became becomes

1784
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
when that hole actually became becomes
 

1785
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,710
when that hole actually became becomes
tubular

1786
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
tubular
 

1787
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,389
tubular
so the throat i would count as just sort

1788
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:02,399
so the throat i would count as just sort
 

1789
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,029
so the throat i would count as just sort
of the very back of the of the you know

1790
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
of the very back of the of the you know
 

1791
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,789
of the very back of the of the you know
the back of the mouth where the nose

1792
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:06,799
the back of the mouth where the nose
 

1793
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,710
the back of the mouth where the nose
also comes down and meets it where the

1794
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:08,720
also comes down and meets it where the
 

1795
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,190
also comes down and meets it where the
tonsils are and the uvula

1796
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
tonsils are and the uvula
 

1797
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,470
tonsils are and the uvula
but you're right that you know we are a

1798
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
but you're right that you know we are a
 

1799
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,230
but you're right that you know we are a
bunch of holes but more accurately we're

1800
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,240
bunch of holes but more accurately we're
 

1801
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,549
bunch of holes but more accurately we're
a tube right we start in the womb as

1802
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
a tube right we start in the womb as
 

1803
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,470
a tube right we start in the womb as
kind of this microscopic little disc

1804
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
kind of this microscopic little disc
 

1805
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,590
kind of this microscopic little disc
almost like

1806
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
almost like
 

1807
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,870
almost like
a uh

1808
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:20,880
a uh
 

1809
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,710
a uh
you know a flat bread and then we're we

1810
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
you know a flat bread and then we're we
 

1811
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,269
you know a flat bread and then we're we
roll in almost like a burrito into this

1812
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,279
roll in almost like a burrito into this
 

1813
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,510
roll in almost like a burrito into this
tube and we're a simple microscopic tube

1814
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:27,520
tube and we're a simple microscopic tube
 

1815
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,269
tube and we're a simple microscopic tube
and from there we grow into this bigger

1816
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
and from there we grow into this bigger
 

1817
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,789
and from there we grow into this bigger
and bigger tube and we become more

1818
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799
and bigger tube and we become more
 

1819
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,269
and bigger tube and we become more
complicated and each end of the tube

1820
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
complicated and each end of the tube
 

1821
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,269
complicated and each end of the tube
does split into various holes so all the

1822
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
does split into various holes so all the
 

1823
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,630
does split into various holes so all the
holes you mentioned at the front end of

1824
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:36,640
holes you mentioned at the front end of
 

1825
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,230
holes you mentioned at the front end of
the tube the front end of her body right

1826
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,240
the tube the front end of her body right
 

1827
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,830
the tube the front end of her body right
it splits into the nose

1828
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
it splits into the nose
 

1829
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,190
it splits into the nose
the mouth the ears the sinuses the the

1830
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,200
the mouth the ears the sinuses the the
 

1831
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,470
the mouth the ears the sinuses the the
tube to the

1832
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
tube to the
 

1833
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,230
tube to the
lungs which is the windpipe the tube

1834
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
lungs which is the windpipe the tube
 

1835
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,350
lungs which is the windpipe the tube
down to the stomach which is the

1836
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
down to the stomach which is the
 

1837
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,630
down to the stomach which is the
esophagus

1838
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
esophagus
 

1839
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,909
esophagus
and then the other end of the tube

1840
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:49,919
and then the other end of the tube
 

1841
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,389
and then the other end of the tube
splits as well uh you know men end up

1842
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:52,399
splits as well uh you know men end up
 

1843
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,750
splits as well uh you know men end up
with two holes

1844
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
with two holes
 

1845
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,750
with two holes
and women end up with three holes

1846
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:55,760
and women end up with three holes
 

1847
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,990
and women end up with three holes
um you know the urethra the vagina and

1848
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
um you know the urethra the vagina and
 

1849
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,509
um you know the urethra the vagina and
the anus and men just you know the

1850
00:30:59,509 --> 00:30:59,519
the anus and men just you know the
 

1851
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,590
the anus and men just you know the
urethra and kind of the reproductive

1852
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:01,600
urethra and kind of the reproductive
 

1853
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,149
urethra and kind of the reproductive
system they share a hole so i'm learning

1854
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:04,159
system they share a hole so i'm learning
 

1855
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,750
system they share a hole so i'm learning
a lot today

1856
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:05,760
a lot today
 

1857
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,470
a lot today
it really is incredible that you start

1858
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,480
it really is incredible that you start
 

1859
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,190
it really is incredible that you start
from sperm and egg and you have some dna

1860
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
from sperm and egg and you have some dna
 

1861
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,750
from sperm and egg and you have some dna
information and from that the building

1862
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:13,760
information and from that the building
 

1863
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,430
information and from that the building
project begins

1864
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
project begins
 

1865
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,029
project begins
and then what that leads to is like a

1866
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:19,039
and then what that leads to is like a
 

1867
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,269
and then what that leads to is like a
like a like pizza dough and then you

1868
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
like a like pizza dough and then you
 

1869
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,470
like a like pizza dough and then you
roll it

1870
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
roll it
 

1871
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,190
roll it
into a tube and that tube then

1872
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200
into a tube and that tube then
 

1873
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,470
into a tube and that tube then
eventually

1874
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,480
eventually
 

1875
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,710
eventually
sort of becomes more and more

1876
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
sort of becomes more and more
 

1877
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,710
sort of becomes more and more
complicated and gets

1878
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:32,720
complicated and gets
 

1879
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,630
complicated and gets
eyes and a brain

1880
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
eyes and a brain
 

1881
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,310
eyes and a brain
and then uh can create a twitter account

1882
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,320
and then uh can create a twitter account
 

1883
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,070
and then uh can create a twitter account
so for so from

1884
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
so for so from
 

1885
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,750
so for so from
it's it's really incredible that we're

1886
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:41,760
it's it's really incredible that we're
 

1887
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,509
it's it's really incredible that we're
just a fancy tube

1888
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:43,519
just a fancy tube
 

1889
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,470
just a fancy tube
right we are and we sprout eyes and a

1890
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
right we are and we sprout eyes and a
 

1891
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,950
right we are and we sprout eyes and a
brain and a sense of smell and taste

1892
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
brain and a sense of smell and taste
 

1893
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,630
brain and a sense of smell and taste
pretty much to regulate what comes in

1894
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:50,640
pretty much to regulate what comes in
 

1895
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,389
pretty much to regulate what comes in
the front of the tube you know we don't

1896
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:52,399
the front of the tube you know we don't
 

1897
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,149
the front of the tube you know we don't
want to eat anything dangerous or

1898
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:54,159
want to eat anything dangerous or
 

1899
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,750
want to eat anything dangerous or
poisonous you know we want to choose

1900
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:55,760
poisonous you know we want to choose
 

1901
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,269
poisonous you know we want to choose
what we eat

1902
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279
what we eat
 

1903
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,950
what we eat
even choose who we kiss well we seem to

1904
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
even choose who we kiss well we seem to
 

1905
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,190
even choose who we kiss well we seem to
be motivated by what comes out of the

1906
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
be motivated by what comes out of the
 

1907
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,710
be motivated by what comes out of the
tube as well

1908
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,720
tube as well
 

1909
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,990
tube as well
in part

1910
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
in part
 

1911
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,310
in part
that's not just output it's a feedback

1912
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
that's not just output it's a feedback
 

1913
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,310
that's not just output it's a feedback
mechanism seemingly like we're also

1914
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
mechanism seemingly like we're also
 

1915
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,870
mechanism seemingly like we're also
monitoring the functioning of the output

1916
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
monitoring the functioning of the output
 

1917
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,070
monitoring the functioning of the output
we're not just obsessed about the input

1918
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
we're not just obsessed about the input
 

1919
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,509
we're not just obsessed about the input
we're very obsessed with the output

1920
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:15,519
we're very obsessed with the output
 

1921
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,750
we're very obsessed with the output
you're absolutely right about that

1922
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
you're absolutely right about that
 

1923
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,310
you're absolutely right about that
people you know have medical complaints

1924
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,320
people you know have medical complaints
 

1925
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,549
people you know have medical complaints
about their output very often that are

1926
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:22,559
about their output very often that are
 

1927
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,230
about their output very often that are
you know i'm never i never cease to be

1928
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,240
you know i'm never i never cease to be
 

1929
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,389
you know i'm never i never cease to be
surprised by a new kind of complaint or

1930
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
surprised by a new kind of complaint or
 

1931
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,230
surprised by a new kind of complaint or
observation about the output i think

1932
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,240
observation about the output i think
 

1933
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,269
observation about the output i think
people have gone to wars over

1934
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:31,279
people have gone to wars over
 

1935
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,830
people have gone to wars over
the output and uh maybe sometimes the

1936
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
the output and uh maybe sometimes the
 

1937
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,909
the output and uh maybe sometimes the
lack of the output or the desire for

1938
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:35,919
lack of the output or the desire for
 

1939
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,350
lack of the output or the desire for
output for the particular other humans

1940
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
output for the particular other humans
 

1941
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,950
output for the particular other humans
that you fancy the brain and the eyes

00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:36,640
to the trachea dragging with it all
 

2105
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,630

kinds of particulates that we've inhaled

00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
kinds of particulates that we've inhaled
 

2107
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,470
kinds of particulates that we've inhaled
and perhaps some food that went down the

2108
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
and perhaps some food that went down the
 

2109
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,310
and perhaps some food that went down the
wrong pipe and drags it up into the

2110
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:42,320
wrong pipe and drags it up into the
 

2111
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,390
wrong pipe and drags it up into the
throat and we swallow it kind of

2112
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
throat and we swallow it kind of
 

2113
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,310
throat and we swallow it kind of
unconsciously all day every day is the

unconsciously all day every day is the
 

2115
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,470

00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
truth even the mechanism of swallowing
 

2117
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,550
truth even the mechanism of swallowing
is super complicated you know uses a

00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:50,560
is super complicated you know uses a
 

2119
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,510
is super complicated you know uses a
number of cranial nerves it uses over 15

00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:53,520
number of cranial nerves it uses over 15
 

2121
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,870

00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:58,320
um it's this coordinated act to keep
 

2125
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,310
um it's this coordinated act to keep
food out of the airway you know it you

00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,320
food out of the airway you know it you

it's so interesting and so a lot of the
 

2179
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,069
it's so interesting and so a lot of the

borrowing a lot of stuff from evolution
 

2189
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,870
borrowing a lot of stuff from evolution
and maybe

2190
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:12,880
and maybe
 

2191
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,270
and maybe
making small adjustments maybe due to

2192
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,280
making small adjustments maybe due to
 

2193
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,109
making small adjustments maybe due to
the fact that we're not using our mouth

2194
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,119
the fact that we're not using our mouth

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,030
the fact that we're not using our mouth
to murder

2196
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,040
to murder

things

2198
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:19,920
things
 

2199
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,870
things
as other predators might we use our

2200
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
as other predators might we use our
 

2201
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,950
as other predators might we use our
thumbs exactly we have hands we don't

2202
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:24,960
thumbs exactly we have hands we don't

need to bite them

2204
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,320
need to bite them
 

2205
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,950
need to bite them
um yeah there's a lot of overlap between

2206
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:28,960
um yeah there's a lot of overlap between
 

2207
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,950
um yeah there's a lot of overlap between
different animals which i find uh very

2208
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
different animals which i find uh very
 

2209
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,790
different animals which i find uh very
comforting and fascinating you know

2210
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:32,800
comforting and fascinating you know
 

2211
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,630
comforting and fascinating you know
someone asked me is there any animal in

2212
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:34,640
someone asked me is there any animal in
 

2213
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,630
someone asked me is there any animal in
which the throat is better designed and

2214
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:36,640
which the throat is better designed and
 

2215
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,470
which the throat is better designed and
i my first thought was whales because

2216
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:38,480
i my first thought was whales because
 

2217
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,150
i my first thought was whales because
the blowhole is kind of up on the top of

2218
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,160
the blowhole is kind of up on the top of
 

2219
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,230
the blowhole is kind of up on the top of
their head so i was thinking oh maybe

2220
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,240
their head so i was thinking oh maybe
 

2221
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,150
their head so i was thinking oh maybe
maybe they are set more separate but

2222
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
maybe they are set more separate but
 

2223
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,829
maybe they are set more separate but
when i looked into it actually no you

2224
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:45,839
when i looked into it actually no you
 

2225
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,310
when i looked into it actually no you
know the paths do come very close just

2226
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,320
know the paths do come very close just
 

2227
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,910
know the paths do come very close just
like in us and

2228
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:49,920
like in us and
 

2229
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,630
like in us and
i saw a paper about some new discovered

2230
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:52,640
i saw a paper about some new discovered
 

2231
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,870
i saw a paper about some new discovered
organ that actually helps keep food and

2232
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:54,880
organ that actually helps keep food and
 

2233
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,630
organ that actually helps keep food and
drink out of the airway in wales that

2234
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:56,640
drink out of the airway in wales that
 

2235
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,790
drink out of the airway in wales that
they hadn't ever noticed before so it's

2236
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
they hadn't ever noticed before so it's
 

2237
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,630
they hadn't ever noticed before so it's
a different mechanism but the same kind

2238
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:00,640
a different mechanism but the same kind
 

2239
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,030
a different mechanism but the same kind
of basic problem is that you know where

2240
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,040
of basic problem is that you know where
 

2241
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,109
of basic problem is that you know where
tubes and the air tube and food tube are

tubes and the air tube and food tube are
 

2243
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,270
tubes and the air tube and food tube are
right next to each other how well do we

00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280
right next to each other how well do we

00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:11,280
little part is there still some
 

2249
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,270

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,510
to like an orchestra play together do we
have a good sense from both a medical

2262
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:25,520
have a good sense from both a medical
 

2263
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,750
have a good sense from both a medical
perspective and a biology perspective or

2264
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:27,760
perspective and a biology perspective or
 

2265
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,109
perspective and a biology perspective or
is there still mysteries there's

2266
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:29,119
is there still mysteries there's
 

2267
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,950
is there still mysteries there's
definitely still mysteries we understand

2268
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
definitely still mysteries we understand
 

2269
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,630
definitely still mysteries we understand
a lot about for instance how the

2270
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:32,640
a lot about for instance how the
 

2271
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,230
a lot about for instance how the
swallowing mechanism you know is

2272
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:34,240
swallowing mechanism you know is
 

2273
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,910
swallowing mechanism you know is
coordinated it's

2274
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:35,920
coordinated it's
 

2275
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,990
coordinated it's
in the brain stem sometimes using some

2276
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,000
in the brain stem sometimes using some
 

2277
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,910
in the brain stem sometimes using some
higher levels of the brain

2278
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:39,920
higher levels of the brain
 

2279
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,069
higher levels of the brain
but it is a very thoughtless thing as

00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:42,079
but it is a very thoughtless thing as
 

2281
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,670
but it is a very thoughtless thing as
you mentioned when you drink the water

2282
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
you mentioned when you drink the water
 

2283
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,710
you mentioned when you drink the water
you know it's not something we have to

2284
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:44,720
you know it's not something we have to
 

2285
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,230
you know it's not something we have to
think about thankfully or we'd be

2286
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,240
think about thankfully or we'd be
 

2287
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,870
think about thankfully or we'd be
thinking about it all day

2288
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:48,880
thinking about it all day
 

2289
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,150
thinking about it all day
there's a lot we don't understand about

2290
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,160
there's a lot we don't understand about
 

2291
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,550
there's a lot we don't understand about
the basic mechanisms perhaps about how

2292
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
the basic mechanisms perhaps about how
 

2293
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,190
the basic mechanisms perhaps about how
the nerves fire and how they kind of you

2294
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,200
the nerves fire and how they kind of you
 

2295
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,990
the nerves fire and how they kind of you
know

2296
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,000
know
 

2297
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,750
know

00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
coordinate on them on the microscopic
 

2299

00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,400
level how ions rush into and out of
 

2301
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,069
level how ions rush into and out of
nerve cells to kind of create that

2302
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
nerve cells to kind of create that
 

2303
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,829
nerve cells to kind of create that
electrical signal but

2304
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
electrical signal but
 

2305
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,670
electrical signal but
we sure understand a heck of a lot and

2306
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:05,680
we sure understand a heck of a lot and
 

2307
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,750
we sure understand a heck of a lot and
it's very fascinating

2308
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:07,760
it's very fascinating
 

2309
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,589
it's very fascinating
so moving on to

so moving on to
 

2311
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,230
so moving on to
chapter two and we'll jump around uh he

2312

chapter two and we'll jump around uh he
 

2313
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,030
chapter two and we'll jump around uh he
actually said the liver um

2314
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,040
actually said the liver um

it said uh you know showing that the
 

2323
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,750
it said uh you know showing that the
liver is bigger than the heart

2324
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
liver is bigger than the heart
 

2325
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,829
liver is bigger than the heart
which is the body or the universe's way

2326

to the organs to the parts that don't
often

2340
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:43,119
often
 

2341
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,790
often
get as much credit as they deserve but

2342

get as much credit as they deserve but
 

2343
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,069
get as much credit as they deserve but
let us go for time to the human heart

2345
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,710

we get chest pain

2346
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:52,720
we get chest pain
 

2347
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,550
we get chest pain
we talk about it when we talk about love

2348
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,560
we talk about it when we talk about love
 

2349
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,870
we talk about it when we talk about love
for some reason why do we talk about the

2350
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
for some reason why do we talk about the
 

2351
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,710
for some reason why do we talk about the
heart when we talk about love there

2352
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:58,720
heart when we talk about love there
 

2353
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,550
heart when we talk about love there
sometimes can actually be some chest

2354
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:00,560
sometimes can actually be some chest
 

2355
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,310
sometimes can actually be some chest
pain involved in love i remember when i

2356
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:02,320
pain involved in love i remember when i
 

2357

was a med student i was very smitten

2358
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:04,720
was a med student i was very smitten
 

2359
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,790
was a med student i was very smitten
with another medical student it was

2360
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
with another medical student it was
 

2361
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,030
with another medical student it was
totally brilliant and beautiful

2362
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040
totally brilliant and beautiful
 

2363
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,030
totally brilliant and beautiful
and it actually does cause this kind of

2364
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,040
and it actually does cause this kind of
 

2365
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,950
and it actually does cause this kind of
burning in your chest i don't know what

2366
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:12,960
burning in your chest i don't know what
 

2367
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,550
burning in your chest i don't know what
that is i don't think it's from the

2368
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
that is i don't think it's from the
 

2369
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,829
that is i don't think it's from the
heart itself

2370
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
heart itself
 

2371
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,510
heart itself
i don't know if it was like acid reflux

2372
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:17,520
i don't know if it was like acid reflux
 

2373
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,109
i don't know if it was like acid reflux
because i was so nervous i'm not really

2374
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
because i was so nervous i'm not really
 

2375
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:19,829
because i was so nervous i'm not really
sure

2376
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:19,839
sure
 

2377
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,910
sure
but i definitely felt something in my

2378
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
but i definitely felt something in my
 

2379
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,910
but i definitely felt something in my
chest whenever i saw her i don't know

2380
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:23,920
chest whenever i saw her i don't know
 

2381
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,510
chest whenever i saw her i don't know
what that is but you could see why

2382
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:25,520
what that is but you could see why
 

2383
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,349
what that is but you could see why
someone might think oh you know maybe it

2384
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:27,359
someone might think oh you know maybe it
 

2385
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,550
someone might think oh you know maybe it
is your heart that's kind of the most

2386
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:28,560
is your heart that's kind of the most
 

2387
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,630
is your heart that's kind of the most
prominent organ in your chest when

2388
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:30,640
prominent organ in your chest when
 

2389
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,990
prominent organ in your chest when
people come to the er with chest pain

2390
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,000
people come to the er with chest pain
 

2391
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,430
people come to the er with chest pain
you know the big question is is it my

2392
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:33,440
you know the big question is is it my
 

2393
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,109
you know the big question is is it my
heart and that's my main job is figuring

2394
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:35,119
heart and that's my main job is figuring
 

2395
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,710
heart and that's my main job is figuring
out if it is or not

2396
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:36,720
out if it is or not
 

2397
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,870
out if it is or not
so i could see why um

2398
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:38,880
so i could see why um
 

2399
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,710
so i could see why um
you know the way ancients saw the

2400
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,720
you know the way ancients saw the
 

2401
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,470
you know the way ancients saw the
functions of different organs is

2402
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
functions of different organs is
 

2403
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,550
functions of different organs is
fascinating but often

2404
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:44,560
fascinating but often
 

2405
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,150
fascinating but often
hard to explain

2406
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,160
hard to explain
 

2407
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,150
hard to explain
would it be fair to say

2408
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
would it be fair to say
 

2409
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,670
would it be fair to say
that if you look at the entirety of

2410
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:49,680
that if you look at the entirety of
 

2411
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,030
that if you look at the entirety of
human history

2412

human history
 

2413
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,910
human history
the way most people die has to do with

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,670
cardiovascular disease and and cardi you
know coronary artery disease is one of

2422
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:01,680
know coronary artery disease is one of
 

2423
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,510
know coronary artery disease is one of
the most common perhaps the most common

2424
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,520
the most common perhaps the most common
 

2425
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,990
the most common perhaps the most common
cause of death you know a 100 years ago

2426
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
cause of death you know a 100 years ago
 

2427
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,470
cause of death you know a 100 years ago
200 years ago it was probably not people

2428
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
200 years ago it was probably not people
 

2429
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,069
200 years ago it was probably not people
were not living as long and people were

2430
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
were not living as long and people were
 

2431
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,550
were not living as long and people were
dying of infections that we tend to die

2432
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
dying of infections that we tend to die
 

2433
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,069
dying of infections that we tend to die
less of these days

2434
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:14,079
less of these days
 

2435
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,470
less of these days
sure um that's true but in terms of

2436
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:16,480
sure um that's true but in terms of
 

2437
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,710
sure um that's true but in terms of
things to stab

2438
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:18,720
things to stab
 

2439
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,030
things to stab
so i'm trying to sort of introspect like

2440
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040
so i'm trying to sort of introspect like
 

2441
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,069
so i'm trying to sort of introspect like
why

2442
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
why
 

2443
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,510
why
why talk about the heart and love

2444
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,520
why talk about the heart and love
 

2445
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,150
why talk about the heart and love
my thought would be that is because

2446
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,160
my thought would be that is because
 

2447
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,030
my thought would be that is because
the heart was seen as the most important

2448
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,040
the heart was seen as the most important
 

2449
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,870
the heart was seen as the most important
organism it would be like the origin of

2450
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:32,880
organism it would be like the origin of
 

2451
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,470
organism it would be like the origin of
life comes from the heart the originator

2452
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:36,480
life comes from the heart the originator
 

2453
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,230
life comes from the heart the originator
of life and the way you figure that out

2454
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:38,240
of life and the way you figure that out
 

2455
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,550
of life and the way you figure that out
from sort of an ancient perspective

2456
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,560
from sort of an ancient perspective
 

2457
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,750
from sort of an ancient perspective
is uh when you stab things

2458
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:43,760
is uh when you stab things
 

2459
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,390
is uh when you stab things
what is likely to lead to issues it's

2460
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,400
what is likely to lead to issues it's
 

2461
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,230
what is likely to lead to issues it's
like it's possible to imagine that the

2462
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,240
like it's possible to imagine that the
 

2463
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,990
like it's possible to imagine that the
brain is not as special as we might

2464
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,000
brain is not as special as we might
 

2465
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,950
brain is not as special as we might
think

2466
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:50,960
think
 

2467
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,150
think
from

2468
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,160
from
 

2469
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,390
from
when you don't understand modern biology

2470
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,400
when you don't understand modern biology
 

2471
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,430
when you don't understand modern biology
or um physiology or neuroscience all

2472
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
or um physiology or neuroscience all
 

2473
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,270
or um physiology or neuroscience all
those kinds of things especially because

2474
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,280
those kinds of things especially because
 

2475
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,230
those kinds of things especially because
pain

2476
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,240
pain
 

2477
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,390
pain
you know is painless too

2478
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
you know is painless too
 

2479
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,470
you know is painless too
uh if you stab it

2480
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
uh if you stab it
 

2481
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,349
uh if you stab it
the brain i mean yeah um

2482
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:07,359
the brain i mean yeah um
 

2483
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,430
the brain i mean yeah um
yeah anyway so that's that's really

2484
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440
yeah anyway so that's that's really
 

2485
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,349
yeah anyway so that's that's really
interesting i'm sure there's a

2486
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,359
interesting i'm sure there's a
 

2487
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,349
interesting i'm sure there's a
there's a kind of a poetic answer to

2488
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:13,359
there's a kind of a poetic answer to
 

2489
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,349
there's a kind of a poetic answer to
maybe the way people wrote about it but

2490
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:15,359
maybe the way people wrote about it but
 

2491
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,510
maybe the way people wrote about it but
what to you is

2492
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
what to you is
 

2493
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,550
what to you is
the wisdom in the design of the heart i

2494
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:20,560
the wisdom in the design of the heart i
 

2495
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,829
the wisdom in the design of the heart i
mean the main function of the heart

2496
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:21,839
mean the main function of the heart
 

2497
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,069
mean the main function of the heart
basically is to push blood through the

2498
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:24,079
basically is to push blood through the
 

2499
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,430
basically is to push blood through the
cardiovascular system through the

2500
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
cardiovascular system through the
 

2501
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,790
cardiovascular system through the
branching

2502
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:26,800
branching
 

2503
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,589
branching
blood vessels to feed every cell in the

00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
blood vessels to feed every cell in the
 

2505
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,990
blood vessels to feed every cell in the

ancestors started off as single-celled

2508
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:33,920
ancestors started off as single-celled

organisms floating in some ancient brew

2510
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,200
organisms floating in some ancient brew
 

2511
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,190
organisms floating in some ancient brew
and they were surrounded by the medium

2512
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,200
and they were surrounded by the medium
 

2513
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,390
and they were surrounded by the medium
that would bring them all the nutrients

2514
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
that would bring them all the nutrients
 

2515
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,230
that would bring them all the nutrients
they needed so there's no issues there

2516
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:42,240
they needed so there's no issues there
 

2517
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,750
they needed so there's no issues there
and then once you start getting

2518
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:43,760
and then once you start getting
 

2519
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,910
and then once you start getting
multicellular organisms the kind of that

2520
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
multicellular organisms the kind of that
 

2521
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,670
multicellular organisms the kind of that
are thicker and the ones on the inside

2522
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:47,680
are thicker and the ones on the inside
 

2523
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,349
are thicker and the ones on the inside
aren't in contact with that sort of

2524
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
aren't in contact with that sort of
 

2525
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,150
aren't in contact with that sort of
nutritious brew that they're growing in

2526
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,160
nutritious brew that they're growing in
 

2527
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,670
nutritious brew that they're growing in
you kind of need a way to distribute

2528
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:53,680
you kind of need a way to distribute
 

2529
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,670
you kind of need a way to distribute
those nutrients to every cell and so

2530
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
those nutrients to every cell and so
 

2531
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,109
those nutrients to every cell and so
that's what the heart and the branching

2532
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:57,119
that's what the heart and the branching
 

2533
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,990
that's what the heart and the branching
vascular tree do so the heart you know

2534
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,000
vascular tree do so the heart you know
 

2535
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,309
vascular tree do so the heart you know
it's i the most the biggest disconnect

2536
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:02,319
it's i the most the biggest disconnect
 

2537
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,910
it's i the most the biggest disconnect
between how the organs talked about in

2538
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:03,920
between how the organs talked about in
 

2539
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,910
between how the organs talked about in
poetry and through history versus his

2540
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:05,920
poetry and through history versus his
 

2541
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,670
poetry and through history versus his
actual function is probably the heart

2542
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:07,680
actual function is probably the heart
 

2543
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,270
actual function is probably the heart
because we ascribe all these things like

2544
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,280
because we ascribe all these things like
 

2545
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,030
because we ascribe all these things like
love and passion

2546
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,040
love and passion
 

2547
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,030
love and passion
and life itself sometimes to the heart

2548
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,040
and life itself sometimes to the heart
 

2549
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,470
and life itself sometimes to the heart
but actually it's just a simple

2550
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:14,480
but actually it's just a simple
 

2551
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,390
but actually it's just a simple
mechanical pump you know that's all it

2552
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400
mechanical pump you know that's all it
 

2553
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,030
mechanical pump you know that's all it
is

2554
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,040
is
 

2555
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,550
is
i don't want to downplay it it's amazing

2556
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:18,560
i don't want to downplay it it's amazing
 

2557
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,109
i don't want to downplay it it's amazing
but um you know it just pushes it fills

2558
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:21,119
but um you know it just pushes it fills
 

2559
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,710
but um you know it just pushes it fills
the blood and then squeezes it fills the

2560
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:22,720
the blood and then squeezes it fills the
 

2561
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,390
the blood and then squeezes it fills the
bone squeezes it and just that squeezing

2562
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:24,400
bone squeezes it and just that squeezing
 

2563
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,030
bone squeezes it and just that squeezing
that pushing creates the blood pressure

2564
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,040
that pushing creates the blood pressure
 

2565
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,109
that pushing creates the blood pressure
that you need to get blood to every cell

2566
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:29,119
that you need to get blood to every cell
 

2567
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,230
that you need to get blood to every cell
in your body especially when you're

2568
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240
in your body especially when you're
 

2569
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,069
in your body especially when you're
standing upright to get blood to your

2570
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:32,079
standing upright to get blood to your
 

2571
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,589
standing upright to get blood to your
brain you need a certain amount of

2572
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:33,599
brain you need a certain amount of
 

2573
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,349
brain you need a certain amount of
pressure to get it up there

2574
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:35,359
pressure to get it up there
 

2575
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,470
pressure to get it up there
isn't it

2576
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:36,480
isn't it
 

2577
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,109
isn't it
amazing to you how much volume of blood

2578
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:39,119
amazing to you how much volume of blood
 

2579
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,270
amazing to you how much volume of blood
just gets pushed through by this

2580
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
just gets pushed through by this
 

2581
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,870
just gets pushed through by this
by this pump

2582
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:42,880
by this pump
 

2583
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,030
by this pump
absolutely they say every red blood cell

2584
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
absolutely they say every red blood cell
 

2585
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,109
absolutely they say every red blood cell
takes about five minutes to circulate

2586
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:47,119
takes about five minutes to circulate
 

2587
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,190
takes about five minutes to circulate
and come back to the heart um and that

2588
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,200
and come back to the heart um and that
 

2589
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,270
and come back to the heart um and that
circulation kind of you know starts at

2590
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:51,280
circulation kind of you know starts at
 

2591
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,109
circulation kind of you know starts at
in the womb and continues and kind of

2592
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:53,119
in the womb and continues and kind of
 

2593
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,349
in the womb and continues and kind of
until the moment that we die

2594
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:55,359
until the moment that we die
 

2595
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,030
until the moment that we die
but the volume is tremendous and it can

2596
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,040
but the volume is tremendous and it can
 

2597
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,829
but the volume is tremendous and it can
never

2598
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:57,839
never
 

2599
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,230
never
see you know take a break basically and

2600
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,240
see you know take a break basically and
 

2601
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,150
see you know take a break basically and
it's sort of uh

2602
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,160
it's sort of uh
 

2603
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,670
it's sort of uh
propagating all kinds of stuff

2604
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,680
propagating all kinds of stuff
 

2605
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,109
propagating all kinds of stuff
throughout the body it's a delivery

2606
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
throughout the body it's a delivery
 

2607
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,390
throughout the body it's a delivery
mechanism blood for all kinds of good

2608
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:08,400
mechanism blood for all kinds of good
 

2609
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,270
mechanism blood for all kinds of good
stuff and bad stuff nutrition

2610
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,280

drugs
 

2613
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,030
drugs
all that right medications too

such a fascinating design and it also

2618
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
such a fascinating design and it also
 

2619
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,589
such a fascinating design and it also
takes the waste away you know it kind of

2620
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
takes the waste away you know it kind of
 

2621
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,030
takes the waste away you know it kind of
brings the nutritious stuff brings the

2622
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
brings the nutritious stuff brings the
 

2623
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,870
brings the nutritious stuff brings the
nutrients especially oxygen but many

2624
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:24,880
nutrients especially oxygen but many
 

2625
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,630
nutrients especially oxygen but many
other things and then it also

2626
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:26,640
other things and then it also
 

2627
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,550
other things and then it also
as it passes the cell takes the cell's

2628
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:28,560
as it passes the cell takes the cell's
 

2629
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,390
as it passes the cell takes the cell's
waste so it's sort of the the fresh

2630
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,400
waste so it's sort of the the fresh
 

2631
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,750
waste so it's sort of the the fresh
water and the sewage system in one so

2632
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:33,760
water and the sewage system in one so
 

2633
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,190
water and the sewage system in one so
about blood

2634
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
about blood
 

2635
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,630
about blood
what what to use fascinating about blood

2636
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:38,640
what what to use fascinating about blood
 

2637
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,109
what what to use fascinating about blood
so we talk about the pump that spreads

2638
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119
so we talk about the pump that spreads
 

2639
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,349
so we talk about the pump that spreads
the blood but the blood itself right so

2640
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:43,359
the blood but the blood itself right so
 

2641
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,190
the blood but the blood itself right so
the blood itself is sort of i mean it's

2642
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:45,200
the blood itself is sort of i mean it's
 

2643
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,790
the blood itself is sort of i mean it's
the most important bodily fluid of

2644
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
the most important bodily fluid of
 

2645
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,190
the most important bodily fluid of
course it you know from moment to moment

2646
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,200
course it you know from moment to moment
 

2647
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,430
course it you know from moment to moment
every cell in the body needs a flow of

2648
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
every cell in the body needs a flow of
 

2649
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,550
every cell in the body needs a flow of
blood

2650
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,560
blood
 

2651
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,190
blood
um to bring it most importantly oxygen

2652
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,200
um to bring it most importantly oxygen
 

2653
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,870
um to bring it most importantly oxygen
but also again all the other nutrients

2654
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:56,880
but also again all the other nutrients
 

2655
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,870
but also again all the other nutrients
and to take away waste and if that stops

2656
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:58,880
and to take away waste and if that stops
 

2657
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,790
and to take away waste and if that stops
for even a few moments you can be in big

2658
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:00,800
for even a few moments you can be in big
 

2659
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,390
for even a few moments you can be in big
trouble

2660
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:02,400
trouble
 

2661
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,630
trouble
so blood is sort of you know the the

2662
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:04,640
so blood is sort of you know the the
 

2663
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,950
so blood is sort of you know the the
most important medium it's also doctors

2664
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:06,960
most important medium it's also doctors
 

2665
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,270
most important medium it's also doctors
use it to kind of evaluate the body it

2666
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:09,280
use it to kind of evaluate the body it
 

2667
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,510
use it to kind of evaluate the body it
does have this kind of all-seeing

2668
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,520
does have this kind of all-seeing
 

2669
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,790
does have this kind of all-seeing
quality to it where um you know we can

2670
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:14,800
quality to it where um you know we can
 

2671
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,790
quality to it where um you know we can
evaluate organs through the blood i can

2672
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:16,800
evaluate organs through the blood i can
 

2673
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,230
evaluate organs through the blood i can
tell you about your liver your heart

2674
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240
tell you about your liver your heart
 

2675
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,069
tell you about your liver your heart
your kidney just by taking a sample of

2676
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:20,079
your kidney just by taking a sample of
 

2677
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,030
your kidney just by taking a sample of
your blood

2678
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
your blood
 

2679
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,870
your blood
so it's sort of like this crystal ball

2680
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:22,880
so it's sort of like this crystal ball
 

2681
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,270
so it's sort of like this crystal ball
in a way and we use it kind of all the

2682
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,280
in a way and we use it kind of all the
 

2683
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,870
in a way and we use it kind of all the
time you know to assess someone's health

2684
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:26,880
time you know to assess someone's health
 

2685
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,950
time you know to assess someone's health
to assess their disease

2686
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:28,960
to assess their disease
 

2687
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,670
to assess their disease
is it also the attack vector for

2688
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
is it also the attack vector for
 

2689
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,790
is it also the attack vector for
diseases for bacteria for viruses and

2690
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:36,800
diseases for bacteria for viruses and
 

2691
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,710
diseases for bacteria for viruses and
all that kind of stuff so viruses seem

2692
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:38,720
all that kind of stuff so viruses seem
 

2693
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,630
all that kind of stuff so viruses seem
to attack either the throat maybe you

2694
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:40,640
to attack either the throat maybe you
 

2695
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,150
to attack either the throat maybe you
can correct me but they seem to attack

2696
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,160
can correct me but they seem to attack
 

2697
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,990
can correct me but they seem to attack
different parts of the body

2698
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,000
different parts of the body
 

2699
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,069
different parts of the body
depending on how easy it is to access

2700
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:46,079
depending on how easy it is to access
 

2701
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,710
depending on how easy it is to access
and how easy it is to uh

2702
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:48,720
and how easy it is to uh
 

2703
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,390
and how easy it is to uh
get in deep

2704
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,400
get in deep
 

2705
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,470
get in deep
depending on what you prefer if you want

2706
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:52,480
depending on what you prefer if you want
 

2707
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,230
depending on what you prefer if you want
to do a little bit of hard work

2708
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,240
to do a little bit of hard work
 

2709
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,630
to do a little bit of hard work
but you get in deep or you don't want to

2710
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
but you get in deep or you don't want to
 

2711
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,309
but you get in deep or you don't want to
do the hard work

2712
00:45:58,309 --> 00:45:58,319
do the hard work
 

2713
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,069
do the hard work
but you don't get in deep those are the

2714
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:00,079
but you don't get in deep those are the
 

2715
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,230
but you don't get in deep those are the
choices viruses have but is blood one of

2716
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:02,240
choices viruses have but is blood one of
 

2717
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,430
choices viruses have but is blood one of
the sort of

2718
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:03,440
the sort of
 

2719
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,950
the sort of
attack factors what's like if you were

2720
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:04,960
attack factors what's like if you were
 

2721
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,430
attack factors what's like if you were
trying to break into the human body

2722
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
trying to break into the human body
 

2723
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,309
trying to break into the human body
uh

2724
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,319
uh
 

2725
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,069
uh
like a parasite a virus a bacteria

2726
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
like a parasite a virus a bacteria
 

2727
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,589
like a parasite a virus a bacteria
how would you do it like what would you

2728
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:13,599
how would you do it like what would you
 

2729
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,950
how would you do it like what would you
what would be the attack vectors you

2730
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:14,960
what would be the attack vectors you
 

2731
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,790
what would be the attack vectors you
would explore right so you got to look

2732
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:16,800
would explore right so you got to look
 

2733
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,950
would explore right so you got to look
for the body's weaknesses of course

2734
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
for the body's weaknesses of course
 

2735
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,950
for the body's weaknesses of course
um you know we have inherent weaknesses

2736
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:20,960
um you know we have inherent weaknesses
 

2737
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,710
um you know we have inherent weaknesses
for instance like our respiratory tract

2738
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:22,720
for instance like our respiratory tract
 

2739
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,589
for instance like our respiratory tract
we have to breathe we have to get air in

2740
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:25,599
we have to breathe we have to get air in
 

2741
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,349
we have to breathe we have to get air in
from the outside and so that's one of

2742
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
from the outside and so that's one of
 

2743
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,430
from the outside and so that's one of
the entries into the body and so you

2744
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440
the entries into the body and so you
 

2745
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,790
the entries into the body and so you
know when we inhale let's say a

2746
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:30,800
know when we inhale let's say a
 

2747
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,790
know when we inhale let's say a
poisonous gas you know it's it's an easy

2748
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
poisonous gas you know it's it's an easy
 

2749
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,790
poisonous gas you know it's it's an easy
way in you have to breathe can't hold

2750
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:34,800
way in you have to breathe can't hold
 

2751
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,790
way in you have to breathe can't hold
your breath very long but you know air

2752
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,800
your breath very long but you know air
 

2753
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,670
your breath very long but you know air
in our lungs is still kind of contiguous

2754
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:39,680
in our lungs is still kind of contiguous
 

2755
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,430
in our lungs is still kind of contiguous
with the external atmosphere it's not

2756
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:41,440
with the external atmosphere it's not
 

2757
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,430
with the external atmosphere it's not
really inside the body until it does

2758
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:43,440
really inside the body until it does
 

2759
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,550
really inside the body until it does
cross across the lining of the alveoli

2760
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
cross across the lining of the alveoli
 

2761
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,069
cross across the lining of the alveoli
into the blood as you said that's when

2762
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
into the blood as you said that's when
 

2763
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,150
into the blood as you said that's when
it really gets inside and the other

2764
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
it really gets inside and the other
 

2765
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,349
it really gets inside and the other
besides the respiratory tract the

2766
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:51,359
besides the respiratory tract the
 

2767
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,750
besides the respiratory tract the
gastrointestinal tract is another way

2768
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760
gastrointestinal tract is another way
 

2769
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,430
gastrointestinal tract is another way
kind of a in the armor you know we

2770
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:55,440
kind of a in the armor you know we
 

2771
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,430
kind of a in the armor you know we
have to eat we have to drink and

2772
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:57,440
have to eat we have to drink and
 

2773
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,950
have to eat we have to drink and
therefore we're taking the external

2774
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:58,960
therefore we're taking the external
 

2775
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,270
therefore we're taking the external
world into ourselves into our gut in

2776
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
world into ourselves into our gut in
 

2777
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,950
world into ourselves into our gut in
order to extract from it what we need

2778
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
order to extract from it what we need
 

2779
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,270
order to extract from it what we need
and let the rest kind of flow out

2780
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,280
and let the rest kind of flow out
 

2781
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,270
and let the rest kind of flow out
so those two the gastrointestinal and

2782
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:07,280
so those two the gastrointestinal and
 

2783
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,390
so those two the gastrointestinal and
respiratory tract you know there's a

2784
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:08,400
respiratory tract you know there's a
 

2785
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,990
respiratory tract you know there's a
reason that you know respiratory tract

2786
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,000
reason that you know respiratory tract
 

2787
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,190
reason that you know respiratory tract
infections

2788
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200
infections
 

2789
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,109
infections
and gastrointestinal infections are kind

2790
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:13,119
and gastrointestinal infections are kind
 

2791
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,190
and gastrointestinal infections are kind
of the most common that afflict us

2792
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
of the most common that afflict us
 

2793
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,349
of the most common that afflict us
because those are the ways in to the

2794
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:17,359
because those are the ways in to the
 

2795
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,790
because those are the ways in to the
body so i would definitely pick one of

2796
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
body so i would definitely pick one of
 

2797
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,990
body so i would definitely pick one of
those

2798
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:20,000
those
 

2799
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,150
those
not just be a lazy cold in the nose but

2800
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:22,160
not just be a lazy cold in the nose but
 

2801
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,069
not just be a lazy cold in the nose but
really a more aggressive pneumonia down

2802
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:24,079
really a more aggressive pneumonia down
 

2803
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,589
really a more aggressive pneumonia down
deep in the lungs and get across that

2804
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:25,599
deep in the lungs and get across that
 

2805
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,109
deep in the lungs and get across that
barrier into the blood

2806
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:27,119
barrier into the blood
 

2807
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,630
barrier into the blood
but also

2808
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
but also
 

2809
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,230
but also
the whole sex thing

2810
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:30,240
the whole sex thing
 

2811
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,069
the whole sex thing
uh that humans do

2812
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:32,079
uh that humans do
 

2813
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:32,950
uh that humans do
so

2814
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:32,960
so
 

2815
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,150
so
speaking of which let us go for time

2816
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,160
speaking of which let us go for time
 

2817
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,470
speaking of which let us go for time
to the genitals chapter

2818
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
to the genitals chapter
 

2819
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,589
to the genitals chapter
so uh what are genitals i think i've

2820
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:41,599
so uh what are genitals i think i've
 

2821
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,270
so uh what are genitals i think i've
heard of those

2822
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
heard of those
 

2823
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,109
heard of those
i think i've read about a penis and a

2824
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
i think i've read about a penis and a
 

2825
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,270
i think i've read about a penis and a
vagina can you explain

2826
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,280
vagina can you explain
 

2827
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,670
vagina can you explain
to me how those work just asking for a

2828
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
to me how those work just asking for a
 

2829
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,510
to me how those work just asking for a
friend but also

2830
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
friend but also
 

2831
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,069
friend but also
um what do you use fascinating about it

2832
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:54,079
um what do you use fascinating about it
 

2833
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,910
um what do you use fascinating about it
and maybe what's

2834
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:55,920
and maybe what's
 

2835
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,069
and maybe what's
misunderstood or little known about them

2836
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:00,079
misunderstood or little known about them
 

2837
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,630
misunderstood or little known about them
sure so i'm they're very unique organs i

2838
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
sure so i'm they're very unique organs i
 

2839
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,710
sure so i'm they're very unique organs i
would say one of the things that i like

2840
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:04,720
would say one of the things that i like
 

2841
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,390
would say one of the things that i like
to point out is that you know while

2842
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
to point out is that you know while
 

2843
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,870
to point out is that you know while
every organ from moment to moment keeps

2844
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:08,880
every organ from moment to moment keeps
 

2845
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,790
every organ from moment to moment keeps
us alive and ensures our survival the

2846
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:10,800
us alive and ensures our survival the
 

2847
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,710
us alive and ensures our survival the
genitals are in a way the opposite you

2848
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720
genitals are in a way the opposite you
 

2849
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,589
genitals are in a way the opposite you
know

2850
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:13,599
know
 

2851
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,510
know
we don't need them from moment to moment

2852
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:15,520
we don't need them from moment to moment
 

2853
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,270
we don't need them from moment to moment
you don't even have to use them at all

2854
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
you don't even have to use them at all
 

2855
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,190
you don't even have to use them at all
um and in fact they often make us do

2856
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,200
um and in fact they often make us do
 

2857
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,589
um and in fact they often make us do
stupid things that are the opposite of

2858
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
stupid things that are the opposite of
 

2859
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,829
stupid things that are the opposite of
kind of enhancing survival so

2860
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:23,839
kind of enhancing survival so
 

2861
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,829
kind of enhancing survival so
and they you know they've affected the

2862
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:25,839
and they you know they've affected the
 

2863
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,990
and they you know they've affected the
brain and you can become sort of focused

2864
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:28,000
brain and you can become sort of focused
 

2865
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,470
brain and you can become sort of focused
and nuts based on those desires that

2866
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,480
and nuts based on those desires that
 

2867
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,309
and nuts based on those desires that
kind of stem from the genitals so they

2868
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:32,319
kind of stem from the genitals so they
 

2869
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,950
kind of stem from the genitals so they
can be dangerous organs too um but you

2870
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
can be dangerous organs too um but you
 

2871
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,430
can be dangerous organs too um but you
know i mean sexual dimorphism helps with

2872
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:37,440
know i mean sexual dimorphism helps with
 

2873
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,069
know i mean sexual dimorphism helps with
genetic variability um as it does in so

2874
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
genetic variability um as it does in so
 

2875
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,990
genetic variability um as it does in so
many other organisms you know you take

2876
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,000
many other organisms you know you take
 

2877
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,670
many other organisms you know you take
two people and mix them together their

2878
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
two people and mix them together their
 

2879
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,109
two people and mix them together their
genetics you just get a lot more

2880
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
genetics you just get a lot more
 

2881
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,109
genetics you just get a lot more
variation and more opportunities to try

2882
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:49,119
variation and more opportunities to try
 

2883
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,030
variation and more opportunities to try
different genetic codes and see what'll

2884
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040
different genetic codes and see what'll
 

2885
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,190
different genetic codes and see what'll
enhance survival as we talked about sex

2886
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,200
enhance survival as we talked about sex
 

2887
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,150
enhance survival as we talked about sex
and death

2888
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:54,160
and death
 

2889
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,910
and death
i talk about in the book a lot of for

2890
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:55,920
i talk about in the book a lot of for
 

2891
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,990
i talk about in the book a lot of for
instance the female genital tract how

2892
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,000
instance the female genital tract how
 

2893
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,109
instance the female genital tract how
the uterus is very unusual because you

2894
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:01,119
the uterus is very unusual because you
 

2895
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,790
the uterus is very unusual because you

waking up uh kind of once a month
 

2913
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,309
waking up uh kind of once a month
and it's this this cycle you know

2914
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
and it's this this cycle you know
 

2915
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,750
and it's this this cycle you know
there's so much in our bodies that are

there's so much in our bodies that are
 

2917
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,750
there's so much in our bodies that are
cyclical and rhythmic the heartbeat the

but menstruation is kind of the a very
 

2923

and only you know the rhythm beats once
 

2929
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,670
and only you know the rhythm beats once
a month which is very slow compared to

you need cpr maybe an electric shock to
 

2943

know you need a breathing machine to
 

2947
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,790
know you need a breathing machine to
breathe for you or something to reverse

implant in the lining and then the
 

2969
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,750
implant in the lining and then the
rhythm ceases and that's obviously not a

rhythm ceases and that's obviously not a
 

2971
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,349

then get us to do
 

3021
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,630
then get us to do
stupid stuff or awesome stuff and all

a
 

3123
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,109
a
human 2.0 or maybe a robot how would you

3124
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:01,119
human 2.0 or maybe a robot how would you
 

3125
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,309

improve

3126
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:02,319
improve
 

3127

the penis and the vagina

3128
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:05,280
the penis and the vagina
 

3129
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,589
the penis and the vagina
well the penis for starters i mean let's

3130
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,599
well the penis for starters i mean let's
 

3131
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,349
well the penis for starters i mean let's
also discuss the testicles you know

3132
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:09,359
also discuss the testicles you know
 

3133
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,670
also discuss the testicles you know
they're very important too i mean okay

3134
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
they're very important too i mean okay
 

3135
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,750
they're very important too i mean okay
so they're yes right so they're fragile

3136
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:13,760
so they're yes right so they're fragile
 

3137
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,349
so they're yes right so they're fragile
and they're important and yet they're

3138
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
and they're important and yet they're
 

3139
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,990
and they're important and yet they're
hanging off the body in danger basically

3140
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
hanging off the body in danger basically
 

3141
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,069
hanging off the body in danger basically
so um does that make sense

3142
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:20,079
so um does that make sense
 

3143
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,069
so um does that make sense
you know they begin in the womb they

3144
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:22,079
you know they begin in the womb they
 

3145
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,069
you know they begin in the womb they
begin inside the abdomen and they slowly

3146
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:24,079
begin inside the abdomen and they slowly
 

3147
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,470
begin inside the abdomen and they slowly
descend and and sometimes before birth

3148
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
descend and and sometimes before birth
 

3149
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,990
descend and and sometimes before birth
sometimes in the first year of life

3150
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
sometimes in the first year of life
 

3151
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,549
sometimes in the first year of life
sometimes never they pop out of the body

3152
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
sometimes never they pop out of the body
 

3153
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,549
sometimes never they pop out of the body
and end up hanging in the scrotum

3154
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:32,559
and end up hanging in the scrotum
 

3155
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,390
and end up hanging in the scrotum
there's a reason because the chemical

3156
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:34,400
there's a reason because the chemical
 

3157
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,710
there's a reason because the chemical
reactions that create sperm

3158
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:36,720
reactions that create sperm
 

3159
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,270
reactions that create sperm
function best at a few degrees cooler

3160
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,280
function best at a few degrees cooler
 

3161
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,470
function best at a few degrees cooler
than body temperature and so that's why

3162
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:42,480
than body temperature and so that's why
 

3163
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,470
than body temperature and so that's why
you might notice in the warm weather

3164
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:44,480
you might notice in the warm weather
 

3165
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,309
you might notice in the warm weather
they might hang further down and in the

3166
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
they might hang further down and in the
 

3167
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,630
they might hang further down and in the
cold weather they scrunch themselves up

3168
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,640
cold weather they scrunch themselves up
 

3169
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,950
cold weather they scrunch themselves up
to get closer to the body to maintain

3170
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:50,960
to get closer to the body to maintain
 

3171
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,790
to get closer to the body to maintain
that ideal temperature a few degrees

3172
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
that ideal temperature a few degrees
 

3173
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,030
that ideal temperature a few degrees
cooler

3174
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:55,040
cooler
 

3175
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,470
cooler
so it's hard you know if you could

3176
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:56,480
so it's hard you know if you could
 

3177
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,309
so it's hard you know if you could
create a sperm production mechanism that

3178
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:58,319
create a sperm production mechanism that
 

3179
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,990
create a sperm production mechanism that
did not rely on that lower temperature

3180
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
did not rely on that lower temperature
 

3181
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,430
did not rely on that lower temperature
that would be great keep them inside the

3182
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:01,440
that would be great keep them inside the
 

3183
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,470
that would be great keep them inside the
body protected like the ovaries are

3184
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:04,480
body protected like the ovaries are
 

3185
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,150
body protected like the ovaries are
um oh then you wouldn't rely on the

3186
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:06,160
um oh then you wouldn't rely on the
 

3187
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,230
um oh then you wouldn't rely on the
lower temperature i thought you meant

3188
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:08,240
lower temperature i thought you meant
 

3189
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,710
lower temperature i thought you meant
create some kind of weird internal

3190
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:10,720
create some kind of weird internal
 

3191
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,870
create some kind of weird internal
cooling mechanism no well

3192
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:12,880
cooling mechanism no well
 

3193
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,390
cooling mechanism no well
no i guess that would be one solution

3194
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:14,400
no i guess that would be one solution
 

3195
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,309
no i guess that would be one solution
but just maybe a different type of

3196
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:16,319
but just maybe a different type of
 

3197
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,470
but just maybe a different type of
chemical reaction or you know would not

3198
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:18,480
chemical reaction or you know would not
 

3199
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,549
chemical reaction or you know would not
be reliant on the lower temperature

3200
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:20,559
be reliant on the lower temperature
 

3201
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,390
be reliant on the lower temperature
let's say um you know it would be great

3202
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:22,400
let's say um you know it would be great
 

3203
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,870
let's say um you know it would be great
to design the

3204
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:23,880
to design the
 

3205
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,150
to design the
spermatogenesis or sperm production

3206
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
spermatogenesis or sperm production
 

3207
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,710
spermatogenesis or sperm production
process that would function best at body

3208
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:28,720
process that would function best at body
 

3209
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,630
process that would function best at body
temperature and then we can keep those

3210
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:30,640
temperature and then we can keep those
 

3211
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,630
temperature and then we can keep those
delicate organs inside the body and not

3212
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,640
delicate organs inside the body and not
 

3213
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,030
delicate organs inside the body and not
have them hanging out in danger

3214
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:35,040
have them hanging out in danger
 

3215
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,910
have them hanging out in danger
or maybe the argument for this design is

3216
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:37,920
or maybe the argument for this design is
 

3217
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,510
or maybe the argument for this design is
uh

3218
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,520
uh
 

3219
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,630
uh
maybe

3220
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
maybe
 

3221
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,870
maybe
it's nice to put them in danger so you

3222
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:42,880
it's nice to put them in danger so you
 

3223
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,910
it's nice to put them in danger so you
uh are constantly concerned about it

3224
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:45,920
uh are constantly concerned about it
 

3225
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,069
uh are constantly concerned about it
could be maybe that's beneficial for

3226
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:48,079
could be maybe that's beneficial for
 

3227
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,990
could be maybe that's beneficial for
male psychology i'm not really sure

3228
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:50,000
male psychology i'm not really sure
 

3229
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,430
male psychology i'm not really sure
there's a psychological element here

3230
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,440
there's a psychological element here
 

3231
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,430
there's a psychological element here
about the evolution that could be so

3232
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:53,440
about the evolution that could be so
 

3233
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,069
about the evolution that could be so
that's the testicles uh

3234
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
that's the testicles uh
 

3235
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,910
that's the testicles uh
uh penis

3236
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
uh penis
 

3237
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,630
uh penis
um a better way to do it you know i i

3238
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:00,640
um a better way to do it you know i i
 

3239
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,190
um a better way to do it you know i i
mean it's pretty good as it is you know

3240
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:03,200
mean it's pretty good as it is you know
 

3241
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,589
mean it's pretty good as it is you know
it kind of when it's time for it to work

3242
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:05,599
it kind of when it's time for it to work
 

3243
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,750
it kind of when it's time for it to work
it it grows and stiffens and when it's

3244
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
it it grows and stiffens and when it's
 

3245
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,990
it it grows and stiffens and when it's
time for it not to work it it kind of

3246
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:10,000
time for it not to work it it kind of
 

3247
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,150
time for it not to work it it kind of
shrinks and yeah hangs out

3248
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:12,160
shrinks and yeah hangs out
 

3249
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:12,950
shrinks and yeah hangs out
um

3250
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:12,960
um
 

3251
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,069
um
saw this on a seinfeld episode so i know

3252
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:16,079
saw this on a seinfeld episode so i know
 

3253
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,789
saw this on a seinfeld episode so i know
how it works shrinkage yeah that was a

3254
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:18,799
how it works shrinkage yeah that was a
 

3255
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,589
how it works shrinkage yeah that was a
good one but you know that's that's also

3256
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:21,599
good one but you know that's that's also
 

3257
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,309
good one but you know that's that's also
a bit unique i suppose that uh you know

3258
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:24,319
a bit unique i suppose that uh you know
 

3259
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,470
a bit unique i suppose that uh you know
the way it's it has this erectile tissue

3260
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:26,480
the way it's it has this erectile tissue
 

3261
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,470
the way it's it has this erectile tissue
actually they're similar

3262
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:28,480
actually they're similar
 

3263
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,549
actually they're similar
in the mouth of certain baleen whales

3264
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:30,559
in the mouth of certain baleen whales
 

3265
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,230
in the mouth of certain baleen whales
there's a certain

3266
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:32,240
there's a certain
 

3267
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,150
there's a certain
similar kind of erectile tissue that

3268
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:34,160
similar kind of erectile tissue that
 

3269
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,190
similar kind of erectile tissue that
helps um cool cool them off

3270
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:37,200
helps um cool cool them off
 

3271
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,670
helps um cool cool them off
um because they have so much blubber

3272
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:39,680
um because they have so much blubber
 

3273
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,670
um because they have so much blubber
and creates so much heat and moving

3274
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:41,680
and creates so much heat and moving
 

3275
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,950
and creates so much heat and moving
around and feeding that they have

3276
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:42,960
around and feeding that they have
 

3277
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,789
around and feeding that they have
actually a similar similar to the penis

3278
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:44,799
actually a similar similar to the penis
 

3279
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,230
actually a similar similar to the penis
organ in their mouth that helps cool

3280
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:46,240
organ in their mouth that helps cool
 

3281
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,910
organ in their mouth that helps cool
their bodies because it's a big problem

3282
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:47,920
their bodies because it's a big problem
 

3283
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,230
their bodies because it's a big problem
they have to store all that blubber for

3284
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:50,240
they have to store all that blubber for
 

3285
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,309
they have to store all that blubber for
fuel but it makes them too hot so as a

3286
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
fuel but it makes them too hot so as a
 

3287
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,589
fuel but it makes them too hot so as a
compensation they have this kind of

3288
00:55:53,589 --> 00:55:53,599
compensation they have this kind of
 

3289
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,870
compensation they have this kind of
erectile organ in their mouth okay

3290
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:56,880
erectile organ in their mouth okay
 

3291
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,069
erectile organ in their mouth okay
uh what about vagina you know the fact

3292
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
uh what about vagina you know the fact
 

3293
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,109
uh what about vagina you know the fact
that

3294
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:01,119
that
 

3295
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,910
that
miscarriages sometimes happen because of

3296
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
miscarriages sometimes happen because of
 

3297
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,069
miscarriages sometimes happen because of
sexually transmitted diseases because of

3298
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:06,079
sexually transmitted diseases because of
 

3299
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,630
sexually transmitted diseases because of
trauma you know it would be great if the

3300
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:08,640
trauma you know it would be great if the
 

3301
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,270
trauma you know it would be great if the
uterus where the growing fetus is is

3302
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:11,280
uterus where the growing fetus is is
 

3303
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,270
uterus where the growing fetus is is
sort of even more protected from those

3304
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:13,280
sort of even more protected from those
 

3305
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,230
sort of even more protected from those
things

3306
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:14,240
things
 

3307
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,589
things
um

3308
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:15,599
um
 

3309
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,589
um
you know i guess that's that's a side

3310
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
you know i guess that's that's a side
 

3311
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,589
you know i guess that's that's a side
effect of the fact that uh people still

3312
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:19,599
effect of the fact that uh people still
 

3313
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,190
effect of the fact that uh people still
have sex when they're pregnant are still

3314
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:21,200
have sex when they're pregnant are still
 

3315
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,349
have sex when they're pregnant are still
you know exposed to injury if there's a

3316
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:23,359
you know exposed to injury if there's a
 

3317
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,069
you know exposed to injury if there's a
way to make it more protected perhaps

3318
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:26,079
way to make it more protected perhaps
 

3319
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,829
way to make it more protected perhaps
that would be even better i did see an

3320
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:27,839
that would be even better i did see an
 

3321
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,390
that would be even better i did see an
article recently about artificial wombs

3322
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:30,400
article recently about artificial wombs
 

3323
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,670
article recently about artificial wombs
which are

3324
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
which are
 

3325
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,309
which are
rapidly becoming a reality and in in

3326
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:34,319
rapidly becoming a reality and in in
 

3327
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,309
rapidly becoming a reality and in in
animal studies they're able to prolong

3328
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:36,319
animal studies they're able to prolong
 

3329
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,630
animal studies they're able to prolong
the gestation of a fetus by a month in

3330
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:38,640
the gestation of a fetus by a month in
 

3331
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,630
the gestation of a fetus by a month in
an artificial womb

3332
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
an artificial womb
 

3333
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,630
an artificial womb
can you explain the artificial aspect of

3334
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:42,640
can you explain the artificial aspect of
 

3335
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,270
can you explain the artificial aspect of
the artificial one sure it's um

3336
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:45,280
the artificial one sure it's um
 

3337
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,510
the artificial one sure it's um
i believe it it acts almost like a a

3338
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:47,520
i believe it it acts almost like a a
 

3339
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,270
i believe it it acts almost like a a
heart lung bypass machine so when

3340
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
heart lung bypass machine so when
 

3341
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,829
heart lung bypass machine so when
someone's getting like bypass surgery

3342
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:51,839
someone's getting like bypass surgery
 

3343
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,829
someone's getting like bypass surgery
their heart is stopped literally they

3344
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:53,839
their heart is stopped literally they
 

3345
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,470
their heart is stopped literally they
throw ice in the chest and they um

3346
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
throw ice in the chest and they um
 

3347
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,309
throw ice in the chest and they um
give a potassium infusion through the

3348
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:58,319
give a potassium infusion through the
 

3349
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,390
give a potassium infusion through the
blood which stops the heart

3350
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:00,400
blood which stops the heart
 

3351
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,950
blood which stops the heart
um but the blood is run through a

3352
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:02,960
um but the blood is run through a
 

3353
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,150
um but the blood is run through a
machine

3354
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,160
machine
 

3355
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,549
machine
that basically does what the work of the

3356
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:06,559
that basically does what the work of the
 

3357
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,710
that basically does what the work of the
heart and lungs together gets oxygen

3358
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:08,720
heart and lungs together gets oxygen
 

3359
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,230
heart and lungs together gets oxygen
into the blood and then pushes it in

3360
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
into the blood and then pushes it in
 

3361
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,470
into the blood and then pushes it in
back into the body so it's i believe

3362
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,480
back into the body so it's i believe
 

3363
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,309
back into the body so it's i believe
it's a sort of similar mechanism to keep

3364
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:14,319
it's a sort of similar mechanism to keep
 

3365
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,150
it's a sort of similar mechanism to keep
blood and nutrition flowing to this

3366
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:16,160
blood and nutrition flowing to this
 

3367
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,910
blood and nutrition flowing to this
fetus

3368
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
fetus
 

3369
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,309
fetus
and so it's just not inside the body of

3370
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:20,319
and so it's just not inside the body of
 

3371
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,470
and so it's just not inside the body of
a parent it's in some kind of other

3372
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:22,480
a parent it's in some kind of other
 

3373
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,630
a parent it's in some kind of other
device but i think that science is going

days that they live inside the female
 

4359
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,709
days that they live inside the female
genital tract but it's sort of i like

4360
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:36,719
genital tract but it's sort of i like
 

4361
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,630
genital tract but it's sort of i like
comparing our genitals to the genitals

4362
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
comparing our genitals to the genitals
 

4363

of the plant world which is flowers and
 

4365
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,470
of the plant world which is flowers and
in the same way that uh

4366
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
in the same way that uh
 

4367
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,390
in the same way that uh
you know a touch me not uh for instance

4368
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:44,400
you know a touch me not uh for instance
 

4369
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,990
you know a touch me not uh for instance
the kind of flower where when you brush

4370
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:46,000
the kind of flower where when you brush
 

4371
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,910
the kind of flower where when you brush
up against it it sort of launches seeds

4372
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:47,920
up against it it sort of launches seeds
 

4373
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,950
up against it it sort of launches seeds
into the distance to try to um

4374
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:50,960
into the distance to try to um
 

4375
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,590
into the distance to try to um
survive in a way kind of the sperm is

4376
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:53,600
survive in a way kind of the sperm is
 

4377
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,270
survive in a way kind of the sperm is
doing something similar launched into

4378
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:55,280
doing something similar launched into
 

4379
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,189
doing something similar launched into
the female genital tract and then all

4380
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:57,199
the female genital tract and then all
 

4381
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,590
the female genital tract and then all
trying to find this uh competing against

4382
01:14:59,590 --> 01:14:59,600
trying to find this uh competing against
 

4383
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,750
trying to find this uh competing against
each other to find this egg it's really

4384
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:01,760
each other to find this egg it's really
 

4385
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,189
each other to find this egg it's really
amazing and when you learn about it from

4386
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:03,199
amazing and when you learn about it from
 

4387
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,950
amazing and when you learn about it from
the biological perspective

4388
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:04,960
the biological perspective
 

4389
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,110
the biological perspective
the most amazing thing is how many

4390
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:07,120
the most amazing thing is how many
 

4391
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,870
the most amazing thing is how many
things can go wrong

4392
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:08,880
things can go wrong
 

4393
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,110
things can go wrong
you know just in the sperm not surviving

4394
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:11,120
you know just in the sperm not surviving
 

4395
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,430
you know just in the sperm not surviving
long enough for it making it to the egg

4396
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,440
long enough for it making it to the egg
 

4397
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,430
long enough for it making it to the egg
and then some genetic

4398
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:15,440
and then some genetic
 

4399
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,830
and then some genetic
abnormality causing a miscarriage it's

4400
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:17,840
abnormality causing a miscarriage it's
 

4401
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,510
abnormality causing a miscarriage it's
sort of astounding

4402
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:19,520
sort of astounding
 

4403
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,350
sort of astounding
that it works as often as it does and i

4404
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,360
that it works as often as it does and i
 

4405
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,189
that it works as often as it does and i
think the lesson there is just that

4406
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:23,199
think the lesson there is just that
 

4407
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,270
think the lesson there is just that
people have a lot of sex and so

4408
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:25,280
people have a lot of sex and so
 

4409
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,870
people have a lot of sex and so
statistics just favorite's going to work

4410
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:26,880
statistics just favorite's going to work
 

4411
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,110
statistics just favorite's going to work
out a good number of times

4412
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120
out a good number of times
 

4413
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,870
out a good number of times
yeah and there might be intelligence in

4414
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:30,880
yeah and there might be intelligence in
 

4415
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,870
yeah and there might be intelligence in
the design of just the sheer number of

4416
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:32,880
the design of just the sheer number of
 

4417
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,510
the design of just the sheer number of
sperm maybe that's yet another way to

4418
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
sperm maybe that's yet another way to
 

4419
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,470
sperm maybe that's yet another way to
inject variety into the system

4420
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:38,480
inject variety into the system
 

4421
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,550
inject variety into the system
and redundancy i guess you know we have

4422
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:40,560
and redundancy i guess you know we have
 

4423
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,870
and redundancy i guess you know we have
two kidneys we have two hands if we lose

4424
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:42,880
two kidneys we have two hands if we lose
 

4425
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,430
two kidneys we have two hands if we lose
one we can still go on we have

4426
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
one we can still go on we have
 

4427
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,750
one we can still go on we have
you know however many millions of sperm

4428
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:47,760
you know however many millions of sperm
 

4429
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,189
you know however many millions of sperm
get sort of launched in every

4430
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:49,199
get sort of launched in every
 

4431
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,590
get sort of launched in every
ejaculation is uh you know if a bunch

4432
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:51,600
ejaculation is uh you know if a bunch
 

4433
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,950
ejaculation is uh you know if a bunch
fail

4434
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:52,960
fail
 

4435
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,870
fail
or don't make it inside there's papers

4436
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:54,880
or don't make it inside there's papers
 

4437
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,110
or don't make it inside there's papers
on this by the way uh that i read for

some reason not read but skimmed
 

4441
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,830

01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:01,840
for some reason which is uh talking
 

4443
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,550
for some reason which is uh talking
about which sperm usually wins like what

4444
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
about which sperm usually wins like what
 

4445
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,149
about which sperm usually wins like what
are the characteristics of sperms that

4446
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:06,159
are the characteristics of sperms that
 

4447
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,110
are the characteristics of sperms that
are winning and it's not the fastest

4448
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:09,120
are winning and it's not the fastest
 

4449
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,630
are winning and it's not the fastest
it says

4450
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:10,640
it says
 

4451
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,709
it says
apparently there's some kind of

4452
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:12,719
apparently there's some kind of
 

4453
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,630
apparently there's some kind of
slaughter that happens early on people

4454
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:14,640
slaughter that happens early on people
 

4455
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,550
slaughter that happens early on people
will correct me but it's not the fastest

4456
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:16,560
will correct me but it's not the fastest
 

4457
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,709
will correct me but it's not the fastest
it's there's a aspect of it's the

4458
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:18,719
it's there's a aspect of it's the
 

4459
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,950
it's there's a aspect of it's the
luckiest it really is like the body

4460
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:20,960
luckiest it really is like the body
 

4461
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,270
luckiest it really is like the body
tries to make it a random selection

they're fueled by fructose i didn't
 

4471
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,510
they're fueled by fructose i didn't
really think about that so they're a um

endurance kind of stuff
 

4493
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,390
endurance kind of stuff
when you don't eat any carbs any glucose

why that's why partly the liver suffers

4560
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
why that's why partly the liver suffers
 

4561
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,470
why that's why partly the liver suffers
sometimes the injury from

4562
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:16,480
sometimes the injury from
 

4563
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,110
sometimes the injury from
uh certain certain toxins like alcohol

4564
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:19,120
uh certain certain toxins like alcohol
 

4565
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,030
uh certain certain toxins like alcohol
but beyond that the liver is also the

4566
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:21,040
but beyond that the liver is also the
 

4567
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,350
but beyond that the liver is also the
place as i said it metabolizes things

4568
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:23,360
place as i said it metabolizes things
 

4569
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,070
place as i said it metabolizes things
too so it metabolizes alcohol and why it

4570
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:26,080
too so it metabolizes alcohol and why it
 

4571
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,149
too so it metabolizes alcohol and why it
can be injured by alcohol it metabolizes

4572
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:28,159
can be injured by alcohol it metabolizes
 

4573
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,310
can be injured by alcohol it metabolizes
drugs like tylenol which is why

4574
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:30,320
drugs like tylenol which is why
 

4575
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,030
drugs like tylenol which is why
tylenols uh can be very toxic to the

4576
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:33,040
tylenols uh can be very toxic to the
 

4577
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,390
tylenols uh can be very toxic to the
liver when taken out as an overdose

4578

liver when taken out as an overdose
 

4579
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,310
liver when taken out as an overdose
so the liver you know even beyond that

4580
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:38,320
so the liver you know even beyond that
 

4581
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,669
so the liver you know even beyond that
the liver produces a lot of different

processes things like bilirubin and
 

4599
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:58,229

01:18:58,229 --> 01:18:58,239
other things that really as i mentioned
 

4601
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,310
other things that really as i mentioned
there's like 15 organs wrapped into one

4602
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,320
there's like 15 organs wrapped into one
 

4603
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,270
there's like 15 organs wrapped into one
maybe that's why it's sort of the

4604
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,280
maybe that's why it's sort of the
 

4605
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,669
maybe that's why it's sort of the
biggest internal organ the skin's bigger

4606
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
biggest internal organ the skin's bigger
 

4607
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,229
biggest internal organ the skin's bigger
but it's not an internal organ

4608
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:06,239
but it's not an internal organ
 

4609
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,750
but it's not an internal organ
right the biggest

4610
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:07,760
right the biggest
 

4611
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,229
right the biggest
organ in the human body is the skin

4612

organ in the human body is the skin
 

4613

organ in the human body is the skin
right

4614
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:11,120
right
 

4615
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,550
right
but the liver is the biggest internal

4616
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:12,560
but the liver is the biggest internal
 

4617
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,790
but the liver is the biggest internal
organ and it really is a powerhouse and

4618
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
organ and it really is a powerhouse and
 

4619
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,189
organ and it really is a powerhouse and
and does a lot which is why when people

4620
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
and does a lot which is why when people
 

4621
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,790
and does a lot which is why when people
suffer from liver failure kind of

4622
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:18,800
suffer from liver failure kind of
 

4623

01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,000
and uh in terms of replacing organs
 

4627
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,430
and uh in terms of replacing organs
what

4628

what
 

4629
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,510
what
what are organs that are easily

4630
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:27,520
what are organs that are easily
 

4631
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,669
what are organs that are easily
replaceable which are not

easiest in a way
 

4647
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,830
easiest in a way
partly i mean maybe a big factor there

4648
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:43,840
partly i mean maybe a big factor there
 

4649
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,350
partly i mean maybe a big factor there
is that other people have two of them

4650
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,360
is that other people have two of them

01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,630
is that other people have two of them
and can give one to you so you don't

4652
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:46,640
and can give one to you so you don't
 

4653
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,149
and can give one to you so you don't

the case with hearts and livers
 

4657
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,830
the case with hearts and livers
sometimes you can take a part of a liver

4658
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:51,840
sometimes you can take a part of a liver
 

4659

sometimes you can take a part of a liver
from someone who's alive and the liver

01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,750
does have this kind of
mythological ability to regenerate

mythological ability to regenerate
 

4665
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,310

and that's uh actually biologically

4674
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,360
and that's uh actually biologically
 

4675
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,189
and that's uh actually biologically
accurate not that you can completely get

accurate not that you can completely get
 

4677
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,709
accurate not that you can completely get
rid of it and it'll appear again but

4678
01:20:12,709 --> 01:20:12,719
rid of it and it'll appear again but
 

4679
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,950
rid of it and it'll appear again but
when pieces of it are removed or injured

4680
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:14,960
when pieces of it are removed or injured

01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:16,840
it does regenerate itself pretty
 

4683
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,030
it does regenerate itself pretty
amazingly um

so i'd say the kidneys the fact that

4686
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:20,400
so i'd say the kidneys the fact that
 

4687
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,629
so i'd say the kidneys the fact that
they're more around also it's you know

4688
01:20:22,629 --> 01:20:22,639
they're more around also it's you know
 

4689
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:24,550
they're more around also it's you know
the kidneys a smaller organ it's often

4690
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,560
the kidneys a smaller organ it's often
 

4691
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,910
the kidneys a smaller organ it's often
just you don't have to put a

4692
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:25,920
just you don't have to put a
 

4693
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,910
just you don't have to put a
transplanted kidney where the kidney

4694
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:27,920
transplanted kidney where the kidney
 

4695
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,270
transplanted kidney where the kidney
should be in the back of the abdomen you

4696
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,280
should be in the back of the abdomen you
 

4697
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,550
should be in the back of the abdomen you
can just kind of stuff it into the

4698
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:30,560
can just kind of stuff it into the
 

4699
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,310
can just kind of stuff it into the
pelvis there because it's a smaller

4700
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:32,320
pelvis there because it's a smaller
 

4701
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,669
pelvis there because it's a smaller
organ the liver would be hard because

4702
01:20:33,669 --> 01:20:33,679
organ the liver would be hard because
 

4703
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,990
organ the liver would be hard because
it's huge

4704
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:36,000
it's huge
 

4705
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,350
it's huge
and i guess we just have the most

4706
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:37,360
and i guess we just have the most
 

4707
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,510
and i guess we just have the most
experience with kidney transplants

4708
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:39,520
experience with kidney transplants
 

4709
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,750
experience with kidney transplants
because they are the most common

4710
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:41,760
because they are the most common
 

4711
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,510
because they are the most common
and then the heart and the brain are

4712
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:43,520
and then the heart and the brain are
 

4713
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,189
and then the heart and the brain are
probably

4714
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:45,199
probably
 

4715
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,350
probably
quite difficult brain as far as i know

and uh
 

4723
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,870
and uh
definitely i've evaluated a lot of

01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:54,880
definitely i've evaluated a lot of
 

4725
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,110
definitely i've evaluated a lot of
patients with a heart transplant it does

4726
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:57,120
patients with a heart transplant it does
 

4727
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,669
patients with a heart transplant it does
work pretty well the mechanical heart

4728
01:20:59,669 --> 01:20:59,679
work pretty well the mechanical heart
 

4729
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,070
work pretty well the mechanical heart
substitutes are also advancing quite

4730
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:02,080
substitutes are also advancing quite
 

4731
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,550

4757
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,149

commonly used so maybe heart transplant

4758
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:30,159

those mechanical things do advance and
as i said the heart is basically a

as i said the heart is basically a
 

4765
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,990
as i said the heart is basically a
mechanical pump so perhaps it would be

01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,000
mechanical pump so perhaps it would be
 

4767
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,990
mechanical pump so perhaps it would be
the easiest organ to replace with some

01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,149
doesn't you don't see a lot of sort of
studies uh medical studies advancing of

5774
01:39:40,149 --> 01:39:40,159
studies uh medical studies advancing of
 

5775
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:42,390
studies uh medical studies advancing of
medical science come out of russia which

5776
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:42,400
medical science come out of russia which
 

5777
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,030
medical science come out of russia which
is sort of i'm surprised sort of i wish

5778
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,040
is sort of i'm surprised sort of i wish
 

5779
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,270
is sort of i'm surprised sort of i wish
that it would you know i visited academe

5780
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:47,280
that it would you know i visited academe
 

5781
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,669
that it would you know i visited academe
goradak outside novosibirsk which is an

5782
01:39:49,669 --> 01:39:49,679
goradak outside novosibirsk which is an
 

5783
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:51,510
goradak outside novosibirsk which is an
entire city the soviets created just for

5784
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:51,520
entire city the soviets created just for
 

5785
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,109
entire city the soviets created just for
the study of science and it's like

5786
01:39:53,109 --> 01:39:53,119
the study of science and it's like
 

5787
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:54,629
the study of science and it's like
there's the geology building and there's

5788
01:39:54,629 --> 01:39:54,639
there's the geology building and there's
 

5789
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:56,390
there's the geology building and there's
the biology building and there's the

5790

the biology building and there's the
 

5791
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,390
the biology building and there's the
chemistry building and

5792
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:58,400
chemistry building and
 

5793
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,750
chemistry building and
i just feel like russia has this

5794
01:39:59,750 --> 01:39:59,760
i just feel like russia has this
 

5795
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,669
i just feel like russia has this
potential to be a science powerhouse or

5796
01:40:01,669 --> 01:40:01,679
potential to be a science powerhouse or
 

5797
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,910
potential to be a science powerhouse or
even in the medical sciences but

5798
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:03,920
even in the medical sciences but
 

5799
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,750
even in the medical sciences but
i guess you just i don't see it i'm not

5800
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:05,760
i guess you just i don't see it i'm not
 

5801
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,510
i guess you just i don't see it i'm not
sure why

5802
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:07,520
sure why
 

5803
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,790
sure why
i mean you can

5804
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:08,800
i mean you can
 

5805
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,669
i mean you can
certainly guess as to why and i

5806
01:40:11,669 --> 01:40:11,679
certainly guess as to why and i
 

5807
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,830
certainly guess as to why and i
i see the same thing in the other in the

5808
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:13,840
i see the same thing in the other in the
 

5809
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,910
i see the same thing in the other in the
sciences i hold the dearest or in

5810
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:15,920
sciences i hold the dearest or in
 

5811
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,669
sciences i hold the dearest or in
computer science

5812

in engineering fields

5814
01:40:20,629 --> 01:40:20,639
in engineering fields
 

5815
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,590
in engineering fields
i kind of long held this uh

5816
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:23,600
i kind of long held this uh
 

5817

know why why so little science is coming

5828
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:36,960
know why why so little science is coming
 

5829
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,030
know why why so little science is coming
out of there why so little

5830
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:39,040
out of there why so little
 

5831
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,350
out of there why so little
um that we hear about

5832
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:41,360
um that we hear about
 

5833
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,629
um that we hear about
and it feels like we should be able to

5834
01:40:42,629 --> 01:40:42,639
and it feels like we should be able to
 

5835
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:44,709
and it feels like we should be able to
bridge the scientific community

5836
01:40:44,709 --> 01:40:44,719
bridge the scientific community
 

5837
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,870
bridge the scientific community
like uh

5838
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:46,880
like uh
 

5839
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,470
like uh
the science

5840
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:48,480
the science
 

5841
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,709
the science
let's even say even in turmoil of

5842
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:50,719
let's even say even in turmoil of
 

5843
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:53,590
let's even say even in turmoil of
geopolitics even in global conflict i

5844
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:53,600
geopolitics even in global conflict i
 

5845
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,189
geopolitics even in global conflict i
feel like science should be bigger than

5846
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:55,199
feel like science should be bigger than
 

5847
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:56,070
feel like science should be bigger than
that

5848
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:56,080
that
 

5849
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,149
that
um but

5850
01:40:58,149 --> 01:40:58,159
um but
 

5851
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:00,310
um but
why do we not hear from the scientists

5852
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:00,320
why do we not hear from the scientists
 

5853
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,790
why do we not hear from the scientists
is because of the limitations on human

5854
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:02,800
is because of the limitations on human
 

5855
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,270
is because of the limitations on human
freedoms on scientific freedoms i feel

5856
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:05,280
freedoms on scientific freedoms i feel
 

5857
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,430
freedoms on scientific freedoms i feel
like in in china

5858
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:07,440
like in in china
 

5859
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,030
like in in china
in russia

any regime of its sort
 

5865
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:16,470
any regime of its sort
you should give freedom to scientists to

5866
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:16,480
you should give freedom to scientists to
 

5867
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,669
you should give freedom to scientists to
to flourish

5868
01:41:17,669 --> 01:41:17,679
to flourish
 

5869
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:19,510
to flourish
and to interact with others and you can

and to interact with others and you can
 

5871
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,270
and to interact with others and you can
only grow from that you shouldn't

5872
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:21,280
only grow from that you shouldn't
 

5873
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,189
only grow from that you shouldn't
suppress that

5874
01:41:23,189 --> 01:41:23,199
suppress that
 

5875
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,270
suppress that
the sort of cold war ideas

5876

the sort of cold war ideas
 

5877
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,270

we should put those aside

5878
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:27,280
we should put those aside
 

5879
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,510
we should put those aside
as a somebody who

5880
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:29,520
as a somebody who
 

5881
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:33,030
as a somebody who
spent time in russia as somebody who's

um
 

5899
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,709
um
i guess it's you know when you read

5900
01:41:52,709 --> 01:41:52,719
i guess it's you know when you read
 

5901
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:54,709
i guess it's you know when you read
russian history and ukrainian history i

5902

russian history and ukrainian history i
 

5903
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,790
russian history and ukrainian history i
guess it just it's sort of

5904

guess it just it's sort of
 

5905
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,910

out is that the use of laxatives early

6206
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:13,119
out is that the use of laxatives early
 

6207
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:15,030
out is that the use of laxatives early
in the 20th century and before that it

6208
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:15,040
in the 20th century and before that it

in the 20th century and before that it
was they were used for a surprising

was they were used for a surprising
 

6211
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:19,590
was they were used for a surprising
number of ailments where they probably

6212
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:19,600
number of ailments where they probably
 

6213
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,750
number of ailments where they probably
did not help at all but

6214
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:21,760
did not help at all but
 

6215
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,510
did not help at all but
i think that was a holdover from sort of

6216
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:23,520
i think that was a holdover from sort of
 

6217
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,590
i think that was a holdover from sort of
the old theory of medicine the humoral

6218
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:25,600
the old theory of medicine the humoral
 

6219
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,510
the old theory of medicine the humoral
theory where you have to balance the

6220
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:27,520
theory where you have to balance the
 

6221
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,669
theory where you have to balance the
fluids in the body and so causing people

6222
01:47:29,669 --> 01:47:29,679
fluids in the body and so causing people
 

6223
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:31,750
fluids in the body and so causing people
to vomit causing them to have diarrhea

6224
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:31,760
to vomit causing them to have diarrhea
 

6225
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:32,629
to vomit causing them to have diarrhea
or

6226
01:47:32,629 --> 01:47:32,639
or
 

6227
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:34,830
or
purposely taking blood out of them in

6228
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:34,840
purposely taking blood out of them in
 

6229
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,030
purposely taking blood out of them in
bloodletting was a big part and i think

6230
01:47:37,030 --> 01:47:37,040
bloodletting was a big part and i think
 

6231
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,669
bloodletting was a big part and i think
that crazy use of laxatives was um maybe

6232
01:47:39,669 --> 01:47:39,679
that crazy use of laxatives was um maybe
 

6233
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:41,750
that crazy use of laxatives was um maybe
a holdover from that time

6234
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:41,760
a holdover from that time
 

6235
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,430
a holdover from that time
but that being said

6236
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:43,440
but that being said
 

6237
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,030
but that being said
they were probably not eating very high

6238
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,040
they were probably not eating very high
 

6239
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,510
they were probably not eating very high
fiber food on that expedition so perhaps

6240
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:47,520
fiber food on that expedition so perhaps
 

6241
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,430
fiber food on that expedition so perhaps
laxatives could have been helpful you

6242
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:49,440
laxatives could have been helpful you
 

6243
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,270
laxatives could have been helpful you

6244
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:51,280
know there's a lot of seal
 

6245
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,149

um

6246

penguin and seal meat being eaten which

6248
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:54,400
penguin and seal meat being eaten which
 

6249
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,790
penguin and seal meat being eaten which
is not super high in fiber

6250
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:56,800
is not super high in fiber
 

6251
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,070
is not super high in fiber
so i don't want to discount the

6252
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:58,080
so i don't want to discount the
 

6253
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,229
so i don't want to discount the
importance of laxatives in that setting

6254
01:48:00,229 --> 01:48:00,239
importance of laxatives in that setting
 

6255
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:01,990
importance of laxatives in that setting
but that wouldn't be the essential thing

6256
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:02,000
but that wouldn't be the essential thing
 

6257
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,109
but that wouldn't be the essential thing
if you're thinking

6258
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:03,119
if you're thinking

6271
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:17,510
possibilities were much now narrower
back then you know this was um before

6272
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:17,520
back then you know this was um before
 

6273
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,910

i think germ theory might have been
 

6277
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:23,750
i think germ theory might have been
you know it was known but um there

6278
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:23,760
you know it was known but um there
 

6279
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,070
you know it was known but um there
wasn't much to do about it um so the

6280
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:26,080
wasn't much to do about it um so the
 

6281
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,830
wasn't much to do about it um so the
availability of medicines i mean that's

6282
01:48:27,830 --> 01:48:27,840
availability of medicines i mean that's
 

6283
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,430
availability of medicines i mean that's
something that exploded over the course

01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:29,440
something that exploded over the course
 

6285
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:31,830
something that exploded over the course
of the 20th century so what i can put in

6286
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:31,840
of the 20th century so what i can put in
 

6287
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,910
of the 20th century so what i can put in
a backpack today filled with modern

orders magnitude greater than what they

6294
01:48:40,149 --> 01:48:40,159
orders magnitude greater than what they
 

6295
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:41,830
orders magnitude greater than what they
had back then

6296
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:41,840

i think just one of the most delicious
foods and it's sort of this weird body

6622
01:53:59,189 --> 01:53:59,199
foods and it's sort of this weird body
 

6623
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:00,870
foods and it's sort of this weird body
part you know it's basically all your

6624
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:00,880
part you know it's basically all your
 

6625
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,870
part you know it's basically all your
stem cells not all of them but the stem

6626
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:02,880
stem cells not all of them but the stem
 

6627
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,870
stem cells not all of them but the stem
cells that produce all your blood cells

6628
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:04,880
cells that produce all your blood cells
 

6629
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,790
cells that produce all your blood cells
so they are spitting out billions of

6630
01:54:06,790 --> 01:54:06,800
so they are spitting out billions of
 

6631
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,229
so they are spitting out billions of
white blood cells red blood cells and

6632
01:54:08,229 --> 01:54:08,239
white blood cells red blood cells and
 

6633
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:10,149
white blood cells red blood cells and
platelets every day and there's a bunch

6634
01:54:10,149 --> 01:54:10,159
platelets every day and there's a bunch
 

6635
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:12,390
platelets every day and there's a bunch
of fat in there as well

6636
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:12,400
of fat in there as well
 

6637
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:13,990
of fat in there as well
just one of the places the body stores

6638
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:14,000
just one of the places the body stores
 

6639
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,470
just one of the places the body stores
fat and so you basically add heat and

6640
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:16,480
fat and so you basically add heat and
 

6641
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:17,589
fat and so you basically add heat and
that's all you need it's like the

6642
01:54:17,589 --> 01:54:17,599
that's all you need it's like the
 

6643
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:20,070
that's all you need it's like the
perfect food you add heat the fat for

6644
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:20,080
perfect food you add heat the fat for
 

6645
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:22,070
perfect food you add heat the fat for
frying the stem cells is already there

6646
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:22,080
frying the stem cells is already there
 

6647
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,229
frying the stem cells is already there
there's a naturally a bone vessel to

chop off just chop off the fat end and
 

6731
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:57,030
chop off just chop off the fat end and
start spooning it out or maybe i'll

6732
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,040
start spooning it out or maybe i'll
 

6733
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:59,910
start spooning it out or maybe i'll
revisit it that's fascinating and where

where would you eat it

6736
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:01,760
where would you eat it
 

6737
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,070
where would you eat it
where in which place of the world

6738
01:56:04,070 --> 01:56:04,080
where in which place of the world
 

6739
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,149
where in which place of the world
is is there something about

6740
01:56:06,149 --> 01:56:06,159
is is there something about
 

6741
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:09,350
is is there something about
who cooks it who you eat it with

6742
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:09,360
who cooks it who you eat it with
 

6743
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:10,790
who cooks it who you eat it with
um

6744
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:10,800
um
 

6745
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,229

many fascinating places
 

6759
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:28,070
many fascinating places
i would say i'm antarctica i would say

6760
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:28,080
i would say i'm antarctica i would say
 

6761
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,470
i would say i'm antarctica i would say
is one of the most picturesque places

6762
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:30,480
is one of the most picturesque places
 

6763
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,870
is one of the most picturesque places
i've ever been i really did not and i

6764
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:32,880
i've ever been i really did not and i
 

6765
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:35,430
i've ever been i really did not and i
didn't know how mountainous it was and i

6766
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,440
didn't know how mountainous it was and i
 

6767
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,830
didn't know how mountainous it was and i
guess i knew there'd be the ice but just

6768
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:37,840
guess i knew there'd be the ice but just
 

6769
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,430
guess i knew there'd be the ice but just
i didn't know how much ice it was you

6770
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,440
i didn't know how much ice it was you
 

6771
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:41,109
i didn't know how much ice it was you
know it's ice and mountains just

6772
01:56:41,109 --> 01:56:41,119
know it's ice and mountains just
 

6773
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:43,830
know it's ice and mountains just
overwhelming i just you know as as kind

6774
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:43,840
overwhelming i just you know as as kind
 

6775
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,510
overwhelming i just you know as as kind
of overwhelming bone marrow might seem

6776
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:45,520
of overwhelming bone marrow might seem
 

6777
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,550
of overwhelming bone marrow might seem
to you sort of that feast for your eyes

um
 

6781
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:51,750
um
and just ice in general is amazing like

6782
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:51,760
and just ice in general is amazing like
 

6783
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:53,990
and just ice in general is amazing like
the icebergs floating around antarctica

6784
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,000
the icebergs floating around antarctica
 

6785
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,990
the icebergs floating around antarctica
is just astounding like the different

6786
01:56:55,990 --> 01:56:56,000
is just astounding like the different
 

6787
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,070
is just astounding like the different
shapes the sizes

6788
01:56:58,070 --> 01:56:58,080
shapes the sizes
 

6789
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:00,390
shapes the sizes
are uh incredible there's actually a i

6790
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:00,400
are uh incredible there's actually a i
 

6791
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,149
are uh incredible there's actually a i
believe it's u.s navy website that

6792
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:02,159
believe it's u.s navy website that
 

6793
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:04,149
believe it's u.s navy website that
tracks the largest icebergs and you can

6794
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:04,159
tracks the largest icebergs and you can
 

6795
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:06,070
tracks the largest icebergs and you can
read about each of them and how big they

6796
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:06,080
read about each of them and how big they
 

6797
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,270
read about each of them and how big they
are and just

6798
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:07,280
are and just
 

6799
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,430
are and just
the formations you see similar up near

6800
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:09,440
the formations you see similar up near
 

6801
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,870
the formations you see similar up near
green land though i have not been to

6802
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:10,880
green land though i have not been to
 

6803
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,390
green land though i have not been to
greenland um

6804
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:12,400
greenland um
 

6805
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,470
greenland um
just ice in general is just amazing so i

6806
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:14,480
just ice in general is just amazing so i
 

6807
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:16,149
just ice in general is just amazing so i
could just look at its different forms

6808
01:57:16,149 --> 01:57:16,159
could just look at its different forms
 

6809
01:57:16,159 --> 01:57:17,910
could just look at its different forms
while eating bone marrow forever until

6810
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:17,920
while eating bone marrow forever until
 

6811
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:20,470
while eating bone marrow forever until
you kill me that is yeah and afterwards

6812
01:57:20,470 --> 01:57:20,480
you kill me that is yeah and afterwards
 

6813
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,790
you kill me that is yeah and afterwards
we go it's back to the death of the

6814
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:22,800
we go it's back to the death of the
 

6815
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,189
we go it's back to the death of the
death and sex i

6816
01:57:25,189 --> 01:57:25,199
death and sex i
 

6817
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:27,669
death and sex i
what is it about the ice is it uh sort

6818
01:57:27,669 --> 01:57:27,679
what is it about the ice is it uh sort
 

6819
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:30,390
what is it about the ice is it uh sort
of the enormity of nature it just

6820
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:30,400
of the enormity of nature it just
 

6821
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:33,350
of the enormity of nature it just
reminds you that it's going to be there

6822
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:33,360
reminds you that it's going to be there
 

6823
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,030
reminds you that it's going to be there
before you and after

6824
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:35,040
before you and after
 

6825
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,550
before you and after
and then you get to partake in the

6826
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:36,560
and then you get to partake in the
 

6827
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,709
and then you get to partake in the
eating of the um

6828
01:57:38,709 --> 01:57:38,719
eating of the um
 

6829
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:40,629
eating of the um
the thing you need for maintaining of

6830
01:57:40,629 --> 01:57:40,639
the thing you need for maintaining of
 

6831
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:42,629
the thing you need for maintaining of
your biological

6832
01:57:42,629 --> 01:57:42,639
your biological
 

6833
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:45,109
your biological
temporary biological organism

6834
01:57:45,109 --> 01:57:45,119
temporary biological organism
 

6835
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,350
temporary biological organism
yeah i think it's a few things one is

6836
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:47,360
yeah i think it's a few things one is
 

6837
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,189
yeah i think it's a few things one is
just the shapes that you see you know

6838
01:57:49,189 --> 01:57:49,199
just the shapes that you see you know
 

6839
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:51,030
just the shapes that you see you know
the wave action

6840
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:51,040
the wave action
 

6841
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,350
the wave action
just eating away at these pieces of ice

6842
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:53,360
just eating away at these pieces of ice
 

6843
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:55,350
just eating away at these pieces of ice
you get these arches and just these

6844
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:55,360
you get these arches and just these
 

6845
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,350
you get these arches and just these
shapes i mean it's just like geometry

6846
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,360
shapes i mean it's just like geometry
 

6847
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,830
shapes i mean it's just like geometry
the geometry alone is amazing i studied

6848
01:57:59,830 --> 01:57:59,840
the geometry alone is amazing i studied
 

6849
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,589
the geometry alone is amazing i studied
math as an undergrad and i've always

6850
01:58:01,589 --> 01:58:01,599
math as an undergrad and i've always
 

6851
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:04,709
math as an undergrad and i've always
appreciated uh geometry

6852
01:58:04,709 --> 01:58:04,719
appreciated uh geometry
 

6853
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:06,870
appreciated uh geometry
and just the shapes alone are just look

6854
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:06,880
and just the shapes alone are just look
 

6855
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,109
and just the shapes alone are just look
like brilliant works of modernist art

6856
01:58:09,109 --> 01:58:09,119
like brilliant works of modernist art
 

6857
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:10,070
like brilliant works of modernist art
and just

6858
01:58:10,070 --> 01:58:10,080
and just
 

6859
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:12,470
and just
obviously no two are ever the same

6860
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:12,480
obviously no two are ever the same
 

6861
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,229
obviously no two are ever the same
not to mention a lot of them are this

6862
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:14,239
not to mention a lot of them are this
 

6863
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:17,430
not to mention a lot of them are this
unearthly blue color that is just um

6864
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:17,440
unearthly blue color that is just um
 

6865
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,870
unearthly blue color that is just um
really startling and fascinating the

6866
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:18,880
really startling and fascinating the
 

6867
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,270
really startling and fascinating the
same color of glaciers

6868
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:21,280
same color of glaciers
 

6869
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:22,709
same color of glaciers
you know in various parts of the world

6870
01:58:22,709 --> 01:58:22,719
you know in various parts of the world
 

6871
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:26,070
you know in various parts of the world
that blue color is just really amazing

6872
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:26,080
that blue color is just really amazing
 

6873
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:27,669
that blue color is just really amazing
and i also just love how it's sort of

6874
01:58:27,669 --> 01:58:27,679
and i also just love how it's sort of
 

6875
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:29,750
and i also just love how it's sort of
this constant shedding

6876
01:58:29,750 --> 01:58:29,760
this constant shedding
 

6877
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,350
this constant shedding
from our antarctic continent from

6878
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:31,360
from our antarctic continent from
 

6879
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,629
from our antarctic continent from
greenland you know it's this constant

6880
01:58:32,629 --> 01:58:32,639
greenland you know it's this constant
 

6881
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:34,470
greenland you know it's this constant
process of snow falling inland and

6882
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:34,480
process of snow falling inland and
 

6883
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,870
process of snow falling inland and
pushing the glaciers further out to sea

6884
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:36,880
pushing the glaciers further out to sea
 

6885
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:39,030
pushing the glaciers further out to sea
and them breaking loose i mean obviously

6886
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:39,040
and them breaking loose i mean obviously
 

6887
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:40,629
and them breaking loose i mean obviously
it seems to be happening faster these

6888
01:58:40,629 --> 01:58:40,639
it seems to be happening faster these
 

6889
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:42,709
it seems to be happening faster these
days but it's sort of this constant

6890
01:58:42,709 --> 01:58:42,719
days but it's sort of this constant
 

6891
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,629
days but it's sort of this constant
shedding and sort of i always like

6892
01:58:44,629 --> 01:58:44,639
shedding and sort of i always like
 

6893
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:45,589
shedding and sort of i always like
thinking about how the body has

6894
01:58:45,589 --> 01:58:45,599
thinking about how the body has
 

6895
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:46,629
thinking about how the body has
something similar you know we're

6896
01:58:46,629 --> 01:58:46,639
something similar you know we're
 

6897
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:49,109
something similar you know we're
constantly shedding and renewing and

6898
01:58:49,109 --> 01:58:49,119
constantly shedding and renewing and
 

6899
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:50,390
constantly shedding and renewing and
rebuilding

6900
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:50,400
rebuilding
 

6901
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,270
rebuilding
everything um and so ice is sort of this

6902
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:53,280
everything um and so ice is sort of this
 

6903
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:56,870
everything um and so ice is sort of this
constant similar process

6904
01:58:56,870 --> 01:58:56,880

 

6905
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,830

yeah

6906
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:57,840
yeah
 

6907
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:00,470
yeah
i did not know you were a math undergrad

6908
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:00,480
i did not know you were a math undergrad
 

6909
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,709
i did not know you were a math undergrad
so that i mean you're just keep getting

6910
01:59:02,709 --> 01:59:02,719
so that i mean you're just keep getting
 

6911
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:05,189
so that i mean you're just keep getting
more fascinating

6912
01:59:05,189 --> 01:59:05,199
more fascinating
 

6913
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:07,109
more fascinating
can you maybe take a small step into

6914
01:59:07,109 --> 01:59:07,119
can you maybe take a small step into
 

6915
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:09,270
can you maybe take a small step into
that direction

6916
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:09,280
that direction
 

6917
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,629
that direction
what do you find beautiful about

6918
01:59:10,629 --> 01:59:10,639
what do you find beautiful about
 

6919
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:13,109
what do you find beautiful about
mathematics why did you journey into

6920
01:59:13,109 --> 01:59:13,119
mathematics why did you journey into
 

6921
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:15,189
mathematics why did you journey into
that part of the world for a time

6922
01:59:15,189 --> 01:59:15,199
that part of the world for a time
 

6923
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:17,669
that part of the world for a time
so i liked math i especially liked so

6924
01:59:17,669 --> 01:59:17,679
so i liked math i especially liked so
 

6925
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:19,910
so i liked math i especially liked so
college math i did some calculus in high

6926
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:19,920
college math i did some calculus in high
 

6927
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,229
college math i did some calculus in high
school when i got to college math i was

6928
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:22,239
school when i got to college math i was
 

6929
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:23,510
school when i got to college math i was
amazed that

6930
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:23,520
amazed that
 

6931
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,270
amazed that
there were no more numbers you know the

6932
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:25,280
there were no more numbers you know the
 

6933
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:28,310
there were no more numbers you know the
digits disappeared it was just variables

6934
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,320
digits disappeared it was just variables
 

6935
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,950
digits disappeared it was just variables
concepts you know um there was almost no

6936
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:30,960
concepts you know um there was almost no
 

6937
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:33,030
concepts you know um there was almost no
more numbers at all it was like this

6938
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:33,040
more numbers at all it was like this
 

6939
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,870
more numbers at all it was like this
totally abstract

6940
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:34,880
totally abstract
 

6941
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:35,910
totally abstract
um

6942
01:59:35,910 --> 01:59:35,920
um
 

6943
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,070
um
you know kind of way of thinking but

6944
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:38,080
you know kind of way of thinking but
 

6945
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:39,830
you know kind of way of thinking but
that sort of reflects the natural world

6946
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:39,840
that sort of reflects the natural world
 

6947
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,430
that sort of reflects the natural world
and teaches you about the natural world

6948
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:41,440
and teaches you about the natural world
 

6949
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,510
and teaches you about the natural world
though it's sort of this perfect you

6950
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:43,520
though it's sort of this perfect you
 

6951
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,510
though it's sort of this perfect you
know platonic ideal perhaps of the

6952
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:45,520
know platonic ideal perhaps of the
 

6953
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,750
know platonic ideal perhaps of the
natural world that can still sort of

6954
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:47,760
natural world that can still sort of
 

6955
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,669
natural world that can still sort of
help explain what happens in the natural

6956
01:59:49,669 --> 01:59:49,679
help explain what happens in the natural
 

6957
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:50,790
help explain what happens in the natural
world but

6958
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:50,800
world but
 

6959
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,109
world but
um just these concepts are so abstract

6960
01:59:53,109 --> 01:59:53,119
um just these concepts are so abstract
 

6961
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:54,229
um just these concepts are so abstract
from like

6962
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:54,239
from like
 

6963
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:56,709
from like
life and from um you know the natural

6964
01:59:56,709 --> 01:59:56,719
life and from um you know the natural
 

6965
01:59:56,719 --> 01:59:57,830
life and from um you know the natural
world and i was actually getting

6966
01:59:57,830 --> 01:59:57,840
world and i was actually getting
 

6967
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,270
world and i was actually getting
interested in the natural world at the

6968
01:59:59,270 --> 01:59:59,280
interested in the natural world at the
 

6969
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:02,149
interested in the natural world at the
same time when i was in um at nyu

6970
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:02,159
same time when i was in um at nyu
 

6971
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:04,550
same time when i was in um at nyu
studying math you know i took a tour of

6972
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:04,560
studying math you know i took a tour of
 

6973
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,629
studying math you know i took a tour of
central park that was pointing the guy

steve brill was pointing out these wild

6976
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:08,560
steve brill was pointing out these wild
 

6977
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:10,229
steve brill was pointing out these wild
edible plants and i was learning to

6978
02:00:10,229 --> 02:00:10,239
edible plants and i was learning to
 

6979
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:12,470
edible plants and i was learning to
identify the first plants and knowing

6980
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:12,480
identify the first plants and knowing
 

6981
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:14,629
identify the first plants and knowing
what's edible what's not that was

6982
02:00:14,629 --> 02:00:14,639
what's edible what's not that was
 

6983
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:16,790
what's edible what's not that was
totally fascinating and sort of this

6984
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:16,800
totally fascinating and sort of this
 

6985
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,149
totally fascinating and sort of this
kind of thing that i felt like was

6986
02:00:18,149 --> 02:00:18,159
kind of thing that i felt like was
 

6987
02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:19,510
kind of thing that i felt like was
connecting me to nature and it was

6988
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:19,520
connecting me to nature and it was
 

6989
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,589
connecting me to nature and it was
balanced with this

6990
02:00:21,589 --> 02:00:21,599
balanced with this
 

6991
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:24,470
balanced with this
utterly abstract science you know or

02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:24,480
utterly abstract science you know or
 

6993
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:26,229
utterly abstract science you know or
early abstract lessons i was getting in

6994
02:00:26,229 --> 02:00:26,239
early abstract lessons i was getting in
 

6995
02:00:26,239 --> 02:00:27,830
early abstract lessons i was getting in
in math class where i was thinking

6996
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:27,840
in math class where i was thinking
 

6997
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,669
in math class where i was thinking
through series you know as we approach

6998
02:00:29,669 --> 02:00:29,679
through series you know as we approach

and
 

7003
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:34,390
and
concepts of like rings and abstract

so different
 

7015
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:48,470
so different
this kind of logical

7016
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:48,480

why the big

7022
02:00:53,669 --> 02:00:53,679
why the big
 

7023
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:55,830
why the big
how did that feel to take the leap into

7024
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:55,840
how did that feel to take the leap into
 

7025
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,030

haven't gotten there yet i think we
 

7165
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:24,070
haven't gotten there yet i think we

the huge problem of needing to get those
 

7175
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:33,910
the huge problem of needing to get those
organs from others and you know the

7176
02:03:33,910 --> 02:03:33,920
organs from others and you know the
 

7177
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:35,750
organs from others and you know the
rejection of putting a foreign material

7178

tends not to like that
 

7183
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:40,870
tends not to like that
um you know

7184
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:40,880
um you know
 

7185
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:43,030
um you know
that has advanced a lot recently i think

7186
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:43,040
that has advanced a lot recently i think
 

7187
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:44,229
that has advanced a lot recently i think
i think um

7188
02:03:44,229 --> 02:03:44,239
i think um
 

7189
02:03:44,239 --> 02:03:46,870
i think um
some advances actually have been where

7190
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:46,880
some advances actually have been where
 

7191
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,229
some advances actually have been where
you know we pay a lot of attention to

7192
02:03:48,229 --> 02:03:48,239
you know we pay a lot of attention to
 

7193
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:49,990
you know we pay a lot of attention to
stem cells stem cell stem cells we can

7194
02:03:49,990 --> 02:03:50,000
stem cells stem cell stem cells we can
 

7195
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,669
stem cells stem cell stem cells we can
grow whatever we want out of stem cells

7196
02:03:51,669 --> 02:03:51,679
grow whatever we want out of stem cells
 

7197
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:54,149
grow whatever we want out of stem cells
but now there's sort of a recognition

7198
02:03:54,149 --> 02:03:54,159
but now there's sort of a recognition
 

7199
02:03:54,159 --> 02:03:56,310
but now there's sort of a recognition
that the what we call the extracellular

7200
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:56,320
that the what we call the extracellular
 

7201
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:58,790
that the what we call the extracellular
matrix which is sort of the you know

7202
02:03:58,790 --> 02:03:58,800
matrix which is sort of the you know
 

7203
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:00,550
matrix which is sort of the you know
foundation of the body the thing that

7204
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:00,560
foundation of the body the thing that
 

7205
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:02,390
foundation of the body the thing that
holds all the cells into their proper

7206
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:02,400
holds all the cells into their proper
 

7207
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:03,910
holds all the cells into their proper
shape and keeps them where they should

7208
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:03,920
shape and keeps them where they should
 

7209
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:05,750
shape and keeps them where they should
be um

7210
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:05,760
be um
 

7211
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:07,109
be um
that is actually crucial and there's

7212
02:04:07,109 --> 02:04:07,119
that is actually crucial and there's
 

7213
02:04:07,119 --> 02:04:09,030
that is actually crucial and there's
probably a lot of signaling that goes on

7214
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:09,040
probably a lot of signaling that goes on
 

7215
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:11,510
probably a lot of signaling that goes on
like you stick a stem cell on the right

7216
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:11,520
like you stick a stem cell on the right
 

7217
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,350
like you stick a stem cell on the right

02:04:13,350 --> 02:04:13,360
extracellular matrix it will turn into
 

7219
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:15,030
extracellular matrix it will turn into
the kind of cell that you want and take

7220
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:15,040
the kind of cell that you want and take
 

7221
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,550
the kind of cell that you want and take
the right shape and position and start

7222
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:16,560
the right shape and position and start
 

7223
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:17,750
the right shape and position and start
functioning

7224
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:17,760

i think that's been a huge uh

7226
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:20,320
i think that's been a huge uh
 

7227
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:22,149
i think that's been a huge uh
huge advance knowing that it's not just

7228
02:04:22,149 --> 02:04:22,159
huge advance knowing that it's not just
 

7229
02:04:22,159 --> 02:04:24,629
huge advance knowing that it's not just
these you know celebrity stem cells that

7230
02:04:24,629 --> 02:04:24,639
these you know celebrity stem cells that
 

7231
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:26,470
these you know celebrity stem cells that
are the answer it's this kind of

7232
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:26,480
are the answer it's this kind of
 

7233
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,390
are the answer it's this kind of
part in the background this sort of just

7234
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:28,400
part in the background this sort of just
 

7235
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,069
part in the background this sort of just
like laying the foundation the system

7236
02:04:30,069 --> 02:04:30,079
like laying the foundation the system
 

7237
02:04:30,079 --> 02:04:31,990
like laying the foundation the system
that you put these cells onto

7238
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:32,000
that you put these cells onto
 

7239
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,589
that you put these cells onto
and we're not there yet but there's

7240
02:04:33,589 --> 02:04:33,599
and we're not there yet but there's
 

7241
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:35,669
and we're not there yet but there's
definitely a lot uh happening a lot of

7242
02:04:35,669 --> 02:04:35,679
definitely a lot uh happening a lot of
 

7243
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:37,270
definitely a lot uh happening a lot of
research happening and i think there'll

7244
02:04:37,270 --> 02:04:37,280
research happening and i think there'll
 

7245
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:39,510
research happening and i think there'll
be some advances probably soon

7246
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:39,520
be some advances probably soon
 

7247
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:40,229
be some advances probably soon
so

7248
02:04:40,229 --> 02:04:40,239
so
 

7249
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:43,589
so
now on the topic of interaction

7250
02:04:43,589 --> 02:04:43,599
now on the topic of interaction
 

7251
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:47,270
now on the topic of interaction
of uh computational systems with biology

7252
02:04:47,270 --> 02:04:47,280
of uh computational systems with biology
 

7253
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:48,629
of uh computational systems with biology
so if you look at a company like

7254
02:04:48,629 --> 02:04:48,639
so if you look at a company like
 

7255
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:50,870
so if you look at a company like
neurolink or the the whole effort of

7256
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:50,880
neurolink or the the whole effort of
 

7257
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:53,109
neurolink or the the whole effort of
brain computer interfaces

7258
02:04:53,109 --> 02:04:53,119

now there's a neurosurgery component

7260
02:04:55,109 --> 02:04:55,119
now there's a neurosurgery component
 

7261
02:04:55,119 --> 02:04:56,550
now there's a neurosurgery component
there

7262
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:56,560
there
 

7263
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,390
there
we have to connect

7264
02:04:58,390 --> 02:04:58,400
we have to connect
 

7265
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:01,830
we have to connect
electrical systems

7266
02:05:01,830 --> 02:05:01,840

 

7267
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:04,310

with biological systems

7268
02:05:04,310 --> 02:05:04,320
with biological systems
 

7269
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:07,109
with biological systems
so just even the implanting is is

7270
02:05:07,109 --> 02:05:07,119
so just even the implanting is is
 

7271
02:05:07,119 --> 02:05:08,550
so just even the implanting is is
difficult

7272
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:08,560
difficult
 

7273
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:11,109
difficult
um then the communication is difficult

7274
02:05:11,109 --> 02:05:11,119
um then the communication is difficult
 

7275
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:12,629
um then the communication is difficult
what would you say from what you know

7276
02:05:12,629 --> 02:05:12,639
what would you say from what you know
 

7277
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:14,310
what would you say from what you know
about the brain what you know about the

7278
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:14,320
about the brain what you know about the
 

7279
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,629
about the brain what you know about the
human body and all the

7280

7283
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,390
the beautiful mess that's there how
difficult is the effort of neural link

7284
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:20,400
difficult is the effort of neural link
 

7285
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,390
difficult is the effort of neural link
do you think it's feasible

7286
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:22,400
do you think it's feasible
 

7287
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,870
do you think it's feasible
i think it's it's definitely feasible i

7288
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:24,880
i think it's it's definitely feasible i
 

7289
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,629
i think it's it's definitely feasible i
think there we need to probably know

7290
02:05:26,629 --> 02:05:26,639
think there we need to probably know
 

7291
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:29,350
think there we need to probably know
more than we do um and and know how to

7292
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:29,360
more than we do um and and know how to
 

7293
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:31,510
more than we do um and and know how to
connect it you know in all these ways i

7294
02:05:31,510 --> 02:05:31,520
connect it you know in all these ways i
 

7295
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,470
connect it you know in all these ways i
think some advances for instance

7296

and figure stuff out
 

7391
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:10,709

there's ethics

02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:29,750
there's ethics
and there's real human lives at stake

and there you can't quite experiment you
 

7413
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:35,270
and there you can't quite experiment you
have to have things that work and maybe

02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:35,280
have to have things that work and maybe

it is messy

7433
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:58,149
um
first of all that's humbling to think

7434
02:07:58,149 --> 02:07:58,159
first of all that's humbling to think
 

7435
02:07:58,159 --> 02:07:59,990
first of all that's humbling to think
about

7436
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:00,000
about
 

7437
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,229
about
like we don't know what we're doing

7438
02:08:02,229 --> 02:08:02,239
like we don't know what we're doing
 

7439
02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:04,390
like we don't know what we're doing
in the great like there's been so much

7440
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:04,400
in the great like there's been so much
 

7441
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,830
in the great like there's been so much
progress

7442

progress
 

7443
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,510
progress
that we kind of have this confidence

7444
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:07,520
that we kind of have this confidence
 

7445
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:09,350
that we kind of have this confidence
that we figured it all out

7446
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:09,360
that we figured it all out
 

7447
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,669
that we figured it all out
if you look at history and you read how

7448
02:08:11,669 --> 02:08:11,679
if you look at history and you read how
 

7449
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:12,870
if you look at history and you read how
people thought

7450
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:12,880
people thought
 

7451
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,229
people thought
i mean there's so many moments in

7452
02:08:14,229 --> 02:08:14,239
i mean there's so many moments in
 

7453
02:08:14,239 --> 02:08:16,069
i mean there's so many moments in
history where people

7454
02:08:16,069 --> 02:08:16,079
history where people
 

7455
02:08:16,079 --> 02:08:17,750
history where people
really thought that they figured it all

7456
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:17,760
really thought that they figured it all
 

7457
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:19,830
really thought that they figured it all
out it's almost like there's nothing

7458
02:08:19,830 --> 02:08:19,840
out it's almost like there's nothing
 

7459
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:21,430
out it's almost like there's nothing
else left to do

7460
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:21,440
else left to do
 

7461
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:23,750
else left to do
at every stage in history

7462
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:23,760
at every stage in history
 

7463
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:26,310
at every stage in history
and uh and then you realize no progress

7464
02:08:26,310 --> 02:08:26,320
and uh and then you realize no progress
 

7465
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:28,149
and uh and then you realize no progress
often happens

7466
02:08:28,149 --> 02:08:28,159
often happens
 

7467
02:08:28,159 --> 02:08:29,990
often happens
like exponentially

7468
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:30,000
like exponentially
 

7469
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,990
like exponentially
and every moment you continue to think

7470
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:32,000
and every moment you continue to think
 

7471
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,589
and every moment you continue to think
you figured it all out

7472
02:08:33,589 --> 02:08:33,599
you figured it all out
 

7473
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:36,310
you figured it all out
but if you're being honest if you're

7474
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:36,320
but if you're being honest if you're
 

7475
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:38,310
but if you're being honest if you're
being humble then you realize we're just

7476
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:38,320
being humble then you realize we're just
 

7477
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,550
being humble then you realize we're just
shrouded in mystery so what do we make

7478
02:08:40,550 --> 02:08:40,560
shrouded in mystery so what do we make
 

7479
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:42,870
shrouded in mystery so what do we make
of this like how should we feel that how

7480
02:08:42,870 --> 02:08:42,880
of this like how should we feel that how
 

7481
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:45,270
of this like how should we feel that how
should you feel as a doctor how should

7482
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:45,280
should you feel as a doctor how should
 

7483
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:46,470
should you feel as a doctor how should
we feel

7484
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:46,480
we feel
 

7485
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:48,870
we feel
as scientific explorers

7486
02:08:48,870 --> 02:08:48,880
as scientific explorers
 

7487
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:50,790
as scientific explorers
of the human body the fact that we're

7488
02:08:50,790 --> 02:08:50,800
of the human body the fact that we're
 

7489
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,310
of the human body the fact that we're
probably going to be wrong about

7490
02:08:52,310 --> 02:08:52,320
probably going to be wrong about
 

7491
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:54,550
probably going to be wrong about
everything we currently know

7492
02:08:54,550 --> 02:08:54,560
everything we currently know
 

7493
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:56,470
everything we currently know
right there's a saying actually

7494
02:08:56,470 --> 02:08:56,480
right there's a saying actually
 

7495
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:58,149
right there's a saying actually
by the time you finish med school half

7496
02:08:58,149 --> 02:08:58,159
by the time you finish med school half
 

7497
02:08:58,159 --> 02:08:59,990
by the time you finish med school half
of what you learned is wrong

7498
02:08:59,990 --> 02:09:00,000
of what you learned is wrong
 

7499
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,430
of what you learned is wrong
um which is

7500
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,440
um which is
 

7501
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,430
um which is
quite illustrative and

7502
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:03,440
quite illustrative and
 

7503
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,430
quite illustrative and
becoming more true as time goes on you

7504
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:05,440
becoming more true as time goes on you
 

7505
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:07,189
becoming more true as time goes on you
know so much medical research going on

7506
02:09:07,189 --> 02:09:07,199
know so much medical research going on
 

7507
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:08,950
know so much medical research going on
so much learning going on is really

7508
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:08,960
so much learning going on is really
 

7509
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,629
so much learning going on is really
wonderful in a way

7510
02:09:10,629 --> 02:09:10,639
wonderful in a way
 

7511
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:12,550
wonderful in a way
but in some ways we still learn these

7512
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:12,560
but in some ways we still learn these
 

7513
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:14,790
but in some ways we still learn these
concepts you know from the past and i

7514
02:09:14,790 --> 02:09:14,800
concepts you know from the past and i
 

7515
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:17,189
concepts you know from the past and i
know when you take a test as a medical

7516
02:09:17,189 --> 02:09:17,199
know when you take a test as a medical
 

7517
02:09:17,199 --> 02:09:18,790
know when you take a test as a medical
student sometimes

7518
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:18,800
student sometimes
 

7519
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,709
student sometimes
you know they want to ask you they want

7520
02:09:20,709 --> 02:09:20,719
you know they want to ask you they want
 

7521
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:22,390
you know they want to ask you they want
you to give the old answer but you know

7522
02:09:22,390 --> 02:09:22,400
you to give the old answer but you know
 

7523
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:23,830
you to give the old answer but you know
there's a new answer because of recent

7524
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:23,840
there's a new answer because of recent
 

7525
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,350
there's a new answer because of recent
science but you know to give the old

7526
02:09:25,350 --> 02:09:25,360
science but you know to give the old
 

7527
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:27,270
science but you know to give the old
answer that's now incorrect to get the

7528
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:27,280
answer that's now incorrect to get the
 

7529
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:28,870
answer that's now incorrect to get the
question right on the test that happens

7530
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:28,880
question right on the test that happens
 

7531
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:30,790
question right on the test that happens
actually quite a bit because things

7532
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:30,800
actually quite a bit because things
 

7533
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,470
actually quite a bit because things
change so quickly

7534
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:32,480
change so quickly
 

7535
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:34,790
change so quickly
um yeah you know when i look back at

7536
02:09:34,790 --> 02:09:34,800
um yeah you know when i look back at
 

7537
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:37,270
um yeah you know when i look back at
doctors from centuries past i mean it's

7538
02:09:37,270 --> 02:09:37,280
doctors from centuries past i mean it's
 

7539
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,950
doctors from centuries past i mean it's
absurd what they were doing to their

7540
02:09:38,950 --> 02:09:38,960
absurd what they were doing to their
 

7541
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:40,550
absurd what they were doing to their
patients i mean for probably for most of

7542
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:40,560
patients i mean for probably for most of
 

7543
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,470
patients i mean for probably for most of
human history they were doing more harm

7544
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:42,480
human history they were doing more harm
 

7545
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:43,990
human history they were doing more harm
than good you know they're draining

7546
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:44,000
than good you know they're draining
 

7547
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,709
than good you know they're draining
people of their blood uh that was you

7548
02:09:46,709 --> 02:09:46,719
people of their blood uh that was you
 

7549
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:48,950
people of their blood uh that was you
know bloodletting was a huge part of

7550
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:48,960
know bloodletting was a huge part of
 

7551
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,870
know bloodletting was a huge part of
of medical care

7552
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:50,880
of medical care
 

7553
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:52,390
of medical care
you know um

7554
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:52,400
you know um
 

7555
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:53,910
you know um
george washington died of a

george washington died of a
peritonsillar abscess an abscess right

peritonsillar abscess an abscess right
 

7559
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:57,750
peritonsillar abscess an abscess right
next to the tonsil which has the great

7563
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:01,830
name of quincy and they bled him to
death you know i mean kind of adding

7564
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:01,840
death you know i mean kind of adding
 

7565
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:04,149
death you know i mean kind of adding
insult to injuries doctors are menace

7566
02:10:04,149 --> 02:10:04,159
insult to injuries doctors are menace
 

7567
02:10:04,159 --> 02:10:06,470
insult to injuries doctors are menace
and do a lot of harm i mean hopefully

7568
02:10:06,470 --> 02:10:06,480
and do a lot of harm i mean hopefully
 

7569
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:08,229
and do a lot of harm i mean hopefully
not intentionally you know even medical

7570
02:10:08,229 --> 02:10:08,239
not intentionally you know even medical
 

7571
02:10:08,239 --> 02:10:11,109
not intentionally you know even medical
errors are still a huge problem cause of

7572
02:10:11,109 --> 02:10:11,119
errors are still a huge problem cause of
 

7573
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:13,589
errors are still a huge problem cause of
death and morbidity

7574
02:10:13,589 --> 02:10:13,599
death and morbidity
 

7575
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:15,669
death and morbidity
so we do a lot of things that are not

7576
02:10:15,669 --> 02:10:15,679
so we do a lot of things that are not
 

7577
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:17,669
so we do a lot of things that are not
great but you know our knowledge yeah

7578
02:10:17,669 --> 02:10:17,679
great but you know our knowledge yeah
 

7579
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:19,669
great but you know our knowledge yeah
it's it's very imperfect at this point i

7580
02:10:19,669 --> 02:10:19,679
it's it's very imperfect at this point i
 

7581
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:22,550
it's it's very imperfect at this point i
do have some confidence you know i guess

7582
02:10:22,550 --> 02:10:22,560
do have some confidence you know i guess
 

7583
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:25,430
do have some confidence you know i guess
perfect scientific studies that try to

7584
02:10:25,430 --> 02:10:25,440
perfect scientific studies that try to
 

7585

essential because when i think
 

7589
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:33,430
essential because when i think

02:10:41,199 --> 02:10:42,470

the patient they got better and that's

7600
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:42,480
the patient they got better and that's
 

7601
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:44,790
the patient they got better and that's
happened 20 times in the last year

7602
02:10:44,790 --> 02:10:44,800
happened 20 times in the last year
 

7603
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,950
happened 20 times in the last year
but it's you know i'm wrong like when

7604
02:10:46,950 --> 02:10:46,960
but it's you know i'm wrong like when
 

7605
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,709
but it's you know i'm wrong like when
you actually do a study it actually

7606
02:10:48,709 --> 02:10:48,719
you actually do a study it actually
 

7607
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:50,550
you actually do a study it actually
doesn't help maybe it hurts

7608
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:50,560
doesn't help maybe it hurts
 

7609
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:53,430
doesn't help maybe it hurts
um and that's really i think the way we

7610
02:10:53,430 --> 02:10:53,440
um and that's really i think the way we
 

7611
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:54,550
um and that's really i think the way we
explain

7612
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:54,560
explain
 

7613
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,109
explain
medications working in our minds is

often wrong when you end up finally

7616
02:10:58,950 --> 02:10:58,960
often wrong when you end up finally

02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:00,320
doing the
 

7619
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,830
doing the
the study and some of the most

7620
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:01,840
the study and some of the most
 

7621
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,310
the study and some of the most
interesting experiments um involve what

7622
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:04,320
interesting experiments um involve what
 

7623
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:06,629
interesting experiments um involve what
we call sham surgery so for instance

7624
02:11:06,629 --> 02:11:06,639
we call sham surgery so for instance
 

7625
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:08,629
we call sham surgery so for instance
people who injure their knee you know

7626
02:11:08,629 --> 02:11:08,639
people who injure their knee you know
 

7627
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:10,629
people who injure their knee you know
arthroscopy where an orthopedic surgeon

7628
02:11:10,629 --> 02:11:10,639
arthroscopy where an orthopedic surgeon
 

7629
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:12,470
arthroscopy where an orthopedic surgeon
goes in there with a scope

7630
02:11:12,470 --> 02:11:12,480
goes in there with a scope
 

7631
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:14,470
goes in there with a scope
gets bits of bone out shaves down the

02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:14,480
gets bits of bone out shaves down the
 

7633
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:17,030
gets bits of bone out shaves down the
cartilage you know cleans things up and

7634
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:17,040
cartilage you know cleans things up and
 

7635
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:18,709
cartilage you know cleans things up and
it helps some people but they they

7636
02:11:18,709 --> 02:11:18,719
it helps some people but they they
 

7637
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,870
it helps some people but they they
actually did some studies where one

7638
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:20,880
actually did some studies where one
 

7639
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:22,550
actually did some studies where one
group of people got the true arthroscopy

7640
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:22,560
group of people got the true arthroscopy
 

7641
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,629
group of people got the true arthroscopy
and others just got sham surgery where

7642
02:11:24,629 --> 02:11:24,639
and others just got sham surgery where
 

7643
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:26,709
and others just got sham surgery where
they put them to sleep made little cuts

7644
02:11:26,709 --> 02:11:26,719
they put them to sleep made little cuts
 

7645
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:29,750
they put them to sleep made little cuts
in the skin so they woke up with scars

7646
02:11:29,750 --> 02:11:29,760
in the skin so they woke up with scars
 

7647
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:31,350
in the skin so they woke up with scars
and then it turned out that it's not

7648
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:31,360
and then it turned out that it's not
 

7649
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:33,669
and then it turned out that it's not
clear arthroscopy's actually helping

7650
02:11:33,669 --> 02:11:33,679
clear arthroscopy's actually helping
 

7651
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:35,750
clear arthroscopy's actually helping
and the same there was a recent

7652
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:35,760
and the same there was a recent
 

7653
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:36,709
and the same there was a recent
huge

7654
02:11:36,709 --> 02:11:36,719
huge
 

7655
02:11:36,719 --> 02:11:39,189
huge
study of doing putting a stent in

7656
02:11:39,189 --> 02:11:39,199
study of doing putting a stent in
 

7657
02:11:39,199 --> 02:11:40,870
study of doing putting a stent in
someone's coronary arteries if they have

7658
02:11:40,870 --> 02:11:40,880
someone's coronary arteries if they have
 

7659
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:42,629
someone's coronary arteries if they have
stable chest pain not like i'm having a

7660
02:11:42,629 --> 02:11:42,639
stable chest pain not like i'm having a
 

7661
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:44,229
stable chest pain not like i'm having a
heart attack you need a stent like right

7662
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:44,239
heart attack you need a stent like right
 

7663
02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:46,790
heart attack you need a stent like right
then but you know kind of chronic

7664
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:46,800
then but you know kind of chronic
 

7665
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,470
then but you know kind of chronic
coronary artery disease where every time

7666
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:48,480
coronary artery disease where every time
 

7667
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:49,990
coronary artery disease where every time
i run up the stairs i get chest pain and

7668
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,000
i run up the stairs i get chest pain and
 

7669
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,470
i run up the stairs i get chest pain and
then when i rest it goes away

7670
02:11:52,470 --> 02:11:52,480
then when i rest it goes away
 

7671
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:54,709
then when i rest it goes away
like obviously you put a stent you

7672
02:11:54,709 --> 02:11:54,719
like obviously you put a stent you
 

7673
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:56,310
like obviously you put a stent you
increase blood flow to the heart like

7674
02:11:56,310 --> 02:11:56,320
increase blood flow to the heart like
 

7675
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:57,830
increase blood flow to the heart like
how could that not work but then when

7676
02:11:57,830 --> 02:11:57,840
how could that not work but then when
 

7677
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:00,390
how could that not work but then when
they did the sham catheterization it

7678
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:00,400
they did the sham catheterization it
 

7679
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,510
they did the sham catheterization it
actually looks like it might not

7680
02:12:01,510 --> 02:12:01,520
actually looks like it might not
 

7681
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:02,470
actually looks like it might not
actually

7682
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:02,480
actually
 

7683
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,550
actually
help better than the sham

7684
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:04,560
help better than the sham
 

7685
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,310
help better than the sham
so i think those placebo-controlled

7686
02:12:06,310 --> 02:12:06,320
so i think those placebo-controlled
 

7687
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:08,310
so i think those placebo-controlled
studies are essential i mean it is

7688
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:08,320
studies are essential i mean it is
 

7689
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,229
studies are essential i mean it is
shocking and this has been driven home

7690
02:12:10,229 --> 02:12:10,239
shocking and this has been driven home
 

7691
02:12:10,239 --> 02:12:11,990
shocking and this has been driven home
during the last two years

7692
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:12,000
during the last two years
 

7693
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,510
during the last two years
how hard it is to figure out what the

7694
02:12:13,510 --> 02:12:13,520
how hard it is to figure out what the
 

7695
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:15,109
how hard it is to figure out what the
hell's going on in the universe and with

7696
02:12:15,109 --> 02:12:15,119
hell's going on in the universe and with
 

7697
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:17,189
hell's going on in the universe and with
especially with our bodies like it is

7698

02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:24,960
medicine is littered with examples where
 

7707
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,550
medicine is littered with examples where
it made perfect sense and it seemed to

7708
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:26,560
it made perfect sense and it seemed to
 

7709
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:28,950
it made perfect sense and it seemed to
help some patients and it turns out

centralized communities
 

7729
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:46,950

sometimes the scientific community
 

7739
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:54,629
sometimes the scientific community
writes sometimes the conspiracy theories

uh theorists are right throughout human

7742
02:12:56,709 --> 02:12:56,719
uh theorists are right throughout human

history i mean and we now think the

7744
02:12:59,350 --> 02:12:59,360
history i mean and we now think the
 

7745
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:01,109
history i mean and we now think the
scientific community well now the

7746
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
scientific community well now the
 

7747
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:02,790
scientific community well now the
science has really figured it out we're

7748
02:13:02,790 --> 02:13:02,800
science has really figured it out we're
 

7749
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:04,709
science has really figured it out we're
way smarter than we were in the past and

7750
02:13:04,709 --> 02:13:04,719
way smarter than we were in the past and
 

7751
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:06,069
way smarter than we were in the past and
then there's these like interesting

7752
02:13:06,069 --> 02:13:06,079
then there's these like interesting
 

7753
02:13:06,079 --> 02:13:08,069
then there's these like interesting
studies

7754

medication
 

7763
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:18,550

medication
and there that's a very kind of uh

7788
02:13:45,189 --> 02:13:45,199
and there that's a very kind of uh
 

7789
02:13:45,199 --> 02:13:47,430
and there that's a very kind of uh
interesting perspective that means

7790
02:13:47,430 --> 02:13:47,440
interesting perspective that means
 

7791
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:50,310
interesting perspective that means
you could probably argue uh

7792
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:50,320
you could probably argue uh
 

7793
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:53,109
you could probably argue uh
you know a lot of ways but the point is

7794
02:13:53,109 --> 02:13:53,119
you know a lot of ways but the point is
 

7795
02:13:53,119 --> 02:13:56,790
you know a lot of ways but the point is
uh because you can bring up

7796
02:13:56,790 --> 02:13:56,800
uh because you can bring up
 

7797
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,310
uh because you can bring up
literally a billion cases where

7798
02:13:58,310 --> 02:13:58,320
literally a billion cases where
 

7799
02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:00,069
literally a billion cases where
medication has significant positive

7800
02:14:00,069 --> 02:14:00,079
medication has significant positive
 

7801
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:01,990
medication has significant positive
impact on a particular patient but you

7802
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:02,000
impact on a particular patient but you
 

7803
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,830
impact on a particular patient but you
have to kind of zoom out

7804
02:14:03,830 --> 02:14:03,840
have to kind of zoom out
 

7805
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:05,910
have to kind of zoom out
and honestly look at the positive

7806
02:14:05,910 --> 02:14:05,920
and honestly look at the positive
 

7807
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:07,430
and honestly look at the positive
effects of medicine

7808
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:07,440
effects of medicine
 

7809
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:10,310
effects of medicine
um of lifestyle choices diet choices of

7810
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:10,320
um of lifestyle choices diet choices of
 

7811
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:12,870
um of lifestyle choices diet choices of
uh exercise or not you know maybe we'll

7812
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:12,880
uh exercise or not you know maybe we'll
 

7813
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,550
uh exercise or not you know maybe we'll
find a venture that exercise is actually

7814
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:14,560
find a venture that exercise is actually
 

7815
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:16,790
find a venture that exercise is actually
bad for you

7816
02:14:16,790 --> 02:14:16,800
bad for you
 

7817
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:19,589
bad for you
but maybe like there there's all kinds

7818
02:14:19,589 --> 02:14:19,599
but maybe like there there's all kinds
 

7819
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:22,629
but maybe like there there's all kinds
of things that we're going to um

7820
02:14:22,629 --> 02:14:22,639
of things that we're going to um
 

7821
02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:24,069
of things that we're going to um
uh i feel like we're going to figure out

7822
02:14:24,069 --> 02:14:24,079
uh i feel like we're going to figure out
 

7823
02:14:24,079 --> 02:14:25,510
uh i feel like we're going to figure out
one of the things i think we're going to

02:14:25,510 --> 02:14:25,520
one of the things i think we're going to

02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:30,550
figure out
everything i've learned about my body

7828
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:30,560
everything i've learned about my body
 

7829
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:32,310
everything i've learned about my body
is that

aside from it being adaptable there's a
 

7833
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:37,109
aside from it being adaptable there's a
lot of very unique parameters

7834
02:14:37,109 --> 02:14:37,119
lot of very unique parameters
 

7835
02:14:37,119 --> 02:14:38,709
lot of very unique parameters
that are opaque to me

7836
02:14:38,709 --> 02:14:38,719
that are opaque to me
 

7837
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:40,550
that are opaque to me
that i'm measuring through this feedback

7838

about each individual human so like it's
 

7853
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:55,109
about each individual human so like it's
absurd

7854
02:14:55,109 --> 02:14:55,119
absurd
 

7855
02:14:55,119 --> 02:14:57,589
absurd
to be like if i show up

7856
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:57,599
to be like if i show up
 

7857
02:14:57,599 --> 02:14:58,470

uh
 

7859
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:00,149
uh
and see a doctor it's absurd for that

7860
02:15:00,149 --> 02:15:00,159

what they're doing and two
 

8679
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:12,710

suicide is incredibly common like in in
 

8681
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:14,630
suicide is incredibly common like in in
all humans in all societies and that i

all humans in all societies and that i
 

8683
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:16,790
all humans in all societies and that i
just find shocking i mean i've never

8684

just find shocking i mean i've never
 

8685
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:19,110
just find shocking i mean i've never
seriously contemplated myself but

8686
02:29:19,110 --> 02:29:19,120
seriously contemplated myself but
 

8687
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:20,790
seriously contemplated myself but
i wouldn't say it hasn't crossed my mind

8688
02:29:20,790 --> 02:29:20,800
i wouldn't say it hasn't crossed my mind
 

8689
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:23,830
i wouldn't say it hasn't crossed my mind
during some more stressful um times of

8690
02:29:23,830 --> 02:29:23,840
during some more stressful um times of
 

8691
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:24,870
during some more stressful um times of
life

life
 

8693
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:25,830
life
um

8694
02:29:25,830 --> 02:29:25,840
um
 

8695
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,670
um
i think it crosses everyone's mind and

8696
02:29:27,670 --> 02:29:27,680
i think it crosses everyone's mind and
 

8697
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:30,230
i think it crosses everyone's mind and
sort of as a kid i found that i never

8698
02:29:30,230 --> 02:29:30,240
sort of as a kid i found that i never
 

8699
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:32,710
sort of as a kid i found that i never
would have guessed how common suicide is

8700
02:29:32,710 --> 02:29:32,720
would have guessed how common suicide is
 

8701
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:35,270
would have guessed how common suicide is
it's an important question to

8702
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:35,280
it's an important question to
 

8703
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:37,910
it's an important question to
sort of the uh the camus question like

8704
02:29:37,910 --> 02:29:37,920
sort of the uh the camus question like
 

8705
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:40,309
sort of the uh the camus question like
why live

8706
02:29:40,309 --> 02:29:40,319
why live
 

8707
02:29:40,319 --> 02:29:41,670
why live
why

8708
02:29:41,670 --> 02:29:41,680
why
 

8709
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:42,630
why
why

8710
02:29:42,630 --> 02:29:42,640
why
 

8711
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:44,469
why
because like life especially when you're

8712
02:29:44,469 --> 02:29:44,479
because like life especially when you're
 

8713
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:45,990
because like life especially when you're
struggling

8714
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:46,000
struggling
 

8715
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,630
struggling
especially when life is

8716
02:29:48,630 --> 02:29:48,640
especially when life is
 

8717
02:29:48,640 --> 02:29:51,190
especially when life is
like why am i doing any of this

8718
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:51,200
like why am i doing any of this
 

8719
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:53,349
like why am i doing any of this
and then on top of that chemistry of

8720
02:29:53,349 --> 02:29:53,359
and then on top of that chemistry of
 

8721
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:55,270
and then on top of that chemistry of
your brain

8722
02:29:55,270 --> 02:29:55,280
your brain
 

8723
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:57,670
your brain
it could be as simple as diet and

8724
02:29:57,670 --> 02:29:57,680
it could be as simple as diet and
 

8725
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:59,510
it could be as simple as diet and
nutrition and

8726
02:29:59,510 --> 02:29:59,520
nutrition and
 

8727
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:01,590
nutrition and
aforementioned exercise and things like

8728
02:30:01,590 --> 02:30:01,600
aforementioned exercise and things like
 

8729
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:04,469
aforementioned exercise and things like
this that affect the chemistry such that

8730
02:30:04,469 --> 02:30:04,479
this that affect the chemistry such that
 

8731
02:30:04,479 --> 02:30:06,630
this that affect the chemistry such that
you're more predisposed to go to the

8732
02:30:06,630 --> 02:30:06,640
you're more predisposed to go to the
 

8733
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:07,750
you're more predisposed to go to the
places

8734
02:30:07,750 --> 02:30:07,760
places
 

8735
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:09,750
places
of asking the question why

8736
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:09,760
of asking the question why
 

8737
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:12,950
of asking the question why
and maybe um struggling to find a good

8738
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:12,960
and maybe um struggling to find a good
 

8739
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:14,309
and maybe um struggling to find a good
answer

8740
02:30:14,309 --> 02:30:14,319
answer
 

8741
02:30:14,319 --> 02:30:16,309
answer
because it's actually a question with no

8742
02:30:16,309 --> 02:30:16,319
because it's actually a question with no
 

8743
02:30:16,319 --> 02:30:19,750
because it's actually a question with no
good answer except

8744
02:30:19,750 --> 02:30:19,760
good answer except
 

8745
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:21,670
good answer except
something in your chemistry says well i

8746
02:30:21,670 --> 02:30:21,680
something in your chemistry says well i
 

8747
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:23,190
something in your chemistry says well i
kind of like it

8748
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:23,200
kind of like it
 

8749
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:25,990
kind of like it
but there's no good intellectual answer

8750
02:30:25,990 --> 02:30:26,000
but there's no good intellectual answer
 

8751
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,750
but there's no good intellectual answer
and especially if day to day it's pain

8752
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:29,760
and especially if day to day it's pain
 

8753
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:32,070
and especially if day to day it's pain
you get to see these stories of um you

8754
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:32,080
you get to see these stories of um you
 

8755
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:34,389
you get to see these stories of um you
know robin williams

8756
02:30:34,389 --> 02:30:34,399
know robin williams
 

8757
02:30:34,399 --> 02:30:35,910
know robin williams
these people that are on top of the

8758
02:30:35,910 --> 02:30:35,920
these people that are on top of the
 

8759
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:39,670
these people that are on top of the
world from an external perspective but

8760
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:39,680
world from an external perspective but
 

8761
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:41,830
world from an external perspective but
from an internal perspective

8762
02:30:41,830 --> 02:30:41,840
from an internal perspective
 

8763
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:44,870
from an internal perspective
it's struggle every day is pain

8764
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:44,880
it's struggle every day is pain
 

8765
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:48,790
it's struggle every day is pain
it feels hopeless and

8766
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:48,800

 

8767
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:50,550

yeah that's a that's a question we all

8768
02:30:50,550 --> 02:30:50,560
yeah that's a that's a question we all
 

8769
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:52,389
yeah that's a that's a question we all
have to struggle with or learn how to

8770
02:30:52,389 --> 02:30:52,399
have to struggle with or learn how to
 

8771
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:54,710
have to struggle with or learn how to
ignore maybe because if you ask the

8772
02:30:54,710 --> 02:30:54,720
ignore maybe because if you ask the
 

8773
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:56,710
ignore maybe because if you ask the
question too much you're not gonna

8774
02:30:56,710 --> 02:30:56,720
question too much you're not gonna
 

8775
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:58,950
question too much you're not gonna
you're not going to find a good answer

8776
02:30:58,950 --> 02:30:58,960
you're not going to find a good answer
 

8777
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:00,790
you're not going to find a good answer
that's a choice you make i personally

8778
02:31:00,790 --> 02:31:00,800
that's a choice you make i personally
 

8779
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:03,910
that's a choice you make i personally
think you should ask that question a lot

8780
02:31:03,910 --> 02:31:03,920
think you should ask that question a lot
 

8781
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:05,670
think you should ask that question a lot
um

8782
02:31:05,670 --> 02:31:05,680
um
 

8783
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:07,590
um
but maybe because i have the luxury of

8784
02:31:07,590 --> 02:31:07,600
but maybe because i have the luxury of
 

8785
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:09,510
but maybe because i have the luxury of
the chemistry i have where i'm not in

8786
02:31:09,510 --> 02:31:09,520
the chemistry i have where i'm not in
 

8787
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:11,030
the chemistry i have where i'm not in
danger

8788
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:11,040
danger
 

8789
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:14,230
danger
of uh seriously contemplating suicide

8790
02:31:14,230 --> 02:31:14,240
of uh seriously contemplating suicide
 

8791
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:16,870
of uh seriously contemplating suicide
but why liv is an important question to

8792
02:31:16,870 --> 02:31:16,880
but why liv is an important question to
 

8793
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:18,790
but why liv is an important question to
answer constantly and struggle to answer

8794
02:31:18,790 --> 02:31:18,800
answer constantly and struggle to answer
 

8795
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:21,590
answer constantly and struggle to answer
that constantly

8796
02:31:21,590 --> 02:31:21,600

 

8797
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,750

but people i am uh i've gotten uh i've

8798
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:23,760
but people i am uh i've gotten uh i've
 

8799
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,830
but people i am uh i've gotten uh i've
been extremely fortunate

8800
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:25,840
been extremely fortunate
 

8801
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:27,910
been extremely fortunate
to meet people

8802
02:31:27,910 --> 02:31:27,920
to meet people
 

8803
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:29,590
to meet people
over the past couple of years that are

8804
02:31:29,590 --> 02:31:29,600
over the past couple of years that are
 

8805
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:31,670
over the past couple of years that are
really struggling

8806
02:31:31,670 --> 02:31:31,680
really struggling
 

8807
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:35,510
really struggling
and

8808
02:31:35,510 --> 02:31:35,520

 

8809
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:38,790

you have probably met

8810
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:38,800
you have probably met
 

8811
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:40,950
you have probably met
people who are really struggling

8812
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:40,960
people who are really struggling
 

8813
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,190
people who are really struggling
like orders of magnitude more people who

8814
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:43,200
like orders of magnitude more people who
 

8815
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:45,110
like orders of magnitude more people who
are really struggling

8816
02:31:45,110 --> 02:31:45,120
are really struggling
 

8817
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:47,270
are really struggling
some of it is psychological a lot of it

8818
02:31:47,270 --> 02:31:47,280
some of it is psychological a lot of it
 

8819
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,349

02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,670
i think
you know i think having kids changes the

8980
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:43,680
you know i think having kids changes the
 

8981
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:45,510
you know i think having kids changes the
equation for sure

8982
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:45,520
equation for sure
 

8983
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:46,790
equation for sure
um

8984
02:34:46,790 --> 02:34:46,800
um
 

8985
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,870
um
should change the equation perhaps so i

8986
02:34:48,870 --> 02:34:48,880
should change the equation perhaps so i
 

8987
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:50,550
should change the equation perhaps so i
think a lot of

8988
02:34:50,550 --> 02:34:50,560
think a lot of
 

8989
02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:52,389
think a lot of
now when i think about what will happen

8990
02:34:52,389 --> 02:34:52,399
now when i think about what will happen
 

8991
02:34:52,399 --> 02:34:55,270
now when i think about what will happen
when i die you know there's a lot of um

8992
02:34:55,270 --> 02:34:55,280
when i die you know there's a lot of um
 

8993
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:57,110
when i die you know there's a lot of um
worrying about what will happen to the

8994
02:34:57,110 --> 02:34:57,120
worrying about what will happen to the
 

8995
02:34:57,120 --> 02:34:59,030
worrying about what will happen to the
people i care for you know you think

8996
02:34:59,030 --> 02:34:59,040
people i care for you know you think
 

8997
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:00,870
people i care for you know you think
about things like insurance policies

8998
02:35:00,870 --> 02:35:00,880
about things like insurance policies
 

8999
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:03,910
about things like insurance policies
like life insurance and you know yes

9000
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:03,920
like life insurance and you know yes
 

9001
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:05,510
like life insurance and you know yes
disability insurance that's not related

9002
02:35:05,510 --> 02:35:05,520
disability insurance that's not related
 

9003
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:08,309
disability insurance that's not related
to death but more just injuries and

9004
02:35:08,309 --> 02:35:08,319
to death but more just injuries and
 

9005
02:35:08,319 --> 02:35:10,230
to death but more just injuries and
that's part of the weight i guess that

9006
02:35:10,230 --> 02:35:10,240
that's part of the weight i guess that
 

9007
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:13,429
that's part of the weight i guess that
um you know you feel as an adult um that

9008
02:35:13,429 --> 02:35:13,439
um you know you feel as an adult um that
 

9009
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:16,309
um you know you feel as an adult um that
i think grows rapidly when you have kids

9010
02:35:16,309 --> 02:35:16,319
i think grows rapidly when you have kids
 

9011
02:35:16,319 --> 02:35:17,990
i think grows rapidly when you have kids
though not only you know there's other

9012
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:18,000
though not only you know there's other
 

9013
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,910
though not only you know there's other
people you can care for your own parents

9014
02:35:19,910 --> 02:35:19,920
people you can care for your own parents
 

9015
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:21,590
people you can care for your own parents
and loved ones like a lot of people

9016
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:21,600
and loved ones like a lot of people
 

9017
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:22,870
and loved ones like a lot of people
depend on

9018
02:35:22,870 --> 02:35:22,880
depend on
 

9019
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:24,710
depend on
individuals and so you think about what

9020
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:24,720
individuals and so you think about what
 

9021
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:26,230
individuals and so you think about what
will happen to the other people when you

9022
02:35:26,230 --> 02:35:26,240
will happen to the other people when you
 

9023
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:27,590
will happen to the other people when you
die

9024
02:35:27,590 --> 02:35:27,600
die
 

9025
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:28,790
die
but also

9026
02:35:28,790 --> 02:35:28,800
but also
 

9027
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:30,309
but also
to push back

9028
02:35:30,309 --> 02:35:30,319
to push back
 

9029
02:35:30,319 --> 02:35:31,670
to push back
that weight

9030
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:31,680
that weight
 

9031
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:33,030
that weight
might be something

9032
02:35:33,030 --> 02:35:33,040
might be something
 

9033
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:35,510
might be something
you've convinced yourself to think about

9034
02:35:35,510 --> 02:35:35,520
you've convinced yourself to think about
 

9035
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:37,590
you've convinced yourself to think about
it's an important way to think about

9036
02:35:37,590 --> 02:35:37,600
it's an important way to think about
 

9037
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,590
it's an important way to think about
but you focus on that way

9038
02:35:39,590 --> 02:35:39,600
but you focus on that way
 

9039
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:42,150
but you focus on that way
to escape the other

9040
02:35:42,150 --> 02:35:42,160
to escape the other
 

9041
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:43,190
to escape the other
weight

9042
02:35:43,190 --> 02:35:43,200
weight
 

9043
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:45,349
weight
which is

9044
02:35:45,349 --> 02:35:45,359
which is
 

9045
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:46,230
which is
that's

9046
02:35:46,230 --> 02:35:46,240
that's
 

9047
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:48,389
that's
one point

9048
02:35:48,389 --> 02:35:48,399
one point
 

9049
02:35:48,399 --> 02:35:51,429
one point
this consciousness just comes to an end

9050
02:35:51,429 --> 02:35:51,439
this consciousness just comes to an end
 

9051
02:35:51,439 --> 02:35:53,349
this consciousness just comes to an end
and it's hard to make sense of

9052
02:35:53,349 --> 02:35:53,359
and it's hard to make sense of
 

9053
02:35:53,359 --> 02:35:54,550
and it's hard to make sense of
of that

9054
02:35:54,550 --> 02:35:54,560
of that
 

9055
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:56,309
of that
we kind of delude ourselves and thinking

9056
02:35:56,309 --> 02:35:56,319
we kind of delude ourselves and thinking
 

9057
02:35:56,319 --> 02:35:58,230
we kind of delude ourselves and thinking
okay it just yeah it's ends that's the

9058
02:35:58,230 --> 02:35:58,240
okay it just yeah it's ends that's the
 

9059
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:59,910
okay it just yeah it's ends that's the
natural way of things and so on that

9060
02:35:59,910 --> 02:35:59,920
natural way of things and so on that
 

9061
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:01,590
natural way of things and so on that
makes sound so we're good okay that's

9062
02:36:01,590 --> 02:36:01,600
makes sound so we're good okay that's
 

9063
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,910
makes sound so we're good okay that's
the way that's the way of life but like

9064
02:36:03,910 --> 02:36:03,920
the way that's the way of life but like
 

9065
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:06,950
the way that's the way of life but like
i don't think it's like cognitively

9066
02:36:06,950 --> 02:36:06,960
i don't think it's like cognitively
 

9067
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:10,309
i don't think it's like cognitively
easy to just realize how

9068
02:36:10,309 --> 02:36:10,319
easy to just realize how
 

9069
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:12,150
easy to just realize how
terrifying that is

9070
02:36:12,150 --> 02:36:12,160
terrifying that is
 

9071
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:15,110
terrifying that is
we we we love life so much

9072
02:36:15,110 --> 02:36:15,120
we we we love life so much
 

9073
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:16,790
we we we love life so much
that

9074
02:36:16,790 --> 02:36:16,800
that
 

9075
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:18,309
that
the end of it

9076
02:36:18,309 --> 02:36:18,319
the end of it
 

9077
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:22,070
the end of it
it just um

9078
02:36:22,070 --> 02:36:22,080

 

9079
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:24,630

it's something that makes no sense

9080
02:36:24,630 --> 02:36:24,640
it's something that makes no sense
 

9081
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:26,230
it's something that makes no sense
and if you linger on that thought i

9082
02:36:26,230 --> 02:36:26,240
and if you linger on that thought i
 

9083
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,070
and if you linger on that thought i
think it's a painful it's a it's a

9084
02:36:28,070 --> 02:36:28,080
think it's a painful it's a it's a
 

9085
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:30,469
think it's a painful it's a it's a
painful i would say even terrifying

9086
02:36:30,469 --> 02:36:30,479
painful i would say even terrifying
 

9087
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:31,349
painful i would say even terrifying
thought

9088
02:36:31,349 --> 02:36:31,359
thought
 

9089
02:36:31,359 --> 02:36:34,150
thought
not scared of like uh in a way that's

9090
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:34,160
not scared of like uh in a way that's
 

9091
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:36,469
not scared of like uh in a way that's
almost like philosophically terrifying

9092
02:36:36,469 --> 02:36:36,479
almost like philosophically terrifying
 

9093
02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:39,190
almost like philosophically terrifying
like it just reminds you maybe humbles

9094
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:39,200
like it just reminds you maybe humbles
 

9095
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:40,950
like it just reminds you maybe humbles
you that you don't know any of the

9096
02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:40,960
you that you don't know any of the
 

9097
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:44,230
you that you don't know any of the
anything about anything

9098
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:44,240

 

9099
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:46,070

but one of the things we do as humans

9100
02:36:46,070 --> 02:36:46,080
but one of the things we do as humans
 

9101
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:48,950
but one of the things we do as humans
really well is we uh especially with

9102
02:36:48,950 --> 02:36:48,960
really well is we uh especially with
 

9103
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:49,910
really well is we uh especially with
kids

9104
02:36:49,910 --> 02:36:49,920
kids
 

9105
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:52,070
kids
you realize okay we start caring for

9106
02:36:52,070 --> 02:36:52,080
you realize okay we start caring for
 

9107
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:53,990
you realize okay we start caring for
others in the community and the family

9108
02:36:53,990 --> 02:36:54,000
others in the community and the family
 

9109
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,150
others in the community and the family
and so on and that distracts us because

9110
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:56,160
and so on and that distracts us because
 

9111
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:57,590
and so on and that distracts us because
then we can at least focus on other

9112
02:36:57,590 --> 02:36:57,600
then we can at least focus on other
 

9113
02:36:57,600 --> 02:36:59,349
then we can at least focus on other
people's problems and not deal with our

9114
02:36:59,349 --> 02:36:59,359
people's problems and not deal with our
 

9115
02:36:59,359 --> 02:37:01,830
people's problems and not deal with our
own

9116
02:37:01,830 --> 02:37:01,840

 

9117
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:02,630

uh

9118
02:37:02,630 --> 02:37:02,640
uh
 

9119
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:04,389
uh
when i was a medical student i was

9120
02:37:04,389 --> 02:37:04,399
when i was a medical student i was
 

9121
02:37:04,399 --> 02:37:06,230
when i was a medical student i was
particularly fascinated with kind of

9122
02:37:06,230 --> 02:37:06,240
particularly fascinated with kind of
 

9123
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:08,550
particularly fascinated with kind of
what actually happens as people die like

9124
02:37:08,550 --> 02:37:08,560
what actually happens as people die like
 

9125
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:10,870
what actually happens as people die like
in the last minute seconds of life it's

9126
02:37:10,870 --> 02:37:10,880
in the last minute seconds of life it's
 

9127
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:12,710
in the last minute seconds of life it's
sort of surprising sometimes like what

9128
02:37:12,710 --> 02:37:12,720
sort of surprising sometimes like what
 

9129
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:14,790
sort of surprising sometimes like what
actually kills people you know like um

9130
02:37:14,790 --> 02:37:14,800
actually kills people you know like um
 

9131
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:16,550
actually kills people you know like um
you can get a let's say a bad head

9132
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:16,560
you can get a let's say a bad head
 

9133
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:18,790
you can get a let's say a bad head
injury and you know what kills you

9134
02:37:18,790 --> 02:37:18,800
injury and you know what kills you
 

9135
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:20,389
injury and you know what kills you
sometimes it's just

9136
02:37:20,389 --> 02:37:20,399
sometimes it's just
 

9137
02:37:20,399 --> 02:37:22,630
sometimes it's just
your consciousness decreases and you

9138
02:37:22,630 --> 02:37:22,640
your consciousness decreases and you
 

9139
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:23,750
your consciousness decreases and you
become

9140
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:23,760
become

02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:09,750
this the components the engineering
components they make up this human body

9304
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:09,760
components they make up this human body
 

9305
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:13,349
components they make up this human body
but when you look at the entirety of it

9306
02:40:13,349 --> 02:40:13,359
but when you look at the entirety of it
 

9307
02:40:13,359 --> 02:40:15,030
but when you look at the entirety of it
what is why

9308
02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:15,040
what is why
 

9309
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:17,190
what is why
why are we here sometimes probably more

9310
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:17,200
why are we here sometimes probably more
 

9311
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:19,190
why are we here sometimes probably more
often than not feel like the question of

9312
02:40:19,190 --> 02:40:19,200
often than not feel like the question of
 

9313
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:21,990
often than not feel like the question of
why is a trick of the human brain and

9314
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:22,000
why is a trick of the human brain and
 

9315
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,790
why is a trick of the human brain and
and outside of our thoughts there is no

9316
02:40:24,790 --> 02:40:24,800
and outside of our thoughts there is no
 

9317
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:25,670
and outside of our thoughts there is no
why

9318
02:40:25,670 --> 02:40:25,680
why
 

9319
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:27,429
why
why is not a something that's in the

9320
02:40:27,429 --> 02:40:27,439
why is not a something that's in the
 

9321
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:29,110
why is not a something that's in the
universe it's just this trick happening

9322
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:29,120
universe it's just this trick happening
 

9323
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:30,950
universe it's just this trick happening
inside our brain

9324
02:40:30,950 --> 02:40:30,960
inside our brain
 

9325
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:34,309
inside our brain
um so what why is a game that the human

9326
02:40:34,309 --> 02:40:34,319
um so what why is a game that the human
 

9327
02:40:34,319 --> 02:40:37,269
um so what why is a game that the human
brain plays on itself and then

9328
02:40:37,269 --> 02:40:37,279
brain plays on itself and then
 

9329
02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:39,269
brain plays on itself and then
the reality of

9330
02:40:39,269 --> 02:40:39,279
the reality of
 

9331
02:40:39,279 --> 02:40:41,990
the reality of
life doesn't have wise i do wonder if

9332
02:40:41,990 --> 02:40:42,000
life doesn't have wise i do wonder if
 

9333
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,150
life doesn't have wise i do wonder if
asking why is sort of an evolutionary

9334
02:40:44,150 --> 02:40:44,160
asking why is sort of an evolutionary
 

9335
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:46,630
asking why is sort of an evolutionary
adaptation like um

9336
02:40:46,630 --> 02:40:46,640
adaptation like um
 

9337
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:49,110
adaptation like um
why you know maybe hunting gathering why

9338
02:40:49,110 --> 02:40:49,120
why you know maybe hunting gathering why
 

9339
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:51,110
why you know maybe hunting gathering why
does this plant grow there and not there

9340
02:40:51,110 --> 02:40:51,120
does this plant grow there and not there
 

9341
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:53,510
does this plant grow there and not there
why do i see the same deer tracks and by

9342
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:53,520
why do i see the same deer tracks and by
 

9343
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:55,830
why do i see the same deer tracks and by
the same tree every three days what you

9344
02:40:55,830 --> 02:40:55,840
the same tree every three days what you
 

9345
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:58,230
the same tree every three days what you
know why is this why is that

9346
02:40:58,230 --> 02:40:58,240
know why is this why is that
 

9347
02:40:58,240 --> 02:40:59,510
know why is this why is that
um

9348
02:40:59,510 --> 02:40:59,520
um
 

9349
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:02,389
um
why does this plant uh make me vomit and

9350
02:41:02,389 --> 02:41:02,399
why does this plant uh make me vomit and
 

9351
02:41:02,399 --> 02:41:05,030
why does this plant uh make me vomit and
that plant doesn't i guess those y's are

9352
02:41:05,030 --> 02:41:05,040
that plant doesn't i guess those y's are
 

9353
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:06,950
that plant doesn't i guess those y's are
very practical and oriented towards

9354
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:06,960
very practical and oriented towards
 

9355
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,070
very practical and oriented towards
survival

9356
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:08,080
survival
 

9357
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:10,230
survival
but then obviously you know we

9358
02:41:10,230 --> 02:41:10,240
but then obviously you know we
 

9359
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:12,550
but then obviously you know we
not only use why you know we use it to

9360
02:41:12,550 --> 02:41:12,560
not only use why you know we use it to
 

9361
02:41:12,560 --> 02:41:14,790
not only use why you know we use it to
maybe hunt better gather better survive

9362
02:41:14,790 --> 02:41:14,800
maybe hunt better gather better survive
 

9363
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:16,710
maybe hunt better gather better survive
better but then we sort of extrapolated

9364
02:41:16,710 --> 02:41:16,720
better but then we sort of extrapolated
 

9365
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:17,910
better but then we sort of extrapolated
into these

9366
02:41:17,910 --> 02:41:17,920
into these
 

9367
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:20,550
into these
unanswerable questions you know

9368
02:41:20,550 --> 02:41:20,560
unanswerable questions you know
 

9369
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:23,750
unanswerable questions you know
um about why like why does life exist

9370
02:41:23,750 --> 02:41:23,760
um about why like why does life exist
 

9371
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:25,510
um about why like why does life exist
and it's possible that they're not

9372
02:41:25,510 --> 02:41:25,520
and it's possible that they're not
 

9373
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:28,550
and it's possible that they're not
unanswerable in the long arc of science

9374
02:41:28,550 --> 02:41:28,560
unanswerable in the long arc of science
 

9375
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:31,349
unanswerable in the long arc of science
and history it's we're just striving for

9376
02:41:31,349 --> 02:41:31,359
and history it's we're just striving for
 

9377
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:33,590
and history it's we're just striving for
the really difficult questions right now

9378
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:33,600
the really difficult questions right now
 

9379
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:34,710
the really difficult questions right now
we just

9380
02:41:34,710 --> 02:41:34,720
we just
 

9381
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:36,469
we just
don't know much about anything and so

9382
02:41:36,469 --> 02:41:36,479
don't know much about anything and so
 

9383
02:41:36,479 --> 02:41:39,910
don't know much about anything and so
we're striving but there there's long

9384
02:41:39,910 --> 02:41:39,920
we're striving but there there's long
 

9385
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:41,830
we're striving but there there's long
so most of human history you were asking

9386
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:41,840
so most of human history you were asking
 

9387
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:44,870
so most of human history you were asking
why questions for which we now have

9388
02:41:44,870 --> 02:41:44,880
why questions for which we now have
 

9389
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:47,030
why questions for which we now have
very precise answers

9390
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:47,040
very precise answers
 

9391
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:48,950
very precise answers
including with biology and physics and

9392
02:41:48,950 --> 02:41:48,960
including with biology and physics and
 

9393
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:50,550
including with biology and physics and
all those kinds of things

9394
02:41:50,550 --> 02:41:50,560
all those kinds of things
 

9395
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:53,030
all those kinds of things
and maybe the whys this cutting edge of

9396
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:53,040
and maybe the whys this cutting edge of
 

9397
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:55,590
and maybe the whys this cutting edge of
science of the explorer of the curiosity

9398
02:41:55,590 --> 02:41:55,600
science of the explorer of the curiosity
 

9399
02:41:55,600 --> 02:41:57,670
science of the explorer of the curiosity
of the human mind

9400
02:41:57,670 --> 02:41:57,680
of the human mind
 

9401
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:00,230
of the human mind
like man's search for meaning is the

9402
02:42:00,230 --> 02:42:00,240
like man's search for meaning is the
 

9403
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:01,269
like man's search for meaning is the
sort of

9404
02:42:01,269 --> 02:42:01,279
sort of
 

9405
02:42:01,279 --> 02:42:04,070
sort of
the ultimate driver of the why

9406
02:42:04,070 --> 02:42:04,080
the ultimate driver of the why
 

9407
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:06,150
the ultimate driver of the why
and it's almost like it could be an

9408
02:42:06,150 --> 02:42:06,160
and it's almost like it could be an
 

9409
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:08,469
and it's almost like it could be an
evolutionary adaptation of asking

9410
02:42:08,469 --> 02:42:08,479
evolutionary adaptation of asking
 

9411
02:42:08,479 --> 02:42:11,269
evolutionary adaptation of asking
exceptionally hard-wired questions

9412
02:42:11,269 --> 02:42:11,279
exceptionally hard-wired questions
 

9413
02:42:11,279 --> 02:42:14,950
exceptionally hard-wired questions
that will never get answered

9414
02:42:14,950 --> 02:42:14,960
that will never get answered
 

9415
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:17,750
that will never get answered
like so you should always have like it's

9416
02:42:17,750 --> 02:42:17,760
like so you should always have like it's
 

9417
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:19,830
like so you should always have like it's
like a cue it's a it's a stack of

9418
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:19,840
like a cue it's a it's a stack of
 

9419
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:22,230
like a cue it's a it's a stack of
questions why questions and that thing

9420
02:42:22,230 --> 02:42:22,240
questions why questions and that thing
 

9421
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:24,389
questions why questions and that thing
should never come to the bottom

9422
02:42:24,389 --> 02:42:24,399
should never come to the bottom
 

9423
02:42:24,399 --> 02:42:26,870
should never come to the bottom
should always be striving and that's

9424
02:42:26,870 --> 02:42:26,880
should always be striving and that's
 

9425
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:28,469
should always be striving and that's
that's useful for humans to come up with

9426
02:42:28,469 --> 02:42:28,479
that's useful for humans to come up with
 

9427
02:42:28,479 --> 02:42:30,870
that's useful for humans to come up with
better and better ways of survival

9428
02:42:30,870 --> 02:42:30,880
better and better ways of survival
 

9429
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:32,389
better and better ways of survival
and uh maybe

9430
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:32,399
and uh maybe
 

9431
02:42:32,399 --> 02:42:34,230
and uh maybe
from in a bigger perspective for the

9432
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:34,240
from in a bigger perspective for the
 

9433
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:36,070
from in a bigger perspective for the
universe to figure out something about

9434
02:42:36,070 --> 02:42:36,080
universe to figure out something about
 

9435
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:38,389
universe to figure out something about
itself and it's just humans just a

9436
02:42:38,389 --> 02:42:38,399
itself and it's just humans just a
 

9437
02:42:38,399 --> 02:42:40,630
itself and it's just humans just a
useful tool for that

9438
02:42:40,630 --> 02:42:40,640
useful tool for that
 

9439
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:42,550
useful tool for that
or life on earth as a useful tool for

9440
02:42:42,550 --> 02:42:42,560
