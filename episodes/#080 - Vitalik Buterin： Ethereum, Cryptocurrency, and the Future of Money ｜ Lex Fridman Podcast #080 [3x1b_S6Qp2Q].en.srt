multiple software limitations instead of
 

601
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,430

and remove myself as a single point of
 

607
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,470
and remove myself as a single point of
failure because

608
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480

that's an interesting
 

639
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,350
that's an interesting
tension that projects like this kind of

640
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
tension that projects like this kind of
 

641
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,150
tension that projects like this kind of

713
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,230
it's a kind of game and it's a game
where you know we have points and if you

714
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
where you know we have points and if you
 

715
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,910
where you know we have points and if you
have points there's this one move where

716
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
have points there's this one move where
 

717
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,269
have points there's this one move where
you can reduce your points by a number

718
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
you can reduce your points by a number
 

719
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,790
you can reduce your points by a number
and increase someone else's voice by the

720
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
and increase someone else's voice by the
 

721
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,990
and increase someone else's voice by the
same number

722
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
same number
 

723
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,509
same number
and

724
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
and
 

725
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,150
and
these so it's a fair game hopefully well

726
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
these so it's a fair game hopefully well
 

727
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,990
these so it's a fair game hopefully well
it's one kind of fair game

728
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
it's one kind of fair game
 

729
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,590
it's one kind of fair game
like for example you know you can have

730
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
like for example you know you can have
 

731
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,030
like for example you know you can have
other kinds of fair games like you're

732
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
other kinds of fair games like you're
 

733
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,389
other kinds of fair games like you're
gonna have a game where if i give

734
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
gonna have a game where if i give
 

735
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,990
gonna have a game where if i give
someone a point and you give someone a

736
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
someone a point and you give someone a
 

737
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,189
someone a point and you give someone a
points and instead of that person

738
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
points and instead of that person
 

739
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,790
points and instead of that person
getting two points that person gets four

740
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
getting two points that person gets four
 

741
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,910
getting two points that person gets four
points and that's also fair

742
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
points and that's also fair
 

743
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,030
points and that's also fair
but

744
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
but
 

745
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,430
but
no money is um

lot of useful functions and so it kind

750
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
lot of useful functions and so it kind
 

751

lot of useful functions and so it kind
of just survives in the society as a

even if we just look at the 20th century
 

783
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,590
even if we just look at the 20th century
before and then leading up to

784
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
before and then leading up to
 

785
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,949
before and then leading up to
cryptocurrencies that's something you

786
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
cryptocurrencies that's something you
 

787
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,949
cryptocurrencies that's something you
think about

788
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
think about
 

789
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,189
think about
yeah and i think like the big thing in

790
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
yeah and i think like the big thing in
 

791
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,829
yeah and i think like the big thing in
the 20th century is kind of we saw a lot

792
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
the 20th century is kind of we saw a lot
 

793
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,629
the 20th century is kind of we saw a lot
more intermediation i guess

794
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
more intermediation i guess
 

795
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,310
more intermediation i guess
like you know i mean the first part is

796
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
like you know i mean the first part is
 

797
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,509
like you know i mean the first part is
kind of the move from

798
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
kind of the move from
 

799
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,750
kind of the move from
being adding more of different kinds of

800
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
being adding more of different kinds of
 

801
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,870
being adding more of different kinds of
banking and then i used we

802
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
banking and then i used we
 

803
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,949
banking and then i used we
saw the move from and of dollars being

804
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
saw the move from and of dollars being
 

805
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,910
saw the move from and of dollars being
backed by gold to dollars

806
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
backed by gold to dollars
 

807
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,829
backed by gold to dollars
being backed by gold that's only

808
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
being backed by gold that's only
 

809
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,590
being backed by gold that's only
redeemable by certain people the dollars

810
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
redeemable by certain people the dollars
 

811
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,110
redeemable by certain people the dollars
not being backed by anything um to and

812
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
not being backed by anything um to and
 

813
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,670
not being backed by anything um to and
it's just this uh nerf system where you

814
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
it's just this uh nerf system where you
 

815
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,750
it's just this uh nerf system where you
have a bunch of free floating currencies

816
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
have a bunch of free floating currencies
 

817
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,590
have a bunch of free floating currencies
and then

818
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
and then
 

819
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,230
and then
people like um getting out of bank

820

823
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,509
accounts and then those things becoming
electronic people getting accounts with

824
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
electronic people getting accounts with
 

825
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,590
electronic people getting accounts with
payment processors that have account um

826
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
payment processors that have account um
 

827
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,110
payment processors that have account um
bank accounts

828
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
bank accounts
 

829
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,150
bank accounts
so

830
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
so
 

831
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,230
so
so what what do you make of that is

832
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
so what what do you make of that is
 

833
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,710
so what what do you make of that is
that's such a fascinating philosophical

834
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
that's such a fascinating philosophical
 

835
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,110
that's such a fascinating philosophical
idea that money might not be backed by

836
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
idea that money might not be backed by
 

837
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,110
idea that money might not be backed by
anything

838
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
anything
 

839
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,269
anything
what is that like fascinating to you

840
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
what is that like fascinating to you
 

841
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,949
what is that like fascinating to you
that money can exist without being

842
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
that money can exist without being
 

843
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,350
that money can exist without being
backed by something physical

844
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
backed by something physical
 

845
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,350
backed by something physical
it definitely is like what do you make

846
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
it definitely is like what do you make
 

847
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,310
it definitely is like what do you make
of that

848
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
of that
 

849
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,269
of that
like

850
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
like
 

851
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,350
like
how is that possible is that stable if

852
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
how is that possible is that stable if
 

853
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,470
how is that possible is that stable if
we look at the future of human

854
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
we look at the future of human
 

855
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,790
we look at the future of human
civilization is it possible to have

856
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
civilization is it possible to have
 

857
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,430
civilization is it possible to have
money at the large scale at such a

858
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
money at the large scale at such a
 

859
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,790
money at the large scale at such a
hugely productive and rich societies

860
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
hugely productive and rich societies
 

861
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,870
hugely productive and rich societies
be able to operate successfully without

862
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
be able to operate successfully without
 

863
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,110
be able to operate successfully without
money being backed by anything physical

864
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
money being backed by anything physical
 

865
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,110
money being backed by anything physical
i feel like the interesting thing about

866
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
i feel like the interesting thing about
 

867
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,550
i feel like the interesting thing about
the 21st century especially is that

868
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
the 21st century especially is that
 

869
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,550
the 21st century especially is that
a lot of the important valuable things

870
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
a lot of the important valuable things
 

871
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,629
a lot of the important valuable things
are not backed by anything like if you

872
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
are not backed by anything like if you
 

873
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,790
are not backed by anything like if you
look at like tech companies for example

874
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
look at like tech companies for example
 

875
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,269
look at like tech companies for example
like something like twitter

876
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
like something like twitter
 

877
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,350
like something like twitter
like you could theoretically imagine

878
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
like you could theoretically imagine
 

879
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,069
like you could theoretically imagine
that if all of the employees wanted to

880
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
that if all of the employees wanted to
 

881
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,910
that if all of the employees wanted to
they could kind of come together they

882
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
they could kind of come together they
 

883
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,030
they could kind of come together they
would quit

884
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
would quit
 

885
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,870
would quit
and you know start working on twitter

886
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
and you know start working on twitter
 

887
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,189
and you know start working on twitter
2.0 and

888
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
2.0 and
 

889
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,350
2.0 and
then

890
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
then
 

891
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,670
then
the value of um

892
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
the value of um
 

893
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,829
the value of um
and just kind of build the exact the the

894
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
and just kind of build the exact the the
 

895
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,509
and just kind of build the exact the the
exact same product of course possibly

896
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
exact same product of course possibly
 

897
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,350
exact same product of course possibly
build a better product and then just

898
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
build a better product and then just
 

899
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,430
build a better product and then just
kind of continue on from there and the

900
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
kind of continue on from there and the
 

901
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,710
kind of continue on from there and the
original

902
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
original
 

903
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,790
original
the original twitter would kind of just

904
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
the original twitter would kind of just
 

905
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,790
the original twitter would kind of just
not have people left anymore right like

906
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
not have people left anymore right like
 

907
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,150
not have people left anymore right like
the

908
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
the
 

909
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,230
the
there is theoretically kind of code and

910
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
there is theoretically kind of code and
 

911
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,310
there is theoretically kind of code and
like ip that's owned by the company but

912
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
like ip that's owned by the company but
 

913
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,990
like ip that's owned by the company but
in reality like good programmers could

914
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
in reality like good programmers could
 

915
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,430
in reality like good programmers could
probably read up rewrite all that stuff

916
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
probably read up rewrite all that stuff
 

917
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,829
probably read up rewrite all that stuff
in three months

918
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
in three months
 

919
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,110
in three months
so the

920
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
so the
 

921
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,590
so the
like the reason why the thing has value

922
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
like the reason why the thing has value
 

923
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,350
like the reason why the thing has value
is just kind of network effects and

924
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
is just kind of network effects and
 

925
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,069
is just kind of network effects and
coordination problems right like these

926
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
coordination problems right like these
 

927
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,590
coordination problems right like these
employees in reality aren't going to

928
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
employees in reality aren't going to
 

929
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,670
employees in reality aren't going to
switch all at once and also the users

930
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
switch all at once and also the users
 

931
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,990
switch all at once and also the users
aren't um all going to switch them at

932
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
aren't um all going to switch them at
 

933
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,350
aren't um all going to switch them at
once because it's just difficult for

934
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
once because it's just difficult for
 

935
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,230
once because it's just difficult for
them to switch at once and so

936
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
them to switch at once and so
 

937
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,630
them to switch at once and so
there's these kind of

938
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
there's these kind of
 

939
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,270
there's these kind of
meta-stable of equilibrium in the

940
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
meta-stable of equilibrium in the
 

941
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,110
meta-stable of equilibrium in the
interactions between thousands and

942
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
interactions between thousands and
 

943
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,189
interactions between thousands and
millions of people that are just

944
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
millions of people that are just
 

945
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,230
millions of people that are just
actually quite sticky even though if you

946
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
actually quite sticky even though if you
 

947
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,990
actually quite sticky even though if you
try to kind of assume that everyone's a

948
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
try to kind of assume that everyone's a
 

949
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,909
try to kind of assume that everyone's a
perfectly rational and kind of perfectly

950
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
perfectly rational and kind of perfectly
 

951
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,590
perfectly rational and kind of perfectly

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,830
to exist at all
this that stickiness do you have a sense

956
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
this that stickiness do you have a sense
 

957
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,750
this that stickiness do you have a sense
of grasp of the

958
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
of grasp of the
 

959
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,070
of grasp of the
sort of the fun fundamental dynamic like

960
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
sort of the fun fundamental dynamic like
 

961
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,150
sort of the fun fundamental dynamic like
the physics of that stickiness

962
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
the physics of that stickiness
 

963
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,710
the physics of that stickiness
it seems to work but uh and i think some

964
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
it seems to work but uh and i think some
 

965
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,630
it seems to work but uh and i think some
of the cryptocurrency

966
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
of the cryptocurrency
 

967
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,430
of the cryptocurrency
ideas kind of rely on it working yeah

968
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
ideas kind of rely on it working yeah
 

969
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,669
ideas kind of rely on it working yeah
it's uh you know it's the sort of thing

970
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
it's uh you know it's the sort of thing
 

971
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,230
it's uh you know it's the sort of thing
that's definitely been uh economically

972
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
that's definitely been uh economically
 

973
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,789
that's definitely been uh economically
modeled a lot like

974
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
modeled a lot like
 

975
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,870
modeled a lot like
one uh the kind of

976
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
one uh the kind of
 

977
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,390
one uh the kind of
analogy of something as similar that uh

978
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
analogy of something as similar that uh
 

979
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,190
analogy of something as similar that uh
you often see in textbooks as like

980
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
you often see in textbooks as like
 

981
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,750
you often see in textbooks as like
what is a government like if for exa

982
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
what is a government like if for exa
 

983
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,070
what is a government like if for exa
like 80 percent of uh people in a

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
like 80 percent of uh people in a
 

985

country just like tomorrow suddenly had
 

987
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,029
country just like tomorrow suddenly had
had the idea that like

988
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
had the idea that like
 

989
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,470
had the idea that like
the laws that are currently the laws in

the laws that are currently the laws in
the government that currently is the

992
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
the government that currently is the
 

993
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,510
the government that currently is the
government are just people and some and

994
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
government are just people and some and
 

995
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,510
government are just people and some and
some other thing is the government and

996
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
some other thing is the government and
 

997
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,029
some other thing is the government and
they just kind of start acting like it

998
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
they just kind of start acting like it
 

999
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,789
they just kind of start acting like it
then that will kind of become the new

1000
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
then that will kind of become the new
 

1001
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,630
then that will kind of become the new
reality and then the question is well

1002
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
reality and then the question is well
 

1003
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,789
reality and then the question is well
what happens if and if

1004
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
what happens if and if
 

1005
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,669
what happens if and if
between zero and 80 people or

1006
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:25,679
between zero and 80 people or
 

1007
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,909
between zero and 80 people or
and 80 of people start believing that

1008
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
and 80 of people start believing that
 

1009
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,830
and 80 of people start believing that
and like what is

1010
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
and like what is
 

1011
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,710
and like what is
uh the thing you also you see is that

1012
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
uh the thing you also you see is that
 

1013
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,630
uh the thing you also you see is that
if there is one of these kind of

1014
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
if there is one of these kind of
 

1015
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,830
if there is one of these kind of
switches happening this kind of

1016
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
switches happening this kind of
 

1017
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,750
switches happening this kind of
revolution then if you're the first

1018
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
revolution then if you're the first
 

1019
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,830
revolution then if you're the first
person to join then like you

1020
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
person to join then like you
 

1021
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,029
person to join then like you
probably probably don't have the

1022
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
probably probably don't have the
 

1023
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,470
probably probably don't have the
incentive to do that but then if you're

1024
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
incentive to do that but then if you're
 

1025
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,750
incentive to do that but then if you're
the 55th

1026
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
the 55th
 

1027
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,750
the 55th
percentile person to join then suddenly

1028
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
percentile person to join then suddenly
 

1029
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,870
percentile person to join then suddenly
becomes quite safe too and so

1030
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
becomes quite safe too and so
 

1031
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,470
becomes quite safe too and so
this definitely is the sort of thing

1032
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
this definitely is the sort of thing
 

1033
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,430
this definitely is the sort of thing
that you can kind of try to analyze and

1034
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
that you can kind of try to analyze and
 

1035
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,150
that you can kind of try to analyze and
understand mathematically but

1036
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
understand mathematically but
 

1037
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,710
understand mathematically but
one of the

1038
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
one of the
 

1039
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,390
one of the
kind of results is that the sort of

1040
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
kind of results is that the sort of
 

1041
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,110
kind of results is that the sort of
like

1042
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
like
 

1043
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,270
like
when the switch happens definitely can

1044
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
when the switch happens definitely can
 

1045
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,029
when the switch happens definitely can
be chaotic sometimes

1046
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
be chaotic sometimes
 

1047
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,110
be chaotic sometimes
yeah but still like to me the idea that

1048
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
yeah but still like to me the idea that
 

1049
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,510
yeah but still like to me the idea that
uh the network affects the the fact that

1050
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
uh the network affects the the fact that
 

1051
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,070
uh the network affects the the fact that
human beings at a scale like millions

1052
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
human beings at a scale like millions
 

1053
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,630
human beings at a scale like millions
billions can share

1054
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
billions can share
 

1055
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,350
billions can share
even the idea of currency like

1056
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
even the idea of currency like
 

1057
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,590
even the idea of currency like
all agree that's just uh

1058
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
all agree that's just uh
 

1059
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,430
all agree that's just uh
i know economics can model it i'm a

1060
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
i know economics can model it i'm a
 

1061
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,070
i know economics can model it i'm a
skeptic on economic and uh

1062
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
skeptic on economic and uh
 

1063
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,230
skeptic on economic and uh
it's like uh so my my favorite sort of

1064
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
it's like uh so my my favorite sort of
 

1065
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,870
it's like uh so my my favorite sort of
field maybe recreationally psychology is

1066
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
field maybe recreationally psychology is
 

1067
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,870
field maybe recreationally psychology is
trying to understand human behavior

1068
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
trying to understand human behavior
 

1069
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,789
trying to understand human behavior
and i i think sometimes people just kind

1070
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
and i i think sometimes people just kind
 

1071
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,789
and i i think sometimes people just kind

of pretend that they can have a grasp on

it's difficult to know how much that's

1086
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
it's difficult to know how much that's
 

1087
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,470
it's difficult to know how much that's
wishful thinking and how much it is

wishful thinking and how much it is

actually getting to the core of

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,110
actually getting to the core of

what
do you think is the role of money in

do you think is the role of money in

do you think is the role of money in
human motivation

1100

human motivation
 

1101
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,230
human motivation
so

1102
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240

 

1103
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,430

do you think

00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,440
do you think
 

1105
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,870
do you think
money

1106
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
money
 

1107
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,470
money
from an economics perspective from a

1108
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
from an economics perspective from a
 

1109
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,110
from an economics perspective from a
psychology perspective is core

1110
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
psychology perspective is core
 

1111
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,230
psychology perspective is core
to like human desires

1112
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
to like human desires
 

1113
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,230
to like human desires
money is definitely very far from the

1114
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
money is definitely very far from the
 

1115
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,430
money is definitely very far from the
only motivator um it is a big motivator

1116
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
only motivator um it is a big motivator
 

1117
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,830
only motivator um it is a big motivator
and it's uh one of the closest things

1118
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:25,840
and it's uh one of the closest things
 

1119
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,070
and it's uh one of the closest things
you have to a universal motivator

1120
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
you have to a universal motivator
 

1121
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,750
you have to a universal motivator
i think

1122
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
i think
 

1123
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,230
i think
because ultimately in like almost any

1124
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
because ultimately in like almost any
 

1125
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,549
because ultimately in like almost any
person in the world if you

1126
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
person in the world if you
 

1127
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,230
person in the world if you
ask them to do something like they'll be

1128
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
ask them to do something like they'll be
 

1129
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,310
ask them to do something like they'll be
more inclined to do it if you also offer

1130
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
more inclined to do it if you also offer
 

1131
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,510
more inclined to do it if you also offer
some uh

1132
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
some uh
 

1133
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,110
some uh
offer the money right and that's uh

1134
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
offer the money right and that's uh
 

1135
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,350
offer the money right and that's uh
there's definitely many cases where

1136
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
there's definitely many cases where
 

1137
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,270
there's definitely many cases where
people will do things other than things

1138
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
people will do things other than things
 

1139
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,870
people will do things other than things
that maximize how much money they have

1140
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
that maximize how much money they have
 

1141
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,029
that maximize how much money they have
and that happens all the time but

1142
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
and that happens all the time but
 

1143
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,110
and that happens all the time but
like though a lot of those other things

1144
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
like though a lot of those other things
 

1145
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,110
like though a lot of those other things
are kind of but much more

1146
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
are kind of but much more
 

1147
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,270
are kind of but much more
specific to and of who that person is

1148
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
specific to and of who that person is
 

1149
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,789
specific to and of who that person is
and of what their situation is the

1150
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
and of what their situation is the
 

1151
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,390
and of what their situation is the
relationship between the motive and the

1152
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400

that decentralized currency
 

1169
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,669
that decentralized currency
decentralized applications are looking

1170
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
decentralized applications are looking
 

1171
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,350
decentralized applications are looking
at is

1172
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
at is
 

1173
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,590
at is
who holds the power yeah

1174
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
who holds the power yeah
 

1175
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,230

money is definitely a kind of power and

1176
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
money is definitely a kind of power and
 

1177
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,270
money is definitely a kind of power and
there's definitely people who

there's definitely people who
 

1179
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,270
there's definitely people who
want money because it gives them power

want money because it gives them power
and then

1182
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
and then
 

1183
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,990
and then
even

1184
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
even
 

1185
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,630
even
if my money doesn't seem to and

1186
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
if my money doesn't seem to and
 

1187
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,110
if my money doesn't seem to and
explicitly be about money a lot of uh

1188
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
explicitly be about money a lot of uh
 

1189
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,710
explicitly be about money a lot of uh
things that people spend money on are

1190
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:38,720
things that people spend money on are
 

1191
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,870
things that people spend money on are
ultimately about a social status of some

1192
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:40,880
ultimately about a social status of some
 

1193
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,750
ultimately about a social status of some
kind

1194
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
kind
 

1195
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,190
kind
um

1196
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
um
 

1197
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,590
um
so i mean i definitely view those two

1198
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
so i mean i definitely view those two
 

1199
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,909
so i mean i definitely view those two
things as kind of interplaying and then

1200
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
things as kind of interplaying and then
 

1201
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,310
things as kind of interplaying and then
there's also money as just a way of uh

1202
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
there's also money as just a way of uh
 

1203
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,110
there's also money as just a way of uh
like

1204
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
like
 

1205
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,590
like
measuring how successful you are i guess

1206
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
measuring how successful you are i guess
 

1207
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,270
measuring how successful you are i guess
a scoreboard right so this kind of gets

1208
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
a scoreboard right so this kind of gets
 

1209
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,870
a scoreboard right so this kind of gets
back to the game

1210
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
back to the game
 

1211
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,390
back to the game
like if

1212
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400
like if
 

1213
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,190
like if
you have four billion dollars then

1214
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
you have four billion dollars then
 

1215
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,950
you have four billion dollars then
the main benefit you get from going up

1216
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
the main benefit you get from going up
 

1217
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,470
the main benefit you get from going up
well one of the big benefits you get

1218
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
well one of the big benefits you get
 

1219
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,310
well one of the big benefits you get
from going up to six million dollars is

1220
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
from going up to six million dollars is
 

1221
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,549
from going up to six million dollars is
that now instead of uh being below the

1222
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
that now instead of uh being below the
 

1223
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,909
that now instead of uh being below the
guy who has five you're above the guy

1224
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919
guy who has five you're above the guy
 

1225
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,350
guy who has five you're above the guy
who has five

1226
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
who has five
 

1227
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,230
who has five
so you think money could be kind of uh

1228
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
so you think money could be kind of uh
 

1229
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,110
so you think money could be kind of uh
in a game of life it's also a measure of

1230
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,120
in a game of life it's also a measure of
 

1231
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,590
in a game of life it's also a measure of
self-worth it's like how we

1232
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
self-worth it's like how we
 

1233
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,669
self-worth it's like how we
it's definitely how uh

1234
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
it's definitely how uh
 

1235
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,590
it's definitely how uh
how a lot of people perceive it define

1236
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
how a lot of people perceive it define
 

1237
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,830
how a lot of people perceive it define
ourselves in the hierarchy of yeah and

1238
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
ourselves in the hierarchy of yeah and
 

1239
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,630
ourselves in the hierarchy of yeah and
i'm not

1240
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
i'm not
 

1241
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,390
i'm not
yeah not saying it's kind of a healthy

1242
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
yeah not saying it's kind of a healthy
 

1243
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,710
yeah not saying it's kind of a healthy
thing that people

1244
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
thing that people
 

1245
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,549
thing that people
define their self-worth as money because

1246
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
define their self-worth as money because
 

1247
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,630
define their self-worth as money because
it's definitely kind of far from a yeah

1248
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640
it's definitely kind of far from a yeah
 

1249
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,190
it's definitely kind of far from a yeah
perfect indicator of like how much you

1250
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
perfect indicator of like how much you
 

1251
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,070
perfect indicator of like how much you
like

1252
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
like
 

1253
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,830
like
value you provide to society or anything

1254

value you provide to society or anything
like this but i i definitely think that

1256
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
like this but i i definitely think that
 

1257
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,750
like this but i i definitely think that
like

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
like
 

1259
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,350
like
as a matter of kind of current practice

1260
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
as a matter of kind of current practice
 

1261
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,470
as a matter of kind of current practice
a bunch of people do feel that way

1262
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
a bunch of people do feel that way
 

1263
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,190
a bunch of people do feel that way
so what does utopia from an economic

1264
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
so what does utopia from an economic
 

1265
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,669
so what does utopia from an economic
perspective look like to you

1266

perspective look like to you
 

1267
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,149
perspective look like to you
what does the perfect world look like

1268
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
what does the perfect world look like
 

1269
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,190
what does the perfect world look like
i guess like the economists say utopia

1270
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
i guess like the economists say utopia
 

1271
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,470
i guess like the economists say utopia
would be

1272
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
would be
 

1273
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,310
would be
one where

1274
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:06,320
one where
 

1275
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,390
one where
kind of

1276
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
kind of
 

1277
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,470
kind of
everything is an of incentive aligns in

1278
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
everything is an of incentive aligns in
 

1279
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,390
everything is an of incentive aligns in
this um in the sense that there aren't

1280
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,400
this um in the sense that there aren't
 

1281
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,350
this um in the sense that there aren't
enough conflicts between what satisfies

1282
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
enough conflicts between what satisfies
 

1283
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,110
enough conflicts between what satisfies
your goals and kind of what is uh good

1284
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
your goals and kind of what is uh good
 

1285
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,110
your goals and kind of what is uh good
for and everyone in the world um in the

1286

what do you think that would um
 

1291
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,510
what do you think that would um
look like does does that mean they're

1292

would be
 

1315
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,549
would be
so i definitely think that

1316
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
so i definitely think that
 

1317
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,269
so i definitely think that
existing economic philosophies do end up

1318
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:57,279
existing economic philosophies do end up
 

1319
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,950
existing economic philosophies do end up
kind of

1320
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
kind of
 

1321
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,269
kind of
systematically kind of deviating from

1322
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,279
systematically kind of deviating from
 

1323
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,310
systematically kind of deviating from
the utopia in a lot of ways yeah like

1324
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
the utopia in a lot of ways yeah like
 

1325
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,230
the utopia in a lot of ways yeah like
one of the big things i talk about for

1326
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
one of the big things i talk about for
 

1327
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,630
one of the big things i talk about for
example is public goods right and public

1328
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
example is public goods right and public
 

1329
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,470
example is public goods right and public
goods are especially important on the

1330
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
goods are especially important on the
 

1331
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,710
goods are especially important on the
internet right yeah because

1332
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
internet right yeah because
 

1333
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,950
internet right yeah because
like the idea is with kind of money as

1334
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
like the idea is with kind of money as
 

1335
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,269
like the idea is with kind of money as
this game where you know i was a few

1336
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:17,279
this game where you know i was a few
 

1337
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,430
this game where you know i was a few
coins a few coins and you gain the same

1338
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
coins a few coins and you gain the same
 

1339
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,870
coins a few coins and you gain the same
number of coins is that this usually

1340
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
number of coins is that this usually
 

1341
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,110
number of coins is that this usually
happens in a trade where i lose some

1342
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,120
happens in a trade where i lose some
 

1343
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,269
happens in a trade where i lose some
money you gain some money you lose a

1344
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
money you gain some money you lose a
 

1345
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,750
money you gain some money you lose a
sandwich and i gain a sandwich

1346
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
sandwich and i gain a sandwich
 

1347
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,190
sandwich and i gain a sandwich
and

1348
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
and
 

1349
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,830
and
this kind of model works really well

1350
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:31,840
this kind of model works really well
 

1351
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,110
this kind of model works really well
when the thing that we're using money to

1352
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
when the thing that we're using money to
 

1353
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,950
when the thing that we're using money to
incentivize the set of private goods

1354
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
incentivize the set of private goods
 

1355
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,630
incentivize the set of private goods
right things that you provide to one

1356
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
right things that you provide to one
 

1357
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,230
right things that you provide to one
person where the benefit comes to one

1358
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,240
person where the benefit comes to one
 

1359
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,669
person where the benefit comes to one
person but

1360
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
person but
 

1361
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,789
person but
the

1362
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
the
 

1363
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,190
the
like on the internet especially but also

1364
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,200
like on the internet especially but also
 

1365
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,110
like on the internet especially but also
many many contacts kind of off the

1366
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,120
many many contacts kind of off the
 

1367
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,669
many many contacts kind of off the
internet there's actions that kind of

1368
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
internet there's actions that kind of
 

1369
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,470
internet there's actions that kind of
individuals or groups can take where

1370
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
individuals or groups can take where
 

1371
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,510
individuals or groups can take where
instead of the benefit going to one

1372
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
instead of the benefit going to one
 

1373
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,590
instead of the benefit going to one
person the benefit just goes to many

1374
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
person the benefit just goes to many
 

1375
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,070
person the benefit just goes to many
people at the same time and you can't

1376
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
people at the same time and you can't
 

1377
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,830
people at the same time and you can't
control who the benefit goes to right so

1378
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
control who the benefit goes to right so
 

1379
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,230
control who the benefit goes to right so
for example this podcast you know we

1380
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,240
for example this podcast you know we
 

1381
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,430
for example this podcast you know we
publish it

1382
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
publish it
 

1383
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,390
publish it
and

1384
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:06,400
and
 

1385
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,390
and
when it's published you don't have any

1386
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
when it's published you don't have any
 

1387
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,110
when it's published you don't have any
fine grains control over like oh these

1388
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120
fine grains control over like oh these
 

1389
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,909
fine grains control over like oh these
38 000 people can watch it and then like

1390
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:13,919
38 000 people can watch it and then like
 

1391
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,230
38 000 people can watch it and then like
these other 29 000 people can't it's

1392
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
these other 29 000 people can't it's
 

1393
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,750
these other 29 000 people can't it's
like once the number goes high enough

1394
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
like once the number goes high enough
 

1395
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,830
like once the number goes high enough
then you know people will just like copy

1396
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:19,840
then you know people will just like copy
 

1397
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,590
then you know people will just like copy
it and then when i write articles on a

1398
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
it and then when i write articles on a
 

1399
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,029
it and then when i write articles on a
blog then

1400
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
blog then
 

1401
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,470
blog then
they're just like

1402
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,480
they're just like
 

1403
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,149
they're just like
free for everyone and that stuff's even

1404
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
free for everyone and that stuff's even
 

1405
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,390
free for everyone and that stuff's even
harder to prevent anyone from copying

1406
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
harder to prevent anyone from copying
 

1407
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,590
harder to prevent anyone from copying
so and aside from that things like you

1408
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
so and aside from that things like you
 

1409
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,149
so and aside from that things like you
know scientific research for example

1410
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
know scientific research for example
 

1411
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,190
know scientific research for example
and

1412
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
and
 

1413
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,269
and
even taking more pedestrian examples

1414
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
even taking more pedestrian examples
 

1415
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,110
even taking more pedestrian examples
like climate change mitigation would be

1416
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
like climate change mitigation would be
 

1417
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,510
like climate change mitigation would be
a big one um

1418
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
a big one um
 

1419
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,630
a big one um
so

1420
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
so
 

1421
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,390
so
there's a lot of things in the world

1422
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
there's a lot of things in the world
 

1423
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,190
there's a lot of things in the world
where

1424
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,200
where
 

1425
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,350
where
you have these kind of individual

1426
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
you have these kind of individual
 

1427
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,269
you have these kind of individual
actions with have concentrated costs and

1428
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
actions with have concentrated costs and
 

1429
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,350
actions with have concentrated costs and
distributed benefits and money as a

1430
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
distributed benefits and money as a
 

1431
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,789
distributed benefits and money as a
point system

1432
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
point system
 

1433
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,510
point system
does not do a good job of encouraging

1434
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,520
does not do a good job of encouraging
 

1435
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,630
does not do a good job of encouraging
these things

1436
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
these things
 

1437
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,590
these things
and

1438
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
and
 

1439
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,070
and
one of the kind of other things even

1440
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,080
one of the kind of other things even
 

1441
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,350
one of the kind of other things even
kind of

1442
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
kind of
 

1443
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,430
kind of
tangentially connected to crypto but

1444
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440
tangentially connected to crypto but
 

1445
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,669
tangentially connected to crypto but
kind of theoretically outside of it that

1446
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
kind of theoretically outside of it that
 

1447
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,430
kind of theoretically outside of it that
i work on is this sort of mechanism

1448
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
i work on is this sort of mechanism
 

1449
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,990
i work on is this sort of mechanism
called quadratic funding um and the way

1450
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
called quadratic funding um and the way
 

1451
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,909
called quadratic funding um and the way
to think about it is and i've imagine a

1452
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
to think about it is and i've imagine a
 

1453
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,149
to think about it is and i've imagine a
point system where

1454
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
point system where
 

1455
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,750
point system where
if uh

1456
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
if uh
 

1457
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,430
if uh
like if one person gives a coin

1458
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
like if one person gives a coin
 

1459
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,070
like if one person gives a coin
gives coins to one other person then it

1460
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
gives coins to one other person then it
 

1461
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,630
gives coins to one other person then it
works the same way as money but if

1462
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
works the same way as money but if
 

1463
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,669
works the same way as money but if
multiple people uh give coins to one

1464
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:27,679
multiple people uh give coins to one
 

1465
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,230
multiple people uh give coins to one
person and they do so anonymously so

1466
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,240
person and they do so anonymously so
 

1467
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,230
person and they do so anonymously so
it's kind of not in consideration for a

1468
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
it's kind of not in consideration for a
 

1469
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,510
it's kind of not in consideration for a
specific service to that person

1470
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
specific service to that person
 

1471
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,830
specific service to that person
themselves and then

1472
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
themselves and then
 

1473
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,230
themselves and then
the number of coins received by that

1474
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,240
the number of coins received by that
 

1475
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,269
the number of coins received by that
person is kind of greater than just the

1476
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
person is kind of greater than just the
 

1477
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,630
person is kind of greater than just the
sum of the number of coins that have

1478
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
sum of the number of coins that have
 

1479
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,390
sum of the number of coins that have
given by those different people

1480
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
given by those different people
 

1481
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,430
given by those different people
um so the actual formula is you take the

1482
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
um so the actual formula is you take the
 

1483
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,870
um so the actual formula is you take the
square root of the amount that each

1484
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:48,880
square root of the amount that each
 

1485
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,390
square root of the amount that each
person gave then you add all the square

1486
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
person gave then you add all the square
 

1487
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,669
person gave then you add all the square
roots and then you had to square the

1488
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
roots and then you had to square the
 

1489
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,470
roots and then you had to square the
sums

1490
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,480
sums
 

1491
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,350
sums
yeah and then you give that and

1492
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
yeah and then you give that and
 

1493
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,070
yeah and then you give that and
the idea here would basically be that if

1494
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
the idea here would basically be that if
 

1495
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,909
the idea here would basically be that if
let's say for example

1496
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
let's say for example
 

1497
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,710
let's say for example
you just started going off and kind of

1498
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720
you just started going off and kind of
 

1499
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,470
you just started going off and kind of
planting a lot of trees

1500
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:04,480
planting a lot of trees
 

1501
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,149
planting a lot of trees
and there's a bunch of people that are

1502
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
and there's a bunch of people that are
 

1503
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,830
and there's a bunch of people that are
really happy that you're planting trees

1504
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
really happy that you're planting trees
 

1505
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,909
really happy that you're planting trees
and so they go and all kind of throw a

1506
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
and so they go and all kind of throw a
 

1507
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,510
and so they go and all kind of throw a
coin um your way then

1508
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520
coin um your way then
 

1509
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,909
coin um your way then
the like there is like basically the

1510
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
the like there is like basically the
 

1511
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,590
the like there is like basically the
fact that kind of you get more than the

1512
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
fact that kind of you get more than the
 

1513
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,909
fact that kind of you get more than the
sum you get this kind of square of some

1514
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:19,919
sum you get this kind of square of some
 

1515
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,830
sum you get this kind of square of some
of these of uh of square roots of these

1516
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
of these of uh of square roots of these
 

1517
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,590
of these of uh of square roots of these
tiny amounts is them

1518
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
tiny amounts is them
 

1519
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,990
tiny amounts is them
that this actually kind of compensates

1520
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
that this actually kind of compensates
 

1521
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,669
that this actually kind of compensates
for the tragedy of the comments right in

1522
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
for the tragedy of the comments right in
 

1523
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,950
for the tragedy of the comments right in
this there's even this kind of

1524
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
this there's even this kind of
 

1525
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,389
this there's even this kind of
mathematical proof that it sort of

1526
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
mathematical proof that it sort of
 

1527
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,710
mathematical proof that it sort of
optimally compensates for it what is the

1528
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
optimally compensates for it what is the
 

1529
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,470
optimally compensates for it what is the
tragedy of the common um this is just

1530
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,480
tragedy of the common um this is just
 

1531
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,549
tragedy of the common um this is just
this idea that

1532
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:36,559
this idea that
 

1533
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,870
this idea that
like if there is this uh situation where

1534
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
like if there is this uh situation where
 

1535
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,190
like if there is this uh situation where
there's some public good that lots of

1536
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
there's some public good that lots of
 

1537
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,590
there's some public good that lots of
people benefit from then no individual

1538
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600
people benefit from then no individual
 

1539
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,269
people benefit from then no individual
person wants to contribute to it because

1540
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:47,279
person wants to contribute to it because
 

1541
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,789
person wants to contribute to it because
if they contribute they only get a small

1542
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
if they contribute they only get a small
 

1543
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,029
if they contribute they only get a small
part of the benefit from

1544
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
part of the benefit from
 

1545
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,870
part of the benefit from
their contribution but they pay the full

1546
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880
their contribution but they pay the full
 

1547
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,630
their contribution but they pay the full
cost of their contribution

1548
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
cost of their contribution
 

1549
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,190
cost of their contribution
in which context does this um sorry what

1550
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
in which context does this um sorry what
 

1551
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,870
in which context does this um sorry what
is the term quadratic quadratic funding

1552
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
is the term quadratic quadratic funding
 

1553
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,950
is the term quadratic quadratic funding
like what's in which context is this

1554
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
like what's in which context is this
 

1555
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,789
like what's in which context is this
mechanism

1556
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799
mechanism
 

1557
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,389
mechanism
useful so

1558
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
useful so
 

1559
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,710
useful so
obviously you said to to combat the

1560
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
obviously you said to to combat the
 

1561
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,950
obviously you said to to combat the
tragedy of the commons but yeah in which

1562
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:10,960
tragedy of the commons but yeah in which
 

1563
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,549
tragedy of the commons but yeah in which
context do you see it as useful actually

1564
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
context do you see it as useful actually
 

1565
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,149
context do you see it as useful actually
practically yeah theoretically public

1566
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
practically yeah theoretically public
 

1567
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,029
practically yeah theoretically public
goods in general right so like like

1568
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
goods in general right so like like
 

1569
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,470
goods in general right so like like
services like what what are we what are

1570
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,480
services like what what are we what are
 

1571
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,230
services like what what are we what are
we talking about what's the public yeah

1572
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
we talking about what's the public yeah
 

1573
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,190
we talking about what's the public yeah
so

1574
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,200
so
 

1575
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,510
so
within the um ethereum ecosystem for

1576
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:23,520
within the um ethereum ecosystem for
 

1577
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,830
within the um ethereum ecosystem for
example like we've actually tried using

1578
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:25,840
example like we've actually tried using
 

1579
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,070
example like we've actually tried using
this mechanism i yeah wrote a couple of

1580
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
this mechanism i yeah wrote a couple of
 

1581
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,870
this mechanism i yeah wrote a couple of
articles about the cinevon vitalic.ca

1582
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
articles about the cinevon vitalic.ca
 

1583
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,230
articles about the cinevon vitalic.ca
where i go through some of the most

1584
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240
where i go through some of the most
 

1585
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,669
where i go through some of the most
recent rounds and it's been really

1586
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
recent rounds and it's been really
 

1587
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,230
recent rounds and it's been really
interesting um some of the top ones that

1588
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,240
interesting um some of the top ones that
 

1589
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,990
interesting um some of the top ones that
people supported there were

1590
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,000

 

1591
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,710

things like kind of just

1592
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
things like kind of just
 

1593
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,870
things like kind of just
online user interfaces that make it

1594
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:44,880
online user interfaces that make it
 

1595
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,870
online user interfaces that make it
easier for people to interact with

1596
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:46,880
easier for people to interact with
 

1597
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,310
easier for people to interact with
ethereum

1598
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
ethereum
 

1599
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,710
ethereum
there was

1600
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:49,720
there was
 

1601
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,789
there was
documentation there were podcasts

1602
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:54,799

 

1603
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,549

there were

1604
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
there were
 

1605
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,789
there were
enough software kind of clients like

1606
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
enough software kind of clients like
 

1607
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,029
enough software kind of clients like
kind of implementations of the ethereum

1608
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039
kind of implementations of the ethereum
 

1609
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,950
kind of implementations of the ethereum
protocol of privacy tools just like

1610
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:04,960
protocol of privacy tools just like
 

1611
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,789
protocol of privacy tools just like
lots of things that are

1612
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
lots of things that are
 

1613
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,269
lots of things that are
useful to lots of people

1614
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
useful to lots of people
 

1615
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,110
useful to lots of people
when a lot of people are contributing

1616
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120
when a lot of people are contributing
 

1617
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,870
when a lot of people are contributing
like funding a particular

1618
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
like funding a particular
 

1619
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,350
like funding a particular
particular entity yeah uh that's really

1620
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
particular entity yeah uh that's really
 

1621
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,470
particular entity yeah uh that's really
that's really interesting is there

1622
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
that's really interesting is there
 

1623
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,149
that's really interesting is there
something special about the quadratic

1624
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
something special about the quadratic
 

1625
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,350
something special about the quadratic
the

1626
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
the
 

1627
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,149
the
the the summing of the square roots yeah

1628
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:22,159
the the summing of the square roots yeah
 

1629
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,149
the the summing of the square roots yeah
so another way to think about it is like

1630
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
so another way to think about it is like
 

1631
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,110
so another way to think about it is like
imagine if n people each give a dollar

1632
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
imagine if n people each give a dollar
 

1633
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,750
imagine if n people each give a dollar
then the person gets n squared right um

1634
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,760
then the person gets n squared right um
 

1635
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,029
then the person gets n squared right um
and

1636
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:31,039
and
 

1637
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,110
and
and so each individual person's uh

1638
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
and so each individual person's uh
 

1639
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,029
and so each individual person's uh
contribution gets multiplied by n right

1640
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,039
contribution gets multiplied by n right
 

1641
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,950
contribution gets multiplied by n right
because you have n people yeah um and so

1642
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:36,960
because you have n people yeah um and so
 

1643
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,789
because you have n people yeah um and so
that kind of perfectly compensates for

1644
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:38,799
that kind of perfectly compensates for
 

1645
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,110
that kind of perfectly compensates for
the kind of kind of anti-1 uh tragedy of

1646
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
the kind of kind of anti-1 uh tragedy of
 

1647
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,870
the kind of kind of anti-1 uh tragedy of
the commons i just wonder if the the

1648
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
the commons i just wonder if the the
 

1649
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,669
the commons i just wonder if the the
squared part is yeah how fundamental no

1650
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
squared part is yeah how fundamental no
 

1651
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,269
squared part is yeah how fundamental no
it is um

1652
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
it is um
 

1653
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,430
it is um
and i'd uh recommend you go to uh on

1654
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:50,440
and i'd uh recommend you go to uh on
 

1655
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,029
and i'd uh recommend you go to uh on
vitalik.ca i have this article called a

attempt so far and explaining the
 

1663
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,110
attempt so far and explaining the
intuition behind this intuition so if we

1664
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
intuition behind this intuition so if we
 

1665
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,710
intuition behind this intuition so if we
could can we go to the

1666
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
could can we go to the
 

1667
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,029
could can we go to the

1697
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,950

two generals that are have camped out on

1698
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,960
two generals that are have camped out on
 

1699
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,110
two generals that are have camped out on
opposite sides of a city

1700
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,120
opposite sides of a city
 

1701
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,430
opposite sides of a city
and they're planning when to attack the

1702
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
and they're planning when to attack the
 

1703
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,310
and they're planning when to attack the
city

1704
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
city
 

1705
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,389
city
then

1706
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
then
 

1707
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,710
then
the question is and if how could those

1708
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720
the question is and if how could those
 

1709
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,310
the question is and if how could those
generals coordinate with each other and

1710
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,320
generals coordinate with each other and
 

1711
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,230
generals coordinate with each other and
they could send message messengers

1712
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
they could send message messengers
 

1713
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,590
they could send message messengers
between each other but those messengers

1714
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:55,600
between each other but those messengers
 

1715
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,430
between each other but those messengers
kind of could get sniped by the enemy on

1716
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440
kind of could get sniped by the enemy on
 

1717
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,549
kind of could get sniped by the enemy on
the

1718
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:58,559
the
 

1719
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,710
the
road some of those messages could end up

1720
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
road some of those messages could end up
 

1721
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,830
road some of those messages could end up
being traders and if things could end up

1722
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:02,840
being traders and if things could end up
 

1723
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,750
being traders and if things could end up
happening and

1724
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:05,760
happening and
 

1725
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,990
happening and
with just two

1726
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
with just two
 

1727
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,350
with just two
mess

1728
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,360
mess
 

1729
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,669
mess
generals it turns out that there's kind

1730
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:11,679
generals it turns out that there's kind
 

1731
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,070
generals it turns out that there's kind
of no solution in a finite number of

1732
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,080
of no solution in a finite number of
 

1733
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,350
of no solution in a finite number of
rounds that guarantees that they will be

1734
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360
rounds that guarantees that they will be
 

1735
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,070
rounds that guarantees that they will be
able to coordinate on the same answer um

1736
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
able to coordinate on the same answer um
 

1737
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,909
able to coordinate on the same answer um
but then in the case where you have more

1738
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919
but then in the case where you have more
 

1739
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,669
but then in the case where you have more
than two generals and then leslie

1740
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:23,679
than two generals and then leslie
 

1741
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,430
than two generals and then leslie
analyzes cases like

1742
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:25,440
analyzes cases like
 

1743
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,350
analyzes cases like
um are the mess and

1744
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,360
um are the mess and
 

1745
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,909
um are the mess and
messages kind of just oral messages are

1746
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:29,919
messages kind of just oral messages are
 

1747
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,470
messages kind of just oral messages are
the messages kind of signed messages so

1748
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,480
the messages kind of signed messages so
 

1749
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,630
the messages kind of signed messages so
i can give you a signed message and then

1750
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
i can give you a signed message and then
 

1751
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,389
i can give you a signed message and then
you can pass along that signed message

1752
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,399
you can pass along that signed message
 

1753
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,310
you can pass along that signed message
and the third party can still verify

1754
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,320
and the third party can still verify
 

1755
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,110
and the third party can still verify
that i originally made that message

1756
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
that i originally made that message
 

1757
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,750
that i originally made that message
and depending on those different cases

1758
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
and depending on those different cases
 

1759
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,789
and depending on those different cases
there's kind of different bounds on like

1760
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
there's kind of different bounds on like
 

1761
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,870
there's kind of different bounds on like
given how many generals and how many

1762
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:48,880
given how many generals and how many
 

1763
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,310
given how many generals and how many
traders um among those generals kind of

1764
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
traders um among those generals kind of
 

1765
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,389
traders um among those generals kind of
whether like under one conditions you

1766
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:54,399
whether like under one conditions you
 

1767
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,990
whether like under one conditions you
actually can't agree when to launch an

1768
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,000
actually can't agree when to launch an
 

1769
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,870
actually can't agree when to launch an
attack uh so

1770
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:58,880
attack uh so
 

1771
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,029
attack uh so
it's actually a big misconception that

1772
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
it's actually a big misconception that
 

1773
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,029
it's actually a big misconception that
the the byzantine general's problem was

1774
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:03,039
the the byzantine general's problem was
 

1775
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,590
the the byzantine general's problem was
unsolved so listen lanport solved it the

1776
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:05,600
unsolved so listen lanport solved it the
 

1777
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,590
unsolved so listen lanport solved it the
thing that was unsolved though is that

1778
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:07,600
thing that was unsolved though is that
 

1779
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,830
thing that was unsolved though is that
all of these solutions assume that

1780
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
all of these solutions assume that
 

1781
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,149
all of these solutions assume that
you've already agreed on a fixed list of

1782
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
you've already agreed on a fixed list of
 

1783
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,470
you've already agreed on a fixed list of
who the generals are and

1784
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,480
who the generals are and
 

1785
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,070
who the generals are and
these generals have to be kind of

1786
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
these generals have to be kind of
 

1787
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,669
these generals have to be kind of
semi-trusted to some extent they can't

1788
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:17,679
semi-trusted to some extent they can't
 

1789
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,110
semi-trusted to some extent they can't
just be anonymous people because if

1790
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,120
just be anonymous people because if
 

1791
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,110
just be anonymous people because if
they're anonymous then like the enemy

1792
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,120
they're anonymous then like the enemy
 

1793
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,990
they're anonymous then like the enemy
could just be 99 of the generals

1794
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
could just be 99 of the generals
 

1795
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,870
could just be 99 of the generals
so

1796
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:24,880
so
 

1797
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,230
so
right then

1798
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,240
right then
 

1799
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,950
right then
in the 1980s and the 1990s kind of the

1800
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
in the 1980s and the 1990s kind of the
 

1801
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,830
in the 1980s and the 1990s kind of the
general use case for distributed system

1802
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
general use case for distributed system
 

1803
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,870
general use case for distributed system
stuff was more kind of enterprisey stuff

1804
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:36,880
stuff was more kind of enterprisey stuff
 

1805
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,230
stuff was more kind of enterprisey stuff
where you could kind of assume

1806
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240
where you could kind of assume
 

1807
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,669
where you could kind of assume
that uh you know you know who the nodes

1808
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:43,679
that uh you know you know who the nodes
 

1809
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,509
that uh you know you know who the nodes
are that are running these nf computer

1810
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:45,519
are that are running these nf computer
 

1811
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,990
are that are running these nf computer
networks so if you wants to have some in

1812
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
networks so if you wants to have some in
 

1813
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,669
networks so if you wants to have some in
a decentralized computer network that

1814
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
a decentralized computer network that
 

1815
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,350
a decentralized computer network that
pretends to be a single computer and

1816
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360
pretends to be a single computer and
 

1817
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,789
pretends to be a single computer and
that you can kind of do

1818
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
that you can kind of do
 

1819
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,269
that you can kind of do
do a lot of operations on then

1820
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279
do a lot of operations on then
 

1821
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,430
do a lot of operations on then
it's made out of these kind of 15

1822
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,440
it's made out of these kind of 15
 

1823
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,909
it's made out of these kind of 15
specific computers and we know kind of

1824
00:32:59,909 --> 00:32:59,919
specific computers and we know kind of
 

1825
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,509
specific computers and we know kind of
who and where they are and so we have a

1826
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:01,519
who and where they are and so we have a
 

1827
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,190
who and where they are and so we have a
good reason to believe that say at least

1828
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
good reason to believe that say at least
 

1829
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,029
good reason to believe that say at least
11 of them would be fine

1830
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:05,039
11 of them would be fine
 

1831
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,029
11 of them would be fine
and then it could also be within a

1832
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:07,039
and then it could also be within a
 

1833
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,830
and then it could also be within a
single system exactly almost a network

1834
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840
single system exactly almost a network
 

1835
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,389
single system exactly almost a network
of devices sensors so on like in

1836
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:12,399
of devices sensors so on like in
 

1837
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,110
of devices sensors so on like in
airplanes and i think uh like flight

1838
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,120
airplanes and i think uh like flight
 

1839
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,789
airplanes and i think uh like flight
systems in general still use these kinds

1840
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:16,799
systems in general still use these kinds
 

1841
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,149
systems in general still use these kinds
of ideas yep yep um so that's the 80s

1842
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:20,159
of ideas yep yep um so that's the 80s
 

1843
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,909
of ideas yep yep um so that's the 80s
that's the it is the 90s now the

1844
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:21,919
that's the it is the 90s now the
 

1845
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,990
that's the it is the 90s now the
cypherpunks had a different use case in

1846
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
cypherpunks had a different use case in
 

1847
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,909
cypherpunks had a different use case in
mind which is that they wanted to create

1848
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:25,919
mind which is that they wanted to create
 

1849
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,310
mind which is that they wanted to create
a fully a decentralized global

1850
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,320
a fully a decentralized global
 

1851
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,070
a fully a decentralized global
permissionless currency

1852
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,080
permissionless currency
 

1853
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,190
permissionless currency
and

1854
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,200
and
 

1855
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,509
and
the problem here is that they didn't

1856
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:33,519
the problem here is that they didn't
 

1857
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,870
the problem here is that they didn't
want any authorities and they didn't

1858
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
want any authorities and they didn't
 

1859
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,350
want any authorities and they didn't
even want any kind of privileged list of

1860
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,360
even want any kind of privileged list of
 

1861
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,990
even want any kind of privileged list of
people and so now the question is well

1862
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,000
people and so now the question is well
 

1863
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,110
people and so now the question is well
how

1864
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,120
how
 

1865
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,990
how
do you use these techniques to create

1866
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
do you use these techniques to create
 

1867
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,630
do you use these techniques to create
consensus when you have no way of kind

1868
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:46,640
consensus when you have no way of kind
 

1869
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,389
consensus when you have no way of kind
of measuring identities right you have

1870
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
of measuring identities right you have
 

1871
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,590
of measuring identities right you have
no way of

1872
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:49,600
no way of
 

1873
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,389
no way of
kind of determining whether or not some

1874
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
kind of determining whether or not some
 

1875
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,029
kind of determining whether or not some
99 of participants aren't actually all

1876
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
99 of participants aren't actually all
 

1877
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,310
99 of participants aren't actually all
the same guy

1878
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,320
the same guy
 

1879
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,789
the same guy
and so the clever solution that satoshi

1880
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:58,799
and so the clever solution that satoshi
 

1881
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,669
and so the clever solution that satoshi
had this is uh kind of going back to the

1882
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679
had this is uh kind of going back to the
 

1883
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,590
had this is uh kind of going back to the
that presentation i made at defcon a few

1884
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
that presentation i made at defcon a few
 

1885
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,750
that presentation i made at defcon a few
months ago where i said that the thing

1886
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
months ago where i said that the thing
 

1887
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,629
months ago where i said that the thing
satoshi invented with crypto economics

1888
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
satoshi invented with crypto economics
 

1889
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,829
satoshi invented with crypto economics
is this uh really neat idea that you can

1890
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
is this uh really neat idea that you can
 

1891
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,669
is this uh really neat idea that you can
use economic resources to kind of limit

1892
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
use economic resources to kind of limit
 

1893
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,069
use economic resources to kind of limit
identity how many identities you can get

1894
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:18,079
identity how many identities you can get
 

1895
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,190
identity how many identities you can get
and

1896
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
and
 

1897
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,629
and
the uh

1898
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
the uh
 

1899
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,550
the uh
if there isn't any existing

1900
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,560
if there isn't any existing
 

1901
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,550
if there isn't any existing
decentralized digital currency then the

1902
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
decentralized digital currency then the
 

1903
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,990
decentralized digital currency then the
only way to do this is with proof of

1904
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,000
only way to do this is with proof of
 

1905
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,069
only way to do this is with proof of
work right so with proof of work the

1906
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:28,079
work right so with proof of work the
 

1907
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,589
work right so with proof of work the
solution is just

1908
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:31,599

 

1909
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,030

you

1910
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,040
you
 

1911
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,750
you
publish a solution to a hard

1912
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
publish a solution to a hard
 

1913
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,550
publish a solution to a hard
mathematical puzzle that takes some uh

1914
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,560
mathematical puzzle that takes some uh
 

1915
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,869
mathematical puzzle that takes some uh
kind of clearly calculable amount of

1916
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:40,879
kind of clearly calculable amount of
 

1917
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,109
kind of clearly calculable amount of
computational power to solve you get an

1918
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
computational power to solve you get an
 

1919
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,190
computational power to solve you get an
identity and then you solve five of

1920
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
identity and then you solve five of
 

1921
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,510
identity and then you solve five of
those puzzles you get five identities

1922
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
those puzzles you get five identities
 

1923
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,589
those puzzles you get five identities
and then these are the identities that

1924
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599
and then these are the identities that
 

1925
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,990
and then these are the identities that
we run the consensus algorithm between

1926
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
we run the consensus algorithm between
 

1927
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,149
we run the consensus algorithm between
so the proof-of-work mechanism you just

1928
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159
so the proof-of-work mechanism you just
 

1929
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,310
so the proof-of-work mechanism you just
described is like the fundamental idea

1930
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,320
described is like the fundamental idea
 

1931
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,310
described is like the fundamental idea
proposed in the

1932
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
proposed in the
 

1933
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,829
proposed in the
in the white paper that defines

1934
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:00,839
in the white paper that defines
 

1935
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,270
in the white paper that defines
bitcoin uh what's the

1936
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
bitcoin uh what's the
 

1937
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,470
bitcoin uh what's the
idea of consensus that we wish to reach

1938
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
idea of consensus that we wish to reach
 

1939
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,109
idea of consensus that we wish to reach
what

1940
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
what
 

1941
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,630
what
why is consensus

1942
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:08,640
why is consensus
 

1943
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,990
why is consensus
important here what is consensus

1944
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,000
important here what is consensus
 

1945
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,430
important here what is consensus
so

1946
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:13,440
so
 

1947
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,589
so
the goal here

1948
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
the goal here
 

1949
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,790
the goal here
in just simple technical terms is to

1950
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:18,800
in just simple technical terms is to
 

1951
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,750
in just simple technical terms is to
basically kind of wire together a set of

1952
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
basically kind of wire together a set of
 

1953
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,069
basically kind of wire together a set of
a large number of computers in such a

1954
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:24,079
a large number of computers in such a
 

1955
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,990
a large number of computers in such a
way that they yeah kind of pretends to

1956
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,000
way that they yeah kind of pretends to
 

1957
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,270
way that they yeah kind of pretends to
the outside world to be a single

1958
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,280
the outside world to be a single
 

1959
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,589
the outside world to be a single
computer where that single computer

1960
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
computer where that single computer
 

1961
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,990
computer where that single computer
keeps working even if a large portion of

1962
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,000
keeps working even if a large portion of
 

1963
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,829
keeps working even if a large portion of
the kind of constituents the computers

1964
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:33,839
the kind of constituents the computers
 

1965
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,670
the kind of constituents the computers
that make it up break and kind of break

1966
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
that make it up break and kind of break
 

1967
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,069
that make it up break and kind of break
in arbitrary ways like they could shut

1968
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
in arbitrary ways like they could shut
 

1969
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,310
in arbitrary ways like they could shut
off they could uh try to actively break

1970
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,320
off they could uh try to actively break
 

1971
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,829
off they could uh try to actively break
a system they could do lots of mean

1972
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:41,839
a system they could do lots of mean
 

1973
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,030
a system they could do lots of mean
things

1974
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
things
 

1975
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,390
things
so

1976
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
so
 

1977
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,670
so
the

1978
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
the
 

1979
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,910
the
reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do

1980
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:47,920
reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do
 

1981
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,310
reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do
this is because they wanted to run one

1982
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,320
this is because they wanted to run one
 

1983
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,069
this is because they wanted to run one
particular program on this virtual

1984
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
particular program on this virtual
 

1985
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,069
particular program on this virtual
computer and the one particular program

1986
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,079
computer and the one particular program
 

1987
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,430
computer and the one particular program
that they wanted to run is just a

1988
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
that they wanted to run is just a
 

1989
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,349
that they wanted to run is just a
currency system right it's a system that

1990
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,359
currency system right it's a system that
 

1991
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,630
currency system right it's a system that
just processes a series of transactions

1992
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,640
just processes a series of transactions
 

1993
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,230
just processes a series of transactions
and for every transaction it verifies uh

1994
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,240
and for every transaction it verifies uh
 

1995
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,150
and for every transaction it verifies uh
that the sender has enough coins to pay

1996
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,160
that the sender has enough coins to pay
 

1997
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,750
that the sender has enough coins to pay
for the transaction and verifies that

1998
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
for the transaction and verifies that
 

1999
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,910
for the transaction and verifies that
the digital signature is correct and if

2000
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:09,920
the digital signature is correct and if
 

2001
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,150
the digital signature is correct and if
the check's passed then it subtracts the

2002
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,160
the check's passed then it subtracts the
 

2003
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,589
the check's passed then it subtracts the
coins from one account and adds the

2004
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:13,599
coins from one account and adds the
 

2005
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,790
coins from one account and adds the
coins to the other account roughly

2006
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:16,800
coins to the other account roughly
 

2007
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,470
coins to the other account roughly
so first of all the the the

2008
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,480
so first of all the the the
 

2009
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,790
so first of all the the the
proof-of-work idea is kind of i mean at

2010
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
proof-of-work idea is kind of i mean at
 

2011
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,470
proof-of-work idea is kind of i mean at
least to me seems

2012
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:22,480
least to me seems
 

2013
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,750
least to me seems
pretty

2014
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:23,760
pretty
 

2015
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,390
pretty
fascinating it is i mean that's a

2016
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,400
fascinating it is i mean that's a
 

2017
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,150
fascinating it is i mean that's a
it's kind of a revolutionary idea i mean

2018
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
it's kind of a revolutionary idea i mean
 

2019
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,230
it's kind of a revolutionary idea i mean
is is it is it obvious to come up with

2020
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
is is it is it obvious to come up with
 

2021
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,510
is is it is it obvious to come up with
that you can

2022
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
that you can
 

2023
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,510
that you can
use uh you can exchange basically

2024
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
use uh you can exchange basically
 

2025
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,790
use uh you can exchange basically
computational resources for

2026
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,800
computational resources for
 

2027
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,950
computational resources for
for identity

2028
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:38,960
for identity
 

2029
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,190
for identity
it's uh it actually has a pretty long

2030
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,200
it's uh it actually has a pretty long
 

2031
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,750
it's uh it actually has a pretty long
history it was uh first proposed in a

2032
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:43,760
history it was uh first proposed in a
 

2033
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,190
history it was uh first proposed in a
paper by uh

2034
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,200
paper by uh
 

2035
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,840
paper by uh
cynthia dwork and

neor in 1994 i believe and the original

2040
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:51,920
neor in 1994 i believe and the original
 

2041
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,870
neor in 1994 i believe and the original
use case was uh combating email spam so

2042
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:54,880
use case was uh combating email spam so
 

2043
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,390
use case was uh combating email spam so
the idea is that if you send an email

2044
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:56,400
the idea is that if you send an email
 

2045
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,750
the idea is that if you send an email
you have to send it with a proof of work

2046
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:57,760
you have to send it with a proof of work
 

2047
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,190
you have to send it with a proof of work
attached and

2048
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,200
attached and
 

2049
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,870
attached and
like this makes it reasonably cheap to

2050
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:00,880
like this makes it reasonably cheap to
 

2051
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,470
like this makes it reasonably cheap to
send emails to your friends but it makes

2052
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
send emails to your friends but it makes
 

2053
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,150
send emails to your friends but it makes
it really expensive to send spam to a

2054
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
it really expensive to send spam to a
 

2055
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,589
it really expensive to send spam to a
million people

2056
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,599
million people
 

2057
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,030
million people
yeah that's a

2058
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,040
yeah that's a
 

2059
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,510
yeah that's a
simple brilliant idea so maybe also

2060
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,520
simple brilliant idea so maybe also
 

2061
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,910
simple brilliant idea so maybe also
taking a step back so what is the role

2062
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920
taking a step back so what is the role
 

2063
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,390
taking a step back so what is the role
of blockchain in this

2064
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:14,400
of blockchain in this
 

2065
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,550
of blockchain in this
what is the blockchain sure so the

2066
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:16,560
what is the blockchain sure so the
 

2067
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,990
what is the blockchain sure so the
blockchain

2068
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
blockchain
 

2069
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,670
blockchain
i mean my way of thinking about it is

2070
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,680
i mean my way of thinking about it is
 

2071
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,589
i mean my way of thinking about it is
that it is this

2072
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
that it is this
 

2073
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,710
that it is this
kind of

2074
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
kind of
 

2075
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,550
kind of
system where you have this kind of one

2076
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560
system where you have this kind of one
 

2077
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,349
system where you have this kind of one
virtual computer created by this a bunch

2078
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
virtual computer created by this a bunch
 

2079
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,710
virtual computer created by this a bunch
of these uh uh nodes in the network um

2080
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:30,720
of these uh uh nodes in the network um
 

2081
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,470
of these uh uh nodes in the network um
and the reason why

2082
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:32,480
and the reason why
 

2083
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,710
and the reason why
the term blockchain is used is because

2084
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:34,720
the term blockchain is used is because
 

2085
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,790
the term blockchain is used is because
the data structure that these systems

2086
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:36,800
the data structure that these systems
 

2087
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,470
the data structure that these systems
use at least so far

2088
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:38,480
use at least so far
 

2089
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,710
use at least so far
is one uh where

2090
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
is one uh where
 

2091
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,150
is one uh where
they um even if different nodes in the

2092
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
they um even if different nodes in the
 

2093
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,630
they um even if different nodes in the
network periodically publish blocks and

2094
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:46,640
network periodically publish blocks and
 

2095
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,950
network periodically publish blocks and
a block is a kind of list of

2096
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
a block is a kind of list of
 

2097
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,270
a block is a kind of list of
transactions uh together with a pointer

2098
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,280
transactions uh together with a pointer
 

2099
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,589
transactions uh together with a pointer
like a hash of a yeah

2100
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:53,599
like a hash of a yeah
 

2101
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,349
like a hash of a yeah
a previous block that it builds on top

2102
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:55,359
a previous block that it builds on top
 

2103
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,069
a previous block that it builds on top
of

2104
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:56,079
of
 

2105
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,430
of
um and so you have a series of blocks

2106
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,440
um and so you have a series of blocks
 

2107
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,870
um and so you have a series of blocks
that that

2108
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,880
that that
 

2109
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,390
that that
nodes in the network create where each

2110
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
nodes in the network create where each
 

2111
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,990
nodes in the network create where each
block points to the previous block and

2112
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,000
block points to the previous block and
 

2113
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,750
block points to the previous block and
so you have this chain of them

2114
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:05,760
so you have this chain of them
 

2115
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,150
so you have this chain of them
is a fault tolerance

2116
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,160
is a fault tolerance
 

2117
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,750
is a fault tolerance
mechanism built into the idea of

2118
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
mechanism built into the idea of
 

2119
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,950
mechanism built into the idea of
blockchain or is there a lot of

2120
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:10,960
blockchain or is there a lot of
 

2121
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,349
blockchain or is there a lot of
possibilities of different ways to make

2122
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:13,359
possibilities of different ways to make
 

2123
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,630
possibilities of different ways to make
sure there's no

2124
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
sure there's no
 

2125
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,670
sure there's no
funny stuff going on there are indeed a

2126
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:17,680
funny stuff going on there are indeed a
 

2127
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,790
funny stuff going on there are indeed a
lot of possibilities um so in a kind of

2128
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:20,800
lot of possibilities um so in a kind of
 

2129
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,470
lot of possibilities um so in a kind of
just simple architecture as i just

2130
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,480
just simple architecture as i just
 

2131
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,069
just simple architecture as i just
described the way the fault tolerance

2132
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,079
described the way the fault tolerance
 

2133
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,230
described the way the fault tolerance
happens is like this right so

2134
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,240
happens is like this right so
 

2135
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,589
happens is like this right so
you have a bunch of nodes and they're

2136
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:27,599
you have a bunch of nodes and they're
 

2137
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,510
you have a bunch of nodes and they're
just happily and occasionally creating

2138
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:29,520
just happily and occasionally creating
 

2139
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,589
just happily and occasionally creating
blocks building on top of each other's

2140
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:31,599
blocks building on top of each other's
 

2141
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,870
blocks building on top of each other's
uh blocks

2142
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:32,880
uh blocks
 

2143
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,109
uh blocks
and let's say you have kind of one block

2144
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:35,119
and let's say you have kind of one block
 

2145
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,030
and let's say you have kind of one block
we'll call it kind of block one

2146
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,040
we'll call it kind of block one
 

2147
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,150
we'll call it kind of block one
and then

2148
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
and then
 

2149
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,150
and then
someone else builds another block on a

2150
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,160
someone else builds another block on a
 

2151
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,829
someone else builds another block on a
steel called block two

2152
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:41,839
steel called block two
 

2153
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,310
steel called block two
then we have an attacker and what the

2154
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,320
then we have an attacker and what the
 

2155
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,990
then we have an attacker and what the
attacker tries to do is the attacker

2156
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,000
attacker tries to do is the attacker
 

2157
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,069
attacker tries to do is the attacker
tries to revert block two and the way

2158
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:48,079
tries to revert block two and the way
 

2159
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,829
tries to revert block two and the way
they revert block two is instead of

2160
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:49,839
they revert block two is instead of
 

2161
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,270
they revert block two is instead of
doing the thing they're supposed to do

2162
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,280
doing the thing they're supposed to do
 

2163
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,430
doing the thing they're supposed to do
which is build a block on top of block

2164
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,440
which is build a block on top of block
 

2165
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,670
which is build a block on top of block
two they're gonna build another block on

2166
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:55,680
two they're gonna build another block on
 

2167
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,470
two they're gonna build another block on
top of block one um so you have block

2168
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:58,480
top of block one um so you have block
 

2169
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,069
top of block one um so you have block
one which has two children block two and

2170
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:00,079
one which has two children block two and
 

2171
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,550
one which has two children block two and
then block two prime now

2172
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
then block two prime now
 

2173
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,390
then block two prime now
this might sometimes even happen by

2174
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,400
this might sometimes even happen by
 

2175
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,270
this might sometimes even happen by
random chance if you know two nodes in

2176
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
random chance if you know two nodes in
 

2177
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,950
random chance if you know two nodes in
the network just happen to create blocks

2178
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
the network just happen to create blocks
 

2179
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,550
the network just happen to create blocks
at the same time and they don't hear

2180
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,560
at the same time and they don't hear
 

2181
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,150
at the same time and they don't hear
about each other's things before they

2182
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,160
about each other's things before they
 

2183
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,230
about each other's things before they
create their own but this also could

2184
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
create their own but this also could
 

2185
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,990
create their own but this also could
happen because of an attack

2186
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,000
happen because of an attack
 

2187
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,870
happen because of an attack
now

2188
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:16,880
now
 

2189
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,990
now
if this happens you have an attack then

2190
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,000
if this happens you have an attack then
 

2191
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,710
if this happens you have an attack then
the no in the bitcoin system uh the

2192
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:22,720
the no in the bitcoin system uh the
 

2193
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,150
the no in the bitcoin system uh the
nodes follow the longest chain um so if

2194
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,160
nodes follow the longest chain um so if
 

2195
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,990
nodes follow the longest chain um so if
um this um attack had happened uh and if

2196
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,000
um this um attack had happened uh and if
 

2197
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,510
um this um attack had happened uh and if
when the uh

2198
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:31,520
when the uh
 

2199
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,349
when the uh
original chain had more than two blocks

2200
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:33,359
original chain had more than two blocks
 

2201
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,790
original chain had more than two blocks
on it so if it was trying to kind of

2202
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
on it so if it was trying to kind of
 

2203
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,630
on it so if it was trying to kind of
revert more than more than two blocks

2204
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:36,640
revert more than more than two blocks
 

2205
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,710
revert more than more than two blocks
then everyone would just

2206
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:38,720
then everyone would just
 

2207
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,710
then everyone would just
would just ignore it yeah um and

2208
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:40,720
would just ignore it yeah um and
 

2209
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,829
would just ignore it yeah um and
everyone would just keep following the

2210
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:41,839
everyone would just keep following the
 

2211
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,829
everyone would just keep following the
regular chain but here you know we have

2212
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
regular chain but here you know we have
 

2213
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,349
regular chain but here you know we have
block two and we have block two prime

2214
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
block two and we have block two prime
 

2215
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,550
block two and we have block two prime
and so the two are kind of even and then

2216
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
and so the two are kind of even and then
 

2217
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,109
and so the two are kind of even and then
whatever block um the next block is

2218
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:51,119
whatever block um the next block is
 

2219
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,950
whatever block um the next block is
created on top of so say block three is

2220
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:52,960
created on top of so say block three is
 

2221
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,190
created on top of so say block three is
now created on top of block two prime

2222
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,200
now created on top of block two prime
 

2223
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,750
now created on top of block two prime
then everyone says

2224
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:57,760
then everyone says
 

2225
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,710
then everyone says
agrees that block 3 is the new head

2226
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
agrees that block 3 is the new head
 

2227
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,829
agrees that block 3 is the new head
and

2228
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839
and
 

2229
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,150
and
block 2 prime is just kind of forgotten

2230
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,160
block 2 prime is just kind of forgotten
 

2231
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,190
block 2 prime is just kind of forgotten
and then everyone just kind of

2232
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200
and then everyone just kind of
 

2233
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,790
and then everyone just kind of
peacefully builds on top of block 3 and

2234
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
peacefully builds on top of block 3 and
 

2235
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,710
peacefully builds on top of block 3 and
the thing continues so how difficult is

2236
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:08,720
the thing continues so how difficult is
 

2237
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,910
the thing continues so how difficult is
it to mess with the system

2238
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920

 

2239
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,750

so how like if we look at the general

2240
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:13,760
so how like if we look at the general
 

2241
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,990
so how like if we look at the general
problem like how many

2242
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
problem like how many
 

2243
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,950
problem like how many
what fraction of people who participate

2244
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
what fraction of people who participate
 

2245
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,349
what fraction of people who participate
in the system have to be bad

2246
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:21,359
in the system have to be bad
 

2247
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,589
in the system have to be bad
players

2248
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:23,599
players
 

2249
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,510
players
in order to mess with it truly like

2250
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:25,520
in order to mess with it truly like
 

2251
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,790
in order to mess with it truly like
what's your is there is there a good

2252
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:26,800
what's your is there is there a good
 

2253
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,710
what's your is there is there a good
number serious um

2254
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:28,720
number serious um
 

2255
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,030
number serious um
well depending on kind of what your

2256
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040
well depending on kind of what your
 

2257
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,870
well depending on kind of what your
model of the participants is and like

2258
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
model of the participants is and like
 

2259
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,470
model of the participants is and like
what kind of attack we're talking about

2260
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:34,480
what kind of attack we're talking about
 

2261
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,270
what kind of attack we're talking about
it's

2262
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,280
it's
 

2263
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,710
it's
anywhere between 23.2 and 50 percent

2264
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,720
anywhere between 23.2 and 50 percent
 

2265
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,910
anywhere between 23.2 and 50 percent
of what of all of the computing power in

2266
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:43,920
of what of all of the computing power in
 

2267
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,950
of what of all of the computing power in
the network

2268
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:44,960

computing power the network goes above

2280
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:01,359
computing power the network goes above
 

2281
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,230
computing power the network goes above
the 23.2 level then there's kind of

2282
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,240
the 23.2 level then there's kind of
 

2283
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,069
the 23.2 level then there's kind of
things that you can mean things that you

2284
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:06,079
things that you can mean things that you
 

2285
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,990
things that you can mean things that you
can potentially do and as your

2286
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,000
can potentially do and as your
 

2287
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,670
can potentially do and as your
percentage of the network kind of keeps

2288
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:09,680
percentage of the network kind of keeps
 

2289
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,150
percentage of the network kind of keeps
going up then the your abilities as you

2290
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,160
going up then the your abilities as you
 

2291
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,589
going up then the your abilities as you
mean things kind of goes higher and then

2292
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
mean things kind of goes higher and then
 

2293
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,670
mean things kind of goes higher and then
if you have above 50 then you can just

2294
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
if you have above 50 then you can just
 

2295
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,390
if you have above 50 then you can just
break everything so how hard is it to

2296
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:18,400
break everything so how hard is it to
 

2297
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,230
break everything so how hard is it to
achieve that level like it seems that

2298
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
achieve that level like it seems that
 

2299
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,150
achieve that level like it seems that
so far historically speaking has been

2300
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,160
so far historically speaking has been
 

2301
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,990
so far historically speaking has been
exceptionally difficult

2302
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,000
exceptionally difficult
 

2303
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,790
exceptionally difficult
so this is a challenging question um so

2304
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:28,800
so this is a challenging question um so
 

2305
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,910
so this is a challenging question um so
the economic cost of uh acquiring that

2306
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
the economic cost of uh acquiring that
 

2307
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,150
the economic cost of uh acquiring that
level of stuff from scratch is uh fairly

2308
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
level of stuff from scratch is uh fairly
 

2309
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,309
level of stuff from scratch is uh fairly
high i think it's uh

2310
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:36,319
high i think it's uh
 

2311
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,390
high i think it's uh
somewhere in the low billions of dollars

2312
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
somewhere in the low billions of dollars
 

2313
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,230
somewhere in the low billions of dollars
and when you say that stuff you mean

2314
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,240
and when you say that stuff you mean
 

2315
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,950
and when you say that stuff you mean
computational resources yeah so

2316
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:42,960
computational resources yeah so
 

2317
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,109
computational resources yeah so

i don't know if you're familiar or
 

2341
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,030
i don't know if you're familiar or
interested in the space what kind of

2342
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,040

asics what kind of hardware

2344
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,040
asics what kind of hardware
 

2345
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,750
asics what kind of hardware
is generally used these days for

2346
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:17,760
is generally used these days for
 

2347
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,750
is generally used these days for
to do the actual computation for the the

2348
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
to do the actual computation for the the
 

2349
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,390
to do the actual computation for the the
proof of work sure so in the case uh and

2350
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,400
proof of work sure so in the case uh and
 

2351
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,910
proof of work sure so in the case uh and
bitcoin and ethereum are a bit different

2352
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:23,920
bitcoin and ethereum are a bit different
 

2353
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,589
bitcoin and ethereum are a bit different
uh so in the case of bitcoin there is an

2354
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:25,599
uh so in the case of bitcoin there is an
 

2355
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,510
uh so in the case of bitcoin there is an
algorithm called uh

2356
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:27,520
algorithm called uh
 

2357
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,790
algorithm called uh
sha256 it's just a hash function and so

2358
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:30,800
sha256 it's just a hash function and so
 

2359
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,470
sha256 it's just a hash function and so
the puzzle is just coming up with a

2360
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:32,480
the puzzle is just coming up with a
 

2361
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,990
the puzzle is just coming up with a
number where the hash of the number is

2362
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,000
number where the hash of the number is
 

2363
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,069
number where the hash of the number is
below some threshold and so because the

2364
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
below some threshold and so because the
 

2365
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,270
below some threshold and so because the
hashes are

2366
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:37,280
hashes are
 

2367
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,109
hashes are
designed to be random you just have to

2368
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
designed to be random you just have to
 

2369
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,870
designed to be random you just have to
keep on trying different numbers until

2370
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:40,880
keep on trying different numbers until
 

2371
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,069
keep on trying different numbers until
one works

2372
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
one works
 

2373
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,510
one works
and the

2374
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:43,520
and the
 

2375
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,589
and the
are just like specialized circuits that

2376
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
are just like specialized circuits that
 

2377
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,550
are just like specialized circuits that

00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:50,480
circuits for evaluating this hash over
 

2381
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,990
circuits for evaluating this hash over
and over again and you have like

2382
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,000
and over again and you have like
 

2383
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,510
and over again and you have like
millions or billions of these hash

2384
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:53,520
millions or billions of these hash
 

2385

order group so

2438
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:55,520
order group so
 

2439
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,750
order group so
it breaks a lot of kind of cryptographic

2440
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:57,760
it breaks a lot of kind of cryptographic
 

2441
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,670
it breaks a lot of kind of cryptographic
nice things that we're used to

2442
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,680
nice things that we're used to
 

2443
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,030
nice things that we're used to
but the good news is that for every kind

2444
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,040
but the good news is that for every kind
 

2445
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,150
but the good news is that for every kind
of major use of uh things that shore's

2446
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,160
of major use of uh things that shore's
 

2447
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,790
of major use of uh things that shore's
algorithm breaks we already know of uh

2448
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:08,800
algorithm breaks we already know of uh
 

2449
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,109
algorithm breaks we already know of uh
quantum proof alternatives right now we

2450
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:11,119
quantum proof alternatives right now we
 

2451
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,150
quantum proof alternatives right now we
don't use these quantum proof

2452
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,160
don't use these quantum proof
 

2453
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,990
don't use these quantum proof
alternatives yet because in many cases

2454
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
alternatives yet because in many cases
 

2455
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,190
alternatives yet because in many cases
they're five to ten times what's

00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
they're five to ten times what's

the second algorithm that is relevant to
 

2471
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,030
the second algorithm that is relevant to

00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,040
cryptography is grover's algorithm and
 

2473
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,750
cryptography is grover's algorithm and
and grover's algorithm might even be

2474
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,760
and grover's algorithm might even be
 

2475
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,589
and grover's algorithm might even be
kind of more familiar to ai people

00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
kind of more familiar to ai people
 

2477
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,309
kind of more familiar to ai people
that's basically usually described as

that's basically usually described as
 

2479
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,349
that's basically usually described as
solving search problems um but the idea

2480
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:45,359
solving search problems um but the idea
 

2481
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,390
solving search problems um but the idea
here is so that if you have a problem

2482
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,400
here is so that if you have a problem
 

2483
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,870
here is so that if you have a problem
over the form finds a number that

over the form finds a number that
 

2485
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,230
over the form finds a number that
satisfies some property um then if with

00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:22,240
we'll just mine way faster than everyone
 

2511
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,870
we'll just mine way faster than everyone
else and we'll see another round of uh

2512
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:24,880
else and we'll see another round of uh
 

2513
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,790
else and we'll see another round of uh
what we saw when asics came out which is

2514
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:26,800
what we saw when asics came out which is
 

2515
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,069
what we saw when asics came out which is
that's kind of the new hardware just

2516
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:28,079
that's kind of the new hardware just
 

2517
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,309
that's kind of the new hardware just
kind of dominated the old stuff and then

2518
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319
kind of dominated the old stuff and then
 

2519
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,510
kind of dominated the old stuff and then
eventually it switched to a new

2520
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520
eventually it switched to a new
 

2521
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,710
eventually it switched to a new
equilibrium but by the way way faster

2522
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:34,720
equilibrium but by the way way faster
 

2523
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,790

not exponentially faster quadratically

2524
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:36,800
not exponentially faster quadratically
 

2525
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,349
not exponentially faster quadratically
faster quadratically faster which is not

2526
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:39,359
faster quadratically faster which is not
 

2527
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,349
faster quadratically faster which is not
sort of uh

2528
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:41,359
sort of uh
 

2529
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,990
sort of uh
it's not game-changing i would say it's

2530
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,000
it's not game-changing i would say it's
 

2531
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,670
it's not game-changing i would say it's
like asics like you said it would be

2532
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:45,680
like asics like you said it would be
 

2533
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,550
like asics like you said it would be
exactly

2534
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
exactly
 

2535
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,030
exactly
yeah so it would not necessarily break

2536
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
yeah so it would not necessarily break
 

2537
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,630
yeah so it would not necessarily break
proof of work as of that's right yeah

2538
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:50,640
proof of work as of that's right yeah
 

2539
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,910
proof of work as of that's right yeah
now the other

2540
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:51,920
now the other
 

2541
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,069
now the other
kind of possible world right is that

2542
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,079
kind of possible world right is that
 

2543
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,230
kind of possible world right is that
quantum computers have a lot of overhead

2544
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,240
quantum computers have a lot of overhead
 

2545
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,790
quantum computers have a lot of overhead
there's a lot of complexity involved in

2546
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:58,800
there's a lot of complexity involved in
 

2547
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,630
there's a lot of complexity involved in
maintaining quantum states and there's

2548
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:00,640
maintaining quantum states and there's
 

2549
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,589
maintaining quantum states and there's
also

2550
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:01,599
also
 

2551
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,309
also
as we've been realizing recently

2552
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,319
as we've been realizing recently
 

2553
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,790
as we've been realizing recently
making quantum computers requ actually

2554
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:06,800
making quantum computers requ actually
 

2555
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,390
making quantum computers requ actually
work requires kind of quantum era

2556
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
work requires kind of quantum era
 

2557
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,230
work requires kind of quantum era
correction which requires kind of a

2558
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,240
correction which requires kind of a
 

2559
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,030
correction which requires kind of a
thousand real qubits per logical qubit

2560
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:13,040
thousand real qubits per logical qubit
 

2561
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,829
thousand real qubits per logical qubit
and so there's the very real possibility

2562
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
and so there's the very real possibility
 

2563
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,510
and so there's the very real possibility
that the overhead of running a quantum

2564
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:17,520
that the overhead of running a quantum
 

2565
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,349
that the overhead of running a quantum
computer will be higher than the speed

2566
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:19,359
computer will be higher than the speed
 

2567
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,510
computer will be higher than the speed
up you get with grovers which would be

2568
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
up you get with grovers which would be
 

2569
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,190
up you get with grovers which would be
kind of sad but which would also mean

2570
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:23,200
kind of sad but which would also mean
 

2571
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,870
kind of sad but which would also mean
that given proof of work would just keep

2572
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:24,880
that given proof of work would just keep
 

2573
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,470
that given proof of work would just keep
working fine

2574
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,480
working fine
 

2575
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,589
working fine
so

2576
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:27,599
so
 

2577
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,510
so
they're beautifully put so so proof of

2578
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:29,520
they're beautifully put so so proof of
 

2579
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,390
they're beautifully put so so proof of
work

2580
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:30,400
work
 

2581
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,390
work
is uh the core idea of bitcoin is there

2582
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400
is uh the core idea of bitcoin is there
 

2583
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,550
is uh the core idea of bitcoin is there
other core ideas before we kind of take

2584
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:34,560
other core ideas before we kind of take
 

2585
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,550
other core ideas before we kind of take
a step towards the origin story and the

2586
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:36,560
a step towards the origin story and the
 

2587
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,109
a step towards the origin story and the
ideas of ethereum is there other stuff

2588
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:39,119
ideas of ethereum is there other stuff
 

2589
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,190
ideas of ethereum is there other stuff
that uh were key to the white paper of

2590
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,200
that uh were key to the white paper of
 

2591
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,190
that uh were key to the white paper of
bitcoin there's proof of work and then

2592
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,200
bitcoin there's proof of work and then
 

2593
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,030
bitcoin there's proof of work and then
there's just the cryptography just kind

2594
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
there's just the cryptography just kind
 

2595
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,270
there's just the cryptography just kind
of public keys and signatures that are

2596
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,280
of public keys and signatures that are
 

2597
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,230
of public keys and signatures that are
used to uh verify transactions those two

2598
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:50,240
used to uh verify transactions those two
 

2599
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,430

really big things

2600

so then what is um
 

2603
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,829
so then what is um
the origin story maybe the human side

2604
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
the origin story maybe the human side
 

2605
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,550
the origin story maybe the human side
but also the technical side of ethereum

2606
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
but also the technical side of ethereum
 

2607
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,829

maybe just a small tangent

2646
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:39,119
maybe just a small tangent
 

2647

that just always been a core feeling
 

2659
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,950

that decentralized control is the future

2660
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:52,960
that decentralized control is the future
 

2661

2677
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,390
writing
so what was next

2678
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,400
so what was next
 

2679
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,309
so what was next
started writing uh

2680
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:12,319

00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:37,119
about six months and just going to
 

2703
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,190
about six months and just going to
different bitcoin communities like i

2704
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:39,200
different bitcoin communities like i
 

2705
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,430
different bitcoin communities like i
went to uh first in new hampshire and

2706
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:41,440
went to uh first in new hampshire and

other people that are working on
 

2715
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,109
other people that are working on
different bitcoin projects and when i

2716
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:51,119
different bitcoin projects and when i
 

2717
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,230
different bitcoin projects and when i
was in israel there were some very smart

2718
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:54,240
was in israel there were some very smart
 

2719
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,109
was in israel there were some very smart
teams there that were working on ideas

2720
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:57,119
teams there that were working on ideas
 

2721
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,870
teams there that were working on ideas
that people were starting to kind of

2722
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:58,880
that people were starting to kind of
 

2723
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,589
that people were starting to kind of
call bitcoin 2.0 so one of these were

2724
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:01,599
call bitcoin 2.0 so one of these were
 

2725
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,670
call bitcoin 2.0 so one of these were
covered coins which is basically saying

2726
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:03,680
covered coins which is basically saying
 

2727
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,549
covered coins which is basically saying
that hey let's uh not just use the

2728
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:06,559
that hey let's uh not just use the
 

2729
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,309
that hey let's uh not just use the
blockchain for bitcoin but let's also

2730
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:08,319
blockchain for bitcoin but let's also
 

2731
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,150
blockchain for bitcoin but let's also
kind of issue other kinds of assets on

2732
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
kind of issue other kinds of assets on
 

2733
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,069
kind of issue other kinds of assets on
it and then there was a protocol called

2734
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:12,079
it and then there was a protocol called
 

2735
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,870
it and then there was a protocol called
mastercoin that supported issuing assets

2736
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:14,880
mastercoin that supported issuing assets
 

2737
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,109
mastercoin that supported issuing assets
but also supported many other things

2738
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:17,119
but also supported many other things
 

2739
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,349
but also supported many other things
like financial contracts like domain

2740
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:19,359
like financial contracts like domain
 

2741
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,910
like financial contracts like domain
name registration and a lot of different

2742
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:21,920
name registration and a lot of different
 

2743
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,349
name registration and a lot of different
things together

2744
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:23,359
things together
 

2745
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,150
things together
and

2746
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,160
and
 

2747
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,230
and
i

2748
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:26,240
i
 

2749
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,630
i
spent some time working with these teams

2750
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
spent some time working with these teams
 

2751
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,950
spent some time working with these teams
and i quickly kind of realized that

2752
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:32,960
and i quickly kind of realized that
 

2753
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,630
and i quickly kind of realized that
this mastercoin protocol could be

2754
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:34,640
this mastercoin protocol could be
 

2755
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,870
this mastercoin protocol could be
improved by kind of generalizing it more

2756
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:36,880
improved by kind of generalizing it more
 

2757
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,870
improved by kind of generalizing it more
right so the master the analogy i use is

2758
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
right so the master the analogy i use is
 

2759
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,390
right so the master the analogy i use is
that the master coin protocol was like

2760
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:40,400
that the master coin protocol was like
 

2761
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,230
that the master coin protocol was like
the swiss army knife you have

2762
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
the swiss army knife you have
 

2763
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,470
the swiss army knife you have
25 different transaction types for 25

2764
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,480
25 different transaction types for 25
 

2765
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,309
25 different transaction types for 25
different applications

2766
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:46,319
different applications
 

2767
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,190
different applications
but

2768
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:47,200
but
 

2769
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,430
but
what i realized is that you could

2770
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:49,440
what i realized is that you could
 

2771
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,750
what i realized is that you could
replace a bunch of them with things that

2772
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:51,760
replace a bunch of them with things that
 

2773
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,990
replace a bunch of them with things that
are more general purpose so one of them

2774
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:54,000
are more general purpose so one of them
 

2775
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,309
are more general purpose so one of them
was that you could replace

2776
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:56,319
was that you could replace
 

2777
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,390
was that you could replace
like three transaction types for three

2778
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,400
like three transaction types for three
 

2779
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,309
like three transaction types for three
types of financial contracts with a

2780
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:00,319
types of financial contracts with a
 

2781
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,109
types of financial contracts with a
generic transaction type for a financial

2782
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:03,119
generic transaction type for a financial
 

2783
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,950
generic transaction type for a financial
contract that just lets you specify a

2784
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:04,960
contract that just lets you specify a
 

2785
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,829
contract that just lets you specify a
mathematical formula for kind of who

2786
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:07,839
mathematical formula for kind of who
 

2787
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,990
mathematical formula for kind of who
how much money each side gets by the way

2788
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,000
how much money each side gets by the way
 

2789
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,230
how much money each side gets by the way
it's a small pause what's you say

2790
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:12,240
it's a small pause what's you say
 

2791
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,390
it's a small pause what's you say
financial contract just the terminology

2792
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:14,400
financial contract just the terminology
 

2793
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,990
financial contract just the terminology
what is the contract

2794
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,000
what is the contract
 

2795
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,030
what is the contract
um what's a financial contract so the

2796
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:19,040
um what's a financial contract so the
 

2797
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,190
um what's a financial contract so the
this is just generally an agreement

2798
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,200
this is just generally an agreement
 

2799
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,270
this is just generally an agreement
where kind of

2800
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
where kind of
 

2801
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,030
where kind of
either one or two parties kind of put

2802
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:25,040
either one or two parties kind of put
 

2803
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,630
either one or two parties kind of put
collateral kind of in um and then

2804
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640
collateral kind of in um and then
 

2805
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,270
collateral kind of in um and then
they depending on and if certain

2806
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,280
they depending on and if certain
 

2807
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,790
they depending on and if certain
conditions like this could involve

2808
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:32,800
conditions like this could involve
 

2809
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,470
conditions like this could involve
prices of assets this could involve

2810
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:34,480
prices of assets this could involve
 

2811
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,870
prices of assets this could involve
different the actions of the two parties

2812
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:36,880
different the actions of the two parties
 

2813
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,950
different the actions of the two parties
it could involve other things

2814
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:38,960
it could involve other things
 

2815
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,109
it could involve other things
but they kind of get different amounts

2816
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:41,119
but they kind of get different amounts
 

2817
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,150
but they kind of get different amounts
of uh

2818
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:42,160
of uh
 

2819
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,230
of uh
of assets out that it'll just depend on

2820
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,240
of assets out that it'll just depend on
 

2821
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,990
of assets out that it'll just depend on
things that happened so a contract is

2822
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,000
things that happened so a contract is
 

2823
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,230
things that happened so a contract is
really a financial contract is the is at

2824
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:48,240
really a financial contract is the is at
 

2825
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,109
really a financial contract is the is at
the core it's the it's the core

2826
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:51,119
the core it's the it's the core
 

2827
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,950
the core it's the it's the core
interactive element of a financial

2828
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:52,960
interactive element of a financial
 

2829
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,270
interactive element of a financial
system yeah there's yeah there's many

2830
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:55,280
system yeah there's yeah there's many
 

2831
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,190
system yeah there's yeah there's many
different kinds of financial contracts

2832
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,200
different kinds of financial contracts
 

2833
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,950
different kinds of financial contracts
like there's things like options where

2834
00:50:58,950 --> 00:50:58,960
like there's things like options where
 

2835
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,109
like there's things like options where
you kind of give someone the right to

2836
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:01,119
you kind of give someone the right to
 

2837
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,390
you kind of give someone the right to
buy a thing that you have for some

2838
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,400
buy a thing that you have for some
 

2839
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,230
buy a thing that you have for some
specific price for some period of time

2840
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
specific price for some period of time
 

2841
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,670
specific price for some period of time
there's uh

2842
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:05,680
there's uh
 

2843
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,349
there's uh
contracts for

2844
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:07,359
contracts for
 

2845
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,430
contracts for
difference where you

2846
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
difference where you
 

2847
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,349
difference where you
basically are kind of making a bet that

2848
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
basically are kind of making a bet that
 

2849
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,510
basically are kind of making a bet that
says like for every dollar this thing

2850
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:13,520
says like for every dollar this thing
 

2851
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,270
says like for every dollar this thing
goes up i'll give you seven dollars or

2852
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,280
goes up i'll give you seven dollars or
 

2853
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,470
goes up i'll give you seven dollars or
for every dollar that thing goes down

2854
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:16,480
for every dollar that thing goes down
 

2855
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,990
for every dollar that thing goes down
you give me seven dollars or something

2856
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,000
you give me seven dollars or something
 

2857
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,270
you give me seven dollars or something
like that

2858
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,280
like that
 

2859
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,190
like that
and but the main idea that these

2860
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:21,200
and but the main idea that these
 

2861
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,950
and but the main idea that these
contracts have to be enforced and

2862
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:22,960
contracts have to be enforced and
 

2863
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,910
contracts have to be enforced and
trusted

2864
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:23,920
trusted
 

2865
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,510
trusted
yes exactly

2866
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
yes exactly
 

2867
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,270
yes exactly
you have to trust that they will work

2868
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
you have to trust that they will work
 

2869
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,950
you have to trust that they will work
out in a system where nobody can be

2870
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
out in a system where nobody can be
 

2871
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,349
out in a system where nobody can be
trusted yes

2872
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:31,359
trusted yes
 

2873
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,309
trusted yes
this is

2874
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:32,319
this is
 

2875
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,309
this is
such a beautiful complicated system okay

2876
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:34,319
such a beautiful complicated system okay
 

2877
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,870
such a beautiful complicated system okay
so uh so you were seeking to kind of

2878
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:36,880
so uh so you were seeking to kind of
 

2879
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,069
so uh so you were seeking to kind of
generalize this basic uh framework of

2880
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:40,079
generalize this basic uh framework of
 

2881
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,069
generalize this basic uh framework of
contracts

2882
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:42,079
contracts
 

2883
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,910
contracts
so what does that

2884
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:43,920
so what does that
 

2885
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,630
so what does that
entail so what what technically are the

2886
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:46,640
entail so what what technically are the
 

2887
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,829
entail so what what technically are the
steps to creating ethereum

2888
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:49,839
steps to creating ethereum
 

2889
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,670
steps to creating ethereum
so i guess just to kind of continue a

2890
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:51,680
so i guess just to kind of continue a
 

2891
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,670
so i guess just to kind of continue a
bit with this master coin story sure um

2892
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,680
bit with this master coin story sure um
 

2893
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,390
bit with this master coin story sure um
so

2894
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:54,400
so
 

2895
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,390
so
started by end of giving ideas for how

2896
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
started by end of giving ideas for how
 

2897
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,589
started by end of giving ideas for how
to generalize the thing and eventually

2898
00:51:59,589 --> 00:51:59,599
to generalize the thing and eventually
 

2899
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,990
to generalize the thing and eventually
um this turned into a much more kind of

2900
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:02,000
um this turned into a much more kind of
 

2901
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,670
um this turned into a much more kind of
fully fledged proposal that just says

2902
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:03,680
fully fledged proposal that just says
 

2903
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,950
fully fledged proposal that just says
hey how about you scrap all your

2904
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:04,960
hey how about you scrap all your
 

2905
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,870
hey how about you scrap all your
features and instead you just

2906
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:06,880
features and instead you just
 

2907
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,430
features and instead you just
um put in this programming language and

2908
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
um put in this programming language and
 

2909
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,750
um put in this programming language and
i gave this idea to them and their

2910
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:11,760
i gave this idea to them and their
 

2911
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,150
i gave this idea to them and their
response was something like hey this is

2912
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
response was something like hey this is
 

2913
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,870
response was something like hey this is
great but this seems complicated and it

2914
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,880
great but this seems complicated and it
 

2915
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,230
great but this seems complicated and it
seems like something that's we're not

2916
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:18,240
seems like something that's we're not
 

2917
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,829
seems like something that's we're not
going to be able to put onto our roadmap

2918
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839
going to be able to put onto our roadmap
 

2919
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,990
going to be able to put onto our roadmap
for a while and my response to this was

2920
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,000
for a while and my response to this was
 

2921
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,589
for a while and my response to this was
like wait do you not realize how

2922
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:23,599
like wait do you not realize how
 

2923
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,510
like wait do you not realize how
revolutionary this is well just go do it

2924
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:25,520
revolutionary this is well just go do it
 

2925
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,470
revolutionary this is well just go do it
myself

2926
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:26,480
myself
 

2927
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,069
myself
and then i

2928
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
and then i
 

2929
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,829
and then i
was the name of the programming language

2930
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:29,839
was the name of the programming language
 

2931
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,470
was the name of the programming language
i just called it ultimate scripting

2932
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:32,480
i just called it ultimate scripting
 

2933
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,870
i just called it ultimate scripting
great uh so

2934
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:34,880
great uh so
 

2935
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,710
great uh so
then i

2936
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
then i
 

2937
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,150
then i
kind of went through a couple more

2938
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:38,160
kind of went through a couple more
 

2939
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,390
kind of went through a couple more
rounds of iteration and

2940
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,400
rounds of iteration and
 

2941
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,390
rounds of iteration and
then the idea for ethereum itself

2942
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:42,400
then the idea for ethereum itself
 

2943
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,270
then the idea for ethereum itself
started to form um and

2944
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:45,280
started to form um and
 

2945
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,470
started to form um and
the idea here is that you just have a

2946
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:48,480
the idea here is that you just have a
 

2947
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,030
the idea here is that you just have a
blockchain where the core unit of the

2948
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,040
blockchain where the core unit of the
 

2949
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,109
blockchain where the core unit of the
thing is what we call contracts it's

2950
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:53,119
thing is what we call contracts it's
 

2951
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,910
thing is what we call contracts it's
these and if accounts that can hold

2952
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:55,920
these and if accounts that can hold
 

2953
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,470
these and if accounts that can hold
assets and like like have their own

2954
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:58,480
assets and like like have their own
 

2955
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,549
assets and like like have their own
internal memory but that are controlled

2956
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:00,559
internal memory but that are controlled
 

2957
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,510
internal memory but that are controlled
by a piece of code and so

2958
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
by a piece of code and so
 

2959
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,069
by a piece of code and so
if i send some ether to a contract the

2960
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:06,079
if i send some ether to a contract the
 

2961
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,630
if i send some ether to a contract the
only thing that can determine where that

2962
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
only thing that can determine where that
 

2963
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,950
only thing that can determine where that
kind of ether and the currency inside

2964
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:10,960
kind of ether and the currency inside
 

2965
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,710
kind of ether and the currency inside
ethereum and it goes after that um is

2966
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,720
ethereum and it goes after that um is
 

2967
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,069
ethereum and it goes after that um is
the code of that contract itself and so

2968
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
the code of that contract itself and so
 

2969
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,630
the code of that contract itself and so
basically you're kind of sending assets

2970
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640
basically you're kind of sending assets
 

2971
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,069
basically you're kind of sending assets
to computer programs becomes this kind

2972
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:24,079
to computer programs becomes this kind
 

2973
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,549
to computer programs becomes this kind
of paradigm for creating the incentive

2974
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:26,559
of paradigm for creating the incentive
 

2975
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,950
of paradigm for creating the incentive
agreement self-executing agreements

2976
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:28,960
agreement self-executing agreements
 

2977
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,589
agreement self-executing agreements
self-executing it's so cool that code is

2978
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:31,599
self-executing it's so cool that code is
 

2979
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,069
self-executing it's so cool that code is
sort of part of this contract

2980
00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:34,079
sort of part of this contract
 

2981
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,589
sort of part of this contract
so that that's what's meant by smart

2982
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:35,599
so that that's what's meant by smart
 

2983
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,430
so that that's what's meant by smart
contracts yeah

2984
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:37,440
contracts yeah
 

2985
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,670
contracts yeah
so how hard was it to build this kind of

2986
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:39,680
so how hard was it to build this kind of
 

2987
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,549
so how hard was it to build this kind of
thing harder than expected um and

2988
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559
thing harder than expected um and
 

2989
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,150
thing harder than expected um and
originally i actually thought that this

2990
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:44,160
originally i actually thought that this
 

2991
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,150
originally i actually thought that this
would be a thing that i would kind of

2992
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:46,160
would be a thing that i would kind of
 

2993
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,990
would be a thing that i would kind of
casually work on for a couple of months

2994
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
casually work on for a couple of months
 

2995
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,309
casually work on for a couple of months
publish and then go back to university

2996
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
publish and then go back to university
 

2997
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:51,750
publish and then go back to university
um

2998
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:51,760
um
 

2999
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,790
um
then

3000
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
then
 

3001
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,870
then
i released it and

3002
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:54,880
i released it and
 

3003
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,710
i released it and
a bunch of people or i released a white

3004
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:56,720
a bunch of people or i released a white
 

3005
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,630
a bunch of people or i released a white
paper white paper there is there the

3006
00:53:58,630 --> 00:53:58,640
paper white paper there is there the
 

3007
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,109
paper white paper there is there the
idea the white paper um a whole bunch of

3008
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:01,119
idea the white paper um a whole bunch of
 

3009
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,030
idea the white paper um a whole bunch of
people came in offering to help a huge

3010
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040
people came in offering to help a huge
 

3011
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,630
people came in offering to help a huge
number of people and have expressed

3012
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:04,640
number of people and have expressed
 

3013
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,470
number of people and have expressed
interest and this was something i was

3014
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:06,480
interest and this was something i was
 

3015
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,230
interest and this was something i was
totally not expecting

3016
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:08,240
totally not expecting
 

3017
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,510
totally not expecting
and

3018
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:09,520
and
 

3019
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,829
and
then i kind of realized that this would

3020
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839
then i kind of realized that this would
 

3021
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,589
then i kind of realized that this would
be something that's kind of much bigger

3022
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:13,599
be something that's kind of much bigger
 

3023
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,750
be something that's kind of much bigger
than i had ever

3024
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
than i had ever
 

3025
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,790
than i had ever
thought that it would be and

3026
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:18,800
thought that it would be and
 

3027
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,710
thought that it would be and
then we started on this kind of much

3028
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:20,720
then we started on this kind of much
 

3029
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,270
then we started on this kind of much
longer developments log of making

3030
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,280
longer developments log of making
 

3031
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,870
longer developments log of making
something that

3032
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:24,880
something that
 

3033
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,630
something that
lives up to this sort of much higher

3034
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:26,640
lives up to this sort of much higher
 

3035
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,790
lives up to this sort of much higher
level of expectations what are the some

3036
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:28,800
level of expectations what are the some
 

3037
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,390
level of expectations what are the some
of the

3038
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:30,400
of the
 

3039
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,829
of the
is it fundamentally like software

3040
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
is it fundamentally like software
 

3041
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,990
is it fundamentally like software
engineering challenges it was there

3042
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,000
engineering challenges it was there
 

3043
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,270
engineering challenges it was there
social okay so there's social

3044
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,280
social okay so there's social
 

3045
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,270
social okay so there's social
so so what are the biggest interesting

3046
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:39,280
so so what are the biggest interesting
 

3047
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,829
so so what are the biggest interesting
challenges that you've learned about

3048
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:41,839
challenges that you've learned about
 

3049
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,150
challenges that you've learned about
human civilization and in software

3050
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,160
human civilization and in software
 

3051
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,349
human civilization and in software
engineering through this process

3052
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:47,359
engineering through this process
 

3053
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,430
engineering through this process
so i guess

3054
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
so i guess
 

3055
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,030
so i guess
one of the challenges for me is that

3056
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:51,040
one of the challenges for me is that
 

3057
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,829
one of the challenges for me is that
like i'm one of the kind of apparently

3058
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:53,839
like i'm one of the kind of apparently
 

3059
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,910
like i'm one of the kind of apparently
unusual geeks who was kind of never

3060
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:55,920
unusual geeks who was kind of never
 

3061
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,750
unusual geeks who was kind of never
treated with anything but kindness in

3062
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:57,760
treated with anything but kindness in
 

3063
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,150
treated with anything but kindness in
school yes um and so

3064
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
school yes um and so
 

3065
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,390
school yes um and so
when i

3066
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
when i
 

3067
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,630
when i
got into crypto i kind of expected

3068
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:04,640
got into crypto i kind of expected
 

3069
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,789
got into crypto i kind of expected
everyone would just kind of be the same

3070
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:06,799
everyone would just kind of be the same
 

3071
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,630
everyone would just kind of be the same
kind of altruistic and nice in that same

3072
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:08,640
kind of altruistic and nice in that same
 

3073
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,030
kind of altruistic and nice in that same
way um but

3074
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
way um but
 

3075
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,549
way um but
the um and if the algorithm that i used

3076
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:14,559
the um and if the algorithm that i used
 

3077
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,309
the um and if the algorithm that i used
for finding co-founders for this thing

3078
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:16,319
for finding co-founders for this thing
 

3079
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,589
for finding co-founders for this thing
was not very good it was sort of

3080
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
was not very good it was sort of
 

3081
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,109
was not very good it was sort of
literally one computer scientist called

3082
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
literally one computer scientist called
 

3083
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,430
literally one computer scientist called
the greedy algorithm it's kind of the

3084
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:21,440
the greedy algorithm it's kind of the
 

3085
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,109
the greedy algorithm it's kind of the
first 15 people who applied back

3086
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:23,119
first 15 people who applied back
 

3087
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,470
first 15 people who applied back
offering to help kind of are the

3088
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:24,480
offering to help kind of are the
 

3089
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,069
offering to help kind of are the
co-founders oh you mean like literally

3090
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:26,079
co-founders oh you mean like literally
 

3091
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,069
co-founders oh you mean like literally
the the the people

3092
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
the the the people
 

3093
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,710
the the the people
that four will form to be the the

3094
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
that four will form to be the the
 

3095
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,710
that four will form to be the the
founders co-founders of the community

3096
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,720
founders co-founders of the community
 

3097
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,390
founders co-founders of the community
the algorithm i like how you call it the

3098
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:34,400
the algorithm i like how you call it the
 

3099
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,309
the algorithm i like how you call it the
algorithm yeah um

3100
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:36,319
algorithm yeah um
 

3101
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,270
algorithm yeah um
and so

3102
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
and so
 

3103
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,230
and so
what happened uh was that uh

3104
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
what happened uh was that uh
 

3105
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,109
what happened uh was that uh
these

3106
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:41,119
these
 

3107
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,309
these
um

3108
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:42,319
um
 

3109
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,150
um
like especially as the projects got

3110
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
like especially as the projects got
 

3111
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,829
like especially as the projects got
really big like there started to be a

3112
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:45,839
really big like there started to be a
 

3113
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,510
really big like there started to be a
lot of this kind of infighting and there

3114
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
lot of this kind of infighting and there
 

3115
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,349
lot of this kind of infighting and there
are a lot of like i

3116
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
are a lot of like i
 

3117
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,190
are a lot of like i
wanted the thing to be a non-profit and

3118
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:51,200
wanted the thing to be a non-profit and
 

3119
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,349
wanted the thing to be a non-profit and
some of them wanted to be a for-profit

3120
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:53,359
some of them wanted to be a for-profit
 

3121
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,190
some of them wanted to be a for-profit
um and then

3122
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,200
um and then
 

3123
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,630
um and then
there started to be people who were just

3124
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
there started to be people who were just
 

3125
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,470
there started to be people who were just
kind of totally unable to work with each

3126
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:58,480
kind of totally unable to work with each
 

3127
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,309
kind of totally unable to work with each
other there

3128
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:00,319
other there
 

3129
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,270
other there
were

3130
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:01,280
were
 

3131
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,030
were
people that were kind of trying to get

3132
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,040
people that were kind of trying to get
 

3133
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,789
people that were kind of trying to get
an advantage for themselves in a lot of

3134
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:04,799
an advantage for themselves in a lot of
 

3135
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,710
an advantage for themselves in a lot of
different ways and

3136
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:06,720
different ways and
 

3137
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,910
different ways and
this uh

3138
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:07,920
this uh
 

3139
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,789
this uh
just

3140
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:08,799
just
 

3141
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,630
just
about six months later led to this big

3142
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
about six months later led to this big
 

3143
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,789
about six months later led to this big
governance crisis and then we kind of

3144
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:12,799
governance crisis and then we kind of
 

3145
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,870
governance crisis and then we kind of
reshuffled leadership a bit

3146
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:14,880
reshuffled leadership a bit
 

3147
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,990
reshuffled leadership a bit
and then uh the project kept on going

3148
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:18,000
and then uh the project kept on going
 

3149
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,589
and then uh the project kept on going
then nine months later there was another

3150
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:19,599
then nine months later there was another
 

3151
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,109
then nine months later there was another
governance crisis and then there was a

3152
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:21,119
governance crisis and then there was a
 

3153
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,270
governance crisis and then there was a
third governance crisis and

3154
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
third governance crisis and
 

3155
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,349
third governance crisis and
so is there a way to

3156
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:25,359
so is there a way to
 

3157
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,549
so is there a way to
if you're looking at the human side of

3158
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:26,559
if you're looking at the human side of
 

3159
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,349
if you're looking at the human side of
things

3160
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:27,359
things
 

3161
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,630
things
is there a way to optimize this aspect

3162
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:30,640
is there a way to optimize this aspect
 

3163
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,470
is there a way to optimize this aspect
of the cryptocurrency world it seems

3164
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:32,480
of the cryptocurrency world it seems
 

3165
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,230
of the cryptocurrency world it seems
that there is

3166
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240
that there is
 

3167
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,150
that there is
from my perspective there's a lot of

3168
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,160
from my perspective there's a lot of
 

3169
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,470
from my perspective there's a lot of
different characters and personalities

3170
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:38,480
different characters and personalities
 

3171
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,270
different characters and personalities
and egos and like you said uh

3172
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
and egos and like you said uh
 

3173
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,030
and egos and like you said uh
i don't know if

3174
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:43,040
i don't know if
 

3175
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,990
i don't know if
you know i also like just think that

3176
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:46,000
you know i also like just think that
 

3177
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,910
you know i also like just think that
most of the world most of the people in

3178
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:47,920
most of the world most of the people in
 

3179
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,069
most of the world most of the people in
the world are well intentioned

3180
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:50,079
the world are well intentioned
 

3181
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,589
the world are well intentioned
but the way those intentions are

3182
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
but the way those intentions are
 

3183
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,549
but the way those intentions are
realized may perhaps come off as uh

3184
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:54,559
realized may perhaps come off as uh
 

3185
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,950
realized may perhaps come off as uh
yeah as as negative like what uh

3186
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:58,960
yeah as as negative like what uh
 

3187
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,030
yeah as as negative like what uh
is there is there a hopeful message here

3188
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:01,040
is there is there a hopeful message here
 

3189
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,190
is there is there a hopeful message here
about creating a governance structure

3190
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:03,200
about creating a governance structure
 

3191
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,349
about creating a governance structure
for cryptocurrency that uh where

3192
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
for cryptocurrency that uh where
 

3193
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:06,789
for cryptocurrency that uh where
everyone gets along

3194
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:06,799
everyone gets along
 

3195
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,430
everyone gets along
and after about four rounds of reshuffle

3196
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
and after about four rounds of reshuffle
 

3197
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,710
and after about four rounds of reshuffle
i think we've actually

3198
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720
i think we've actually
 

3199
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,470
i think we've actually
come up with something that seems to be

3200
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,480
come up with something that seems to be
 

3201
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,230
come up with something that seems to be
pretty stable and happy

3202
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,240
pretty stable and happy
 

3203
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,270
pretty stable and happy
um

3204
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:15,280
um
 

3205
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,950
um
i think

3206
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960

 

3207
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,990

i mean

3208
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,000
i mean
 

3209
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,470
i mean
i definitely do think that most people

3210
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:22,480
i definitely do think that most people
 

3211
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,309
i definitely do think that most people
are well intentioned i just think that

3212
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:24,319
are well intentioned i just think that
 

3213
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,190
are well intentioned i just think that
like

3214
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:25,200
like
 

3215
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,510
like
one of the reasons why i like

3216
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:26,520
one of the reasons why i like
 

3217
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,789
one of the reasons why i like
decentralization is just because there's

3218
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:28,799
decentralization is just because there's
 

3219
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:29,670
decentralization is just because there's
like

3220
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:29,680
like
 

3221
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,589
like
this thing about power where power

3222
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:31,599
this thing about power where power
 

3223
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,589
this thing about power where power
attracts people with egos and so that

3224
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:33,599
attracts people with egos and so that
 

3225
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,510
attracts people with egos and so that
just allows a very small percentage of

3226
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:35,520
just allows a very small percentage of
 

3227
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,829
just allows a very small percentage of
people to just ruin so many things you

3228
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:37,839
people to just ruin so many things you
 

3229
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,430
people to just ruin so many things you
think ego has a

3230
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:39,440
think ego has a
 

3231
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,630
think ego has a
you think

3232
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:40,640
you think
 

3233
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,630
you think
ego has a use like is ego always bad

3234
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
ego has a use like is ego always bad
 

3235
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,710
ego has a use like is ego always bad
it seems like it sometimes does but then

3236
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,720
it seems like it sometimes does but then
 

3237
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,390
it seems like it sometimes does but then
the ethereum research team i feel like

3238
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:48,400
the ethereum research team i feel like
 

3239
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,230
the ethereum research team i feel like
we've found

3240
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,240
we've found
 

3241
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,030
we've found
also kind of a lot like a lot of very

3242
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
also kind of a lot like a lot of very
 

3243
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,990
also kind of a lot like a lot of very
good people that are just

3244
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,000
good people that are just
 

3245
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,150
good people that are just
and if primarily you're just interested

3246
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,160
and if primarily you're just interested
 

3247
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,069
and if primarily you're just interested
in things for the technology

3248
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:00,079
in things for the technology
 

3249
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,670
in things for the technology
and uh

3250
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,680
and uh
 

3251
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,549
and uh
you know things seem to just

3252
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:04,559
you know things seem to just
 

3253
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,789
you know things seem to just
generally be going quite well

3254
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799
generally be going quite well
 

3255
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,470
generally be going quite well
yeah when you're when the focus and the

3256
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,480
yeah when you're when the focus and the
 

3257
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,549
yeah when you're when the focus and the
passion is in the tech so on the so

3258
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:10,559
passion is in the tech so on the so
 

3259
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,549
passion is in the tech so on the so
that's the human side of things but the

3260
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:12,559
that's the human side of things but the
 

3261
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,390
that's the human side of things but the
technology side like what have you

3262
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
technology side like what have you
 

3263
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,910
technology side like what have you
learned what have been the biggest

3264
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920
learned what have been the biggest
 

3265
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,190
learned what have been the biggest
challenges of bringing ethereum to life

3266
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:19,200
challenges of bringing ethereum to life
 

3267
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,349
challenges of bringing ethereum to life
on the technology side

3268
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
on the technology side
 

3269
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,789
on the technology side
so i think first of all just uh

3270
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:24,799
so i think first of all just uh
 

3271
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,470
so i think first of all just uh
you know there's like

3272
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:26,480
you know there's like
 

3273
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,390
you know there's like
the first law of software development

3274
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400
the first law of software development
 

3275
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,910
the first law of software development
which is that when someone gives you a

3276
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:29,920
which is that when someone gives you a
 

3277
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,990
which is that when someone gives you a
timetable let's switch the unit of time

3278
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:32,000
timetable let's switch the unit of time
 

3279
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,829
timetable let's switch the unit of time
to the next largest unit of time and had

3280
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:33,839
to the next largest unit of time and had
 

3281
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,390
to the next largest unit of time and had
one and like we basically fell victim to

3282
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:36,400
one and like we basically fell victim to
 

3283
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,270
one and like we basically fell victim to
that

3284
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
that
 

3285
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,430
that
um and uh

3286
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,440
um and uh
 

3287
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,109
um and uh
and so

3288
00:58:41,109 --> 00:58:41,119
and so
 

3289
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,270
and so
instead of taking those like three

3290
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:43,280
instead of taking those like three
 

3291
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,510
instead of taking those like three
months it ended up taking like 20 months

3292
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:45,520
months it ended up taking like 20 months
 

3293
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,870
months it ended up taking like 20 months
to watch the thing

3294
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:46,880
to watch the thing
 

3295
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,230
to watch the thing
um

3296
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:48,240
um
 

3297
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,589
um
and that was just i think

3298
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:49,599
and that was just i think
 

3299
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,190
and that was just i think
underestimating the sheer technical

3300
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:51,200
underestimating the sheer technical
 

3301
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,109
underestimating the sheer technical
complexity of the thing

3302
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:53,119
complexity of the thing
 

3303
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,510
complexity of the thing
um there are research challenges like so

3304
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:55,520
um there are research challenges like so
 

3305
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,190
um there are research challenges like so
for example

3306
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,200
for example
 

3307
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,710
for example
one of the things that we've been saying

3308
00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:58,720
one of the things that we've been saying
 

3309
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,630
one of the things that we've been saying
from the start that we would do one is a

3310
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:00,640
from the start that we would do one is a
 

3311
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,630
from the start that we would do one is a
switch from a proof-of-work to a

3312
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:02,640
switch from a proof-of-work to a
 

3313
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,030
switch from a proof-of-work to a
proof-of-stake uh more proof of stake is

3314
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:05,040
proof-of-stake uh more proof of stake is
 

3315
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,270
proof-of-stake uh more proof of stake is
to this uh alternative consensus

3316
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280
to this uh alternative consensus
 

3317
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,430
to this uh alternative consensus
mechanism where instead of uh

3318
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:09,440
mechanism where instead of uh
 

3319
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,190
mechanism where instead of uh
having to waste a lot of uh computing

3320
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:11,200
having to waste a lot of uh computing
 

3321
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,630
having to waste a lot of uh computing
power on solving these mathematical

3322
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:12,640
power on solving these mathematical
 

3323
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,789
power on solving these mathematical
puzzles that don't mean anything you

3324
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:14,799
puzzles that don't mean anything you
 

3325
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,349
puzzles that don't mean anything you
kind of prove that you have access to

3326
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:17,359
kind of prove that you have access to
 

3327
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,990
kind of prove that you have access to
coins inside of the system and this uh

3328
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:20,000
coins inside of the system and this uh
 

3329
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,349
coins inside of the system and this uh
and it gives you some level of

3330
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:21,359
and it gives you some level of
 

3331
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,589
and it gives you some level of
participation in the consensus can you

3332
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:23,599
participation in the consensus can you
 

3333
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,270
participation in the consensus can you
maybe elaborate on that a little bit i

3334
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:25,280
maybe elaborate on that a little bit i
 

3335
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,430
maybe elaborate on that a little bit i
understand the idea of proof of work

3336
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,440
understand the idea of proof of work
 

3337
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,470
understand the idea of proof of work
um

3338
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:28,480
um
 

3339
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,069
um
i know that a lot of people say that the

3340
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
i know that a lot of people say that the
 

3341
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,349
i know that a lot of people say that the
idea of proof of stake is really

3342
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:31,359
idea of proof of stake is really
 

3343
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,190
idea of proof of stake is really
appealing can you maybe linger on a

3344
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:33,200
appealing can you maybe linger on a
 

3345
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,430
appealing can you maybe linger on a
longer explain what it is

3346
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:35,440
longer explain what it is
 

3347
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,390
longer explain what it is
sure

3348
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:36,400
sure
 

3349
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,829
sure
so

3350
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:37,839
so
 

3351
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,150
so
basically the idea is like

3352
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:40,160
basically the idea is like
 

3353
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,190
basically the idea is like
if i kind of lock up a hundred coins

3354
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:43,200
if i kind of lock up a hundred coins
 

3355
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,829
if i kind of lock up a hundred coins
then i turn that into a kind of quote

3356
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:45,839
then i turn that into a kind of quote
 

3357
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,670
then i turn that into a kind of quote
virtual miner and the system itself kind

3358
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:49,680
virtual miner and the system itself kind
 

3359
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,630
virtual miner and the system itself kind
of

3360
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:50,640
of
 

3361
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,349
of
automatically and randomly assigns that

3362
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:53,359
automatically and randomly assigns that
 

3363
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,990
automatically and randomly assigns that
in a virtual miner the right to create

3364
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,000
in a virtual miner the right to create
 

3365
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,470
in a virtual miner the right to create
blocks at particular intervals and then

3366
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:58,480
blocks at particular intervals and then
 

3367
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,710
blocks at particular intervals and then
if someone else has 200 coins and they

3368
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:00,720
if someone else has 200 coins and they
 

3369
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,109
if someone else has 200 coins and they
walk on the lock there's 200 coins then

3370
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:03,119
walk on the lock there's 200 coins then
 

3371
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,109
walk on the lock there's 200 coins then
they get a kind of twice as big virtual

3372
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:05,119
they get a kind of twice as big virtual
 

3373
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,470
they get a kind of twice as big virtual
miner they'll be able to create their

3374
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:06,480
miner they'll be able to create their
 

3375
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,349
miner they'll be able to create their
blocks twice as often right so

3376
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:09,359
blocks twice as often right so
 

3377
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,230
blocks twice as often right so
it tries to kind of do similar things to

3378
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:12,240
it tries to kind of do similar things to
 

3379
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,390
it tries to kind of do similar things to
proof of work except instead of the

3380
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
proof of work except instead of the
 

3381
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,069
proof of work except instead of the
thing and

3382
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079
thing and
 

3383
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,150
thing and
rate limiting your participation being

3384
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
rate limiting your participation being
 

3385
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,270
rate limiting your participation being
your ability to crank out uh solutions

3386
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,280
your ability to crank out uh solutions
 

3387
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,589
your ability to crank out uh solutions
to kind of hash challenges the thing

3388
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599
to kind of hash challenges the thing
 

3389
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,109
to kind of hash challenges the thing
that really limits your participation is

3390
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:25,119
that really limits your participation is
 

3391
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,870
that really limits your participation is
kind of how much coins you're locking

3392
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:26,880
kind of how much coins you're locking
 

3393
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,789
kind of how much coins you're locking
into this mechanism

3394
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
into this mechanism
 

3395
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,950
into this mechanism
okay so interesting so that that limit

3396
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:30,960
okay so interesting so that that limit
 

3397
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,789
okay so interesting so that that limit
of participation doesn't require you to

3398
01:00:32,789 --> 01:00:32,799
of participation doesn't require you to
 

3399
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:37,270
of participation doesn't require you to
run a lot of compute

3400
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:37,280

 

3401
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,109

does that mean that the

3402
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
does that mean that the
 

3403
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,589
does that mean that the
richer you are

3404
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:41,599
richer you are
 

3405
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,309
richer you are
so rich people

3406
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:44,319
so rich people
 

3407
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,270
so rich people
um

3408
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:45,280
um
 

3409
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,470
um
are more

3410
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:46,480
are more
 

3411
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,630
are more
like their identities more

3412
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,640
like their identities more
 

3413
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,510
like their identities more
right and this stable

3414
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:51,520
right and this stable
 

3415
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,670
right and this stable
yeah verifiable or whatever whatever the

3416
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:53,680
yeah verifiable or whatever whatever the
 

3417
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,109
yeah verifiable or whatever whatever the
right terminology is

3418
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,119
right terminology is
 

3419
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,789
right terminology is
right and this is definitely a common

3420
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:56,799
right and this is definitely a common
 

3421
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,750
right and this is definitely a common
critique i think my usual answer to this

3422
01:00:59,750 --> 01:00:59,760
critique i think my usual answer to this
 

3423
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,990
critique i think my usual answer to this
is that like proof of work is even more

3424
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:02,000
is that like proof of work is even more
 

3425
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,829
is that like proof of work is even more
of that kind of system exactly yeah

3426
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:03,839
of that kind of system exactly yeah
 

3427
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,030
of that kind of system exactly yeah
because i didn't mean it and that

3428
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040
because i didn't mean it and that
 

3429
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,549
because i didn't mean it and that
statement is a criticism i think you're

3430
01:01:06,549 --> 01:01:06,559
statement is a criticism i think you're
 

3431
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,309
statement is a criticism i think you're
exactly right that's equivalent the

3432
01:01:08,309 --> 01:01:08,319
exactly right that's equivalent the
 

3433
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,950
exactly right that's equivalent the
proof of work is the same kind of thing

3434
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:10,960
proof of work is the same kind of thing
 

3435
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,789
proof of work is the same kind of thing
but in the proof of work you

3436
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:12,799
but in the proof of work you
 

3437
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,670
but in the proof of work you
have to also use physical resources

3438
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:15,680
have to also use physical resources
 

3439
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,910
have to also use physical resources
yes and uh burn computers and burn trees

3440
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:17,920
yes and uh burn computers and burn trees
 

3441
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,870
yes and uh burn computers and burn trees
and all of that stuff is there um a way

3442
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:20,880
and all of that stuff is there um a way
 

3443
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,030
and all of that stuff is there um a way
to mess with the system of the proof of

3444
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,040
to mess with the system of the proof of
 

3445
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,950
to mess with the system of the proof of
uh proof of stake

3446
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:24,960
uh proof of stake
 

3447
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,870
uh proof of stake
there is but you will once again need to

3448
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
there is but you will once again need to
 

3449
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,270
there is but you will once again need to
have uh a very large portion of all the

3450
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
have uh a very large portion of all the
 

3451
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,789
have uh a very large portion of all the
coins that are locked in the system to

3452
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:30,799
coins that are locked in the system to
 

3453
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,109
coins that are locked in the system to
do anything bad got it

3454
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:33,119
do anything bad got it
 

3455
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,109
do anything bad got it
so yeah and just to that maybe take a

3456
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:35,119
so yeah and just to that maybe take a
 

3457
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,349
so yeah and just to that maybe take a
small tangent one of the criticisms of

3458
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:37,359
small tangent one of the criticisms of
 

3459
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,589
small tangent one of the criticisms of
cryptocurrencies the fact

3460
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
cryptocurrencies the fact
 

3461
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:40,950
cryptocurrencies the fact
that it gets for the proof-of-work

3462
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:40,960
that it gets for the proof-of-work
 

3463
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,349
that it gets for the proof-of-work
mechanism you have to use so much energy

3464
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:43,359
mechanism you have to use so much energy
 

3465
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,349
mechanism you have to use so much energy
in the world yes

3466
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:45,359
in the world yes
 

3467
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,190
in the world yes
is that one of the motivations of

3468
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:47,200
is that one of the motivations of
 

3469
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,670
is that one of the motivations of
proof-of-stake is to move away from this

3470
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:49,680
proof-of-stake is to move away from this
 

3471
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,069
proof-of-stake is to move away from this
definitely like what's your sense of the

3472
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:52,079
definitely like what's your sense of the
 

3473
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,390
definitely like what's your sense of the
uh maybe i'm just under-informed is

3474
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:54,400
uh maybe i'm just under-informed is
 

3475
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,630
uh maybe i'm just under-informed is
there like legitimately environmental

3476
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
there like legitimately environmental
 

3477
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,150
there like legitimately environmental
impact from this

3478
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:58,160
impact from this
 

3479
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,309
impact from this
yeah uh so

3480
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
yeah uh so
 

3481
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,069
yeah uh so
the latest thing was that bitcoin

3482
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:02,079
the latest thing was that bitcoin
 

3483
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,990
the latest thing was that bitcoin
consumed as much energy as the country

3484
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,000
consumed as much energy as the country
 

3485
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,549
consumed as much energy as the country
of austria or something like that yeah

3486
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:06,559
of austria or something like that yeah
 

3487
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,309
of austria or something like that yeah
and then ethereum is like right now

3488
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:08,319
and then ethereum is like right now
 

3489
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,990
and then ethereum is like right now
maybe only like half an order of

3490
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,000
maybe only like half an order of
 

3491
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,069
maybe only like half an order of
magnitude smaller than bitcoin

3492
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:12,079
magnitude smaller than bitcoin
 

3493
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,069
magnitude smaller than bitcoin
i've heard you talk about uh ethereum

3494
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:14,079
i've heard you talk about uh ethereum
 

3495
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,990
i've heard you talk about uh ethereum
2.0 so what's the

3496
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,000
2.0 so what's the
 

3497
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,710
2.0 so what's the
what's the dream of a theorem 2.0 what's

3498
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:18,720
what's the dream of a theorem 2.0 what's
 

3499
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,910
what's the dream of a theorem 2.0 what's
the

3500
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:19,920
the
 

3501
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,589
the
status of proof of stake is the

3502
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:21,599
status of proof of stake is the
 

3503
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,230
status of proof of stake is the
mechanism that ethereum moves towards

3504
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240
mechanism that ethereum moves towards
 

3505
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,870
mechanism that ethereum moves towards
and also how do you move to a different

3506
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:26,880
and also how do you move to a different
 

3507
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,829
and also how do you move to a different
mechanism of consensus

3508
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:29,839
mechanism of consensus
 

3509
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,670
mechanism of consensus
within a cryptocurrency

3510
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
within a cryptocurrency
 

3511
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,789
within a cryptocurrency
so ethereum 2.0 is a collection of

3512
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:34,799
so ethereum 2.0 is a collection of
 

3513
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,789
so ethereum 2.0 is a collection of
major upgrades that we've wanted to do

3514
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
major upgrades that we've wanted to do
 

3515
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,349
major upgrades that we've wanted to do
to ethereum for quite some time the two

3516
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
to ethereum for quite some time the two
 

3517
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,910
to ethereum for quite some time the two
big ones uh one is proof of stake and

3518
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:41,920
big ones uh one is proof of stake and
 

3519
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,309
big ones uh one is proof of stake and
the other is that we call sharding

3520
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:44,319
the other is that we call sharding
 

3521
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:46,230
the other is that we call sharding
sharding solves another problem with

3522
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:46,240
sharding solves another problem with
 

3523
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,710
sharding solves another problem with
blockchains which is a scalability

3524
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:48,720
blockchains which is a scalability
 

3525
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,950
blockchains which is a scalability
and what sharding does is it basically

3526
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:50,960
and what sharding does is it basically
 

3527
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,990
and what sharding does is it basically
says

3528
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000
says
 

3529
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,069
says
instead of every participant in the

3530
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:54,079
instead of every participant in the
 

3531
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,910
instead of every participant in the
network having to personally download

3532
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:55,920
network having to personally download
 

3533
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,910
network having to personally download
and verify every transaction every

3534
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:57,920
and verify every transaction every
 

3535
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,430
and verify every transaction every
participant in the network only

3536
01:02:59,430 --> 01:02:59,440
participant in the network only
 

3537
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,190
participant in the network only
downloads and verifies a small portion

3538
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:01,200
downloads and verifies a small portion
 

3539
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,549
downloads and verifies a small portion
of transactions

3540
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:02,559
of transactions
 

3541
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,870
of transactions
and then you kind of randomly distribute

3542
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
and then you kind of randomly distribute
 

3543
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,510
and then you kind of randomly distribute
who gets how much work um and because

3544
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:07,520
who gets how much work um and because
 

3545
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,910
who gets how much work um and because
this of how the distribution is random

3546
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:09,920
this of how the distribution is random
 

3547
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,549
this of how the distribution is random
it still has the property that you need

3548
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:12,559
it still has the property that you need
 

3549
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,710
it still has the property that you need
a large portion of the entire network to

3550
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:14,720
a large portion of the entire network to
 

3551
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,630
a large portion of the entire network to
corrupt what's going on inside of any

3552
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640
corrupt what's going on inside of any
 

3553
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,549
corrupt what's going on inside of any
shard but

3554
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:18,559
shard but
 

3555
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,470
shard but
the system is still kind of very

3556
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
the system is still kind of very
 

3557
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,069
the system is still kind of very
redundant and very secure that's

3558
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
redundant and very secure that's
 

3559
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,430
redundant and very secure that's
brilliant

3560
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:23,440
brilliant
 

3561
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,910
brilliant
how hard is that to implement and how

3562
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
how hard is that to implement and how
 

3563
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,470
how hard is that to implement and how
hard is uh proof of stake to implement

3564
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:28,480
hard is uh proof of stake to implement
 

3565
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,870
hard is uh proof of stake to implement
like on the technical level yeah

3566
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:30,880
like on the technical level yeah
 

3567
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,630
like on the technical level yeah
software level proof of stake and

3568
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
software level proof of stake and
 

3569
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,549
software level proof of stake and
charting are both challenging um might

3570
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:34,559
charting are both challenging um might
 

3571
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,109
charting are both challenging um might
say sharding is a bit more challenging

3572
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:37,119
say sharding is a bit more challenging
 

3573
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,710
say sharding is a bit more challenging
the reason is that proof of stake is

3574
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:38,720
the reason is that proof of stake is
 

3575
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,710
the reason is that proof of stake is
kind of just a change to like how the

3576
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:40,720
kind of just a change to like how the
 

3577
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,549
kind of just a change to like how the
consensus lawyer works

3578
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:42,559
consensus lawyer works
 

3579
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,270
consensus lawyer works
shorting does both that but it's also a

3580
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:45,280
shorting does both that but it's also a
 

3581
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,270
shorting does both that but it's also a
change to the networking layer um the

3582
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,280
change to the networking layer um the
 

3583
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,630
change to the networking layer um the
reason is that charting is kind of

3584
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:48,640
reason is that charting is kind of
 

3585
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,789
reason is that charting is kind of
pointless if at the networking layer you

3586
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
pointless if at the networking layer you
 

3587
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,470
pointless if at the networking layer you
still do what you do today which is you

3588
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:52,480
still do what you do today which is you
 

3589
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,069
still do what you do today which is you
kind of gossip everything which means

3590
01:03:54,069 --> 01:03:54,079
kind of gossip everything which means
 

3591
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,150
kind of gossip everything which means
that if someone publishes something

3592
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
that if someone publishes something
 

3593
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,230
that if someone publishes something
every other node in the client hears it

3594
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:58,240
every other node in the client hears it
 

3595
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,029
every other node in the client hears it
like from uh on the networking layer and

3596
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:01,039
like from uh on the networking layer and
 

3597
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,789
like from uh on the networking layer and
so instead we have to have enough sub

3598
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799
so instead we have to have enough sub
 

3599
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,230
so instead we have to have enough sub
networks and the ability to quickly

3600
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:04,240
networks and the ability to quickly
 

3601
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,750
networks and the ability to quickly
switch between sub networks and other

3602
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
switch between sub networks and other
 

3603
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,910
switch between sub networks and other
sub networks talk to each other and this

3604
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:07,920
sub networks talk to each other and this
 

3605
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,230
sub networks talk to each other and this
is all doable but it's a

3606
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:10,240
is all doable but it's a
 

3607
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,910
is all doable but it's a
more complex architecture and it's

3608
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:11,920
more complex architecture and it's
 

3609
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,349
more complex architecture and it's
definitely the sort of thing that has

3610
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
definitely the sort of thing that has
 

3611
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,270
definitely the sort of thing that has
not yet been done in cryptocurrency so

3612
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:15,280
not yet been done in cryptocurrency so
 

3613
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,510
not yet been done in cryptocurrency so
most most of the networking layer

3614
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
most most of the networking layer
 

3615
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,870
most most of the networking layer
in uh cryptocurrency is you're shouting

3616
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
in uh cryptocurrency is you're shouting
 

3617
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,789
in uh cryptocurrency is you're shouting
you're like broadcasting messages and

3618
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:22,799
you're like broadcasting messages and
 

3619
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,349
you're like broadcasting messages and
this is more like ad hoc networks like

3620
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:25,359
this is more like ad hoc networks like
 

3621
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,349
this is more like ad hoc networks like
yeah you're shouting within smaller

3622
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:27,359
yeah you're shouting within smaller
 

3623
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:28,789
yeah you're shouting within smaller
groups smaller group but do you have

3624
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:28,799
groups smaller group but do you have
 

3625
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,349
groups smaller group but do you have
like a bunch of subnet like exactly and

3626
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:31,359
like a bunch of subnet like exactly and
 

3627
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,109
like a bunch of subnet like exactly and
you have to switch between oh man i'd

3628
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:33,119
you have to switch between oh man i'd
 

3629
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,549
you have to switch between oh man i'd
love to see the

3630
01:04:34,549 --> 01:04:34,559
love to see the
 

3631
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,430
love to see the
uh so it's a beautiful idea

3632
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:37,440
uh so it's a beautiful idea
 

3633
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,829
uh so it's a beautiful idea
uh so from a graph theoretic perspective

3634
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:39,839
uh so from a graph theoretic perspective
 

3635
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:40,710
uh so from a graph theoretic perspective
but

3636
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:40,720
but
 

3637
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,109
but
just the software like who's responsible

3638
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
just the software like who's responsible
 

3639
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,029
just the software like who's responsible
is the ethereum

3640
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:45,039
is the ethereum
 

3641
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,710
is the ethereum
project like the people involved would

3642
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:46,720
project like the people involved would
 

3643
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,230
project like the people involved would
they be implementing like what's the

3644
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:48,240
they be implementing like what's the
 

3645
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,950

i guess it's like you have to invent job

3676
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:23,680
i guess it's like you have to invent job
 

3677
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,510
i guess it's like you have to invent job
titles for this stuff right the reason

3678
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:25,520
titles for this stuff right the reason
 

3679
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,870
titles for this stuff right the reason
is that um

3680
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:26,880
is that um
 

3681
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,870
is that um
like we also have this unique kind of

3682
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:28,880
like we also have this unique kind of
 

3683
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,230
like we also have this unique kind of
organizational structure where the

ethereum foundation itself kind of does

3686
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,160
ethereum foundation itself kind of does
 

3687
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,390
ethereum foundation itself kind of does
research in-house but then the actual

3688
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
research in-house but then the actual
 

3689
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,710
research in-house but then the actual
implementation is done by independent

3690

implementation is done by independent
 

3691
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,390
implementation is done by independent
teams that are separate companies and

all around the world and like fun places
 

3697
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,069
all around the world and like fun places
like australia um and

like australia um and
 

3699
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,109
like australia um and
so you know you kind of just need a

3700
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:49,119
so you know you kind of just need a
 

3701
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,029
so you know you kind of just need a
bunch of kind of almost non-stop cat

3702
01:05:51,029 --> 01:05:51,039
bunch of kind of almost non-stop cat
 

3703
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,190
bunch of kind of almost non-stop cat
hurting to just keep getting these

3704
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:53,200
hurting to just keep getting these
 

3705
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,230
hurting to just keep getting these
people to kind of talk to each other and

people to kind of talk to each other and
 

3707
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,829
people to kind of talk to each other and
kind of implement the spec make sure

3708
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
kind of implement the spec make sure
 

3709
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,750
kind of implement the spec make sure
that everyone agrees on

3710
01:05:59,750 --> 01:05:59,760
that everyone agrees on
 

3711
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,029
that everyone agrees on
what's going on and kind of how to

3712
01:06:01,029 --> 01:06:01,039
what's going on and kind of how to
 

3713
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,950
what's going on and kind of how to
interpret different things

3714
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:02,960
interpret different things
 

3715
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,950

so ethereum 2.0 is split into three

3732
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:22,640
so ethereum 2.0 is split into three
 

3733
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,190
so ethereum 2.0 is split into three
phases so phase zero just creates a

3734
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,200
phases so phase zero just creates a
 

3735
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,270
phases so phase zero just creates a
proof of stake network and it's actually

3736
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:27,280
proof of stake network and it's actually
 

3737
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,589
proof of stake network and it's actually
separate from kind of proof of

want to then phase one adds sharding but

3752
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:44,079
want to then phase one adds sharding but
 

3753
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,150
want to then phase one adds sharding but
it only adds sharding of and of data

3754
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:46,160
it only adds sharding of and of data
 

3755
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,750
it only adds sharding of and of data
storage and not sharding of a

3756
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:47,760
storage and not sharding of a
 

3757
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,710
storage and not sharding of a
computation and then after that there is

3758
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:50,720
computation and then after that there is
 

3759
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,109
computation and then after that there is
kind of the merger phase which is where

3760
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:53,119
kind of the merger phase which is where
 

3761
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,309
kind of the merger phase which is where
the yeah

3762
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
the yeah
 

3763
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,549
the yeah
and if the accounts uh kind of smart

3764
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:56,559
and if the accounts uh kind of smart
 

3765
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,190

01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:01,680
the the existing ether1 system just kind
 

3769
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,910
the the existing ether1 system just kind
of gets cut and pasted into eth2 and

3770
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:03,920
of gets cut and pasted into eth2 and
 

3771
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,190
of gets cut and pasted into eth2 and
then the proof of work chain gets

3772
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:05,200
then the proof of work chain gets
 

3773
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,829
then the proof of work chain gets
forgotten and then and the things all

3774
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:07,839
forgotten and then and the things all
 

3775
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:08,950
forgotten and then and the things all
the things that we're living there

3776
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:08,960
the things that we're living there
 

3777
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,950
the things that we're living there
before you just kind of continue living

3778
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:10,960
before you just kind of continue living

so

3782
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:14,480

almost fully implemented
 

3791
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,150
almost fully implemented
and now it's just a matter of

3792
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,160
and now it's just a matter of
 

3793
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,990
and now it's just a matter of
a whole bunch of security auditing and

3794
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
a whole bunch of security auditing and
 

3795
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,029
a whole bunch of security auditing and
testing

3796
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
testing
 

3797
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,589
testing
um my own experience is that right now

3798
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:31,599
um my own experience is that right now
 

3799
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,309
um my own experience is that right now
it feels like we're at about a phase

3800
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:34,319
it feels like we're at about a phase
 

3801
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,470
it feels like we're at about a phase
comparable to

3802
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480
comparable to
 

3803
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,029
comparable to
when we were doing uh the original

3804
01:07:39,029 --> 01:07:39,039
when we were doing uh the original
 

3805
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:40,710
when we were doing uh the original
ethereum launch when we were maybe about

3806
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:40,720
ethereum launch when we were maybe about
 

3807
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,390
ethereum launch when we were maybe about
four months away from lunch

3808
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:42,400
four months away from lunch
 

3809
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,470
four months away from lunch
but that's just a hunch then that's just

3810
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:44,480
but that's just a hunch then that's just
 

3811
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,470
but that's just a hunch then that's just
that's just a hunch yeah

3812
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:46,480
that's just a hunch yeah
 

3813
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,950
that's just a hunch yeah
so how you know it took it took like

3814
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:48,960
so how you know it took it took like
 

3815
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,789
so how you know it took it took like
over a decade for people to move from

3816
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:50,799
over a decade for people to move from
 

3817
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:53,430
over a decade for people to move from
python to python three

3818
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
python to python three
 

3819
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,710
python to python three
how do you see

3820
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:54,720
how do you see
 

3821
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,230
how do you see
the move from like at this phase of zero

3822
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:58,240
the move from like at this phase of zero
 

3823
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,029
the move from like at this phase of zero
of

3824
01:07:59,029 --> 01:07:59,039
of
 

3825
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,109
of
for for different consensus mechanism do

3826
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,119
for for different consensus mechanism do
 

3827
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,950
for for different consensus mechanism do
you see there being a

3828
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:02,960
you see there being a
 

3829
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,589
you see there being a
a drastic phase shift and people just

3830
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,599
a drastic phase shift and people just
 

3831
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,549
a drastic phase shift and people just
kind of jumping to this better mechanism

3832
01:08:08,549 --> 01:08:08,559
kind of jumping to this better mechanism
 

3833
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,710
kind of jumping to this better mechanism
so in phase zero i don't expect too many

3834
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:10,720
so in phase zero i don't expect too many
 

3835
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,990
so in phase zero i don't expect too many
people to

3836
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,000
people to
 

3837
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,549
people to
do much because in phase zero and phase

3838
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:14,559
do much because in phase zero and phase
 

3839
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,709
do much because in phase zero and phase

01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:33,440
keep living on each one and then

of i can sense a system that like on the
 

3869
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,950
of i can sense a system that like on the
one hand you have to coordinate the

01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:44,960
one hand you have to coordinate the
 

3871
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,309
one hand you have to coordinate the
upgrade but on the other hand the

so what's casper ffg by the way um

3876
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
so what's casper ffg by the way um
 

3877
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,110
so what's casper ffg by the way um
casper ffg is the consensus algorithm

3878
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:55,120
casper ffg is the consensus algorithm

01:08:59,189 --> 01:08:59,199
is there something interesting uh
 

3883
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,669
is there something interesting uh
specific about casper ffg like some

01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,120
he is so casper ffg
 

3889
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,669
he is so casper ffg
combines together kind of two different

3890
01:09:09,669 --> 01:09:09,679
combines together kind of two different
 

3891
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,590
combines together kind of two different
schools of like it's not algorithm

3892
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:11,600
schools of like it's not algorithm
 

3893
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,910
schools of like it's not algorithm
design uh so the general two different

3894
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
design uh so the general two different
 

3895
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,709
design uh so the general two different
schools of the of the design are right

3896
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:16,719
schools of the of the design are right
 

3897
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,789
schools of the of the design are right
one is uh

3898
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:18,799
one is uh
 

3899
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:22,070
one is uh
50 fault tolerant but dependent on

3900
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:22,080
50 fault tolerant but dependent on
 

3901
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,829
50 fault tolerant but dependent on
network synchrony so fifty percent

3902
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:23,839
network synchrony so fifty percent
 

3903
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,470
network synchrony so fifty percent
volume fault tolerant but it didn't

3904
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,480
volume fault tolerant but it didn't
 

3905
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,990
volume fault tolerant but it didn't
tolerate up to fifty percent of faults

3906
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:28,000
tolerate up to fifty percent of faults
 

3907
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,550
tolerate up to fifty percent of faults
but not more but it depends on an

3908
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
but not more but it depends on an
 

3909
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,309
but not more but it depends on an
assumption that all of the nodes can

3910
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:32,319
assumption that all of the nodes can
 

3911
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,789
assumption that all of the nodes can
talk uh talk to each other within some

3912
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:34,799
talk uh talk to each other within some
 

3913
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,030
talk uh talk to each other within some
of a limited period of time like if i

3914
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:37,040
of a limited period of time like if i
 

3915
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,149
of a limited period of time like if i
send the message you'll receive it

3916
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:38,159
send the message you'll receive it
 

3917
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:39,829
send the message you'll receive it
within a few seconds

3918
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
within a few seconds
 

3919
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,709
within a few seconds
um and the second the school is

3920
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:42,719
um and the second the school is
 

3921
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,349
um and the second the school is
33 fault tolerant but safe under

3922
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
33 fault tolerant but safe under
 

3923
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,870
33 fault tolerant but safe under
asynchrony which means that like if we

3924
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:48,880
asynchrony which means that like if we
 

3925
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,110
asynchrony which means that like if we
agree on something then that thing is

3926
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,120
agree on something then that thing is
 

3927
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,349
agree on something then that thing is
finalized and even if the network goes

3928
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:53,359
finalized and even if the network goes
 

3929
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:54,950
finalized and even if the network goes
horribly wonky the second after that

3930
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:54,960
horribly wonky the second after that
 

3931
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,390
horribly wonky the second after that
thing is finalized there's no way to

3932
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:56,400
thing is finalized there's no way to
 

3933
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,750
thing is finalized there's no way to
revert that thing

3934
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:57,760
revert that thing
 

3935
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,630
revert that thing
um

3936
01:09:58,630 --> 01:09:58,640
um
 

3937
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,669
um
and

3938
01:09:59,669 --> 01:09:59,679
and
 

3939
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,790
and
that's

3940
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:00,800
that's
 

3941
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,229
that's
fascinating how you would make that

3942
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:02,239
fascinating how you would make that
 

3943
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,830
fascinating how you would make that
happen it's uh definitely quite clever

3944
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:05,840
happen it's uh definitely quite clever
 

3945
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,790
happen it's uh definitely quite clever
um i'd recommend the casper ffg paper um

3946
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:08,800
um i'd recommend the casper ffg paper um
 

3947
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,630
um i'd recommend the casper ffg paper um
if you just search like archive as in

3948
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:10,640
if you just search like archive as in
 

3949
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,350
if you just search like archive as in
like a rx iv and casper ffg it's that's

3950
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:13,360
like a rx iv and casper ffg it's that's
 

3951
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,510
like a rx iv and casper ffg it's that's
an archive the paper is an archive yeah

3952
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
an archive the paper is an archive yeah
 

3953
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,990
an archive the paper is an archive yeah
yeah who are the authors um myself and

3954
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,000
yeah who are the authors um myself and
 

3955
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,750
yeah who are the authors um myself and
uh virgil griffith

3956
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:19,760
uh virgil griffith
 

3957
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,590
uh virgil griffith
that's awesome

3958
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,600
that's awesome
 

3959
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,430
that's awesome
take a small tangent

3960
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:23,440
take a small tangent
 

3961
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,030
take a small tangent
this idea of just putting out white

3962
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:25,040
this idea of just putting out white
 

3963
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,709
this idea of just putting out white
papers and papers and putting them on

3964
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:26,719
papers and papers and putting them on
 

3965
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:29,030
papers and papers and putting them on
archive and just putting them publicly

3966
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,040
archive and just putting them publicly
 

3967
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,910
archive and just putting them publicly
that is that at the core

3968
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:31,920
that is that at the core
 

3969
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,350
that is that at the core
is that a necessary component of

3970
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:33,360
is that a necessary component of
 

3971
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,350
is that a necessary component of
particular currencies that the tradition

3972
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,360
particular currencies that the tradition
 

3973
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,110
particular currencies that the tradition
started with uh

3974
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,120
started with uh
 

3975
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,910
started with uh
uh satoshi nakamoto is like what do you

3976
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:39,920
uh satoshi nakamoto is like what do you
 

3977
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,110
uh satoshi nakamoto is like what do you
make of it like what do you make of the

3978
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:41,120
make of it like what do you make of the
 

3979
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,790
make of it like what do you make of the
future of that kind of sharing of ideas

3980
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:42,800
future of that kind of sharing of ideas
 

3981
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,790
future of that kind of sharing of ideas
i guess so yeah and it's definitely

3982
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:46,800
i guess so yeah and it's definitely
 

3983
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,030
i guess so yeah and it's definitely
something that's kind of mandatory for

3984
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:49,040
something that's kind of mandatory for
 

3985
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,830
something that's kind of mandatory for
crypto because like crypto is all about

3986
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840
crypto because like crypto is all about
 

3987
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,950
crypto because like crypto is all about
making

3988
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:52,960
making
 

3989
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,950
making
systems where you know you don't have to

3990
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:54,960
systems where you know you don't have to
 

3991
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,709
systems where you know you don't have to
trust the operators to trust that the

3992
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:56,719
trust the operators to trust that the
 

3993
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,709
trust the operators to trust that the
thing works and so if

3994
01:10:58,709 --> 01:10:58,719
thing works and so if
 

3995
01:10:58,719 --> 01:10:59,750
thing works and so if
anything

3996
01:10:59,750 --> 01:10:59,760
anything
 

3997
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,189
anything
behind how a system works is

3998
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:01,199
behind how a system works is
 

3999
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,669
behind how a system works is
closed-sourced and that kind of uh kills

4000
01:11:03,669 --> 01:11:03,679
closed-sourced and that kind of uh kills
 

4001
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,590
closed-sourced and that kind of uh kills
the point and so

4002
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:05,600
the point and so
 

4003
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,149
the point and so
there is the kind of a sense in which

4004
01:11:08,149 --> 01:11:08,159
there is the kind of a sense in which
 

4005
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,030
there is the kind of a sense in which
the

4006
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:09,040
the
 

4007
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,950
the
fundamental properties of the category

4008
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:10,960
fundamental properties of the category
 

4009
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,550
fundamental properties of the category
of the thing we're trying to build just

4010
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:12,560
of the thing we're trying to build just
 

4011
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,270
of the thing we're trying to build just
kind of forces openness but also

4012
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,280
kind of forces openness but also
 

4013
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,510
kind of forces openness but also
openness just has proven to be a really

4014
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:17,520
openness just has proven to be a really
 

4015
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,270
openness just has proven to be a really
great way to collaborate and then

4016
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:19,280
great way to collaborate and then
 

4017
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,750
great way to collaborate and then
there's actually a lot of innovation and

4018
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
there's actually a lot of innovation and
 

4019
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,510
there's actually a lot of innovation and
academic collaboration that's just kind

4020
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:23,520
academic collaboration that's just kind
 

4021
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,149
academic collaboration that's just kind
of happened ad hoc in the crypto space

4022
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
of happened ad hoc in the crypto space
 

4023
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:27,750
of happened ad hoc in the crypto space
the last few years

4024
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:27,760
the last few years
 

4025
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,510
the last few years
so like for example

4026
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:29,520
so like for example
 

4027
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,070
so like for example
we have this forum called etheresearch

4028
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
we have this forum called etheresearch
 

4029
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,390
we have this forum called etheresearch
that's like

4030
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:33,400
that's like
 

4031
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,470
that's like
e-t-h-r-e-s-e-a-r and then dot c-h um

4032
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:36,480
e-t-h-r-e-s-e-a-r and then dot c-h um
 

4033
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,590
e-t-h-r-e-s-e-a-r and then dot c-h um
and

4034
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
and
 

4035
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,790
and
there we publish uh kind of just ideas

4036
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:40,800
there we publish uh kind of just ideas
 

4037
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,790
there we publish uh kind of just ideas
in a form that's kind of half formal

4038
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:42,800
in a form that's kind of half formal
 

4039
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,350
in a form that's kind of half formal
like it's halfway in between

4040
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:45,360
like it's halfway in between
 

4041
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,590
like it's halfway in between
like it's it's a kind of a text write up

4042
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:47,600
like it's it's a kind of a text write up
 

4043
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,830
like it's it's a kind of a text write up
and then you can have math in it but

4044
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:49,840
and then you can have math in it but
 

4045
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,950
and then you can have math in it but
it's often much shorter than a paper and

4046
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:54,960
it's often much shorter than a paper and
 

4047
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,790
it's often much shorter than a paper and
it turns out that the great majority of

4048
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
it turns out that the great majority of
 

4049
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,310
it turns out that the great majority of
new ideas like they're just kind of

4050
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,320
new ideas like they're just kind of
 

4051
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,669
new ideas like they're just kind of
fairly small nuggets that you can

4052
01:11:59,669 --> 01:11:59,679
fairly small nuggets that you can
 

4053
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,590
fairly small nuggets that you can
explain in like five to ten lines and

4054
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:01,600
explain in like five to ten lines and
 

4055
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,030
explain in like five to ten lines and
they don't really

4056
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,040
they don't really
 

4057
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,870
they don't really
need the whole formality of a paper

4058
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:04,880
need the whole formality of a paper
 

4059
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,470
need the whole formality of a paper
exactly they don't require the kind of

4060
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,480
exactly they don't require the kind of
 

4061
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,950
exactly they don't require the kind of
like ten pages of in a filler and so

4062
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:08,960
like ten pages of in a filler and so
 

4063
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,750
like ten pages of in a filler and so
introduction conclusion is not needed

4064
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
introduction conclusion is not needed
 

4065
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,990
introduction conclusion is not needed
yeah and so instead you just kind of

4066
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:14,000
yeah and so instead you just kind of
 

4067
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,990
yeah and so instead you just kind of
publish the idea and then like people

4068
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,000
publish the idea and then like people
 

4069
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,750
publish the idea and then like people
giggle comments on it and it's brilliant

4070
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:17,760
giggle comments on it and it's brilliant
 

4071
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,990
giggle comments on it and it's brilliant
yeah this has been so great for us i

4072
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:20,000
yeah this has been so great for us i
 

4073
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,070
yeah this has been so great for us i
think i interrupted you was there

4074
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,080
think i interrupted you was there
 

4075
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,149
think i interrupted you was there
something else on casper ffg

4076
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:24,159
something else on casper ffg
 

4077
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,709
something else on casper ffg
yeah so just casper ffg is just kind of

4078
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:26,719
yeah so just casper ffg is just kind of
 

4079
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,030
yeah so just casper ffg is just kind of
combines together these two schools um

4080
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,040
combines together these two schools um
 

4081
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,630
combines together these two schools um
and so

4082
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:30,640
and so
 

4083
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,990
and so
basically it creates this system where

4084
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,000
basically it creates this system where
 

4085
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,790
basically it creates this system where
if

4086
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:34,800
if
 

4087
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,950
if
you have uh more than 50 that are honest

4088
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:38,960
you have uh more than 50 that are honest
 

4089
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,470
you have uh more than 50 that are honest
then

4090
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:40,480
then
 

4091
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,110
then
um and you have a network synchrony then

4092
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:43,120
um and you have a network synchrony then
 

4093
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,110
um and you have a network synchrony then
the thing kind of goes as a chain but

4094
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
the thing kind of goes as a chain but
 

4095
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,870
the thing kind of goes as a chain but
then if network security fails then kind

4096
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
then if network security fails then kind
 

4097
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,709
then if network security fails then kind
of the last few blocks in the chain

4098
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:48,719
of the last few blocks in the chain
 

4099
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:49,669
of the last few blocks in the chain
might

4100
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:49,679
might
 

4101
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,229
might
kind of get replaced but anything that

4102
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:52,239
kind of get replaced but anything that
 

4103
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,310
kind of get replaced but anything that
was finalized by this kind of more

4104
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:54,320
was finalized by this kind of more
 

4105
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,669
was finalized by this kind of more
asynchronous process uh gets uh

4106
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
asynchronous process uh gets uh
 

4107
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:00,310
asynchronous process uh gets uh
like can't be reverted and so you

4108
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:00,320
like can't be reverted and so you
 

4109
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,990
like can't be reverted and so you
essentially get a kind of best of both

4110
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,000
essentially get a kind of best of both
 

4111
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,229
essentially get a kind of best of both
worlds between those two bottles

4112
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:04,239
worlds between those two bottles
 

4113
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:05,990
worlds between those two bottles
okay so i know what i'm doing to them

4114
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:06,000
okay so i know what i'm doing to them
 

4115
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,590
okay so i know what i'm doing to them
i'm going to be reading the casper

4116
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:07,600
i'm going to be reading the casper
 

4117
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,229
i'm going to be reading the casper

4118
01:13:10,229 --> 01:13:10,239
refugee paper uh apologize for the
 

4119
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,310
refugee paper uh apologize for the
romanticized question but

4120
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:12,320
romanticized question but
 

4121
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,310
romanticized question but
what to you are

4122
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:14,320
what to you are
 

4123
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,950
what to you are
some or the most beautiful idea in the

4124
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:16,960
some or the most beautiful idea in the
 

4125
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,950
some or the most beautiful idea in the
world of ethereum

4126
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
world of ethereum
 

4127
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,950
world of ethereum
just something uh surprising something

4128
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:20,960
just something uh surprising something
 

4129
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,070
just something uh surprising something
beautiful

4130
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:22,080
beautiful
 

4131
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,189
beautiful
something powerful yeah i mean i think

4132
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:25,199
something powerful yeah i mean i think
 

4133
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,270
something powerful yeah i mean i think
the fact that money can just emerge out

4134
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:27,280
the fact that money can just emerge out
 

4135
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,870
the fact that money can just emerge out
of a database if enough people believe

4136
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:28,880
of a database if enough people believe
 

4137
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,030
of a database if enough people believe
in it i think is definitely one of those

4138
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:31,040
in it i think is definitely one of those
 

4139
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,630
in it i think is definitely one of those
things that's up there

4140
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:32,640
things that's up there
 

4141
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,830
things that's up there
um

4142
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:33,840
um
 

4143
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,830
um
i think one of the things that i really

4144
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:35,840
i think one of the things that i really
 

4145
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,149
i think one of the things that i really
love about ethereum is also this concept

4146
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:38,159
love about ethereum is also this concept
 

4147
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,709
love about ethereum is also this concept
of composability so this is the idea

4148
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:40,719
of composability so this is the idea
 

4149
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:42,630
of composability so this is the idea
that like if i build an application on

4150
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:42,640
that like if i build an application on
 

4151
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,950
that like if i build an application on
top of ethereum then

4152
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:44,960
top of ethereum then
 

4153
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,790
top of ethereum then
you can build an application that talks

4154
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:46,800
you can build an application that talks
 

4155
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,189
you can build an application that talks
to my application and you don't even

4156
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:49,199
to my application and you don't even
 

4157
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,030
to my application and you don't even
need my permission you you don't even

4158
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:51,040
need my permission you you don't even
 

4159
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,270
need my permission you you don't even
need to talk to me right so one really

4160
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280
need to talk to me right so one really
 

4161
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,110
need to talk to me right so one really
fun example of this is there was this

4162
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:55,120
fun example of this is there was this
 

4163
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,030
fun example of this is there was this
center game on ethereum uh called a

4164
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
center game on ethereum uh called a
 

4165
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,110
center game on ethereum uh called a
cryptokitties that just involved kind of

4166
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,120
cryptokitties that just involved kind of
 

4167
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,510
cryptokitties that just involved kind of
breeding digital cats yes and someone

4168
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:01,520
breeding digital cats yes and someone
 

4169
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,310
breeding digital cats yes and someone
else created a game called crypto

4170
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:04,320
else created a game called crypto
 

4171
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,709
else created a game called crypto
dragons where the way you play crypto

4172
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:06,719
dragons where the way you play crypto
 

4173
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,229
dragons where the way you play crypto
dragons is you have a dragon and you

4174
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:08,239
dragons is you have a dragon and you
 

4175
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:11,270
dragons is you have a dragon and you
have to feed it cryptokitties

4176
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:11,280
have to feed it cryptokitties
 

4177
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,630
have to feed it cryptokitties
and

4178
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:12,640
and
 

4179
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,390
and
they just

4180
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
they just
 

4181
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,030
they just
created the whole thing just like as an

4182
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:17,040
created the whole thing just like as an
 

4183
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,270
created the whole thing just like as an
ethereum contract that you would send

4184
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:19,280
ethereum contract that you would send
 

4185
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,990
ethereum contract that you would send
these uh these tokens that are defined

4186
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,000
these uh these tokens that are defined
 

4187
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,470
these uh these tokens that are defined
by this other ethereum contract and for

4188
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
by this other ethereum contract and for
 

4189
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,310
by this other ethereum contract and for
the interoperability to happen like the

4190
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:26,320
the interoperability to happen like the
 

4191
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,110
the interoperability to happen like the
projects didn't don't really need to

4192
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120
projects didn't don't really need to
 

4193
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,630
projects didn't don't really need to
like the teams don't really need to talk

4194
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:30,640
like the teams don't really need to talk
 

4195
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,870
like the teams don't really need to talk
to each other you just kind of interface

4196
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:32,880
to each other you just kind of interface
 

4197
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,910
to each other you just kind of interface
with

4198
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:33,920
with
 

4199
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,830
with
the existing program so it's uh

4200
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:35,840
the existing program so it's uh
 

4201
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,430
the existing program so it's uh
arbitrarily composable in this kind of

4202
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,440
arbitrarily composable in this kind of
 

4203
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,270
arbitrarily composable in this kind of
way so you have different uh

4204
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:39,280
way so you have different uh
 

4205
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,390
way so you have different uh
different groups that could be working

4206
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:40,400
different groups that could be working
 

4207
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,270
different groups that could be working
so you could see it scaling to just

4208
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:43,280
so you could see it scaling to just
 

4209
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,030
so you could see it scaling to just
outside of dragons and kitties it could

4210
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:45,040
outside of dragons and kitties it could
 

4211
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,709
outside of dragons and kitties it could
be you could build like entire

4212
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:46,719
be you could build like entire
 

4213
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,950
be you could build like entire
ecosystems of software

4214
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:48,960
ecosystems of software
 

4215
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,470
ecosystems of software
yeah it's kind of weird i mean

4216
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:50,480
yeah it's kind of weird i mean
 

4217
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,110
yeah it's kind of weird i mean
especially in the the decentralized

4218
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,120
especially in the the decentralized
 

4219
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,430
especially in the the decentralized
finance space that's been popping up the

4220
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:55,440
finance space that's been popping up the
 

4221
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,590
finance space that's been popping up the
last two years there has been a huge

4222
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:57,600
last two years there has been a huge
 

4223
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,350
last two years there has been a huge
amount of really interesting things

4224
01:14:59,350 --> 01:14:59,360
amount of really interesting things
 

4225
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,750
amount of really interesting things
happen as a result of this is it

4226
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:01,760
happen as a result of this is it
 

4227
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,430
happen as a result of this is it
particular kind of like financial

4228
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,440
particular kind of like financial
 

4229
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,430
particular kind of like financial
applications kind of thing

4230
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:05,440
applications kind of thing
 

4231
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,830
applications kind of thing
yeah i mean there's like stable coins so

4232
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:07,840
yeah i mean there's like stable coins so
 

4233
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,270
yeah i mean there's like stable coins so
this is a kind of

4234
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:09,280
this is a kind of
 

4235
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,189
this is a kind of
tokens retain value i'm equal to one

4236
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:13,199
tokens retain value i'm equal to one
 

4237
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,110
tokens retain value i'm equal to one
dollar but they're kind of backed by a

4238
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,120
dollar but they're kind of backed by a
 

4239
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,750
dollar but they're kind of backed by a
crypt uh cryptocurrency um then there's

4240
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
crypt uh cryptocurrency um then there's
 

4241
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,149
crypt uh cryptocurrency um then there's
decentralized exchanges um

4242
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159
decentralized exchanges um
 

4243
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,189
decentralized exchanges um
so

4244
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:21,199
so
 

4245
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,630
so
when as far as the decentralized

4246
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:22,640
when as far as the decentralized
 

4247
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,990
when as far as the decentralized
exchanges goes up there's this uh

4248
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:26,000
exchanges goes up there's this uh
 

4249
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,630
exchanges goes up there's this uh
really interesting construction that

4250
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:28,640
really interesting construction that
 

4251
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,550
really interesting construction that
has existed for about one one and a half

4252
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:30,560
has existed for about one one and a half
 

4253
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,470
has existed for about one one and a half
years now called uniswap

4254
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:32,480
years now called uniswap
 

4255
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,470
years now called uniswap
so what unit swap is let's say a smart

4256
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:34,480
so what unit swap is let's say a smart
 

4257
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,149
so what unit swap is let's say a smart
contract that holds balances of uh two

4258
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:38,159
contract that holds balances of uh two
 

4259
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,070
contract that holds balances of uh two
tokens we'll call them token a and token

4260
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:40,080
tokens we'll call them token a and token
 

4261
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:40,870
tokens we'll call them token a and token
b

4262
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
b
 

4263
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,950
b
and it maintains an invariant that the

4264
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:42,960
and it maintains an invariant that the
 

4265
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,790
and it maintains an invariant that the
balance of token a multiplied by the

4266
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:44,800
balance of token a multiplied by the
 

4267
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,709
balance of token a multiplied by the
balance of token b has to equal the same

4268
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:46,719
balance of token b has to equal the same
 

4269
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:47,590
balance of token b has to equal the same
value

4270
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:47,600
value
 

4271
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,110
value
and so the way that you trade against

4272
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,120
and so the way that you trade against
 

4273
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,830
and so the way that you trade against
the thing is basically like you have

4274
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
the thing is basically like you have
 

4275
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,669
the thing is basically like you have
this kind of curve you know like x times

4276
01:15:53,669 --> 01:15:53,679
this kind of curve you know like x times
 

4277
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,030
this kind of curve you know like x times
y equals k and yeah before you trade

4278
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:57,040
y equals k and yeah before you trade
 

4279
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,630
y equals k and yeah before you trade
it's at some points on the curve after

4280
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:58,640
it's at some points on the curve after
 

4281
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,910
it's at some points on the curve after
you trade you just like pick some

4282
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
you trade you just like pick some
 

4283
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,590
you trade you just like pick some
different any any other points on the

4284
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:01,600
different any any other points on the
 

4285
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,750
different any any other points on the
curve and then whatever the delta x is

4286
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:03,760
curve and then whatever the delta x is
 

4287
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,110
curve and then whatever the delta x is
that's the amount of a tokens you

4288
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:05,120
that's the amount of a tokens you
 

4289
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,870
that's the amount of a tokens you
provide whatever the delta y is that's

4290
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
provide whatever the delta y is that's
 

4291
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,709
provide whatever the delta y is that's
the amount of b tokens you get or vice

4292
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719
the amount of b tokens you get or vice
 

4293
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:09,750
the amount of b tokens you get or vice
versa

4294
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:09,760
versa
 

4295
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,350
versa
and that's just and then kind of the

4296
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,360
and that's just and then kind of the
 

4297
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,470
and that's just and then kind of the
slope

4298
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:12,480
slope
 

4299
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,709
slope
at the current uh point on the curve

4300
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:14,719
at the current uh point on the curve
 

4301
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,910
at the current uh point on the curve
kind of is the price um and so

4302
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:17,920
kind of is the price um and so
 

4303
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,709
kind of is the price um and so
that just is the whole thing and

4304
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:20,719
that just is the whole thing and
 

4305
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,110
that just is the whole thing and
that just allows you to kind of have

4306
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:23,120
that just allows you to kind of have
 

4307
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:23,990
that just allows you to kind of have
this

4308
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:24,000
this
 

4309
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,830
this
exchange for tokens and even if there's

4310
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:27,840
exchange for tokens and even if there's
 

4311
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,149
exchange for tokens and even if there's
very few participants and the whole

4312
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,159
very few participants and the whole
 

4313
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:33,110
very few participants and the whole
thing is just like so simple and it's

4314
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:33,120
thing is just like so simple and it's
 

4315
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,950
thing is just like so simple and it's
just very easy to set up very easy to

4316
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:34,960
just very easy to set up very easy to
 

4317
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,189
just very easy to set up very easy to
participate in and

4318
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,199
participate in and
 

4319
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,229
participate in and
it just

4320
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:38,239
it just
 

4321
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:41,430
it just
provides so much value to people so

4322
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
provides so much value to people so
 

4323
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,709
provides so much value to people so
and uh

4324
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:42,719
and uh
 

4325
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:43,910
and uh
the uh

4326
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:43,920
the uh
 

4327
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,070
the uh
the fundamental the the the distributed

4328
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:46,080
the fundamental the the the distributed
 

4329
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,229
the fundamental the the the distributed
application infrastructure and allows

4330
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:48,239
application infrastructure and allows
 

4331
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,510
application infrastructure and allows
that somehow

4332
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:49,520
that somehow
 

4333
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,229
that somehow
yes so this is a smart contract meeting

4334
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:52,239
yes so this is a smart contract meeting
 

4335
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,750
yes so this is a smart contract meeting
this is all a computer program that's

4336
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
this is all a computer program that's
 

4337
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,229
this is all a computer program that's
just running on ethereum smart contracts

4338
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:56,239
just running on ethereum smart contracts
 

4339
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:59,430
just running on ethereum smart contracts
too are just fascinating they are

4340
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
too are just fascinating they are
 

4341
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,229
too are just fascinating they are
okay

4342
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:00,239
okay
 

4343
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,790
okay
do you think cryptocurrency may become

4344
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:02,800
do you think cryptocurrency may become
 

4345
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,189
do you think cryptocurrency may become
the main currency in the world one day

4346
01:17:05,189 --> 01:17:05,199
the main currency in the world one day
 

4347
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,950
the main currency in the world one day
so where do you think we're headed in

4348
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:06,960
so where do you think we're headed in
 

4349
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,390
so where do you think we're headed in
terms of

4350
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
terms of
 

4351
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,709
terms of
the role of currency the structure type

4352
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:10,719
the role of currency the structure type
 

4353
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,709
the role of currency the structure type
of currency in the world

4354
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:12,719
of currency in the world
 

4355
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:15,990
of currency in the world
i definitely expect some fiat currency

4356
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:16,000
i definitely expect some fiat currency
 

4357
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,189
i definitely expect some fiat currency
is to

4358
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:17,199
is to
 

4359
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,110
is to
continue to exist and continue to be

4360
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:19,120
continue to exist and continue to be
 

4361
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,870
continue to exist and continue to be
strong and i definitely expect kind of

4362
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:20,880
strong and i definitely expect kind of
 

4363
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,870
strong and i definitely expect kind of
fiat currencies to also digitize in

4364
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:22,880
fiat currencies to also digitize in
 

4365
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,310
fiat currencies to also digitize in
their own way over the next couple of

4366
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
their own way over the next couple of
 

4367
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,390
their own way over the next couple of
decades what's fiat currency by the way

4368
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:26,400
decades what's fiat currency by the way
 

4369
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,430
decades what's fiat currency by the way
oh just like things like us dollars and

4370
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:29,440
oh just like things like us dollars and
 

4371
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,350
oh just like things like us dollars and
like dollars and euros and yen and these

4372
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:31,360
like dollars and euros and yen and these
 

4373
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,870
like dollars and euros and yen and these
other things and they're sort of backed

4374
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:32,880
other things and they're sort of backed
 

4375
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,310
other things and they're sort of backed
by governments yes but i also expect

4376
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:36,320
by governments yes but i also expect
 

4377
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,950
by governments yes but i also expect
enough cryptocurrencies to

4378
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:38,960
enough cryptocurrencies to
 

4379
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,590
enough cryptocurrencies to
play a kind of important role in just

4380
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:41,600
play a kind of important role in just
 

4381
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,270
play a kind of important role in just
making sure that people always have an

4382
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:43,280
making sure that people always have an
 

4383
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,910
making sure that people always have an
alternative if uh fiat currencies start

4384
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:45,920
alternative if uh fiat currencies start
 

4385
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,470
alternative if uh fiat currencies start
breaking so like if or

you know some at a very high inflation
 

4391
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,270
you know some at a very high inflation

like cryptocurrencies are the sort of

01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:16,320
like cryptocurrencies are the sort of
 

4413
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,830
like cryptocurrencies are the sort of
thing that just because of their kind of

thing that just because of their kind of
 

4415
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,990
thing that just because of their kind of
global neutrality they're just kind of

4416
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:20,000
global neutrality they're just kind of
 

4417
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,070
global neutrality they're just kind of
always there and you can keep using them

4418
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,080
always there and you can keep using them

01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,590
always there and you can keep using them
it's interesting that you're quite

it's interesting that you're quite
humble about the possibilities of the

humble about the possibilities of the
 

4423
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,590

future of cryptocurrency
 

4425
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,189

you don't think there's a possible

future where

future where
it uh becomes the main set of currency

4430
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
it uh becomes the main set of currency
 

4431
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,870
it uh becomes the main set of currency
because it feels like fiat it feels like

because it feels like fiat it feels like

i think like four

01:18:52,189 --> 01:18:52,199
i think like four
 

4445
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,950
i think like four
cryptocurrencies being the

cryptocurrencies being the

01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,470
cryptocurrencies being the
main form of uh value to and of work

main form of uh value to and of work
 

4449
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,350
main form of uh value to and of work
well

4450
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,360
well
 

4451
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,750
well
like you do need to have some

4452
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:01,760

much more price stability than they have

4456
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:04,560
much more price stability than they have
 

4457
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,790
much more price stability than they have
today and i mean there are now stable

4458
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:06,800
today and i mean there are now stable
 

4459
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,709
today and i mean there are now stable
coins and there are kind of cryptic

4460
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:08,719
coins and there are kind of cryptic
 

4461
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,310
coins and there are kind of cryptic
cryptocurrencies that try to be more

4462
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
cryptocurrencies that try to be more
 

4463
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,470
cryptocurrencies that try to be more
stable than existing things like bitcoin

4464
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
stable than existing things like bitcoin
 

4465
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,470
stable than existing things like bitcoin
and ether but

4466
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:14,480
and ether but
 

4467
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,470
and ether but
that just is

4468
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:16,480
that just is
 

4469
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,390
that just is
to me kind of the main challenge do you

4470
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
to me kind of the main challenge do you
 

4471
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,910
to me kind of the main challenge do you
think oh that's do you think that's a

4472
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:19,920
think oh that's do you think that's a
 

4473
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,430
think oh that's do you think that's a
characteristic of this just being the

4474
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:21,440
characteristic of this just being the
 

4475
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,709
characteristic of this just being the
early days it's such a young concept

4476
01:19:24,709 --> 01:19:24,719
early days it's such a young concept
 

4477
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,790
early days it's such a young concept
that 10 years is nothing in the history

4478
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
that 10 years is nothing in the history
 

4479
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,189
that 10 years is nothing in the history
of money yeah and i think it's a

4480
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:29,199
of money yeah and i think it's a
 

4481
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,590
of money yeah and i think it's a
combination of two things right one is

4482
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:31,600
combination of two things right one is
 

4483
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,229
combination of two things right one is
um it's uh

4484
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:34,239
um it's uh
 

4485
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,070
um it's uh
it's still early days but the other is a

4486
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
it's still early days but the other is a
 

4487
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,510
it's still early days but the other is a
kind of more durable any kind of

4488
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:37,520
kind of more durable any kind of
 

4489
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,750
kind of more durable any kind of
economic problem which is that

4490
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:39,760
economic problem which is that
 

4491
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,910
economic problem which is that
like demand for currency is volatile

4492
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:41,920
like demand for currency is volatile
 

4493
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,510
like demand for currency is volatile
right because of like

4494
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:43,520
right because of like
 

4495
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,870
right because of like
recessions booms changes to technology

4496
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:46,880
recessions booms changes to technology
 

4497
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,870
recessions booms changes to technology
lots of things and if people's demand

4498
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
lots of things and if people's demand
 

4499
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,310
lots of things and if people's demand
for how much currency they want to hold

4500
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:50,320
for how much currency they want to hold
 

4501
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,270
for how much currency they want to hold
changes

4502
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:51,280
changes
 

4503
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,229
changes
and

4504
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:52,239
and
 

4505
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:53,750
and
if you have a currency that has a fixed

4506
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:53,760
if you have a currency that has a fixed
 

4507
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,550
if you have a currency that has a fixed
supply then the change in demand has to

4508
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,560
supply then the change in demand has to
 

4509
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,110
supply then the change in demand has to
be entirely expressed as a change in

4510
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
be entirely expressed as a change in
 

4511
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,110
be entirely expressed as a change in
value of the currency and so what that

4512
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,120
value of the currency and so what that
 

4513
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,709
value of the currency and so what that
means is that kind of the volatility of

4514
01:20:02,709 --> 01:20:02,719
means is that kind of the volatility of
 

4515
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:05,910
means is that kind of the volatility of
demand becomes entirely translated into

4516
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:05,920
demand becomes entirely translated into
 

4517
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,990
demand becomes entirely translated into
volatility and ahead of prices of things

4518
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:08,000
volatility and ahead of prices of things
 

4519
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,990
volatility and ahead of prices of things
that dominated in that currency

4520
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:10,000
that dominated in that currency
 

4521
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,390
that dominated in that currency
but if you have a currency where

4522
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
but if you have a currency where
 

4523
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,310
but if you have a currency where
instead the supply can change and so the

4524
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,320
instead the supply can change and so the
 

4525
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,070
instead the supply can change and so the
supply can go up when there's more

4526
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,080
supply can go up when there's more
 

4527
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,590
supply can go up when there's more
demand than

4528
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:17,600
demand than
 

4529
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,310
demand than
you have the supply and of absorbing

4530
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:20,320
you have the supply and of absorbing
 

4531
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,229
you have the supply and of absorbing
more of that volatility and so the price

4532
01:20:22,229 --> 01:20:22,239
more of that volatility and so the price
 

4533
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,750
more of that volatility and so the price
of the currency would absorb less of the

4534
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:23,760
of the currency would absorb less of the
 

4535
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,390
of the currency would absorb less of the
volatility on that topic so bitcoin does

4536
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:26,400
volatility on that topic so bitcoin does
 

4537
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,950
volatility on that topic so bitcoin does
have a limited supply specific fixed

4538
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:28,960
have a limited supply specific fixed
 

4539
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,430
have a limited supply specific fixed
supply yes uh what's

4540
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:31,440
supply yes uh what's
 

4541
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,669
supply yes uh what's
what's the idea and the ethereum doesn't

4542
01:20:33,669 --> 01:20:33,679
what's the idea and the ethereum doesn't
 

4543
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:36,950
what's the idea and the ethereum doesn't
but can you clarify

4544
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:36,960
but can you clarify
 

4545
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,629
but can you clarify
just in the comments you just made is

4546
01:20:38,629 --> 01:20:38,639
just in the comments you just made is
 

4547
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,510
just in the comments you just made is
ethereum qualify to the kind of currency

4548
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:41,520
ethereum qualify to the kind of currency
 

4549
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,870
ethereum qualify to the kind of currency
that you're talking about and being

4550
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:42,880
that you're talking about and being
 

4551
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,030
that you're talking about and being
flexible in the supply and it's a bit

4552
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,040
flexible in the supply and it's a bit
 

4553
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,870
flexible in the supply and it's a bit
more flexible but kind of the thing that

4554
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:46,880
more flexible but kind of the thing that
 

4555
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,750
more flexible but kind of the thing that
you would really want is

4556
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:49,760
you would really want is
 

4557
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,070
you would really want is
something that's kind of specifically

4558
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:52,080
something that's kind of specifically
 

4559
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,590
something that's kind of specifically
flexible

4560
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:53,600
flexible
 

4561
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,990
flexible
in response to how valuable the currency

4562
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:56,000
in response to how valuable the currency
 

4563
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:56,790
in response to how valuable the currency
is

4564
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
is
 

4565
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,750
is
and

4566
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:57,760
and
 

4567
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,149
and
and i'd recommend you to look at stable

4568
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:00,159
and i'd recommend you to look at stable
 

4569
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,990
and i'd recommend you to look at stable
coins as well so like things like die

4570
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
coins as well so like things like die
 

4571
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,870
coins as well so like things like die
for example that's a new like how do you

4572
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:04,880
for example that's a new like how do you
 

4573
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,950
for example that's a new like how do you
spell that dai

4574
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:06,960
spell that dai
 

4575
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,669
spell that dai
and what uh what's stable coins is that

4576
01:21:09,669 --> 01:21:09,679
and what uh what's stable coins is that
 

4577
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,590
and what uh what's stable coins is that
a type of cryptocurrency it is a type of

4578
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:11,600
a type of cryptocurrency it is a type of
 

4579
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,149
a type of cryptocurrency it is a type of
cryptocurrency it's um a type of

4580
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:14,159
cryptocurrency it's um a type of
 

4581
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:17,030
cryptocurrency it's um a type of
cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart

4582
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart
 

4583
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,950
cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart
contract one of these ethereum computer

4584
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:18,960
contract one of these ethereum computer
 

4585
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,750
contract one of these ethereum computer
programs that um where the smart

4586
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
programs that um where the smart
 

4587
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,990
programs that um where the smart
contract holds a bunch of ether and then

4588
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:24,000
contract holds a bunch of ether and then
 

4589
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,830
contract holds a bunch of ether and then
it is basically

4590
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:25,840
it is basically
 

4591
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,830
it is basically
like that people deposit and then at

4592
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:27,840
like that people deposit and then at
 

4593
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,149
like that people deposit and then at
issues die and the reason why people

4594
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:30,159
issues die and the reason why people
 

4595
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:31,830
issues die and the reason why people
deposit is because they wants to kind of

4596
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:31,840
deposit is because they wants to kind of
 

4597
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,910
deposit is because they wants to kind of
go high leverage on their ether and so

4598
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:33,920
go high leverage on their ether and so
 

4599
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,990
go high leverage on their ether and so
it kind of pairs these two sets of users

4600
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:36,000
it kind of pairs these two sets of users
 

4601
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,510
it kind of pairs these two sets of users
one that wants stability and one that

4602
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:37,520
one that wants stability and one that
 

4603
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,270
one that wants stability and one that
kind of wants extra risk together with

4604
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,280
kind of wants extra risk together with
 

4605
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,550
kind of wants extra risk together with
each other

4606
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:40,560
each other
 

4607
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,669
each other
and

4608
01:21:41,669 --> 01:21:41,679
and
 

4609
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,590
and
it basically

4610
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:43,600
it basically
 

4611
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,510
it basically
creates some

4612
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:45,520
creates some
 

4613
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,990
creates some
or gives one set of participants a

4614
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,000
or gives one set of participants a
 

4615
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,790
or gives one set of participants a
guarantee that they'll be pa uh that

4616
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:50,800
guarantee that they'll be pa uh that
 

4617
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,709
guarantee that they'll be pa uh that
they have this asset that can that that

4618
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:52,719
they have this asset that can that that
 

4619
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:54,550
they have this asset that can that that
can be later converted back into ether

4620
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:54,560
can be later converted back into ether
 

4621
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,149
can be later converted back into ether
but like specifically out kind of the

4622
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:56,159
but like specifically out kind of the
 

4623
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,229
but like specifically out kind of the
one dollar raid and it has some kind of

4624
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
one dollar raid and it has some kind of
 

4625
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,110
one dollar raid and it has some kind of
uh

4626
01:21:59,110 --> 01:21:59,120
uh
 

4627
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,430
uh
stabilizing network effects

4628
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:01,440
stabilizing network effects
 

4629
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,910
stabilizing network effects
yeah it has this yeah it has many kinds

4630
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:03,920
yeah it has this yeah it has many kinds
 

4631
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,149
yeah it has this yeah it has many kinds
of stabilizing mechanisms in it that's

4632
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:06,159
of stabilizing mechanisms in it that's
 

4633
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,590
of stabilizing mechanisms in it that's
fascinating okay this

4634
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:07,600
fascinating okay this
 

4635
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,750
fascinating okay this
this world is awesome technically just

4636
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:09,760
this world is awesome technically just
 

4637
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,350
this world is awesome technically just
from a scientific perspective it's an

4638
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:11,360
from a scientific perspective it's an
 

4639
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,750
from a scientific perspective it's an
awesome world uh that i i often don't

4640
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:13,760
awesome world uh that i i often don't
 

4641
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,510
awesome world uh that i i often don't
see from an outsider's perspective what

4642
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:15,520
see from an outsider's perspective what
 

4643
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,590
see from an outsider's perspective what
i often see is kind of

4644
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:17,600
i often see is kind of
 

4645
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,629
i often see is kind of
uh

4646
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:18,639
uh
 

4647
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:20,149
uh
maybe hype and

4648
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:20,159
maybe hype and
 

4649
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,910
maybe hype and
a little bit if i may say so like

4650
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:21,920
a little bit if i may say so like
 

4651
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,310
a little bit if i may say so like
charltonism

4652
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:24,320
charltonism
 

4653
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,470
charltonism
and you don't often see at least from an

4654
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
and you don't often see at least from an
 

4655
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,149
and you don't often see at least from an
outsider's perspective the beautiful

4656
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:28,159
outsider's perspective the beautiful
 

4657
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,790
outsider's perspective the beautiful
science of it and the engineering of it

4658
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:30,800
science of it and the engineering of it
 

4659
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,229
science of it and the engineering of it
maybe is there a comment you can make

4660
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:34,239
maybe is there a comment you can make
 

4661
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:35,430
maybe is there a comment you can make
of

4662
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440
of
 

4663
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,030
of
who to follow

4664
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:37,040
who to follow
 

4665
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,990
who to follow
how to learn about this world

4666
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,000
how to learn about this world
 

4667
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,229
how to learn about this world
without being

4668
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:42,239
without being
 

4669
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,550
without being
interrupted by the charlatans and the

4670
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:44,560
interrupted by the charlatans and the
 

4671
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,030
interrupted by the charlatans and the
hype people in the space

4672
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:47,040
hype people in the space
 

4673
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,110
hype people in the space
i think you do need to just know the

4674
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,120
i think you do need to just know the
 

4675
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,750
i think you do need to just know the
specific kind of just people to follow

4676
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:51,760
specific kind of just people to follow
 

4677
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,709
specific kind of just people to follow
like

4678
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:52,719
like
 

4679
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:53,750
like
there's

and there's all the kind of the
 

4683
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,270
and there's all the kind of the
cryptographers and the researchers and

4684
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:57,280
cryptographers and the researchers and
 

4685
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,189
cryptographers and the researchers and
then there's just like

4686
01:22:59,189 --> 01:22:59,199
then there's just like
 

4687
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:01,270
then there's just like
even just the ethereum research crew

4688
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,280
even just the ethereum research crew
 

4689
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,030
even just the ethereum research crew

you know there's a tension between
 

4789
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,110
you know there's a tension between
decentralization of currency and the

4790
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:45,120
decentralization of currency and the
 

4791
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,790

what's your sense about that tension can
is there some rule for regulation of

01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,040
is there some rule for regulation of
 

4801
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,430
is there some rule for regulation of
currency

4802

yeah is there like is the government the
 

4805

yeah is there like is the government the
enemy of digital currency of distributed

4806
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:03,600
enemy of digital currency of distributed
 

4807
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,390
enemy of digital currency of distributed
currency or can they be

4808
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:06,400
currency or can they be
 

4809
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,430
currency or can they be
like

4810
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:07,440
like
 

4811
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,070
like
cautious friends

4812
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,080
cautious friends
 

4813
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,110
cautious friends
i mean i think like

4814
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:13,120
i mean i think like
 

4815
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,790
i mean i think like
the one thing that people forget is that

4816
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:14,800
the one thing that people forget is that
 

4817
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,550
the one thing that people forget is that
it's clearly not entirely an enemy

4818
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:16,560
it's clearly not entirely an enemy
 

4819
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,390
it's clearly not entirely an enemy
because i think uh

4820
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:18,400
because i think uh
 

4821
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,709
because i think uh
if uh

4822
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:20,719
if uh
 

4823
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:23,030
if uh
there hadn't been so much government

4824
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:23,040
there hadn't been so much government
 

4825
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,229
there hadn't been so much government
regulation on and if centralized uh digi

4826
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:26,239
regulation on and if centralized uh digi
 

4827
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:26,950
regulation on and if centralized uh digi
like

4828
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:26,960
like
 

4829
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,790
like
issuing centralized digital currencies

4830
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:28,800
issuing centralized digital currencies
 

4831
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,270
issuing centralized digital currencies
then like we would be seeing

4832
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:31,280
then like we would be seeing
 

4833
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,470
then like we would be seeing
things with people like google and

4834
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:32,480
things with people like google and
 

4835
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,669
things with people like google and
facebook and twitter just kind of

4836
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:33,679
facebook and twitter just kind of
 

4837
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,070
facebook and twitter just kind of
issuing them left and right and then

4838
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,080
issuing them left and right and then
 

4839
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,270
issuing them left and right and then
like if that was the case then

4840
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,280
like if that was the case then
 

4841
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,790
like if that was the case then
decentralized currencies would still

4842
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:38,800
decentralized currencies would still
 

4843
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,229
decentralized currencies would still
appeal to some people but they

4844
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:40,239
appeal to some people but they
 

4845
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:41,669
appeal to some people but they
definitely would appeal to less people

4846
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:41,679
definitely would appeal to less people
 

4847
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:42,709
definitely would appeal to less people
than today

4848
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
than today
 

4849
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:43,669
than today
so

4850
01:25:43,669 --> 01:25:43,679
so
 

4851
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,430
so
even in that sense i think it's uh

4852
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:47,440
even in that sense i think it's uh
 

4853
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,669
even in that sense i think it's uh
clearly been kind of more of a help i

4854
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:49,679

acceptance and leverage of technology if
you look at the autonomous vehicle space

4936

cryptocurrency but
 

5087
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,070

5093
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,990
um is this kind of diversity good in the
crypto world do you see it sticking

what's your what's your sense i
 

5105
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,270
what's your what's your sense i
definitely think that diversity is good

5106
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:19,280
definitely think that diversity is good
 

5107
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,430
definitely think that diversity is good
and i definitely i think also that

5108
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:21,440
and i definitely i think also that
 

5109
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,750
and i definitely i think also that
there's probably too many people trying

5110
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:23,760
there's probably too many people trying
 

5111
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,910
there's probably too many people trying
to make separate blockchains of right

5112
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:25,920
to make separate blockchains of right
 

5113
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,070
to make separate blockchains of right
now and the numbers should definitely be

5114
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:28,080
now and the numbers should definitely be
 

5115
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,750
now and the numbers should definitely be
greater than one and probably greater

5116
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:29,760
greater than one and probably greater
 

5117
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,070
greater than one and probably greater
than two or even five uh not three

5118
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:32,080
than two or even five uh not three
 

5119
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,110
than two or even five uh not three
thousand

there's definitely this range from just

5128
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:41,840
there's definitely this range from just
 

5129
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,830
there's definitely this range from just
like one person

5130
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:43,840
like one person
 

5131
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,790
like one person
who

who
 

5133
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,030
who
just like wrongly thinks that you can

5134
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,040
just like wrongly thinks that you can
 

5135
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,350
just like wrongly thinks that you can
create a cryptocurrency in like 12 hours

5136
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:49,360
create a cryptocurrency in like 12 hours
 

5137
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,470
create a cryptocurrency in like 12 hours
and

5138
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:50,480
and
 

5139
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,830
and
doesn't even think about kind of the

5140
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:51,840
doesn't even think about kind of the
 

5141
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,669
doesn't even think about kind of the
community aspects of maintaining it

5142
01:30:53,669 --> 01:30:53,679
community aspects of maintaining it
 

5143
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:55,350
community aspects of maintaining it
going to

5144
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:55,360
going to
 

5145
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,030
going to
people

5146
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,040
people
 

5147
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,629
people
actually trying but only creating a

5148
01:30:58,629 --> 01:30:58,639
actually trying but only creating a
 

5149
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,149
actually trying but only creating a
really tiny one to like scammers to

5150
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:02,159
really tiny one to like scammers to
 

5151
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,470
really tiny one to like scammers to
people like making something that's

5152
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:04,480
people like making something that's
 

5153
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,070
people like making something that's
actually successful

5154
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:06,080
actually successful
 

5155
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,990
actually successful
and

5156
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:08,000
and
 

5157
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,430
and
then there's a lot of different

5158
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:09,440
then there's a lot of different
 

5159
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,189
then there's a lot of different
categories of blockchain and you have

5160
01:31:11,189 --> 01:31:11,199
categories of blockchain and you have
 

5161
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,629
categories of blockchain and you have
project in terms of what it's trying to

5162
01:31:12,629 --> 01:31:12,639
project in terms of what it's trying to
 

5163
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:16,070
project in terms of what it's trying to
do and what applications it's for um and

5164
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:16,080
do and what applications it's for um and
 

5165
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,750
do and what applications it's for um and
i think the experimentation is

5166
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760
i think the experimentation is
 

5167
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,830
i think the experimentation is
definitely healthy

5168
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:19,840
definitely healthy
 

5169
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,669
definitely healthy
if you look at the two worlds there

5170
01:31:21,669 --> 01:31:21,679
if you look at the two worlds there
 

5171
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:24,229
if you look at the two worlds there
might be a little bit disjoints but uh

5172
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:24,239
might be a little bit disjoints but uh
 

5173
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,990
might be a little bit disjoints but uh
the distributed applications

5174
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,000
the distributed applications
 

5175
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,590
the distributed applications
cryptocurrency and then the world of

5176
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:27,600
cryptocurrency and then the world of
 

5177
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,590
cryptocurrency and then the world of
artificial intelligence do you see

5178
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:29,600
artificial intelligence do you see
 

5179
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,669
artificial intelligence do you see
there's some overlap between these

5180
01:31:31,669 --> 01:31:31,679
there's some overlap between these
 

5181
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:32,870
there's some overlap between these
worlds

5182
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:32,880
worlds
 

5183
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,870
worlds
that both worry about centralized

5184
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:34,880
that both worry about centralized
 

5185
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,750
that both worry about centralized
control is there some overlap that's

5186
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:37,760
control is there some overlap that's
 

5187
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,110
control is there some overlap that's
interesting that you think about do you

5188
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:39,120
interesting that you think about do you
 

5189
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,709
interesting that you think about do you
think about ai much

5190
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:40,719
think about ai much
 

5191
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:43,270
think about ai much
yeah and i think

5192
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,280
yeah and i think
 

5193
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,110
yeah and i think
definitely had a thought about things

5194
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:45,120
definitely had a thought about things
 

5195
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:48,149
definitely had a thought about things
like like the ai and if control problems

5196
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:48,159
like like the ai and if control problems
 

5197
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,149
like like the ai and if control problems
and alignment problems and all of those

5198
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:50,159
and alignment problems and all of those
 

5199
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:51,270
and alignment problems and all of those
things do you worry about the

5200
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:51,280
things do you worry about the
 

5201
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,270
things do you worry about the
existential threat of ai that's

5202
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,280
existential threat of ai that's
 

5203
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,629
existential threat of ai that's
definitely one of the things i worry

5204
01:31:54,629 --> 01:31:54,639
definitely one of the things i worry
 

5205
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,790
definitely one of the things i worry
about

5206
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:56,800
about
 

5207
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,790
about
they think um

5208
01:31:58,790 --> 01:31:58,800
they think um
 

5209
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,070
they think um
blood

5210
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,080
blood
 

5211
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,910
blood
there's a lot of kind of common

5212
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:01,920
there's a lot of kind of common
 

5213
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,550
there's a lot of kind of common
challenges because in in both cases what

5214
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:04,560
challenges because in in both cases what
 

5215
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,229
challenges because in in both cases what
you're ultimately trying to do is you're

5216
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:06,239
you're ultimately trying to do is you're
 

5217
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,149
you're ultimately trying to do is you're
trying to kind of

5218
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:08,159
trying to kind of
 

5219
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,390
trying to kind of
get a simple system to direct a more

5220
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:10,400
get a simple system to direct a more
 

5221
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,750
get a simple system to direct a more
complex system like in the case of uh

5222
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:13,760
complex system like in the case of uh
 

5223
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,830
complex system like in the case of uh
these as strong ais the idea would be

5224
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:15,840
these as strong ais the idea would be
 

5225
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,750
these as strong ais the idea would be
that the simple system is people and the

5226
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:17,760
that the simple system is people and the
 

5227
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,229
that the simple system is people and the
complex system is well whatever

5228
01:32:20,229 --> 01:32:20,239
complex system is well whatever
 

5229
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:22,870
complex system is well whatever
um thing uh the people the people end up

5230
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:22,880
um thing uh the people the people end up
 

5231
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,629
um thing uh the people the people end up
kind of unleashing on the universe

5232
01:32:24,629 --> 01:32:24,639
kind of unleashing on the universe
 

5233
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,470
kind of unleashing on the universe
that'll hopefully be a great thing

5234
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:26,480
that'll hopefully be a great thing
 

5235
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,550
that'll hopefully be a great thing
um and

5236
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:28,560
um and
 

5237
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,629
um and
in the case of blockchains and of the

5238
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:30,639
in the case of blockchains and of the
 

5239
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:33,270
in the case of blockchains and of the
complex well the simple thing is

5240
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:33,280
complex well the simple thing is
 

5241
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,030
complex well the simple thing is
the algorithm which is a piece of static

5242
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:35,040
the algorithm which is a piece of static
 

5243
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,709
the algorithm which is a piece of static
and fully open source code and the more

5244
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:36,719
and fully open source code and the more
 

5245
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,629
and fully open source code and the more
complex thing is

5246
01:32:38,629 --> 01:32:38,639
complex thing is
 

5247
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:39,510
complex thing is
just

5248
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:39,520
just
 

5249
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,669
just
the num all of the different possible

5250
01:32:41,669 --> 01:32:41,679
the num all of the different possible
 

5251
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,830
the num all of the different possible
kind of human actors and of the

5252
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:43,840
kind of human actors and of the
 

5253
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,430
kind of human actors and of the
strategies that they

5254
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:45,440
strategies that they
 

5255
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,189
strategies that they
might end up used to participate in the

5256
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:47,199
might end up used to participate in the
 

5257
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,430
might end up used to participate in the
network

5258
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:49,440
network
 

5259
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,950
network
do you think about your own mortality

5260
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:50,960
do you think about your own mortality
 

5261
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,390
do you think about your own mortality
like what

5262
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:52,400
like what
 

5263
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,470
like what
you hope to accomplish in your life

5264
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
you hope to accomplish in your life
 

5265
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,990
you hope to accomplish in your life
oh i definitely i definitely think about

5266
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:56,000
oh i definitely i definitely think about
 

5267
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,709
oh i definitely i definitely think about
ending my own mortality

5268
01:32:58,709 --> 01:32:58,719
ending my own mortality
 

5269
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,950
ending my own mortality
so that's if i gave you the option to

5270
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:00,960
so that's if i gave you the option to
 

5271
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,430
so that's if i gave you the option to
live forever would you depends a lot on

5272
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:03,440
live forever would you depends a lot on
 

5273
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,669
live forever would you depends a lot on
what the fine bridge is

5274
01:33:05,669 --> 01:33:05,679
what the fine bridge is
 

5275
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:07,590
what the fine bridge is
i mean you know if it's one of those

5276
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:07,600
i mean you know if it's one of those
 

5277
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,870
i mean you know if it's one of those
things where i'm going to be kind of

5278
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:08,880
things where i'm going to be kind of
 

5279
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,950
things where i'm going to be kind of
like floating through empty space for 10

5280
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:10,960
like floating through empty space for 10
 

5281
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,870
like floating through empty space for 10
to the 75 years then no if it's uh

5282
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:14,880
to the 75 years then no if it's uh
 

5283
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,910
to the 75 years then no if it's uh
um

5284
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:15,920
um
 

5285
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,110
um
forever worth of uh end of having

5286
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:19,120
forever worth of uh end of having
 

5287
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:19,990
forever worth of uh end of having
you know

to be working on then

5302
01:33:34,629 --> 01:33:34,639
to be working on then
 

5303
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,390
to be working on then
i think absolutely

5304
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
i think absolutely
 

5305
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,350
i think absolutely
move

5306
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:37,360
move
 

5307
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:40,070
move
that's uh beautifully put live forever

5308
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:40,080
that's uh beautifully put live forever
 

5309
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,229
that's uh beautifully put live forever
but uh you'd have to check the fine

5310
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,239
but uh you'd have to check the fine
 

5311
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:43,590
but uh you'd have to check the fine
print um

5312
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:43,600
print um
 

5313
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,350
print um
i think there's no better way to end it

5314
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,360
i think there's no better way to end it
 

5315
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,110
i think there's no better way to end it
