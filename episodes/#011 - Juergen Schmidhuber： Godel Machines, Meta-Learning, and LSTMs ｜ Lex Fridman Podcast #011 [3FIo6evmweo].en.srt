inspired you when I was a boy I'm I was

52
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:17,990
inspired you when I was a boy I'm I was
 

53
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,230
inspired you when I was a boy I'm I was
thinking about what to do in my life and

54
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
thinking about what to do in my life and
 

55
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,740
thinking about what to do in my life and
then I thought the most exciting thing

56
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:23,750
then I thought the most exciting thing
 

57
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,130
then I thought the most exciting thing
is to solve the riddles of the universe

58
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,140
is to solve the riddles of the universe
 

59
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,320
is to solve the riddles of the universe
and and that means you have to become a

60
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,330
and and that means you have to become a
 

61
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,760
and and that means you have to become a
physicist however then I realized that

62
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:33,770
physicist however then I realized that
 

63
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,190
physicist however then I realized that
there's something even grander you can

64
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,200
there's something even grander you can
 

65
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,540
there's something even grander you can
try to build a machine that isn't really

66
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:40,550
try to build a machine that isn't really
 

67
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,850
try to build a machine that isn't really
a machine any longer that learns to

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:42,860
a machine any longer that learns to
 

69
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,920
a machine any longer that learns to
become a much better physicist than I

70
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:44,930
become a much better physicist than I
 

71
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,800
become a much better physicist than I
could ever hope to be and that's how I

72
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:47,810
could ever hope to be and that's how I
 

73
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,800
could ever hope to be and that's how I
thought maybe I can multiply my tiny

74
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:50,810
thought maybe I can multiply my tiny

little bit of creativity into infinity

76
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:53,710
little bit of creativity into infinity
 

77
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,530
little bit of creativity into infinity
but ultimately that creativity will be

78
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:56,540
but ultimately that creativity will be
 

79
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,090
but ultimately that creativity will be
multiplied to understand the universe

80
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,100
multiplied to understand the universe
 

81
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,320
multiplied to understand the universe
around us that's that's the the

82
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,330
around us that's that's the the
 

83
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,750
around us that's that's the the
curiosity for that mystery that that

84
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:04,760
curiosity for that mystery that that
 

85
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,660
curiosity for that mystery that that
drove you yes so if you can build a

86
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:07,670
drove you yes so if you can build a
 

87
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,710
drove you yes so if you can build a
machine that learns to solve more and

88
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:11,720
machine that learns to solve more and
 

89
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,650
machine that learns to solve more and
more complex problems and more and more

90
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:14,660
more complex problems and more and more
 

91
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,560
more complex problems and more and more
general problems older then you

92
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:17,570
general problems older then you
 

93
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,880
general problems older then you
basically have solved all the problems

94
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:21,890
basically have solved all the problems
 

95
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,140
basically have solved all the problems
at least all the solvable problems so

96
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,150
at least all the solvable problems so
 

97
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,090
at least all the solvable problems so
how do you think what is the mechanism

98
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,100
how do you think what is the mechanism
 

99
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,460
how do you think what is the mechanism
for that kind of general solver look

100
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,470
for that kind of general solver look
 

101
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,479
for that kind of general solver look
like obviously we don't quite yet have

102
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:34,489
like obviously we don't quite yet have
 

103
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,460
like obviously we don't quite yet have
one or know how to build one who have

104
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:36,470
one or know how to build one who have
 

105
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,680
one or know how to build one who have
ideas and you have had throughout your

106
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:38,690
ideas and you have had throughout your
 

107
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,229
ideas and you have had throughout your
career several ideas about it so how do

108
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:41,239
career several ideas about it so how do
 

109
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,140
career several ideas about it so how do
you think about that mechanism so in the

110
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,150
you think about that mechanism so in the
 

111
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,100
you think about that mechanism so in the
80s I thought about how to build this

112
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,110
80s I thought about how to build this
 

113
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,350
80s I thought about how to build this
machine that learns to solve all these

114
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:50,360
machine that learns to solve all these
 

115
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,670
machine that learns to solve all these
problems I cannot solve myself and I

116
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:54,680
problems I cannot solve myself and I
 

117
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,650
problems I cannot solve myself and I
thought it is clear that has to be a

118
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:56,660
thought it is clear that has to be a
 

119
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,770
thought it is clear that has to be a
machine that not only learns to solve

120
00:02:59,770 --> 00:02:59,780
machine that not only learns to solve
 

121
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,550
machine that not only learns to solve
this problem here and

122
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:01,560
this problem here and
 

123
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,360
this problem here and
problem here but it also has to learn to

124
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,370
problem here but it also has to learn to
 

125
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,530
problem here but it also has to learn to
improve the learning algorithm itself so

126
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:09,540
improve the learning algorithm itself so
 

127
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,589
improve the learning algorithm itself so
it has to have the learning algorithm in

128
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:12,599
it has to have the learning algorithm in
 

129
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,660
it has to have the learning algorithm in
a representation that allows it to

130
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:14,670
a representation that allows it to
 

131
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,320
a representation that allows it to
inspect it and modify it such that it

132
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,330
inspect it and modify it such that it
 

133
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,270
inspect it and modify it such that it
can come up with a better learning

134
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:20,280
can come up with a better learning
 

135
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,440
can come up with a better learning
algorithm so I call that meta learning

136
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,450
algorithm so I call that meta learning
 

137
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,600
algorithm so I call that meta learning
learning to learn and recursive

138
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:26,610
learning to learn and recursive
 

139
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,850
learning to learn and recursive
self-improvement that is really the

140
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:28,860
self-improvement that is really the
 

141
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,460
self-improvement that is really the
pinnacle of that why you then not only

142
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:31,470
pinnacle of that why you then not only
 

143
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,949
pinnacle of that why you then not only
alarm how to improve on that problem and

144
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
alarm how to improve on that problem and
 

145
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,470
alarm how to improve on that problem and
on that but you also improve the way the

146
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,480
on that but you also improve the way the
 

147
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,900
on that but you also improve the way the
machine improves and you also improve

148
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:41,910
machine improves and you also improve
 

149
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,910
machine improves and you also improve
the way it improves the way it improves

150
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
the way it improves the way it improves
 

151
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,020
the way it improves the way it improves

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,490
kind of form you've talked about how
that's not really meta learning with

transfer learning can you talk about the

174
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:22,229
transfer learning can you talk about the
 

175
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,380
transfer learning can you talk about the
difference between the big general meta

176
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,390
difference between the big general meta
 

177
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,590
difference between the big general meta
learning and a more narrow sense of meta

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,130
learning the way it's used today the
 

181
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,580
learning the way it's used today the
ways talked about today let's take the

182
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:31,590
ways talked about today let's take the
 

183
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,469
ways talked about today let's take the
example of a deep neural networks that

184
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:33,479
example of a deep neural networks that
 

185
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,640
example of a deep neural networks that
has learnt to classify images and maybe

186
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:37,650
has learnt to classify images and maybe
 

187
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,450
has learnt to classify images and maybe
you have trained that network on 100

188
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:41,460
you have trained that network on 100
 

189
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,129
you have trained that network on 100
different databases of images and now a

190
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:46,139
different databases of images and now a
 

191
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,890
different databases of images and now a
new database comes along and you want to

192
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:48,900
new database comes along and you want to
 

193
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,510
new database comes along and you want to
quickly learn the new thing as well so

194
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
quickly learn the new thing as well so
 

195
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,430
quickly learn the new thing as well so
one simple way of doing that as you take

196
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
one simple way of doing that as you take
 

197
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,420
one simple way of doing that as you take
the network which already knows 100

198
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,430
the network which already knows 100
 

199
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,409
the network which already knows 100
types of databases and then you would

200
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:03,419
types of databases and then you would
 

201
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,590
types of databases and then you would
just take the top layer of that and you

202
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:06,600
just take the top layer of that and you
 

203
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,180
just take the top layer of that and you
retrain that using the new label data

204
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,190
retrain that using the new label data
 

205
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,090
retrain that using the new label data
that you have in the new image database

206
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,100
that you have in the new image database
 

207
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,790
that you have in the new image database
and then it turns out that it really

208
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
and then it turns out that it really
 

209
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
and then it turns out that it really
really quickly can learn that to one

210
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,290
really quickly can learn that to one
 

211
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,070
really quickly can learn that to one
shot basically because from the first

212
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
shot basically because from the first
 

213
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,020
shot basically because from the first
100 data sets

214
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,030
100 data sets
 

215
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,910
100 data sets
it already has learned so much about

216
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:25,920
it already has learned so much about
 

217
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,490
it already has learned so much about
about computer vision that it can reuse

218
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:28,500
about computer vision that it can reuse
 

219
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,550
about computer vision that it can reuse
that and that is then almost good enough

220
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:31,560
that and that is then almost good enough
 

221
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,860
that and that is then almost good enough
to solve the new task except you need a

222
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:33,870
to solve the new task except you need a
 

223
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,570
to solve the new task except you need a
little bit of adjustment on the top so

224
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:38,580
little bit of adjustment on the top so
 

225
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,690
little bit of adjustment on the top so
that is transfer learning and it has

226
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:41,700
that is transfer learning and it has
 

227
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,820
that is transfer learning and it has
been done in principle for many decades

modify any part of the learning
 

245
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,050
modify any part of the learning

right that there's no evidence no

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:29,160
right that there's no evidence no
physical evidence for that so there's an

physical evidence for that so there's an

we think as humans require randomness so
you don't find randomness beautiful you

you don't find randomness beautiful you
 

945
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,080
you don't find randomness beautiful you
use you find simple determinism

use you find simple determinism
beautiful yeah okay so why why because

948
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,390

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,840
there was an astronomer whose name was
Keppler and he looked at the data points

1028
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:21,850
Keppler and he looked at the data points
 

1029
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,440
Keppler and he looked at the data points
that he got by watching planets move and

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,450
that he got by watching planets move and
 

1031
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,659
that he got by watching planets move and
then he had all these data points and

1032
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:27,669
then he had all these data points and
 

1033
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,120
then he had all these data points and
suddenly turnouts that he can greatly

suddenly turnouts that he can greatly
compress the data by predicting it

1036

compress the data by predicting it
 

1037
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,610
compress the data by predicting it
through an ellipse law so it turns out

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,110
through an ellipse law so it turns out
that all these data points are more or

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,490
compression of these observations became
much more compressible because as long

much more compressible because as long
 

1061
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,220
much more compressible because as long

something wrong with that theory of the
 

1073
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:35,289
something wrong with that theory of the

00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:40,369
years later another guy came along whose
 

1079
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:43,930
years later another guy came along whose
name was Einstein and he he was able to

00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,839
name was Einstein and he he was able to
explain away all these deviations from

00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:46,849
explain away all these deviations from
 

1083
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:50,409
explain away all these deviations from
the predictions of the old theory

1084

00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,739
the predictions of the old theory
through a new theory which was called

through a new theory which was called

00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:57,129
through a new theory which was called
the general theory of relativity which

1088
00:27:57,129 --> 00:27:57,139
the general theory of relativity which
 

1089
00:27:57,139 --> 00:27:59,799
the general theory of relativity which
at first glance looks a little bit more

1090
00:27:59,799 --> 00:27:59,809
at first glance looks a little bit more
 

1091
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:01,899
at first glance looks a little bit more
complicated and you have to warp space

1092
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:01,909
complicated and you have to warp space
 

1093
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:04,060
complicated and you have to warp space
and time but you can't phrase it within

1094
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,070
and time but you can't phrase it within
 

1095

00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:10,389
one single sentence which is no matter
how fast you accelerate and how fast are

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,320
how fast you accelerate and how fast are
hard you decelerate and no matter what

1100
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,330
hard you decelerate and no matter what
 

1101
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,099
hard you decelerate and no matter what
is the gravity in your local framework

1102
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:18,109
is the gravity in your local framework
 

1103
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:21,190
is the gravity in your local framework
Lightspeed always looks the same and

1104
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,200
Lightspeed always looks the same and
 

1105
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,619
Lightspeed always looks the same and
from from that you can calculate all the

1106
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:23,629
from from that you can calculate all the
 

1107
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:25,299
from from that you can calculate all the
consequences so it's a very simple thing

1108
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:25,309
consequences so it's a very simple thing
 

1109
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,779
consequences so it's a very simple thing
and it allows you to further compress

1110
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:28,789
and it allows you to further compress
 

1111
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:32,019
and it allows you to further compress
all the observations because suddenly

1112
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:32,029
all the observations because suddenly
 

1113
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:34,989
all the observations because suddenly
there are hardly any deviations any

1114
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:34,999
there are hardly any deviations any
 

1115
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:37,269
there are hardly any deviations any
longer that you can measure from the

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,659
longer that you can measure from the

00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:40,669
predictions of this new theory so all of
 

1119
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:43,719
predictions of this new theory so all of
science is a history of compression

further and says let's not only search

1232
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,010
further and says let's not only search
 

1233
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,910
further and says let's not only search
for solutions to a given problem but

00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:24,920
for solutions to a given problem but
 

1235
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,990
for solutions to a given problem but
let's search two pairs of problems and

00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,000
let's search two pairs of problems and
 

1237
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,450
let's search two pairs of problems and
their solutions where the system itself

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:31,460
their solutions where the system itself
 

1239
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,170
their solutions where the system itself
has the opportunity to phrase its own

has the opportunity to phrase its own
 

1241
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,610
has the opportunity to phrase its own

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,620
problem so we are looking suddenly at
pairs of problems and their solutions or

degree of freedom allows us to build

1254
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,250
degree of freedom allows us to build
 

1255
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,370

Korea systems that are like scientists

1256
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:01,380
Korea systems that are like scientists
 

1257
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,310
Korea systems that are like scientists
in the sense that they not only try to

00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
in the sense that they not only try to
 

1259
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,800
in the sense that they not only try to
solve and try to find answers to

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:06,810
solve and try to find answers to
 

1261
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,820
solve and try to find answers to
existing questions no they are also free

1262
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:09,830
existing questions no they are also free
 

1263
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,640
existing questions no they are also free
to impose their own questions so if you

1264
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:13,650
to impose their own questions so if you
 

1265
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,470
to impose their own questions so if you
want to build an artificial scientist we

1266
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:15,480
want to build an artificial scientist we
 

1267
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,240
want to build an artificial scientist we
have to give it that freedom and power

1268
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,250
have to give it that freedom and power
 

1269
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,060
have to give it that freedom and power
play is exactly doing that so that's

1270
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,070
play is exactly doing that so that's
 

1271
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,670
play is exactly doing that so that's
that's a dimension of freedom that's

1272
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:21,680
that's a dimension of freedom that's
 

1273
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,050
that's a dimension of freedom that's
important to have but how do you are

1274
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,060
important to have but how do you are
 

1275
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,170
important to have but how do you are
hardly you think that

1276
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:27,180

 

1277
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:31,040

00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:35,670
questions is yeah so as as it's one of
 

1283
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,100
questions is yeah so as as it's one of
the things that as human beings we

1284
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,110
the things that as human beings we
 

1285
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,350
the things that as human beings we
consider to be the thing that makes us

1286
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
consider to be the thing that makes us
 

1287
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,090
consider to be the thing that makes us
special the intelligence that makes us

1288
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,100
special the intelligence that makes us
 

1289
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,780
special the intelligence that makes us
special is that brilliant insight yeah

1290
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:44,790
special is that brilliant insight yeah
 

1291
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,180
special is that brilliant insight yeah
that can create something totally new

1292
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,190
that can create something totally new
 

1293
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,780
that can create something totally new
yes so now let's look at the extreme

1294
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:50,790
yes so now let's look at the extreme
 

1295
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,300
yes so now let's look at the extreme
case let's look at the set of all

1296
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,310
case let's look at the set of all
 

1297
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,480
case let's look at the set of all
possible problems that you can formally

1298
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:56,490
possible problems that you can formally
 

1299
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,400
possible problems that you can formally
describe which is infinite which should

1300
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:01,410
describe which is infinite which should
 

1301
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:05,300
describe which is infinite which should
be the next problem that a scientist or

1302
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,310
be the next problem that a scientist or
 

1303
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,860
be the next problem that a scientist or
power-play is going to solve well it

1304
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:09,870
power-play is going to solve well it
 

1305
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:14,300
power-play is going to solve well it
should be the easiest problem that goes

1306
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:14,310
should be the easiest problem that goes
 

1307
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,040
should be the easiest problem that goes
beyond what you already know

1308
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,050
beyond what you already know
 

1309
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,130
beyond what you already know
so it should be the simplest problem

1310
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,140
so it should be the simplest problem
 

1311
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,590
so it should be the simplest problem
that the current problems all of that

1312
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:22,600
that the current problems all of that
 

1313
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
that the current problems all of that
you have which can already sold 100

1314
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:24,610
you have which can already sold 100
 

1315
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,860
you have which can already sold 100
problems that he cannot solve yet by

1316
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:28,870
problems that he cannot solve yet by
 

1317
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,580
problems that he cannot solve yet by
just generalizing so it has to be new so

1318
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:32,590
just generalizing so it has to be new so
 

1319
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,770
just generalizing so it has to be new so
it has to require a modification of the

1320
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:34,780
it has to require a modification of the
 

1321
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,720
it has to require a modification of the
problem solver such that the new problem

1322
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:36,730
problem solver such that the new problem
 

1323
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,300
problem solver such that the new problem
solver can solve this new thing but the

1324
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,310
solver can solve this new thing but the
 

1325
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,130
solver can solve this new thing but the
old problem solver cannot do it

1326
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:41,140
old problem solver cannot do it
 

1327
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,790
old problem solver cannot do it
and in addition to that we have to make

1328
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:44,800
and in addition to that we have to make
 

1329
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,880
and in addition to that we have to make
sure that the problem solver doesn't

1330
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:47,890
sure that the problem solver doesn't
 

1331
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,890
sure that the problem solver doesn't
forget any of the previous solutions

1332
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:49,900
forget any of the previous solutions
 

1333
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,520
forget any of the previous solutions
right and so by definition power play is

1334
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:53,530
right and so by definition power play is
 

1335
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,770
right and so by definition power play is
now trying always to search and this

1336
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:55,780
now trying always to search and this
 

1337
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,310
now trying always to search and this

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:05,860
for a combination that minimize the time
 

1343
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,760
for a combination that minimize the time
to achieve these criteria so as always

1344
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:08,770
to achieve these criteria so as always
 

1345
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,340
to achieve these criteria so as always
trying to find the problem which is

1346
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:11,350
trying to find the problem which is
 

1347
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:15,120
trying to find the problem which is
easiest to add to the repertoire so just

1348
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,130
easiest to add to the repertoire so just
 

1349
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,270
easiest to add to the repertoire so just
like grad students and academics and

1350
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:18,280
like grad students and academics and
 

1351
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,010
like grad students and academics and
researchers can spend the whole career

1352
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,020
researchers can spend the whole career
 

1353
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,620
researchers can spend the whole career
in a local minima hmm

00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,080
this approach of looking for the
 

1363
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,290
this approach of looking for the
simplest unsolvable problem to get stuck

1364

simplest unsolvable problem to get stuck
 

1365
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,480
simplest unsolvable problem to get stuck
in a local minima is not never really

in a local minima is not never really
discovering new you know really jumping

1373
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,740
solved in a genuine creative way no
because that's the nature of power play

1374
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:49,750
because that's the nature of power play
 

1375
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,110
because that's the nature of power play
that it's always trying to break its

00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,120
that it's always trying to break its
 

1377
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,130
that it's always trying to break its
current generalization abilities by

1378
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:56,140
current generalization abilities by
 

1379
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,170
current generalization abilities by
coming up with a new problem which is

1380
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:58,180
coming up with a new problem which is
 

1381
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,390
coming up with a new problem which is
beyond the current horizon

1382
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:00,400
beyond the current horizon
 

1383
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,020
beyond the current horizon
just shifting the horizon of knowledge a

00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,030
just shifting the horizon of knowledge a
 

1385
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,480
just shifting the horizon of knowledge a
little bit out there breaking the

1386
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:06,490
little bit out there breaking the
 

1387
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,500
little bit out there breaking the
existing rules

00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,090
search says the new thing becomes
 

1391
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,300
search says the new thing becomes
solvable but wasn't solvable by the old

1392
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,310
solvable but wasn't solvable by the old
 

1393
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,170
solvable but wasn't solvable by the old
thing so like adding a new axiom like

1394
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:16,180
thing so like adding a new axiom like
 

1395
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,050

what Google did when he came up with

1396
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,060
what Google did when he came up with
 

1397
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,600
what Google did when he came up with
these new sentences new theorems that

1398
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:21,610
these new sentences new theorems that
 

1399
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,670
these new sentences new theorems that
didn't have a proof in the phone system

1400
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
didn't have a proof in the phone system
 

1401
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,500
didn't have a proof in the phone system
which means you can add them to the

1402
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:25,510
which means you can add them to the
 

1403
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,140
which means you can add them to the
repertoire

1404
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,150
repertoire

damage the consistency of the whole
 

1409
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,720
damage the consistency of the whole

intrinsic motivation you talk about

1414
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:44,760
intrinsic motivation you talk about
 

1415
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,200
intrinsic motivation you talk about
discovery as intrinsic reward so if you

1416
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,210
discovery as intrinsic reward so if you
 

1417
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,769
discovery as intrinsic reward so if you
view humans as intelligent agents what

1418
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:51,779
view humans as intelligent agents what
 

1419
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:53,539
view humans as intelligent agents what
do you think is the purpose and meaning

1420
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:53,549
do you think is the purpose and meaning
 

1421
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:57,380
do you think is the purpose and meaning
of life far as humans is you've talked

1422
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:57,390
of life far as humans is you've talked
 

1423
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,569
of life far as humans is you've talked
about this discovery do you see humans

1424
00:35:59,569 --> 00:35:59,579
about this discovery do you see humans
 

1425
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,390
about this discovery do you see humans
as an instance of power play

1426
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:01,400
as an instance of power play
 

1427
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:08,140
as an instance of power play
agents yeah so humans are curious and

1428
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,150
agents yeah so humans are curious and
 

1429
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,269
agents yeah so humans are curious and
that means they behave like scientists

1430
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:11,279
that means they behave like scientists
 

1431
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:13,279
that means they behave like scientists
not only the official scientists but

1432
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:13,289
not only the official scientists but
 

1433
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:15,710
not only the official scientists but
even the babies behave like scientists

1434
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:15,720
even the babies behave like scientists
 

1435
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,859
even the babies behave like scientists
and they play around with toys to figure

1436
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:18,869
and they play around with toys to figure
 

1437
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:20,960
and they play around with toys to figure
out how the world works and how it is

1438
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:20,970
out how the world works and how it is
 

1439
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,260
out how the world works and how it is
responding to their actions and that's

1440
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,270
responding to their actions and that's
 

1441
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,120
responding to their actions and that's
how they learn about gravity and

1442
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,130
how they learn about gravity and
 

1443
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,779
how they learn about gravity and
everything and yeah in 1990 we had the

1444
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:29,789
everything and yeah in 1990 we had the
 

1445
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:31,370
everything and yeah in 1990 we had the
first systems like the hand would just

1446
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:31,380
first systems like the hand would just
 

1447
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,620
first systems like the hand would just
try to to play around with the

1448
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:33,630
try to to play around with the
 

1449
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,539
try to to play around with the
environment and come up with situations

1450
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:35,549
environment and come up with situations
 

1451
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:39,170
environment and come up with situations
that go beyond what they knew at that

1452
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:39,180
that go beyond what they knew at that
 

1453
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,809
that go beyond what they knew at that
time and then get a reward for creating

1454
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:41,819
time and then get a reward for creating
 

1455
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:44,750
time and then get a reward for creating
these situations and then becoming more

1456
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:44,760
these situations and then becoming more
 

1457
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,339
these situations and then becoming more
general problem solvers and being able

1458
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:46,349
general problem solvers and being able
 

1459
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:49,549
general problem solvers and being able
to understand more of the world so yeah

1460
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:49,559
to understand more of the world so yeah
 

1461
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,740
to understand more of the world so yeah
I think in principle that that that

1462
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,750
I think in principle that that that
 

1463
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:01,279
I think in principle that that that
curiosity strategy or sophisticated

1464
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:01,289
curiosity strategy or sophisticated
 

1465
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,410
curiosity strategy or sophisticated
versions of whether chess is quiet they

1466
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:03,420
versions of whether chess is quiet they
 

1467
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,019
versions of whether chess is quiet they
are what we have built-in as well

1468
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:06,029
are what we have built-in as well
 

1469
00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:08,390
are what we have built-in as well
because evolution discovered that's a

1470
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
because evolution discovered that's a
 

1471
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,940
because evolution discovered that's a
good way of exploring the unknown world

1472
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:10,950
good way of exploring the unknown world
 

1473
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,309
good way of exploring the unknown world
and a guy who explores the unknown world

1474
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:13,319
and a guy who explores the unknown world
 

1475
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:16,549
and a guy who explores the unknown world
has a higher chance of solving problems

1476
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:16,559
has a higher chance of solving problems
 

1477
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:18,589
has a higher chance of solving problems
that he needs to survive in this world

1478
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:18,599
that he needs to survive in this world
 

1479
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,370
that he needs to survive in this world
on the other hand those guys who were

1480
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:22,380
on the other hand those guys who were
 

1481
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,980
on the other hand those guys who were
too curious they were weeded out as well

1482
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:24,990
too curious they were weeded out as well
 

1483
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,960
too curious they were weeded out as well
so you have to find this trade-off

1484
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:26,970
so you have to find this trade-off
 

1485
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,720
so you have to find this trade-off
evolution found a certain trade-off

1486
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:28,730
evolution found a certain trade-off
 

1487
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,120
evolution found a certain trade-off
apparently in our society there are as a

1488
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,130
apparently in our society there are as a
 

1489
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,010
apparently in our society there are as a
certain percentage of extremely

1490
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:34,020
certain percentage of extremely
 

1491
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,650
certain percentage of extremely
exploitive guy

1492
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:35,660
exploitive guy
 

1493
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,750
exploitive guy
and it doesn't matter if they die

1494
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:37,760
and it doesn't matter if they die
 

1495
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,270
and it doesn't matter if they die
because many of the others are more

1496
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:40,280
because many of the others are more
 

1497
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,950
because many of the others are more
conservative and and and so yeah it

1498
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:44,960
conservative and and and so yeah it
 

1499
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,780
conservative and and and so yeah it
would be surprising to me if if that

1500
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:49,790
would be surprising to me if if that
 

1501
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,700
would be surprising to me if if that
principle of artificial curiosity

1502
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:53,710
principle of artificial curiosity
 

1503
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,140
principle of artificial curiosity
wouldn't be present and almost exactly

1504
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,150
wouldn't be present and almost exactly
 

1505
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,320
wouldn't be present and almost exactly
the same form here in our brains

1506
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,330
the same form here in our brains
 

1507
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,570
the same form here in our brains
so you're a bit of a musician and an

1508
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:01,580
so you're a bit of a musician and an
 

1509
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,620
so you're a bit of a musician and an
artist so continuing on this topic of

1510
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:05,630
artist so continuing on this topic of
 

1511
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,320
artist so continuing on this topic of
creativity what do you think is the role

1512
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,330
creativity what do you think is the role
 

1513
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,810
creativity what do you think is the role
of creativity and intelligence so you've

1514
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:10,820
of creativity and intelligence so you've
 

1515
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,970
of creativity and intelligence so you've
kind of implied that it's essential for

1516
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:14,980
kind of implied that it's essential for
 

1517
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,930
kind of implied that it's essential for
intelligence if you think of

1518
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:16,940
intelligence if you think of
 

1519
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,730
intelligence if you think of
intelligence as a problem-solving system

1520
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:20,740
intelligence as a problem-solving system
 

1521
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,620
intelligence as a problem-solving system
as ability to solve problems but do you

1522
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:23,630
as ability to solve problems but do you
 

1523
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,990
as ability to solve problems but do you
think it's essential this idea of

1524
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
think it's essential this idea of
 

1525
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,300
think it's essential this idea of
creativity we never have a program a sub

1526
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,310
creativity we never have a program a sub
 

1527
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,670
creativity we never have a program a sub
program that is called creativity or

1528
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:33,680
program that is called creativity or
 

1529
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,890
program that is called creativity or
something it's just a side effect of

1530
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:35,900
something it's just a side effect of
 

1531
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,230
something it's just a side effect of
when our problem solvers do they are

1532
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,240
when our problem solvers do they are
 

1533
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,690
when our problem solvers do they are
searching a space of problems or a space

1534
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:40,700
searching a space of problems or a space
 

1535
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,780
searching a space of problems or a space
of candidates of solution candidates

1536
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:43,790
of candidates of solution candidates
 

1537
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,750
of candidates of solution candidates
until they hopefully find a solution to

00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:46,760
until they hopefully find a solution to

00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,730
until they hopefully find a solution to
have given from them but then there are

1540
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:48,740
have given from them but then there are
 

1541
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,340
have given from them but then there are
these two types of creativity and both

1542
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,350
these two types of creativity and both
 

1543
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,400
these two types of creativity and both
of them are now present in our machines

1544
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,410
of them are now present in our machines
 

1545
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,960
of them are now present in our machines
the first one has been around for a long

1546
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:55,970
the first one has been around for a long
 

1547
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,140
the first one has been around for a long
time which is human gives problem to

1548
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,150
time which is human gives problem to
 

1549
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,560
time which is human gives problem to
machine machine tries to find a solution

1550
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:02,570
machine machine tries to find a solution
 

1551
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,780
machine machine tries to find a solution
to that and this has been happening for

1552
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:04,790
to that and this has been happening for
 

1553
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,490
to that and this has been happening for
many decades and for many decades

1554
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:06,500
many decades and for many decades
 

1555
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,340
many decades and for many decades
machines have found creative solutions

1556
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,350
machines have found creative solutions
 

1557
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,070
machines have found creative solutions
to interesting problems where humans

1558
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,080
to interesting problems where humans
 

1559
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,510
to interesting problems where humans
were not aware of these particularly in

1560
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:16,520
were not aware of these particularly in
 

1561
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,880
were not aware of these particularly in
creative solutions but then appreciated

1562
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:18,890
creative solutions but then appreciated
 

1563
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,150
creative solutions but then appreciated
that the machine found that the second

1564
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,160
that the machine found that the second
 

1565
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,490
that the machine found that the second
is the pure creativity that I would call

1566
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:24,500
is the pure creativity that I would call
 

1567
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,740
is the pure creativity that I would call
what I just mentioned I would call the

1568
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:26,750
what I just mentioned I would call the
 

1569
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,860
what I just mentioned I would call the
applied creativity like applied art

1570
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:29,870
applied creativity like applied art
 

1571
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,470
applied creativity like applied art
where somebody tells you now make a nice

1572
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,480
where somebody tells you now make a nice
 

1573
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,500
where somebody tells you now make a nice
picture off of this Pope and you will

1574
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:35,510
picture off of this Pope and you will
 

1575
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,590
picture off of this Pope and you will
get money for that okay so here is the

1576
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:38,600
get money for that okay so here is the
 

1577
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,080
get money for that okay so here is the
artist and he makes a convincing picture

1578
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,090
artist and he makes a convincing picture
 

1579
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,000
artist and he makes a convincing picture
of the Pope and the Pope likes it and

1580
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,010
of the Pope and the Pope likes it and
 

1581
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,210
of the Pope and the Pope likes it and
gives him the money

1582
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,220
gives him the money
 

1583
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,750
gives him the money
and then there is the pure creative

1584
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:47,760
and then there is the pure creative
 

1585
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,910
and then there is the pure creative
creativity which is more like the power

1586
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:49,920
creativity which is more like the power
 

1587
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,859
creativity which is more like the power
play and the artificial curiosity thing

1588
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:51,869
play and the artificial curiosity thing
 

1589
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:55,069
play and the artificial curiosity thing
where you have the freedom to select

1590
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:55,079
where you have the freedom to select
 

1591
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,280
where you have the freedom to select
your own problem like a scientist who

1592
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,290
your own problem like a scientist who
 

1593
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:03,710
your own problem like a scientist who
defines his own question to study and so

1594
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:03,720
defines his own question to study and so
 

1595
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,550
defines his own question to study and so
that is the pure creativity of UL and

1596
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:07,560
that is the pure creativity of UL and
 

1597
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,599
that is the pure creativity of UL and
opposed to the applied creativity which

1598
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:11,609
opposed to the applied creativity which
 

1599
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:15,230
opposed to the applied creativity which

the prototype so it's compressing all

1760
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:57,360
the prototype so it's compressing all
 

1761
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,180
the prototype so it's compressing all
the time the stuff that frequently

1762
00:43:59,180 --> 00:43:59,190
the time the stuff that frequently
 

1763
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,930
the time the stuff that frequently
appears there's one thing that appears

1764
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:02,940
appears there's one thing that appears
 

1765
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,020

00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,180
all the time that is present all the
time when the agent is interacting with

time when the agent is interacting with
 

1769
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,700
time when the agent is interacting with
its environment which is the agent

you need to better encode the data which
 

1787
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,380
you need to better encode the data which

00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,610
most problems in the real world are deep
in the sense that the current input

1916
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:39,620
in the sense that the current input
 

1917
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,810
in the sense that the current input
doesn't tell you all you need to know

1918
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:41,820
doesn't tell you all you need to know
 

1919
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,120
doesn't tell you all you need to know
about the environment mm-hmm so instead

1920
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,130
about the environment mm-hmm so instead
 

1921
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,830
about the environment mm-hmm so instead
you have to have a memory of what

1922
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:48,840
you have to have a memory of what
 

1923
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,350
you have to have a memory of what
happened in the past and often important

1924
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:51,360
happened in the past and often important
 

1925
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,160
happened in the past and often important
parts of that memory are dated they are

1926
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,170
parts of that memory are dated they are
 

1927
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:58,130
parts of that memory are dated they are
pretty old and so when you're doing

1928
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:58,140
pretty old and so when you're doing
 

1929
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,050
pretty old and so when you're doing
speech recognition for example and

1930
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:00,060
speech recognition for example and
 

1931
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:05,890
speech recognition for example and
somebody says eleven then that's about

1932
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:05,900
somebody says eleven then that's about
 

1933
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,300
somebody says eleven then that's about
half a second or something like that

1934
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:08,310
half a second or something like that
 

1935
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,490
half a second or something like that
which means it's already fifty-eight

1936
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:10,500
which means it's already fifty-eight
 

1937
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,220
which means it's already fifty-eight
time steps and another guy or the same

time steps and another guy or the same
 

1939
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:17,390
time steps and another guy or the same
guy says seven so the ending is the same

1940
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:17,400
guy says seven so the ending is the same
 

1941
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,090

1945
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,070

there wasn't or a nerve eleven or seven
so there you have already a problem of

00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,750
do you think that that kind of thinking

let's just use the model of the world as

and millisecond by millisecond we
 

2157
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:34,010
and millisecond by millisecond we
planned the future and that means we

2158
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:34,020
planned the future and that means we
 

2159
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,200
planned the future and that means we
have to roll it out really in detail and

00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:36,210
have to roll it out really in detail and
 

2161
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,970
have to roll it out really in detail and
it will work only as the model is really

it will work only as the model is really
 

2163
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,309
it will work only as the model is really
good and it will still be inefficient

00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
good and it will still be inefficient
 

2165
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,050
good and it will still be inefficient
because we have to look at all these

of course so these little Audi's they

2250
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:52,849
of course so these little Audi's they
 

2251
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,480
of course so these little Audi's they
are small maybe like that so I'm much

2252
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:55,490
are small maybe like that so I'm much
 

2253
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:58,030
are small maybe like that so I'm much
smaller than the real Howdy's but they

2254
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:58,040
smaller than the real Howdy's but they
 

2255
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,309
smaller than the real Howdy's but they
have all the sensors that you find the

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,500
have all the sensors that you find the
real howdy is you find the cameras that

2263
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:11,530

2264
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:11,540
to and and they are from pain sensors
 

2265
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,020

basically and they don't want to bump

2266
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,030
basically and they don't want to bump
 

2267
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,900
basically and they don't want to bump

against obstacles and other Howdy's and
so they must learn like little babies to

2270
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:20,930
so they must learn like little babies to
 

2271
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:24,549
so they must learn like little babies to

00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,440
a park take the wrong vision input and
translate that into actions that lead to

2971
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:48,760

you said the most interesting sources

01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:51,920

01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:57,670

 

2977
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:02,640

so at least in the long run there seems

2978
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:02,650
so at least in the long run there seems
 

2979
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:06,750
so at least in the long run there seems
to be some sort of protection through

2980
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:06,760
to be some sort of protection through
 

2981
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:12,410
to be some sort of protection through
lack of interest on the other side

2982
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:12,420

 

2983
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:15,239

and now it seems also clear as far as we

2984
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:15,249
and now it seems also clear as far as we
 

2985
01:14:15,249 --> 01:14:18,959
and now it seems also clear as far as we
understand physics you need matter and

2986
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:18,969
understand physics you need matter and
 

2987
01:14:18,969 --> 01:14:21,120

01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:35,969

01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:54,140
niches in ways that we cannot fathom at
the moment but it's going to expand

3012
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:54,150
the moment but it's going to expand
 

3013
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:57,209
the moment but it's going to expand
limited by Lightspeed and physics it's

3014
01:14:57,209 --> 01:14:57,219
limited by Lightspeed and physics it's
 

3015
01:14:57,219 --> 01:15:00,600
limited by Lightspeed and physics it's
going to expand and and now we realize

3016
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:00,610
going to expand and and now we realize
 

3017
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:03,120
going to expand and and now we realize
that the universe is still young it's

3018
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:03,130
that the universe is still young it's
 

3019
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,459
that the universe is still young it's
only 13.8 billion years old

3020
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:05,469
only 13.8 billion years old
 

3021
01:15:05,469 --> 01:15:07,560
only 13.8 billion years old
and it's going to be a thousand times

3022
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:07,570
and it's going to be a thousand times
 

3023
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:12,390
and it's going to be a thousand times
older than that so there's plenty of

3024
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:12,400
older than that so there's plenty of
 

3025
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,370
older than that so there's plenty of
time to conquer the entire universe and

3026
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:16,380
time to conquer the entire universe and
 

3027
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:20,459
time to conquer the entire universe and
to fill it with intelligence and senders

3028
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:20,469
to fill it with intelligence and senders
 

3029
01:15:20,469 --> 01:15:23,310
to fill it with intelligence and senders

of the universe one Eon
 

3039
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:41,370
of the universe one Eon
one Eon now it will take just a few eons

one Eon now it will take just a few eons
 

3041
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,229
one Eon now it will take just a few eons
from now and the entire visible universe

3042
01:15:43,229 --> 01:15:43,239
from now and the entire visible universe
 

3043
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:46,770
from now and the entire visible universe
is going to be full of that stuff and

3044
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:46,780
is going to be full of that stuff and
 

3045
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,169
is going to be full of that stuff and
let's look ahead to a time when the

let's look ahead to a time when the
 

3047
01:15:49,179 --> 01:15:50,790
let's look ahead to a time when the
universe is going to be one thousand

3049
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,370
universe is going to be one thousand
times older than it is now they will

3050
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:53,380
times older than it is now they will
 

3051
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,140
times older than it is now they will
look back and they will say look almost

3052
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:55,150
look back and they will say look almost
 

3053
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,969
look back and they will say look almost
immediately after the Big Bang

3054
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:56,979
immediately after the Big Bang
 

3055
01:15:56,979 --> 01:16:00,089
immediately after the Big Bang
only a few eons later the entire

only a few eons later the entire
 

3057
01:16:00,099 --> 01:16:02,600
only a few eons later the entire
universe started to become intelligent

3058
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:02,610
universe started to become intelligent
 

3059
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:06,450
universe started to become intelligent
now to your question how do we see

3060
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:06,460
now to your question how do we see
 

3061
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:09,209
now to your question how do we see
whether anything like that has already

3062
01:16:09,209 --> 01:16:09,219
whether anything like that has already
 

3063
01:16:09,219 --> 01:16:10,649
whether anything like that has already
happened or is already in a more

01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:10,659
happened or is already in a more
 

3065
01:16:10,659 --> 01:16:13,609

trying to look out there and nothing
 

3071
01:16:18,099 --> 01:16:21,180
trying to look out there and nothing
like that has happened so far or is that

her
 

3075
01:16:21,699 --> 01:16:24,420
her
do you think we'll recognize it or

3076
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:24,430
do you think we'll recognize it or
 

3077
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:25,920
do you think we'll recognize it or
how do we know it's not among us how do

3078
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:25,930
how do we know it's not among us how do
 

3079
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:28,680
how do we know it's not among us how do
we know planets aren't in themselves

3080
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:28,690
we know planets aren't in themselves
 

3081
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:33,800
we know planets aren't in themselves
intelligent beings how do we know ants

3082
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:33,810
intelligent beings how do we know ants
 

3083
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:37,920
intelligent beings how do we know ants
seen as a collective are not much

3084
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:37,930
seen as a collective are not much
 

3085
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,350
seen as a collective are not much
greater intelligence in our own these

3086
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:40,360
greater intelligence in our own these
 

3087
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,290
greater intelligence in our own these
kinds of ideas no but it was a boy I was

3088
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:43,300
kinds of ideas no but it was a boy I was
 

3089
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,540
kinds of ideas no but it was a boy I was
thinking about these things and I

3090
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:45,550
thinking about these things and I
 

3091
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:47,640
thinking about these things and I
thought hmm maybe it has already

3092
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:47,650
thought hmm maybe it has already
 

3093
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:50,490
thought hmm maybe it has already
happened because back then I know I knew

3094
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:50,500
happened because back then I know I knew
 

3095
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,250
happened because back then I know I knew
I learned from popular physics books

3096
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:53,260
I learned from popular physics books
 

3097
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:56,460
I learned from popular physics books
that the structure the large-scale

3098
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:56,470
that the structure the large-scale
 

3099
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,230
that the structure the large-scale
structure of the universe is not

3100
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:58,240
structure of the universe is not
 

3101
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,410
structure of the universe is not
homogeneous and you have these clusters

3102
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:01,420
homogeneous and you have these clusters
 

3103
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:04,410
homogeneous and you have these clusters
of galaxies and then in between there

3104
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:04,420
of galaxies and then in between there
 

3105
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,970
of galaxies and then in between there
are these huge empty spaces and I

3106
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:08,980
are these huge empty spaces and I
 

3107
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:11,820
are these huge empty spaces and I
thought hmm maybe they aren't really

3108
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:11,830
thought hmm maybe they aren't really
 

3109
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:13,650
thought hmm maybe they aren't really
empty it's just that in the middle of

3110
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:13,660
empty it's just that in the middle of
 

3111
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:16,080
empty it's just that in the middle of
that some AI civilization already has

3112
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:16,090
that some AI civilization already has
 

3113
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,650
that some AI civilization already has
expanded and then has covered a bottle

3114
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:19,660
expanded and then has covered a bottle
 

3115
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:22,500
expanded and then has covered a bottle
of a billion light-years diameter and is

3116
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:22,510
of a billion light-years diameter and is
 

3117
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:25,530
of a billion light-years diameter and is
using all the energy of all the stars

3118
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:25,540
using all the energy of all the stars
 

3119
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,200
using all the energy of all the stars
within that bubble for its own

3120
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:27,210
within that bubble for its own
 

3121
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:30,390
within that bubble for its own
unfathomable purposes and so it always

3122
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:30,400
unfathomable purposes and so it always
 

3123
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,840
unfathomable purposes and so it always
happened and we just failed to interpret

3124
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:33,850
happened and we just failed to interpret
 

3125
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:37,730
happened and we just failed to interpret
the signs but then alarmed effect

3126
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:37,740
the signs but then alarmed effect
 

3127
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:40,110
the signs but then alarmed effect
gravity by itself explains the

3128
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:40,120
gravity by itself explains the
 

3129
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,730
gravity by itself explains the
large-scale structure of the universe

3130
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:41,740
large-scale structure of the universe
 

3131
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,620
large-scale structure of the universe
and that this is not a convincing

3132
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:43,630
and that this is not a convincing
 

3133
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:47,450
and that this is not a convincing
explanation and then I thought maybe

3134
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:47,460
explanation and then I thought maybe
 

3135
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:52,680
explanation and then I thought maybe
maybe it's the dark matter because as

3136
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:52,690
maybe it's the dark matter because as
 

3137
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:56,180
maybe it's the dark matter because as
far as we know today 80% of the

3138
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:56,190
far as we know today 80% of the
 

3139
01:17:56,190 --> 01:18:00,470
far as we know today 80% of the
measurable matter is invisible and we

3140
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:00,480
measurable matter is invisible and we
 

3141
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,300
measurable matter is invisible and we
know that because otherwise our galaxy

3142
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:03,310
know that because otherwise our galaxy
 

3143
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:06,060
know that because otherwise our galaxy
or other galaxies would fall apart they

3144
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:06,070
or other galaxies would fall apart they
 

3145
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:10,520
or other galaxies would fall apart they
would they are rotating too quickly and

3146
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:10,530
would they are rotating too quickly and
 

3147
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:14,760
would they are rotating too quickly and
then the idea was maybe all us he is AI

3148
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:14,770
then the idea was maybe all us he is AI
 

3149
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:17,250
then the idea was maybe all us he is AI
civilizations and hourly out there they

3150
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:17,260
civilizations and hourly out there they
 

3151
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:22,770
civilizations and hourly out there they
they just invisible because they are

3152
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:22,780
they just invisible because they are
 

3153
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,390
they just invisible because they are
really efficient in using the energies

3154
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:24,400
really efficient in using the energies
 

3155
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,910
really efficient in using the energies
at their own local systems and that's

3156
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:26,920
at their own local systems and that's
 

3157
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,180
at their own local systems and that's
why they appear dark to us but this is

3158
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:30,190
why they appear dark to us but this is
 

3159
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:31,290
why they appear dark to us but this is
awesome at a convincing explanation

3160
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:31,300
awesome at a convincing explanation
 

3161
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:35,690
awesome at a convincing explanation
because then the question becomes why is

3162
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:35,700
because then the question becomes why is
 

3163
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,300
because then the question becomes why is
there

3164
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:37,310
there
 

3165
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:40,520
there
are there still any visible stars left

3166
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:40,530
are there still any visible stars left
 

3167
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:43,130
are there still any visible stars left
in our own galaxy which also must have a

3168
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:43,140
in our own galaxy which also must have a
 

3169
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,560
in our own galaxy which also must have a
lot of dark matter so that is also not a

3170
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:45,570
lot of dark matter so that is also not a
 

3171
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:50,980
lot of dark matter so that is also not a
convincing thing and today I like to

3172
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:50,990
convincing thing and today I like to
 

3173
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:53,690
convincing thing and today I like to
think it's quite plausible that maybe

3174
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:53,700
think it's quite plausible that maybe
 

3175
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,610
think it's quite plausible that maybe
are the first at least in our local

3176
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:55,620
are the first at least in our local
 

3177
01:18:55,620 --> 01:19:03,170
are the first at least in our local
light cone within a few hundreds of

3178
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:03,180
light cone within a few hundreds of
 

3179
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:05,060
light cone within a few hundreds of
millions of light years that we can

3180
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:05,070
millions of light years that we can
 

3181
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:10,010
millions of light years that we can
reliably observe is there exciting to

3182
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:10,020
reliably observe is there exciting to
 

3183
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:14,270
reliably observe is there exciting to
you it will might be the first and it

3184
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:14,280
you it will might be the first and it
 

3185
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,890
you it will might be the first and it
would make us much more important

3186
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:15,900
would make us much more important
 

3187
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,710
would make us much more important
because if we mess it up through a

3188
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:18,720
because if we mess it up through a
 

3189
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:24,230
because if we mess it up through a
nuclear war then then maybe this will

3190
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:24,240
nuclear war then then maybe this will
 

3191
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,670
nuclear war then then maybe this will
have an effect on the on the on the

3192
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:27,680
have an effect on the on the on the
 

3193
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,310
have an effect on the on the on the
development on of the entire universe so

3194
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:31,320
development on of the entire universe so
 

3195
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,200
development on of the entire universe so
let's not mess it up let's not mess it

3196
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:33,210
let's not mess it up let's not mess it
 

3197
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:35,210
let's not mess it up let's not mess it
up Union thank you so much for talking

3198
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:35,220
up Union thank you so much for talking
 

3199

up Union thank you so much for talking
today I really appreciate it it's my

today I really appreciate it it's my
pleasure
