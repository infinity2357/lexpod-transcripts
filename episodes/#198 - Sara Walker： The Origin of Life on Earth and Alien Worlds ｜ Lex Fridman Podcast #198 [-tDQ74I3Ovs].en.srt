how did life originate on earth what are

108
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
how did life originate on earth what are
 

109
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,389
how did life originate on earth what are
the various hypotheses for how life

110
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
the various hypotheses for how life
 

111
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,190
the various hypotheses for how life
originated on earth yeah so

112
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
originated on earth yeah so
 

113
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,630
originated on earth yeah so
i guess you're asking a historical

114
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
i guess you're asking a historical
 

115
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,469
i guess you're asking a historical
question which is always a good place to

116
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
question which is always a good place to
 

117
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,870
question which is always a good place to
start thinking about life um

118
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
start thinking about life um
 

119
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,109
start thinking about life um
so there's a lot of ideas about how life

120
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
so there's a lot of ideas about how life
 

121
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,110
so there's a lot of ideas about how life
started on earth um probably the most

122
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
started on earth um probably the most
 

123
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,070
started on earth um probably the most
popular is what's called the rna world

124
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
popular is what's called the rna world
 

125
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,589
popular is what's called the rna world
scenario um so this idea is probably the

126
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
scenario um so this idea is probably the
 

127
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,350
scenario um so this idea is probably the
one that you'll see most reported in the

128
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
one that you'll see most reported in the
 

129
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,949
one that you'll see most reported in the
news

130
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
news
 

131
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,190
news
and is based on the idea that there are

132
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
and is based on the idea that there are
 

133
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,390
and is based on the idea that there are

134
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400

135
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,229

molecules in our bodies um that uh relay

136
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
molecules in our bodies um that uh relay
 

137
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,229
molecules in our bodies um that uh relay
genetic information and we know those as

138
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
genetic information and we know those as
 

139
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,470
genetic information and we know those as
dna obviously but there's also sort of

140
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
dna obviously but there's also sort of
 

141
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,750
dna obviously but there's also sort of
an intermediary called rna ribonucleic

142
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
an intermediary called rna ribonucleic
 

143
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,790
an intermediary called rna ribonucleic
acid

144
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
acid
 

145
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,190
acid
that also plays the role of proteins

146
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
that also plays the role of proteins
 

147
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,710
that also plays the role of proteins
and

148
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
and
 

149
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,630
and
people came up with this idea in the 80s

150
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
people came up with this idea in the 80s
 

151
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,550
people came up with this idea in the 80s
that maybe that was the first genetic

152
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
that maybe that was the first genetic
 

153
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,990
that maybe that was the first genetic
material because it could play both

154
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
material because it could play both
 

155
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,190
material because it could play both
roles of being genetic and performing

156
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
roles of being genetic and performing
 

157
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,150
roles of being genetic and performing
catalysis and then somehow that idea got

158
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
catalysis and then somehow that idea got
 

159
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,790
catalysis and then somehow that idea got
reduced to this idea that there was a

160
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
reduced to this idea that there was a
 

161
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,430
reduced to this idea that there was a
molecule that emerged on early earth and

162
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
molecule that emerged on early earth and
 

163
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,750
molecule that emerged on early earth and
underwent darwinian evolution and that

164
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
underwent darwinian evolution and that
 

165
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,190
underwent darwinian evolution and that
was the start of life

166
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
was the start of life
 

167
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,270
was the start of life
so there's a lot of assumptions

168
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
so there's a lot of assumptions
 

169
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,390
so there's a lot of assumptions
packed in there that we could unpack but

170
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
packed in there that we could unpack but
 

171
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,149
packed in there that we could unpack but
that's sort of the leading hypothesis

172
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
that's sort of the leading hypothesis
 

173
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,670
that's sort of the leading hypothesis
there's also other ideas about life

174
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
there's also other ideas about life
 

175
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,910
there's also other ideas about life
starting as metabolism and so that's

176
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
starting as metabolism and so that's
 

177
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,750
starting as metabolism and so that's
more connected to the geochemistry of

178
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
more connected to the geochemistry of
 

179
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,350
more connected to the geochemistry of
early earth

180
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
early earth
 

181
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,949
early earth
and it would be kind of more focused on

182
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
and it would be kind of more focused on
 

183
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,630
and it would be kind of more focused on
this idea that you get some kind of

184
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
this idea that you get some kind of
 

185
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,869
this idea that you get some kind of
catalytic cycle of molecules that can

186
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
catalytic cycle of molecules that can
 

187
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,550
catalytic cycle of molecules that can
reproduce themselves and form some kind

188
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
reproduce themselves and form some kind
 

189
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,789
reproduce themselves and form some kind
of metabolism and then life starts

190
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
of metabolism and then life starts
 

191
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,470
of metabolism and then life starts
basically as self-organization and then

192
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
basically as self-organization and then
 

193
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,910
basically as self-organization and then
you have to explain how evolution comes

194
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
you have to explain how evolution comes
 

195
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,190
you have to explain how evolution comes
later

196
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
later
 

197
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,030
later
right so that's the difference between

198
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
right so that's the difference between
 

199
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,670
right so that's the difference between
sort of uh energy and genetic code so

200
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
sort of uh energy and genetic code so
 

201
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,670
sort of uh energy and genetic code so
like energy and information are those

202
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
like energy and information are those
 

203
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,589
like energy and information are those
are the two kind of yeah

204
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
are the two kind of yeah
 

205
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,550
are the two kind of yeah
yeah i think that's a good way of

206
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
yeah i think that's a good way of
 

207
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,630
yeah i think that's a good way of
putting that it's um

208
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
putting that it's um
 

209
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,990
putting that it's um
it's kind of funny because i think most

210
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
it's kind of funny because i think most
 

211
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,869
it's kind of funny because i think most
of the people that think about these

212
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
of the people that think about these
 

213
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,789
of the people that think about these
things are really disciplinary bias so

214
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
things are really disciplinary bias so
 

215
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,830
things are really disciplinary bias so
the people that tend to think about

216
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
the people that tend to think about
 

217
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,670
the people that tend to think about
genetics come from a biology background

218
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
genetics come from a biology background
 

219
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,830
genetics come from a biology background
and they're really evolution focused and

220
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
and they're really evolution focused and
 

221
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,190
and they're really evolution focused and
so they're worried about where does the

222
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
so they're worried about where does the
 

223
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,949
so they're worried about where does the
information come from and how does it

224
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
information come from and how does it
 

225
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,149
information come from and how does it
change over time but they're talking

226
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
change over time but they're talking
 

227
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,750
change over time but they're talking
about information in a really narrow way

228
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
about information in a really narrow way
 

229
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,030
about information in a really narrow way
where they're talking about a genetic

230
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
where they're talking about a genetic
 

231
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,110
where they're talking about a genetic
sequence and then most of people that

232
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
sequence and then most of people that
 

233
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,869
sequence and then most of people that
think about

234
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
think about
 

235
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,350
think about
metabolism origins of life scenarios

236
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
metabolism origins of life scenarios
 

237
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,949
metabolism origins of life scenarios
tend to be people like physicists or

238
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
tend to be people like physicists or
 

239
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,550
tend to be people like physicists or
geochemists that are worried about what

240
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
geochemists that are worried about what
 

241
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,390
geochemists that are worried about what
are the energy sources and what you know

242
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
are the energy sources and what you know
 

243
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,990
are the energy sources and what you know
like what kinds of organization can you

244
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
like what kinds of organization can you
 

245
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,550
like what kinds of organization can you
get out of those energy sources okay so

246
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
get out of those energy sources okay so
 

247
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,150
get out of those energy sources okay so
which one is your favorite i don't like

248
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
which one is your favorite i don't like
 

249
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,349
which one is your favorite i don't like
either

250
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
either
 

251
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,110
either
okay all right can we talk about them

252
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
okay all right can we talk about them
 

253
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,030
okay all right can we talk about them
for a little bit longer though

254
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040

 

255
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,909

uh so okay so there's uh early earth

256
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
uh so okay so there's uh early earth
 

257
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,990
uh so okay so there's uh early earth
what was that like was there just mostly

258
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
what was that like was there just mostly
 

259
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,790
what was that like was there just mostly
covered by oceans was there heat sources

260
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
covered by oceans was there heat sources
 

261
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,629
covered by oceans was there heat sources
energy sources so if we

262
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
energy sources so if we
 

263
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,350
energy sources so if we
uh talk about the metabolism view of the

264
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
uh talk about the metabolism view of the
 

265
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,430
uh talk about the metabolism view of the
origin of life like where was the source

266
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
origin of life like where was the source
 

267
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,590
origin of life like where was the source
of energy probably the most popular view

268
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
of energy probably the most popular view
 

269
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,670
of energy probably the most popular view
for where the original life happened on

270
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
for where the original life happened on
 

271
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,990
for where the original life happened on
earth is hydrothermal vents because they

272
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
earth is hydrothermal vents because they
 

273
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,670
earth is hydrothermal vents because they
had sufficient energy

274
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
had sufficient energy
 

275
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,710
had sufficient energy
and so we don't really know a lot about

276
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
and so we don't really know a lot about
 

277
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,150
and so we don't really know a lot about
early earth

278
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
early earth
 

279
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,550
early earth
we have you know some ideas about when

280
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
we have you know some ideas about when
 

281
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,909
we have you know some ideas about when
oceans first formed and things like that

282
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
oceans first formed and things like that
 

283
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,510
oceans first formed and things like that
but the time of the original life is

284
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
but the time of the original life is
 

285
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,469
but the time of the original life is
kind of

286
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
kind of
 

287
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,950
kind of
um not well understood or pinned down

288
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
um not well understood or pinned down
 

289
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,469
um not well understood or pinned down
and the conditions on earth at that time

290
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
and the conditions on earth at that time
 

291
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,070
and the conditions on earth at that time
are not well known

292
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
are not well known
 

293
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,749
are not well known
but a lot of people do think that there

294
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
but a lot of people do think that there
 

295
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,830
but a lot of people do think that there
was probably hydrothermal vents which

296
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
was probably hydrothermal vents which
 

297
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,469
was probably hydrothermal vents which
are really hot

298
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
are really hot
 

299
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,550
are really hot
chemically active regions say on the sea

300
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
chemically active regions say on the sea
 

301
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,110
chemically active regions say on the sea
floor in modern times which also would

302
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
floor in modern times which also would
 

303
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,029
floor in modern times which also would
have been present on early earth and

304
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
have been present on early earth and
 

305
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,790
have been present on early earth and
they would have provided energy and

306
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
they would have provided energy and
 

307
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,070
they would have provided energy and
organics

308
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
organics
 

309
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,430
organics
and basically all of the right

310
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
and basically all of the right
 

311
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,430
and basically all of the right
conditions for

312
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
conditions for
 

313
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,790
conditions for
the origins of life which is one of the

314
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
the origins of life which is one of the
 

315
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,670
the origins of life which is one of the
reasons that we look for these

316
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
reasons that we look for these
 

317
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,110
reasons that we look for these
hydrothermal systems when we're talking

318
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
hydrothermal systems when we're talking
 

319
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,189
hydrothermal systems when we're talking
about life elsewhere too

320
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
about life elsewhere too
 

321
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,909
about life elsewhere too
okay and for the genetic code

322
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
okay and for the genetic code
 

323
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,070
okay and for the genetic code
the idea is that the rna is the first

324
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
the idea is that the rna is the first
 

325
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,310
the idea is that the rna is the first
like why would rna

326
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
like why would rna
 

327
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,550
like why would rna
be the first moment you can say it's

328
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
be the first moment you can say it's
 

329
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,510
be the first moment you can say it's
life

330
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
life
 

331
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,390
life
i guess the idea is it could both

332
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
i guess the idea is it could both
 

333
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,870
i guess the idea is it could both
have persistent information

334
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
have persistent information
 

335
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,029
have persistent information
and then it can also do some of the work

336
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
and then it can also do some of the work
 

337
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,830
and then it can also do some of the work
of like what creating a self-sustaining

338
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
of like what creating a self-sustaining
 

339
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,029
of like what creating a self-sustaining
organism

340
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
organism
 

341
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,909
organism
yeah that's the basic idea so the idea

342
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
yeah that's the basic idea so the idea
 

343
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,710
yeah that's the basic idea so the idea
is you have in an rna molecule you have

344
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
is you have in an rna molecule you have
 

345
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,469
is you have in an rna molecule you have
a sequence of characters say so you can

346
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
a sequence of characters say so you can
 

347
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,710
a sequence of characters say so you can
treat it like a string in a computer

348
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
treat it like a string in a computer
 

349
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,029
treat it like a string in a computer
and it can be copied so information can

350
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
and it can be copied so information can
 

351
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,629
and it can be copied so information can
be propagated

352
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
be propagated
 

353
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,469
be propagated
which is important for

354
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
which is important for
 

355
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,510
which is important for
evolution because evolution happens by

356
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
evolution because evolution happens by
 

357
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,749
evolution because evolution happens by
having inheritance of information so for

358
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
having inheritance of information so for
 

359
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,510
having inheritance of information so for
example you know like my eyes are brown

360
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
example you know like my eyes are brown
 

361
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,749
example you know like my eyes are brown
because my mother's eyes were brown

362
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
because my mother's eyes were brown
 

363
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,070
because my mother's eyes were brown
so you need that copying of information

364
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
so you need that copying of information
 

365
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,150
so you need that copying of information
but then

366
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
but then
 

367
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,110
but then
you

368
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
you
 

369
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,110
you
also have the ability to perform

370
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
also have the ability to perform
 

371
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,350
also have the ability to perform
catalysis which means that that rna

372
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
catalysis which means that that rna
 

373
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,430
catalysis which means that that rna
molecule is not inert in that

374
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
molecule is not inert in that
 

375
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,350
molecule is not inert in that
environment but it actually interacts

376
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
environment but it actually interacts
 

377
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,710
environment but it actually interacts
with something that could potentially

378
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
with something that could potentially
 

379
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,909
with something that could potentially
mediate say a metabolism that could then

380
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
mediate say a metabolism that could then
 

381
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,870
mediate say a metabolism that could then
fuel

382
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
fuel
 

383
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,350
fuel
the actual reproduction of that molecule

384
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
the actual reproduction of that molecule
 

385
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,230
the actual reproduction of that molecule
so

386
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
so
 

387
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,670
so
in some ways

388
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
in some ways
 

389
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,790
in some ways
people think that rna gives you

390
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
people think that rna gives you
 

391
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,990
people think that rna gives you
you know

392
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
you know
 

393
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,670
you know
the most bang for your buck in a single

394
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
the most bang for your buck in a single
 

395
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,990
the most bang for your buck in a single
molecule and therefore

396
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
molecule and therefore
 

397
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,110
molecule and therefore
you know it gives you all the features

398
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
you know it gives you all the features
 

399
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,749
you know it gives you all the features
that you might think are life um

400
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
that you might think are life um
 

401
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,189
that you might think are life um
and so that this is sort of where this

402
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
and so that this is sort of where this
 

403
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,790
and so that this is sort of where this
rna world conjecture came from is

404
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
rna world conjecture came from is
 

405
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,469
rna world conjecture came from is
because of those two properties

406
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
because of those two properties
 

407
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,230
because of those two properties
isn't it amazing that rna came to be

408
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
isn't it amazing that rna came to be
 

409
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,029
isn't it amazing that rna came to be
in general isn't it yes that is amazing

410
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
in general isn't it yes that is amazing
 

411
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,589
in general isn't it yes that is amazing
okay so we're not talking down about rna

412
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
okay so we're not talking down about rna
 

413
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,350
okay so we're not talking down about rna
no no i love rna it's one of my favorite

414
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
no no i love rna it's one of my favorite
 

415
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,270
no no i love rna it's one of my favorite
molecules i think it's beautiful it's

416
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
molecules i think it's beautiful it's
 

417
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,790
molecules i think it's beautiful it's
just not step one

418
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
just not step one
 

419
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,189
just not step one
yeah i think i think the issue it's not

420
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
yeah i think i think the issue it's not
 

421
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,029
yeah i think i think the issue it's not
even the rna world is a problem and

422
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
even the rna world is a problem and
 

423
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,710
even the rna world is a problem and
actually if you really um dig into it

424
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
actually if you really um dig into it
 

425
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,430
actually if you really um dig into it
the rna world is not one hypothesis it

426
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
the rna world is not one hypothesis it
 

427
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,189
the rna world is not one hypothesis it
is a set of hypothesis

428
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
is a set of hypothesis
 

429
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,909
is a set of hypothesis
hypotheses sorry and they range from

430
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
hypotheses sorry and they range from
 

431
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,710
hypotheses sorry and they range from
a

432
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
a
 

433
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,430
a
molecule of rna spontaneously emerged on

434
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
molecule of rna spontaneously emerged on
 

435
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,589
molecule of rna spontaneously emerged on
the early earth and started evolving

436
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
the early earth and started evolving
 

437
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,110
the early earth and started evolving
which is kind of like the hardest rna

438
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
which is kind of like the hardest rna
 

439
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,710
which is kind of like the hardest rna
world scenario which is the one i cited

440
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
world scenario which is the one i cited
 

441
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,270
world scenario which is the one i cited
and i get a little um

442
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
and i get a little um
 

443
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,670
and i get a little um
uh animated about because it seems so

444
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
uh animated about because it seems so
 

445
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,990
uh animated about because it seems so
blatantly wrong to me but that's a

446
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
blatantly wrong to me but that's a
 

447
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,430
blatantly wrong to me but that's a
separate story and then the other one is

448
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
separate story and then the other one is
 

449
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,909
separate story and then the other one is
actually something i agree with which is

450
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
actually something i agree with which is
 

451
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,790
actually something i agree with which is
that

452
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
that
 

453
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,390
that
you can say there was an rna world

454
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
you can say there was an rna world
 

455
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,550
you can say there was an rna world
because rna was the first genetic

456
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
because rna was the first genetic
 

457
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,950
because rna was the first genetic
material for life on earth so an rna

458
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
material for life on earth so an rna
 

459
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,950
material for life on earth so an rna
world could just be

460
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
world could just be
 

461
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,830
world could just be
the earliest organisms that had

462
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
the earliest organisms that had
 

463
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,909
the earliest organisms that had
genetics in a modern sense didn't have

464
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
genetics in a modern sense didn't have
 

465
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,710
genetics in a modern sense didn't have
dna evolved yet they had rna

466
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
dna evolved yet they had rna
 

467
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,710
dna evolved yet they had rna
right and so that's sort of a softer rna

468
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
right and so that's sort of a softer rna
 

469
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,710
right and so that's sort of a softer rna
world scenario in the sense that it

470
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
world scenario in the sense that it
 

471
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,070
world scenario in the sense that it
doesn't mean it was the first thing that

472
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
doesn't mean it was the first thing that
 

473
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,110
doesn't mean it was the first thing that
happened

474
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
happened
 

475
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,749
happened
but it was a thing that definitely

476
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
but it was a thing that definitely
 

477
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,589
but it was a thing that definitely
was part of the lineage of events that

478
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
was part of the lineage of events that
 

479
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,710
was part of the lineage of events that
led to us

480
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
led to us
 

481
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,710
led to us
so if life was a

482
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
so if life was a
 

483
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,110
so if life was a
like a best of album it would be on the

484
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
like a best of album it would be on the
 

485
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,029
like a best of album it would be on the
maybe one of the songs on there yes one

486
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
maybe one of the songs on there yes one
 

487
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,950
maybe one of the songs on there yes one
of the early songs okay it's on the

488
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
of the early songs okay it's on the
 

489
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,790
of the early songs okay it's on the
greatest hits greatest hits that's the

490
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
greatest hits greatest hits that's the
 

491
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,670
greatest hits greatest hits that's the
word i was looking for okay did life do

492
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
word i was looking for okay did life do
 

493
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,990
word i was looking for okay did life do
you think originate once

494
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
you think originate once
 

495
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,230
you think originate once
twice three times on earth multiple

496
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
twice three times on earth multiple
 

497
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,230
twice three times on earth multiple
times what do you think i think that's a

498
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
times what do you think i think that's a
 

499
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,630
times what do you think i think that's a
really difficult question um and an

500
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
really difficult question um and an
 

501
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,909
really difficult question um and an
important question it's a super

502
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
important question it's a super
 

503
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,589
important question it's a super
important question no that no it's a

504
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
important question no that no it's a
 

505
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,750
important question no that no it's a
really important question um and so

506
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
really important question um and so
 

507
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,469
really important question um and so
there there's some so there's

508
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
there there's some so there's
 

509
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,230
there there's some so there's
there's a lot of questions in that

510
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
there's a lot of questions in that
 

511
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,630
there's a lot of questions in that
question um so one of the first ones

512
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
question um so one of the first ones
 

513
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,110
question um so one of the first ones
that i think needs to be addressed is is

514
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
that i think needs to be addressed is is
 

515
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,870
that i think needs to be addressed is is
the original life a continuous process

516
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
the original life a continuous process
 

517
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,710
the original life a continuous process
on our planet so

518
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
on our planet so
 

519
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,070
on our planet so
we think about the original life is

520
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
we think about the original life is
 

521
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,710
we think about the original life is
something that happened on earth um say

522
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
something that happened on earth um say
 

523
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,470
something that happened on earth um say
almost four billion years ago because we

524
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
almost four billion years ago because we
 

525
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,230
almost four billion years ago because we
have evidence of life emerging very

526
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
have evidence of life emerging very
 

527
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,829
have evidence of life emerging very
early on our planet

528
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
early on our planet
 

529
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,630
early on our planet
um

530
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
um
 

531
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,430
um
and then an original life event quote

532
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
and then an original life event quote
 

533
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,350
and then an original life event quote
unquote a singular event whatever that

534
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
unquote a singular event whatever that
 

535
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,150
unquote a singular event whatever that
was happened and then all life on earth

536
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
was happened and then all life on earth
 

537
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,430
was happened and then all life on earth
that we know

538
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
that we know
 

539
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,670
that we know
is a descendant of that particular event

540
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
is a descendant of that particular event
 

541
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,829
is a descendant of that particular event
in our universe right and so

542
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
in our universe right and so
 

543
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,190
in our universe right and so
um but

544
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
um but
 

545
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,070
um but
uh we don't have um

546
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
uh we don't have um
 

547
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,150
uh we don't have um
any idea one way or the other if the

548
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
any idea one way or the other if the
 

549
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,870
any idea one way or the other if the
original life is happening repeatedly

550
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
original life is happening repeatedly
 

551
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,150
original life is happening repeatedly
and maybe it's just not taking off

552
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
and maybe it's just not taking off
 

553
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,509
and maybe it's just not taking off
because life is already established

554
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
because life is already established
 

555
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,509
because life is already established
that's a argument that people will make

556
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
that's a argument that people will make
 

557
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,710
that's a argument that people will make
or

558
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
or
 

559
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,550
or
maybe there are alternative forms of

560
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
maybe there are alternative forms of
 

561
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,590
maybe there are alternative forms of
life on earth that we don't even

562
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
life on earth that we don't even
 

563
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,790
life on earth that we don't even
recognize

564
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
recognize
 

565
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,230
recognize
um so this is the idea of a shadow

566
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
um so this is the idea of a shadow
 

567
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,590
um so this is the idea of a shadow
biosphere that there actually might just

568
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
biosphere that there actually might just
 

569
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,509
biosphere that there actually might just
be completely other life on earth but

570
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
be completely other life on earth but
 

571
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,750
be completely other life on earth but
it's so alien that we don't even know

572
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
it's so alien that we don't even know
 

573
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,790
it's so alien that we don't even know
what it is

574
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
what it is
 

575
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,389
what it is
i'm gonna have to talk to you about the

576
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
i'm gonna have to talk to you about the
 

577
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,310
i'm gonna have to talk to you about the
shadow biosphere

578
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
shadow biosphere
 

579
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,150
shadow biosphere
in a second but first let me ask for the

580
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
in a second but first let me ask for the
 

581
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,350
in a second but first let me ask for the
other alternative which is panspermia

582
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
other alternative which is panspermia
 

583
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,070
other alternative which is panspermia
right so that's the idea the hypothesis

584
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
right so that's the idea the hypothesis
 

585
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,750
right so that's the idea the hypothesis
that life exists elsewhere in the

586
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
that life exists elsewhere in the
 

587
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,750
that life exists elsewhere in the
universe and got to us through like an

588
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
universe and got to us through like an
 

589
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,870
universe and got to us through like an
asteroid

590
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
asteroid
 

591
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,710
asteroid
or a planetoid or some

592
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
or a planetoid or some
 

593
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,550
or a planetoid or some
uh according to wikipedia space dust

594
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
uh according to wikipedia space dust
 

595
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,949
uh according to wikipedia space dust
whatever the heck that is

596
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
whatever the heck that is
 

597
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,790
whatever the heck that is
uh it sounds fun but basically rode

598
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
uh it sounds fun but basically rode
 

599
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,750
uh it sounds fun but basically rode
along

600
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
along
 

601
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,430
along
yeah whatever

602
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
yeah whatever
 

603
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,829
yeah whatever
kind of rock and got to us

604
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
kind of rock and got to us
 

605
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,949
kind of rock and got to us
do you think that's at all a possibility

606
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
do you think that's at all a possibility
 

607
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,430
do you think that's at all a possibility
sure so i think the reason that most

608
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
sure so i think the reason that most
 

609
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,509
sure so i think the reason that most
original life scientists are interested

610
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
original life scientists are interested
 

611
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,030
original life scientists are interested
in the origin of life on earth and say

612
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
in the origin of life on earth and say
 

613
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,790
in the origin of life on earth and say
not the original life

614
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
not the original life
 

615
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,910
not the original life
um

616
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
um
 

617
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,710
um
you know on mars and then panspermia you

618
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
you know on mars and then panspermia you
 

619
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,990
you know on mars and then panspermia you
know the exchange of life between

620
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
know the exchange of life between
 

621
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,069
know the exchange of life between
planets being the explanation is once

622
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
planets being the explanation is once
 

623
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,430
planets being the explanation is once
you start removing the original life

624
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
you start removing the original life
 

625
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,750
you start removing the original life
from earth you know even less about it

626
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
from earth you know even less about it
 

627
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,990
from earth you know even less about it
than you do if you study it on earth

628
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
than you do if you study it on earth
 

629
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,670
than you do if you study it on earth
although i think there are ways of

630
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
although i think there are ways of
 

631
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,190
although i think there are ways of
reformulating the problem this is why i

632
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
reformulating the problem this is why i
 

633
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,870
reformulating the problem this is why i
said earlier like oh you mean the

634
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
said earlier like oh you mean the
 

635
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,470
said earlier like oh you mean the
historical original life problem you

636
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
historical original life problem you
 

637
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,550
historical original life problem you
don't mean the problem of how does life

638
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
don't mean the problem of how does life
 

639
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,150
don't mean the problem of how does life
arise in the universe and what the

640
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
arise in the universe and what the
 

641
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,670
arise in the universe and what the
universal principles are because there's

642
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
universal principles are because there's
 

643
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,269
universal principles are because there's
this historic problem how did it happen

644
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
this historic problem how did it happen
 

645
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,430
this historic problem how did it happen
on early earth and there's a more

646
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
on early earth and there's a more
 

647
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,590
on early earth and there's a more
tractable general problem of how does it

648
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
tractable general problem of how does it
 

649
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,110
tractable general problem of how does it
happen

650
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
happen
 

651
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,550
happen
and how does it happen is something we

652
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
and how does it happen is something we
 

653
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,310
and how does it happen is something we
can actually ask in the lab how does it

654
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
can actually ask in the lab how does it
 

655
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,389
can actually ask in the lab how does it
how did it how did it happen on early

656
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
how did it how did it happen on early
 

657
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,910
how did it how did it happen on early
earth is

658
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
earth is
 

659
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,829
earth is
a much more detailed and nuanced

660
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
a much more detailed and nuanced
 

661
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,670
a much more detailed and nuanced
question and requires detailed knowledge

662
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
question and requires detailed knowledge
 

663
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,949
question and requires detailed knowledge
of what was happening on early earth

664
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
of what was happening on early earth
 

665
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,870
of what was happening on early earth
that we don't have

666
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
that we don't have
 

667
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,470
that we don't have
and i'm personally more interested in

668
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
and i'm personally more interested in
 

669
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,990
and i'm personally more interested in
general mechanisms so to me it doesn't

670
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
general mechanisms so to me it doesn't
 

671
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,269
general mechanisms so to me it doesn't
matter if it happened on earth or it

672
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
matter if it happened on earth or it
 

673
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,110
matter if it happened on earth or it
happened on mars

674
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
happened on mars
 

675
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,870
happened on mars
it just matters that it happened we have

676
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
it just matters that it happened we have
 

677
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,389
it just matters that it happened we have
evidence that happened

678
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
evidence that happened
 

679
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,750
evidence that happened
the question is did it happen more than

680
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
the question is did it happen more than
 

681
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,790
the question is did it happen more than
once in our universe and so the reason i

682
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
once in our universe and so the reason i
 

683
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,069
once in our universe and so the reason i
don't find panspermia as a particularly

684
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
don't find panspermia as a particularly
 

685
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,630
don't find panspermia as a particularly
i think it's a fascinating um hypothesis

686
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
i think it's a fascinating um hypothesis
 

687
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,509
i think it's a fascinating um hypothesis
i definitely think it's possible um and

688
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
i definitely think it's possible um and
 

689
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,310
i definitely think it's possible um and
um

690
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
um
 

691
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,350
um
and i in particular i think it's

692
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
and i in particular i think it's
 

693
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,710
and i in particular i think it's
possible once you get to the stage of a

694
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
possible once you get to the stage of a
 

695
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,310
possible once you get to the stage of a
life where you have technology because

696
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
life where you have technology because
 

697
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,470
life where you have technology because
then you you obviously can spread out

698
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
then you you obviously can spread out
 

699
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,630
then you you obviously can spread out
into the cosmos um but it's also

700
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
into the cosmos um but it's also
 

701
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,110
into the cosmos um but it's also
possible for microbes because we know

702
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
possible for microbes because we know
 

703
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,509
possible for microbes because we know
that um certain microorganisms can

704
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
that um certain microorganisms can
 

705
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,150
that um certain microorganisms can
survive the journey in space and we you

706
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
survive the journey in space and we you
 

707
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,910
survive the journey in space and we you
know they can live in a rock and go

708
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
know they can live in a rock and go
 

709
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,269
know they can live in a rock and go
between mars and earth like people have

710
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
between mars and earth like people have
 

711
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,629
between mars and earth like people have
done experiments to try to prove that

712
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
done experiments to try to prove that
 

713
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,389
done experiments to try to prove that
could work um so in that scenario it's

714
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
could work um so in that scenario it's
 

715
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,350
could work um so in that scenario it's
super cool because then you get

716
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
super cool because then you get
 

717
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,350
super cool because then you get
planetary exchange but say we go find we

718
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
planetary exchange but say we go find we
 

719
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,949
planetary exchange but say we go find we
go look for life on mars and it ends up

720
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
go look for life on mars and it ends up
 

721
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,389
go look for life on mars and it ends up
being exactly the same life we have on

722
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
being exactly the same life we have on
 

723
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,470
being exactly the same life we have on
earth biochemically speaking then we

724
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
earth biochemically speaking then we
 

725
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,670
earth biochemically speaking then we
haven't really discovered something new

726
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
haven't really discovered something new
 

727
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,670
haven't really discovered something new
about the universe what kind of aliens

728
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
about the universe what kind of aliens
 

729
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,590
about the universe what kind of aliens
are possible were there other original

730
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
are possible were there other original
 

731
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,069
are possible were there other original
life events if we find if all the life

732
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
life events if we find if all the life
 

733
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,910
life events if we find if all the life
we ever find is the same original life

734
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
we ever find is the same original life
 

735
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,350
we ever find is the same original life
event in the universe it doesn't help me

736
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
event in the universe it doesn't help me
 

737
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,069
event in the universe it doesn't help me
solve my problem but it's possible that

738
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079
solve my problem but it's possible that
 

739
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,910
solve my problem but it's possible that
that would be a sign that you could

740
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
that would be a sign that you could
 

741
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,509
that would be a sign that you could
separate the environment from the

742
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
separate the environment from the
 

743
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,910
separate the environment from the
basic ingredients yes so that's true you

744
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
basic ingredients yes so that's true you
 

745
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,750
basic ingredients yes so that's true you
can have like a life gun

746
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
can have like a life gun
 

747
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,069
can have like a life gun
that you shoot throughout the universe

748
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
that you shoot throughout the universe
 

749
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,430
that you shoot throughout the universe
and then uh

750
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
and then uh
 

751
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,430
and then uh
like once you shoot it it's like the

752
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
like once you shoot it it's like the
 

753
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,110
like once you shoot it it's like the
simpsons with a makeup gun that was a

754
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
simpsons with a makeup gun that was a
 

755
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,670
simpsons with a makeup gun that was a
great episode uh when you shoot this

756
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
great episode uh when you shoot this
 

757
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,949
great episode uh when you shoot this
life gun

758
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
life gun
 

759
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,190
life gun
it'll he'll find the earth's it'll like

760
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
it'll he'll find the earth's it'll like
 

761
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,069
it'll he'll find the earth's it'll like
get sticky it'll stick to the earth's

762
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
get sticky it'll stick to the earth's
 

763
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,030
get sticky it'll stick to the earth's
and that kind of reduces the barrier of

764
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
and that kind of reduces the barrier of
 

765
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,069
and that kind of reduces the barrier of
uh

766
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
uh
 

767
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,629
uh
like the time it takes the the luck it

768
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
like the time it takes the the luck it
 

769
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,110
like the time it takes the the luck it
takes to actually from nothing from the

770
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
takes to actually from nothing from the
 

771
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,430
takes to actually from nothing from the
basic chemistry from the basic physics

772
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
basic chemistry from the basic physics
 

773
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,470
basic chemistry from the basic physics
the universe for the life to spring up

774
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
the universe for the life to spring up
 

775
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,310
the universe for the life to spring up
yeah i think this is actually super

776
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
yeah i think this is actually super
 

777
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,110
yeah i think this is actually super
important to just think about like does

778
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
important to just think about like does
 

779
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,069
important to just think about like does
life

780
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
life
 

781
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,710
life
getting seated on a planet have to be

782
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
getting seated on a planet have to be
 

783
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,230
getting seated on a planet have to be
geochemically compatible with that

784
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
geochemically compatible with that
 

785
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,910
geochemically compatible with that
planet so you're suggesting like we

786
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
planet so you're suggesting like we
 

787
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,990
planet so you're suggesting like we
could just shoot guns in space and like

788
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
could just shoot guns in space and like
 

789
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,430
could just shoot guns in space and like
life could go to mars and then it would

790
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
life could go to mars and then it would
 

791
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,310
life could go to mars and then it would
just live there and be happy there um

792
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
just live there and be happy there um
 

793
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,389
just live there and be happy there um
but that's actually an open question so

794
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
but that's actually an open question so
 

795
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,509
but that's actually an open question so
one of the things i was going to say in

796
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
one of the things i was going to say in
 

797
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,590
one of the things i was going to say in
response to your question about

798
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
response to your question about
 

799
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,030
response to your question about
whether the original life happened once

800
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
whether the original life happened once
 

801
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,350
whether the original life happened once
or multiple times is for me personally

802
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
or multiple times is for me personally
 

803
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,790
or multiple times is for me personally
right now in my thinking although this

804
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
right now in my thinking although this
 

805
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,430
right now in my thinking although this
changes on a weekly basis but um is that

806
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
changes on a weekly basis but um is that
 

807
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,870
changes on a weekly basis but um is that
i think of life more as a planetary

808
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
i think of life more as a planetary
 

809
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,710
i think of life more as a planetary
phenomena so i think the original life

810
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
phenomena so i think the original life
 

811
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,110
phenomena so i think the original life
because um because life is so

812
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
because um because life is so
 

813
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,269
because um because life is so
um intimately tied to planetary cycles

814
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
um intimately tied to planetary cycles
 

815
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,350
um intimately tied to planetary cycles
and planetary processes and this goes

816
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
and planetary processes and this goes
 

817
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,550
and planetary processes and this goes
all the way back through the history of

818
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
all the way back through the history of
 

819
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,870
all the way back through the history of
our planet that the original life itself

820
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
our planet that the original life itself
 

821
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,550
our planet that the original life itself
grew out of geochemistry and became

822
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
grew out of geochemistry and became
 

823
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,470
grew out of geochemistry and became
coupled and controlled geochemistry and

824
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
coupled and controlled geochemistry and
 

825
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,069
coupled and controlled geochemistry and
and when we start to talk about life

826
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
and when we start to talk about life
 

827
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,829
and when we start to talk about life
existing on the planet is when we have

828
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
existing on the planet is when we have
 

829
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,269
existing on the planet is when we have
evidence of life

830
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
evidence of life
 

831
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,509
evidence of life
actually influencing properties of the

832
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
actually influencing properties of the
 

833
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,150
actually influencing properties of the
planet um and so

834
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
planet um and so
 

835
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,189
planet um and so
so if life is a planetary property um

836
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
so if life is a planetary property um
 

837
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,350
so if life is a planetary property um
then going to mars is not a trivial

838
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
then going to mars is not a trivial
 

839
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,790
then going to mars is not a trivial
thing because you basically have to make

840
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
thing because you basically have to make
 

841
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,590
thing because you basically have to make
ours

842
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
ours
 

843
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,710
ours
mars more earth-like um and so in some

844
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
mars more earth-like um and so in some
 

845
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,550
mars more earth-like um and so in some
sense um like when i think about sort of

846
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560
sense um like when i think about sort of
 

847
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,550
sense um like when i think about sort of
long-term vision of humans in space for

848
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:10,560
long-term vision of humans in space for
 

849
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,670
long-term vision of humans in space for
example

850
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
example
 

851
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,110
example
really what you're talking about when

852
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120
really what you're talking about when
 

853
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,269
really what you're talking about when
you're saying let's send our

854
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
you're saying let's send our
 

855
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,030
you're saying let's send our
civilization to mars is you're not

856
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
civilization to mars is you're not
 

857
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,389
civilization to mars is you're not
saying let's send our civilization to

858
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
saying let's send our civilization to
 

859
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,629
saying let's send our civilization to
mars you're saying let's reproduce our

860
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
mars you're saying let's reproduce our
 

861
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,710
mars you're saying let's reproduce our
planet on mars like the information from

862
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
planet on mars like the information from
 

863
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,230
planet on mars like the information from
our planet actually has to go to mars

864
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
our planet actually has to go to mars
 

865
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,230
our planet actually has to go to mars
and make mars more earth-like which

866
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
and make mars more earth-like which
 

867
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,350
and make mars more earth-like which
means that you're now having a

868
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
means that you're now having a
 

869
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,949
means that you're now having a
reproduction process like a cell

870
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
reproduction process like a cell
 

871
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,470
reproduction process like a cell
reproduces itself to propagate

872
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
reproduces itself to propagate
 

873
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,470
reproduces itself to propagate
information in the future

874
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
information in the future
 

875
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,750
information in the future
planets have to figure out how to

876
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
planets have to figure out how to
 

877
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,509
planets have to figure out how to
reproduce their conditions including

878
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
reproduce their conditions including
 

879
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,829
reproduce their conditions including
geochemical conditions on other planets

880
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
geochemical conditions on other planets
 

881
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,430
geochemical conditions on other planets
in order to actually reproduce life in

882
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
in order to actually reproduce life in
 

883
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,949
in order to actually reproduce life in
the universe which is kind of a little

884
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
the universe which is kind of a little
 

885
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,790
the universe which is kind of a little
bit radical but i think

886
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
bit radical but i think
 

887
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,710
bit radical but i think
for long-term sustainability of life on

888
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
for long-term sustainability of life on
 

889
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,189
for long-term sustainability of life on
a planet that's absolutely essential

890
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
a planet that's absolutely essential
 

891
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,870
a planet that's absolutely essential
okay so

892
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
okay so
 

893
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,790
okay so
if we were to think about life as a

894
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
if we were to think about life as a
 

895
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,629
if we were to think about life as a
planetary phenomenon

896
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
planetary phenomenon
 

897
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,110
planetary phenomenon
and so life on mars would be best if

898
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
and so life on mars would be best if
 

899
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,430
and so life on mars would be best if
it's way different than life on earth

900
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
it's way different than life on earth
 

901
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,509
it's way different than life on earth
we have to ask the very basic question

902
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
we have to ask the very basic question
 

903
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,550
we have to ask the very basic question
of

904
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
of
 

905
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,430
of
what

906
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
what
 

907
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,269
what
is life

908
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
is life
 

909
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,790
is life
i actually don't think that's the right

910
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
i actually don't think that's the right
 

911
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,150
i actually don't think that's the right
question to ask

912
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
question to ask
 

913
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,350
question to ask
it took me a long time to get there

914
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
it took me a long time to get there
 

915
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,829
it took me a long time to get there
right so cross it out yeah you cross it

916
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
right so cross it out yeah you cross it
 

917
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,670
right so cross it out yeah you cross it
off your list it's wrong

918
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
off your list it's wrong
 

919
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,230
off your list it's wrong
no question um no no no i mean i think

920
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
no question um no no no i mean i think
 

921
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,069
no question um no no no i mean i think
it has an answer but i think the part of

922
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
it has an answer but i think the part of
 

923
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,310
it has an answer but i think the part of
the problem is um you know most of the

924
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
the problem is um you know most of the
 

925
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,670
the problem is um you know most of the
places in science where we get really

926
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
places in science where we get really
 

927
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,790
places in science where we get really
stuck is because we don't know what

928
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
stuck is because we don't know what
 

929
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,110
stuck is because we don't know what
questions to ask um and so you can't

930
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
questions to ask um and so you can't
 

931
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,550
questions to ask um and so you can't
answer a question if you're asking the

932
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
answer a question if you're asking the
 

933
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,230
answer a question if you're asking the
wrong question um and i think uh the way

934
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
wrong question um and i think uh the way
 

935
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,990
wrong question um and i think uh the way
i think about it is obviously i'm

936
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
i think about it is obviously i'm
 

937
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,430
i think about it is obviously i'm
interested in what life is so i'm being

938
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
interested in what life is so i'm being
 

939
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,629
interested in what life is so i'm being
a little cheeky when i say that's the

940
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
a little cheeky when i say that's the
 

941
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,069
a little cheeky when i say that's the
wrong question to ask that's exactly

942
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
wrong question to ask that's exactly
 

943
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,990
wrong question to ask that's exactly
like the question that's like the core

944
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
like the question that's like the core
 

945
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,670
like the question that's like the core
of my existence but

946
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
of my existence but
 

947
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,790
of my existence but
um

948
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
um
 

949
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,269
um
but i think the way of framing that is

950
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
but i think the way of framing that is
 

951
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,670
but i think the way of framing that is
what is it about our universe that

952
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
what is it about our universe that
 

953
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,150
what is it about our universe that
allows features that we associate life

954
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
allows features that we associate life
 

955
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,030
allows features that we associate life
to be there um and so really what i

956
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
to be there um and so really what i
 

957
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,389
to be there um and so really what i
guess when i'm asking that question what

958
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
guess when i'm asking that question what
 

959
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,550
guess when i'm asking that question what
i'm after is an explanatory framework

960
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
i'm after is an explanatory framework
 

961
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,870
i'm after is an explanatory framework
for what life is right and so most

962
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
for what life is right and so most
 

963
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,269
for what life is right and so most
people they try to go in and define life

964
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
people they try to go in and define life
 

965
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,990
people they try to go in and define life
and they say well life is uh say a

966
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
and they say well life is uh say a
 

967
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,910
and they say well life is uh say a
self-reproducing chemical system capable

968
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
self-reproducing chemical system capable
 

969
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,269
self-reproducing chemical system capable
of darwinian evolution that's a very

970
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
of darwinian evolution that's a very
 

971
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,829
of darwinian evolution that's a very
popular definition for life um or life

972
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
popular definition for life um or life
 

973
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,230
popular definition for life um or life
is something that metabolizes and eats

974
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
is something that metabolizes and eats
 

975
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,069
is something that metabolizes and eats
that is not how i think about life what

976
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
that is not how i think about life what
 

977
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,389
that is not how i think about life what
i think about life is there are

978
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
i think about life is there are
 

979
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,310
i think about life is there are

how information interacts with the

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,389
how information interacts with the
physical world i don't know exactly what

00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
physical world i don't know exactly what
 

991
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,389
physical world i don't know exactly what
i mean even when i say that um because

992
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
i mean even when i say that um because
 

993
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,030
i mean even when i say that um because
we don't know these rules um but it's a

994
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
we don't know these rules um but it's a
 

995
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,269
we don't know these rules um but it's a
little bit like um i like to use

996
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
little bit like um i like to use
 

997
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,430
little bit like um i like to use
analogies you'll give me time to be like

998
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
analogies you'll give me time to be like
 

999
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,269
analogies you'll give me time to be like
a little long-winded for a second even

1000
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
a little long-winded for a second even
 

1001
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,389
a little long-winded for a second even
in as i um but um but sort of like if

1002
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
in as i um but um but sort of like if
 

1003
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,509
in as i um but um but sort of like if
you look at the history of physics for

1004
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
you look at the history of physics for
 

1005
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,590
you look at the history of physics for
example this is like so we are in the

1006
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
example this is like so we are in the
 

1007
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,710
example this is like so we are in the
period of the development of

1008
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
period of the development of
 

1009
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,710
period of the development of
thought on our planet where we don't

1010
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
thought on our planet where we don't
 

1011
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,949
thought on our planet where we don't
understand what we are yet right um

1012
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
understand what we are yet right um
 

1013
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,790
understand what we are yet right um
there was a period of thought in the

1014
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
there was a period of thought in the
 

1015
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,910
there was a period of thought in the
history of our planet where we didn't

1016
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:51,920
history of our planet where we didn't
 

1017
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,749
history of our planet where we didn't
understand what gravity was

1018
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
understand what gravity was
 

1019
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,590
understand what gravity was
um and we didn't understand for example

1020
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
um and we didn't understand for example
 

1021
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,910
um and we didn't understand for example
that planets in the heavens

1022
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
that planets in the heavens
 

1023
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,749
that planets in the heavens
you know were actually planets or that

1024
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
you know were actually planets or that
 

1025
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,269
you know were actually planets or that
they operated by the same laws that we

1026
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
they operated by the same laws that we
 

1027
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:01,990
they operated by the same laws that we
did

1028
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
did
 

1029
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,150
did
um and so there has been this sort of

1030
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
um and so there has been this sort of
 

1031
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,069
um and so there has been this sort of
progression of getting a deeper

1032
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
progression of getting a deeper
 

1033
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,390
progression of getting a deeper

phenomena like i'm not gonna drop the

1036
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
phenomena like i'm not gonna drop the
 

1037
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,429
phenomena like i'm not gonna drop the
cup i'll drop the water bottle there you

1038
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
cup i'll drop the water bottle there you
 

1039
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,669
cup i'll drop the water bottle there you
go okay that fell right but why did that

1040
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
go okay that fell right but why did that
 

1041
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,069
go okay that fell right but why did that
fall um

1042
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
fall um
 

1043
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,270
fall um
this is why i'm a theorist not an

1044
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
this is why i'm a theorist not an
 

1045
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,949
this is why i'm a theorist not an
experiment

1046
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
experiment
 

1047
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,630
experiment
i could have gone wrong in so many ways

1048
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
i could have gone wrong in so many ways
 

1049
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,230
i could have gone wrong in so many ways
i know i could have especially if i did

1050
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
i know i could have especially if i did
 

1051
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,429
i know i could have especially if i did
the confidence smash anyway

1052
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
the confidence smash anyway
 

1053
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,390
the confidence smash anyway
um so um so if you think you take this

1054
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
um so um so if you think you take this
 

1055
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,750
um so um so if you think you take this
view that there's sort of some missing

1056
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
view that there's sort of some missing
 

1057
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,710
view that there's sort of some missing
principles i associate them uh to

1058
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
principles i associate them uh to
 

1059
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,270
principles i associate them uh to
information and what it what the sort of

1060
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
information and what it what the sort of
 

1061
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,350
information and what it what the sort of
feeling there is there's some missing

1062
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
feeling there is there's some missing
 

1063
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,430
feeling there is there's some missing
explanatory framework for how our

1064
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
explanatory framework for how our
 

1065
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,350
explanatory framework for how our
universe works and if we understood that

1066
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
universe works and if we understood that
 

1067
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,390
universe works and if we understood that
physics it would explain what we are um

1068
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
physics it would explain what we are um
 

1069
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,750
physics it would explain what we are um
it might also explain a lot of other

1070
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
it might also explain a lot of other
 

1071
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,549
it might also explain a lot of other
features we don't associate to life um

1072
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
features we don't associate to life um
 

1073
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,870
features we don't associate to life um
and so it's a little like um people

1074
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
and so it's a little like um people
 

1075
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,549
and so it's a little like um people
accept the fact that gravity is a

1076
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
accept the fact that gravity is a
 

1077
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,789
accept the fact that gravity is a
universal phenomena but when we want to

1078
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
universal phenomena but when we want to
 

1079
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,630
universal phenomena but when we want to
study gravity we study things like large

1080
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
study gravity we study things like large
 

1081
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,830
study gravity we study things like large

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
if we want to understand information and
 

1089
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,909
if we want to understand information and

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,029
study intelligent systems or living

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,310

explanatory framework i think it's just

1102
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
explanatory framework i think it's just
 

1103
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,430
explanatory framework i think it's just
because we haven't been thinking about

00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
because we haven't been thinking about

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,430
because we haven't been thinking about
the problem deeply enough but i feel

1106
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:19,440
the problem deeply enough but i feel
 

1107
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,350
the problem deeply enough but i feel
like if you're explaining something

1108
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
like if you're explaining something
 

1109
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,870
like if you're explaining something
you're deriving it from some more

1110
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
you're deriving it from some more
 

1111
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,029
you're deriving it from some more

don't include us in the universe and i
can't help but think there's something

1140
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
can't help but think there's something
 

1141
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,230
can't help but think there's something
really special about what we are and

1142
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
really special about what we are and
 

1143
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,750
really special about what we are and
there have to be some deep principles at

1144
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
there have to be some deep principles at
 

1145
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,870
there have to be some deep principles at
play there

1146
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
play there
 

1147
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,470
play there
um

1148
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
um
 

1149
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,950
um
and so so that's sort of my perspective

1150
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
and so so that's sort of my perspective
 

1151
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,430
and so so that's sort of my perspective
on it now when you ask me what life is i

1152
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
on it now when you ask me what life is i
 

1153
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,909
on it now when you ask me what life is i
have some ideas of what i think it is

1154
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
have some ideas of what i think it is
 

1155
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,909
have some ideas of what i think it is
but i think that we haven't

1156
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
but i think that we haven't
 

1157
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,830
but i think that we haven't
gotten there yet because we haven't been

1158
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
gotten there yet because we haven't been
 

1159
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,990
gotten there yet because we haven't been
able to see that structure and it's and

1160
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
able to see that structure and it's and
 

1161
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,270
able to see that structure and it's and
just go back to the gravity example it's

1162
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
just go back to the gravity example it's
 

1163
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,270
just go back to the gravity example it's
a little like you know in ancient times

1164
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
a little like you know in ancient times
 

1165
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,190
a little like you know in ancient times
they didn't know i was talking about

1166
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
they didn't know i was talking about
 

1167
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,710
they didn't know i was talking about
stars and heavens and things they didn't

1168
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
stars and heavens and things they didn't
 

1169
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,789
stars and heavens and things they didn't
know those were um you know governed by

1170
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
know those were um you know governed by
 

1171
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,390
know those were um you know governed by
the same principles as that starting to

1172
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
the same principles as that starting to
 

1173
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,310
the same principles as that starting to
experiment here's where i was going with

1174
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
experiment here's where i was going with
 

1175
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,350
experiment here's where i was going with
it once you realize like newton did that

1176
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
it once you realize like newton did that
 

1177
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,190
it once you realize like newton did that
you know heavenly emotions and earthly

1178
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
you know heavenly emotions and earthly
 

1179
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,470
you know heavenly emotions and earthly
emotions are governed by the same

1180
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
emotions are governed by the same
 

1181
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,230
emotions are governed by the same
principles and you unify terrestrial and

1182
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
principles and you unify terrestrial and
 

1183
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,669
principles and you unify terrestrial and
celestial motion you get these more

1184
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
celestial motion you get these more
 

1185
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,110
celestial motion you get these more
powerful ideas

1186
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
powerful ideas
 

1187
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,990
powerful ideas
um and i i think where life is is

1188
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
um and i i think where life is is
 

1189
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,390
um and i i think where life is is
somehow unifying these abstract ideas of

1190
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
somehow unifying these abstract ideas of
 

1191
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,470
somehow unifying these abstract ideas of
computation and information

1192
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
computation and information
 

1193
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,710
computation and information
with the physical world with matter and

1194
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
with the physical world with matter and
 

1195
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,270
with the physical world with matter and
realizing that there's some explanatory

1196
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
realizing that there's some explanatory
 

1197
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,270
realizing that there's some explanatory
framework that's not physics and it's

1198
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
framework that's not physics and it's
 

1199
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,990
framework that's not physics and it's
not computation but it's something

1200
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
not computation but it's something
 

1201
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,510
not computation but it's something
that's deeper

1202
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
that's deeper
 

1203
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,470
that's deeper
so

1204
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
so
 

1205
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,990
so
answering the question of what is life

1206
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
answering the question of what is life
 

1207
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,190
answering the question of what is life
requires

1208
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
requires
 

1209
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,029
requires
deeply understanding something about the

1210
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
deeply understanding something about the
 

1211
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,510
deeply understanding something about the
universe as information processing

1212
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
universe as information processing
 

1213
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,430
universe as information processing
universe is computation

1214
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
universe is computation
 

1215
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,549
universe is computation
something about

1216
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
something about
 

1217
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,110
something about
like would uh once you come up with an

1218
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
like would uh once you come up with an
 

1219
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,590
like would uh once you come up with an
answer to what is life well the words

1220
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
answer to what is life well the words
 

1221
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,750
answer to what is life well the words
information and computation be in the

1222
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:07,760
information and computation be in the
 

1223
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,070
information and computation be in the
paragraph no i don't think so oh damn it

1224
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
paragraph no i don't think so oh damn it
 

1225
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,830
paragraph no i don't think so oh damn it
okay i know it doesn't help does it i

1226
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
okay i know it doesn't help does it i
 

1227
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,590
okay i know it doesn't help does it i
know i i hate actually i hate this about

1228
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
know i i hate actually i hate this about
 

1229
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,630
know i i hate actually i hate this about
what i do because it's so hard to

1230
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
what i do because it's so hard to
 

1231
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,630
what i do because it's so hard to
communicate right with words like when

1232
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
communicate right with words like when
 

1233
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,110
communicate right with words like when
you have words that are

1234
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
you have words that are
 

1235
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,669
you have words that are
um ideas that have historically

1236
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
um ideas that have historically
 

1237
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,190
um ideas that have historically
described one thing and you're trying to

1238
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
described one thing and you're trying to
 

1239
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,950
described one thing and you're trying to
describe something people haven't seen

1240
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
describe something people haven't seen
 

1241
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,750
describe something people haven't seen
yet right and the words just don't fit

1242
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
yet right and the words just don't fit
 

1243
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,669
yet right and the words just don't fit
so what uh what's wrong is it too

1244
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
so what uh what's wrong is it too
 

1245
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,669
so what uh what's wrong is it too
ambiguous the word information we could

1246
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
ambiguous the word information we could
 

1247
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,750
ambiguous the word information we could
switch to binary if you want yeah no i

1248
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
switch to binary if you want yeah no i
 

1249
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,669
switch to binary if you want yeah no i
don't think it's binary either i think

1250
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:35,679
don't think it's binary either i think
 

1251
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,990
don't think it's binary either i think
information is just loaded i use it so

1252
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000
information is just loaded i use it so
 

1253
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,270
information is just loaded i use it so
the other way i might talk about it is

1254
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
the other way i might talk about it is
 

1255
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,270
the other way i might talk about it is
the physics of causation but i think

1256
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
the physics of causation but i think
 

1257
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,110
the physics of causation but i think
that's worse because causation is even

1258
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
that's worse because causation is even
 

1259
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,710
that's worse because causation is even
more loaded word than

1260
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
more loaded word than
 

1261
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,990
more loaded word than
um

1262
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
um
 

1263
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,230
um
information causation is fundamental you

1264
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
information causation is fundamental you
 

1265
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,110
information causation is fundamental you
think i do yeah and um in some sense i

1266
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
think i do yeah and um in some sense i
 

1267
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,870
think i do yeah and um in some sense i
think the physics so this is the really

1268
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
think the physics so this is the really
 

1269
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,630
think the physics so this is the really
radical part some sense like when i

1270
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
radical part some sense like when i
 

1271
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,230
radical part some sense like when i
really think about it sort of most

1272
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
really think about it sort of most
 

1273
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,470
really think about it sort of most
deeply uh what i think life is is

1274
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480
deeply uh what i think life is is
 

1275
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,310
deeply uh what i think life is is
actually the physics of existence what

1276
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
actually the physics of existence what
 

1277
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,350
actually the physics of existence what
gets to exist and why um and you know

1278
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
gets to exist and why um and you know
 

1279
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,789
gets to exist and why um and you know
for simple elementary particles that's

1280
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
for simple elementary particles that's
 

1281
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,909
for simple elementary particles that's
not very complicated because the

1282
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:05,919
not very complicated because the
 

1283
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,350
not very complicated because the
interactions are simple but for things

1284
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
interactions are simple but for things
 

1285
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,669
interactions are simple but for things
like um you know you and me and human

1286
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
like um you know you and me and human
 

1287
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,190
like um you know you and me and human
civilizations

1288
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
civilizations
 

1289
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,029
civilizations
um you know what comes next in the

1290
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
um you know what comes next in the
 

1291
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,390
um you know what comes next in the
universe is really dependent on what

1292
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
universe is really dependent on what
 

1293
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,549
universe is really dependent on what
came before and there's a huge space of

1294
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
came before and there's a huge space of
 

1295
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,310
came before and there's a huge space of
possibilities of things that can exist

1296
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
possibilities of things that can exist
 

1297
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,390
possibilities of things that can exist
and when i say information and causation

1298
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
and when i say information and causation
 

1299
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,350
and when i say information and causation
what i mean is why is it that

1300
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
what i mean is why is it that
 

1301
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,110
what i mean is why is it that
cups evolved in the universe and not

1302
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
cups evolved in the universe and not
 

1303
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,950
cups evolved in the universe and not
some other object that could deliver

1304
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
some other object that could deliver
 

1305
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,590
some other object that could deliver
water and not spill it

1306
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,600
water and not spill it
 

1307
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,430
water and not spill it
i don't know what you would call it uh

1308
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
i don't know what you would call it uh
 

1309
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,190
i don't know what you would call it uh
maybe it wouldn't be a cup but um but

1310
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
maybe it wouldn't be a cup but um but
 

1311
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,909
maybe it wouldn't be a cup but um but
it's a huge it it's um

1312
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
it's a huge it it's um
 

1313
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,590
it's a huge it it's um
you know you know people talk about the

1314
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600
you know you know people talk about the
 

1315
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,029
you know you know people talk about the
space of things that could exist as

1316
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
space of things that could exist as
 

1317
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,870
space of things that could exist as
being actually infinitely large right i

1318
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:40,880
being actually infinitely large right i
 

1319
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,870
being actually infinitely large right i
don't know if i believe in infinity

1320
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
don't know if i believe in infinity
 

1321
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,350
don't know if i believe in infinity
um but i do think that

1322
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
um but i do think that
 

1323
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,350
um but i do think that
there is something very interesting

1324
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
there is something very interesting
 

1325
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,149
there is something very interesting
about

1326
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159

 

1327
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,149

the problem of what exists in its

1328
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
the problem of what exists in its
 

1329
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,909
the problem of what exists in its
relationship to life so do you think

1330
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
relationship to life so do you think
 

1331
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,789
relationship to life so do you think
this

1332
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
this
 

1333
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,470
this
the set of things that could exist is

1334
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
the set of things that could exist is
 

1335
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,830
the set of things that could exist is
finite

1336
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
finite
 

1337
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,750
finite
it's very large but like if we were to

1338
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
it's very large but like if we were to
 

1339
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,630
it's very large but like if we were to
think

1340
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
think
 

1341
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,909
think
about the physics of existence

1342
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:03,919
about the physics of existence
 

1343
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,230
about the physics of existence
like how how many shapes of mugs can

1344
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
like how how many shapes of mugs can
 

1345
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,390
like how how many shapes of mugs can
there be like is uh

1346
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
there be like is uh
 

1347
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,310
there be like is uh
in the initial programming i should go

1348
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
in the initial programming i should go
 

1349
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,870
in the initial programming i should go
to the math department for that but

1350
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
to the math department for that but
 

1351
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,870
to the math department for that but
so that's not a topology question i just

1352
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
so that's not a topology question i just
 

1353
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,230
so that's not a topology question i just
mean

1354
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
mean
 

1355
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,070
mean
maybe another way to ask is what do you

1356
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,080
maybe another way to ask is what do you
 

1357
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,310
maybe another way to ask is what do you
think is fundamental to the universe and

1358
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,320
think is fundamental to the universe and
 

1359
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,510
think is fundamental to the universe and
what is emergent so if existence i was

1360
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:23,520
what is emergent so if existence i was
 

1361
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,430
what is emergent so if existence i was
supposed to think of that as somehow

1362
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440
supposed to think of that as somehow
 

1363
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,270
supposed to think of that as somehow
fundamental you think so there's a

1364
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,280
fundamental you think so there's a
 

1365
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,870
fundamental you think so there's a
couple problems in physics that i think

1366
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
couple problems in physics that i think
 

1367
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,470
couple problems in physics that i think
this is related to one is why does

1368
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
this is related to one is why does
 

1369
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,230
this is related to one is why does
mathematics work at describing reality

1370
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
mathematics work at describing reality
 

1371
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,190
mathematics work at describing reality
so well

1372
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200
so well
 

1373
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,669
so well
um and then there is this problem of we

1374
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679
um and then there is this problem of we
 

1375
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,590
um and then there is this problem of we
don't understand why the laws of physics

1376
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
don't understand why the laws of physics
 

1377
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,510
don't understand why the laws of physics
are the way they are or why certain

1378
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,520
are the way they are or why certain
 

1379
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,350
are the way they are or why certain
things get to exist or

1380
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
things get to exist or
 

1381
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,950
things get to exist or
what put in place the initial condition

1382
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
what put in place the initial condition
 

1383
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,549
what put in place the initial condition
of our universe right there's all of

1384
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:44,559
of our universe right there's all of
 

1385
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,310
of our universe right there's all of
these sort of really deep and big

1386
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
these sort of really deep and big
 

1387
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,149
these sort of really deep and big
problems and they they all um

1388
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:50,159
problems and they they all um
 

1389
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,149
problems and they they all um
indirectly are related i think to the

1390
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
indirectly are related i think to the
 

1391
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,029
indirectly are related i think to the
same kind of thing that um

1392
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
same kind of thing that um
 

1393
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,870
same kind of thing that um
you know our physics is really good if

1394
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:56,880
you know our physics is really good if
 

1395
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,950
you know our physics is really good if
you specify the initial condition at

1396
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:58,960
you specify the initial condition at
 

1397
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,870
you specify the initial condition at
specifying a certain sequence of events

1398
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880
specifying a certain sequence of events
 

1399
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,350
specifying a certain sequence of events
but it doesn't deal with the fact that

1400
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
but it doesn't deal with the fact that
 

1401
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,110
but it doesn't deal with the fact that
other things could have happened which

1402
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
other things could have happened which
 

1403
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,549
other things could have happened which
is kind of an informational property

1404
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
is kind of an informational property
 

1405
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,630
is kind of an informational property
like a counter factual property

1406
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
like a counter factual property
 

1407
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,430
like a counter factual property
um

1408
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
um
 

1409
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,549
um
and it's not good at explaining

1410
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
and it's not good at explaining
 

1411
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,430
and it's not good at explaining
uh

1412
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
uh
 

1413
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,789
uh
you know this conversation right now

1414
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
you know this conversation right now
 

1415
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,710
you know this conversation right now
it's just it there are certain things

1416
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
it's just it there are certain things
 

1417
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,630
it's just it there are certain things
that are outside the explanatory reach

1418
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
that are outside the explanatory reach
 

1419
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,470
that are outside the explanatory reach
of current physics and

1420
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
of current physics and
 

1421
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,789
of current physics and
um i think they require looking at it

1422
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
um i think they require looking at it
 

1423
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,950
um i think they require looking at it
from a completely different direction

1424
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:24,960
from a completely different direction
 

1425
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,470
from a completely different direction
um and so i don't want to have to

1426
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
um and so i don't want to have to
 

1427
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,909
um and so i don't want to have to
fine-tune the initial condition of the

1428
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
fine-tune the initial condition of the
 

1429
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,149
fine-tune the initial condition of the
universe to specify precisely all the

1430
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
universe to specify precisely all the
 

1431
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,510
universe to specify precisely all the
information in this conversation i think

1432
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
information in this conversation i think
 

1433
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,590
information in this conversation i think
that's a ridiculous assertion um but

1434
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
that's a ridiculous assertion um but
 

1435
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,110
that's a ridiculous assertion um but
that's sort of like how people want to

1436
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120
that's sort of like how people want to
 

1437
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,870
that's sort of like how people want to
frame it when they talk about

1438
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
frame it when they talk about
 

1439
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,750
frame it when they talk about
um

1440
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
um
 

1441
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,750
um
you know the standard model is

1442
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760
you know the standard model is
 

1443
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,070
you know the standard model is
sufficient if we had computing power to

1444
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
sufficient if we had computing power to
 

1445
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,510
sufficient if we had computing power to
basically explain all life in our

1446
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:43,520
basically explain all life in our
 

1447
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,669
basically explain all life in our
existence an interesting thing you said

1448
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
existence an interesting thing you said
 

1449
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,909
existence an interesting thing you said
is the way we think about information

1450
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
is the way we think about information
 

1451
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,789
is the way we think about information
computation is by observing a particular

1452
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799
computation is by observing a particular
 

1453
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,430
computation is by observing a particular
kind of systems on earth

1454
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
kind of systems on earth
 

1455
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,830
kind of systems on earth
that exhibit something we think of as

1456
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
that exhibit something we think of as
 

1457
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,750
that exhibit something we think of as
intelligence but that's

1458
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
intelligence but that's
 

1459
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,990
intelligence but that's
that's like uh looking at i guess the

1460
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
that's like uh looking at i guess the
 

1461
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,510
that's like uh looking at i guess the
tip of an iceberg and we should be

1462
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
tip of an iceberg and we should be
 

1463
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,110
tip of an iceberg and we should be
really looking at the fundamentals of

1464
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
really looking at the fundamentals of
 

1465
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,149
really looking at the fundamentals of
like the iceberg like like like what

1466
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:06,159
like the iceberg like like like what
 

1467
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,750
like the iceberg like like like what
makes

1468
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
makes
 

1469
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,470
makes
water and ice and and and the chemistry

1470
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
water and ice and and and the chemistry
 

1471
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,950
water and ice and and and the chemistry
that from which intelligence emerges

1472
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
that from which intelligence emerges
 

1473
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,549
that from which intelligence emerges
essentially

1474
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
essentially
 

1475
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,310
essentially
we can't just couple the information

1476
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
we can't just couple the information
 

1477
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,750
we can't just couple the information
from the physics and i think that's what

1478
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
from the physics and i think that's what
 

1479
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,190
from the physics and i think that's what
we've gotten really good at doing

1480
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
we've gotten really good at doing
 

1481
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,549
we've gotten really good at doing
especially with

1482
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
especially with
 

1483
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,909
especially with
sort of

1484
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
sort of
 

1485
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,710
sort of
the modern age where you know software

1486
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
the modern age where you know software
 

1487
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,390
the modern age where you know software
is so abstracted

1488
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
is so abstracted
 

1489
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,990
is so abstracted
um from

1490
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
um from
 

1491
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,430
um from
hardware

1492
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,440
hardware
 

1493
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,110
hardware
but the entire process of biological

1494
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,120
but the entire process of biological
 

1495
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,669
but the entire process of biological
evolution has basically been built like

1496
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
evolution has basically been built like
 

1497
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,590
evolution has basically been built like
been building layers of increasing

1498
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
been building layers of increasing
 

1499
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,590
been building layers of increasing
abstraction and so it's really hard to

1500
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
abstraction and so it's really hard to
 

1501
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,990
abstraction and so it's really hard to
see that physics in us but it's much

1502
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
see that physics in us but it's much
 

1503
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,390
see that physics in us but it's much
clearer to see it in molecules

1504
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
clearer to see it in molecules
 

1505
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,470
clearer to see it in molecules
yeah but i guess i'm trying to figure

1506
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
yeah but i guess i'm trying to figure
 

1507
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,149
yeah but i guess i'm trying to figure
out what what do you think are the best

1508
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
out what what do you think are the best
 

1509
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,470
out what what do you think are the best
tools to look at it

1510
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
tools to look at it
 

1511
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,230
tools to look at it
what do you think

1512
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
what do you think
 

1513
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,350
what do you think
an open mind is that a tool

1514
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,360
an open mind is that a tool
 

1515
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,549
an open mind is that a tool
what's the physics of an open mind

1516
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
what's the physics of an open mind
 

1517
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,909
what's the physics of an open mind
i think if we saw that we'll solve

1518
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
i think if we saw that we'll solve
 

1519
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,590
i think if we saw that we'll solve
everything i'm saying an open mind

1520
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600
everything i'm saying an open mind
 

1521
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,750
everything i'm saying an open mind
because i think the biggest stumbling

1522
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
because i think the biggest stumbling
 

1523
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,669
because i think the biggest stumbling
block um

1524
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
block um
 

1525
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,990
block um
to understanding sort of the things i've

1526
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
to understanding sort of the things i've
 

1527
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,909
to understanding sort of the things i've
been trying to articulate or and when i

talk also with colleagues that are

1530
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
talk also with colleagues that are
 

1531
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,669
talk also with colleagues that are
thinking deeply about these same issues

1532
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:11,679
thinking deeply about these same issues
 

1533
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,029
thinking deeply about these same issues
is

1534
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
is
 

1535
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,029
is
none of it is inconsistent with what we

1536
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
none of it is inconsistent with what we
 

1537
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,390
none of it is inconsistent with what we
know it's just such a radically

1538
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
know it's just such a radically
 

1539
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,390
know it's just such a radically
different perception perception of the

1540
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
different perception perception of the
 

1541
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,830
different perception perception of the
way we understand things now that it's

1542
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:19,840
way we understand things now that it's
 

1543
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,669
way we understand things now that it's
hard for people to get there and in some

1544
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:21,679
hard for people to get there and in some
 

1545
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,190
hard for people to get there and in some
ways you have to almost forget what

1546
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,200
ways you have to almost forget what
 

1547
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,950
ways you have to almost forget what
you've learned in order to learn

1548
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
you've learned in order to learn
 

1549
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,710
you've learned in order to learn
something new right so i feel like most

1550
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
something new right so i feel like most
 

1551
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,549
something new right so i feel like most
of my career trying to understand the

1552
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
of my career trying to understand the
 

1553
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,590
of my career trying to understand the
problem of life has been variously

1554
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
problem of life has been variously
 

1555
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,149
problem of life has been variously
forgetting and then relearning things

1556
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
forgetting and then relearning things
 

1557
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,549
forgetting and then relearning things
that i learned in physics and and i

1558
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
that i learned in physics and and i
 

1559
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,390
that i learned in physics and and i
think you have to

1560
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
think you have to
 

1561
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,310
think you have to
you have to have a capacity

1562
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
you have to have a capacity
 

1563
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,549
you have to have a capacity
to learn things but then accept that

1564
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
to learn things but then accept that
 

1565
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,390
to learn things but then accept that
things that you were you you learned

1566
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
things that you were you you learned
 

1567
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,909
things that you were you you learned
might not be true

1568
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
might not be true
 

1569
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,190
might not be true
um

1570
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
um
 

1571
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,470
um
or

1572
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
or
 

1573
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,029
or
or might need refinement or reframing

1574
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
or might need refinement or reframing
 

1575
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:51,830
or might need refinement or reframing
um

1576
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
um
 

1577
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,430
um
and the best way i can say that is just

1578
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
and the best way i can say that is just
 

1579
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,710
and the best way i can say that is just
like with a physics education there are

1580
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
like with a physics education there are
 

1581
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,310
like with a physics education there are
just certain things you're told in

1582
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
just certain things you're told in
 

1583
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,990
just certain things you're told in
undergrad that are like facts about the

1584
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,000
undergrad that are like facts about the
 

1585
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,870
undergrad that are like facts about the
world

1586
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
world
 

1587
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,950
world
and your physics professors never tell

1588
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
and your physics professors never tell
 

1589
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,630
and your physics professors never tell
you that those facts actually emerge

1590
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
you that those facts actually emerge
 

1591
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,710
you that those facts actually emerge
from a human mind right so we're taught

1592
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
from a human mind right so we're taught
 

1593
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,230
from a human mind right so we're taught
to think about say the laws of physics

1594
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
to think about say the laws of physics
 

1595
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,350
to think about say the laws of physics
for example

1596
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
for example
 

1597
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,630
for example
as this like

1598
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
as this like
 

1599
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,149
as this like
autonomous thing that exists outside of

1600
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
autonomous thing that exists outside of
 

1601
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,590
autonomous thing that exists outside of
our universe and tells our universe how

1602
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
our universe and tells our universe how
 

1603
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,149
our universe and tells our universe how
it works yeah um but the laws of physics

1604
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
it works yeah um but the laws of physics
 

1605
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,909
it works yeah um but the laws of physics
were invented by human minds to describe

1606
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
were invented by human minds to describe
 

1607
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,510
were invented by human minds to describe
things that are regularities in our

1608
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
things that are regularities in our
 

1609
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,029
things that are regularities in our
everyday experience

1610
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:19,039
everyday experience
 

1611
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,549
everyday experience
right they don't exist autonomous to the

1612
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:20,559
right they don't exist autonomous to the
 

1613
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,870
right they don't exist autonomous to the
universe right so it's like turtles on

1614
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
universe right so it's like turtles on
 

1615
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,549
universe right so it's like turtles on
top of turtles but

1616
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:24,559
top of turtles but
 

1617
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,549
top of turtles but
eventually gets the human mind and then

1618
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:26,559
eventually gets the human mind and then
 

1619
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,470
eventually gets the human mind and then
you have to explain the human mind with

1620
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
you have to explain the human mind with
 

1621
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,110
you have to explain the human mind with
the turtles yes so you have to yeah it

1622
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
the turtles yes so you have to yeah it
 

1623
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,430
the turtles yes so you have to yeah it
comes from humans this understanding the

1624
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,440
comes from humans this understanding the
 

1625
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,950
comes from humans this understanding the
simplification of the universe these

1626
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:34,960
simplification of the universe these
 

1627
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,190
simplification of the universe these
models yeah there's a guy named stephen

1628
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
models yeah there's a guy named stephen
 

1629
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,350
models yeah there's a guy named stephen
wolfram there's a

1630
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
wolfram there's a
 

1631
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,070
wolfram there's a
concept called cellular automata so

1632
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
concept called cellular automata so
 

1633
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,750
concept called cellular automata so
there's a

1634
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
there's a
 

1635
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,029
there's a
there's some mysteries in these um

1636
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039
there's some mysteries in these um
 

1637
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,350
there's some mysteries in these um
systems that are computational in nature

1638
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
systems that are computational in nature
 

1639
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,110
systems that are computational in nature
that have

1640
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
that have
 

1641
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,870
that have
maybe echoes

1642
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
maybe echoes
 

1643
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,110
maybe echoes
of the kind of mysteries we should

1644
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
of the kind of mysteries we should
 

1645
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,760
of the kind of mysteries we should
need to solve to understand what is life

1646
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:57,770
need to solve to understand what is life
 

1647
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,029
need to solve to understand what is life
[Music]

1648
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039
[Music]
 

1649
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,470
[Music]
so

1650
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
so
 

1651
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,630
so
if we could talk take a

1652
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
if we could talk take a
 

1653
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,710
if we could talk take a
computational view of things do you

1654
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
computational view of things do you
 

1655
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,510
computational view of things do you
think there's something compelling to

1656
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,520
think there's something compelling to
 

1657
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,750
think there's something compelling to
reducing everything down to computation

1658
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:09,760
reducing everything down to computation
 

1659
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,070
reducing everything down to computation
like the universe is computation and

1660
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
like the universe is computation and
 

1661
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,870
like the universe is computation and
then trying to understand

1662
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
then trying to understand
 

1663
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,149
then trying to understand
life so

1664
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
life so
 

1665
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,909
life so
throw away the biology throw away the

1666
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919
throw away the biology throw away the
 

1667
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,990
throw away the biology throw away the
chemistry throw away even the physics

1668
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
chemistry throw away even the physics
 

1669
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,230
chemistry throw away even the physics
that you you learn undergrad in graduate

1670
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,240
that you you learn undergrad in graduate
 

1671
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,549
that you you learn undergrad in graduate
school and more look at these simple

1672
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
school and more look at these simple
 

1673
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,630
school and more look at these simple
little systems whether it's cellular

1674
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
little systems whether it's cellular
 

1675
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,549
little systems whether it's cellular

1676
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
automata or whatever the heck kind of
 

1677
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,230
automata or whatever the heck kind of
computational systems that operate on

1678
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
computational systems that operate on
 

1679
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,230
computational systems that operate on
simple local rules and then create

1680
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
simple local rules and then create
 

1681
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,149
simple local rules and then create
complexity

1682
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
complexity
 

1683
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,230
complexity
as they evolve

1684
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,240
as they evolve
 

1685
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,630
as they evolve
is is it uh at all do you think

1686
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
is is it uh at all do you think
 

1687
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,190
is is it uh at all do you think
productive to focus on those kinds of

1688
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
productive to focus on those kinds of
 

1689
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,430
productive to focus on those kinds of
systems to get an inkling of what is

1690
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
systems to get an inkling of what is
 

1691
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,230
systems to get an inkling of what is
life

1692
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
life
 

1693
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,830
life
and if it is

1694
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:45,840
and if it is
 

1695
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,669
and if it is
do you do you think it's

1696
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
do you do you think it's
 

1697
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,669
do you do you think it's
it's possible to come up with some kind

1698
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:49,679
it's possible to come up with some kind
 

1699
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,389
it's possible to come up with some kind
of laws and principles about what makes

1700
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
of laws and principles about what makes
 

1701
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,870
of laws and principles about what makes
life in those computational

1702
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
life in those computational
 

1703
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,070
life in those computational
systems

1704
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
systems
 

1705
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,590
systems
so i like cellular automata i think

1706
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
so i like cellular automata i think
 

1707
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,310
so i like cellular automata i think
they're good toy models um but mostly

1708
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,320
they're good toy models um but mostly
 

1709
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,990
they're good toy models um but mostly
like where i've thought about them and

1710
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
like where i've thought about them and
 

1711
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,230
like where i've thought about them and
use them is to actually

1712
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240
use them is to actually
 

1713
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,660
use them is to actually
um

1714
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:04,670
um
 

1715
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,630
um
[Music]

1716
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,640
[Music]
 

1717
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,350
[Music]
let's say poke at sort of the current

1718
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,360
let's say poke at sort of the current
 

1719
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,870
let's say poke at sort of the current
conceptual framework that we have and

1720
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
conceptual framework that we have and
 

1721
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,549
conceptual framework that we have and
see where the flaws are

1722
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
see where the flaws are
 

1723
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,789
see where the flaws are
um so i think like the part that you're

1724
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:14,799
um so i think like the part that you're
 

1725
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,149
um so i think like the part that you're
talking about that people find

1726
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:16,159
talking about that people find
 

1727
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,830
talking about that people find
intriguing is that if you have like a

1728
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
intriguing is that if you have like a
 

1729
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,590
intriguing is that if you have like a
fairly simple rule

1730
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,600
fairly simple rule
 

1731
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,510
fairly simple rule
and you specify some initial condition

1732
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,520
and you specify some initial condition
 

1733
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,950
and you specify some initial condition
and you run that rule and that initial

1734
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
and you run that rule and that initial
 

1735
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,950
and you run that rule and that initial
condition you could get really complex

1736
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
condition you could get really complex
 

1737
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,350
condition you could get really complex
patterns emerging and ooh doesn't that

1738
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
patterns emerging and ooh doesn't that
 

1739
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,590
patterns emerging and ooh doesn't that
look lifelike um

1740
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:29,600
look lifelike um
 

1741
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,950
look lifelike um
yeah

1742
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
yeah
 

1743
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,310
yeah
well it's like really surprising isn't

1744
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
well it's like really surprising isn't
 

1745
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,909
well it's like really surprising isn't
it it is really surprising and they're

1746
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
it it is really surprising and they're
 

1747
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,789
it it is really surprising and they're
beautiful um and i i think they have a

1748
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:36,799
beautiful um and i i think they have a
 

1749
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,269
beautiful um and i i think they have a
lot of nice features associated to them

1750
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
lot of nice features associated to them
 

1751
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,549
lot of nice features associated to them
um i think the things that i find yeah

1752
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
um i think the things that i find yeah
 

1753
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,669
um i think the things that i find yeah
so so i i do think um as a proof of

1754
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:45,679
so so i i do think um as a proof of
 

1755
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,350
so so i i do think um as a proof of
principle that you can get complex

1756
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
principle that you can get complex
 

1757
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,950
principle that you can get complex
things emerging from simple rules

1758
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
things emerging from simple rules
 

1759
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,990
things emerging from simple rules
they're great

1760
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
they're great
 

1761
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,950
they're great
um as a sort of proof of principle about

1762
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
um as a sort of proof of principle about
 

1763
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,590
um as a sort of proof of principle about
some of the ways that we might think of

1764
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
some of the ways that we might think of
 

1765
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,830
some of the ways that we might think of
computation as being sort of a

1766
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:57,840
computation as being sort of a
 

1767
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,149
computation as being sort of a
fundamental principle for dynamical

1768
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
fundamental principle for dynamical
 

1769
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,909
fundamental principle for dynamical
systems and maybe the the evolution of

1770
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
systems and maybe the the evolution of
 

1771
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,070
systems and maybe the the evolution of
the universe as a whole they're a great

1772
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
the universe as a whole they're a great
 

1773
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,590
the universe as a whole they're a great

as an explanatory framework for life i

1776
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
as an explanatory framework for life i
 

1777
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,029
as an explanatory framework for life i
think

1778
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:09,039
think
 

1779
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,350
think
they're a bit problematic for the same

1780
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
they're a bit problematic for the same
 

1781
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,029
they're a bit problematic for the same
reason that

1782
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
reason that
 

1783
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,470
reason that
the laws of physics are a bit

1784
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
the laws of physics are a bit
 

1785
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,909
the laws of physics are a bit
problematic um and the clearest way i

1786
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
problematic um and the clearest way i
 

1787
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,549
problematic um and the clearest way i
can articulate that is like cellular

1788
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:20,559
can articulate that is like cellular
 

1789
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,510
can articulate that is like cellular
automata are actually cast in sort of a

1790
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,520
automata are actually cast in sort of a
 

1791
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,350
automata are actually cast in sort of a
conceptual framework for how the

1792
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
conceptual framework for how the
 

1793
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,789
conceptual framework for how the
universe should be described that goes

1794
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
universe should be described that goes
 

1795
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,909
universe should be described that goes
all the way back

1796
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
all the way back
 

1797
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,269
all the way back
to newton in fact with this idea that we

1798
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
to newton in fact with this idea that we
 

1799
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,590
to newton in fact with this idea that we
can have a fixed law of motion

1800
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600
can have a fixed law of motion
 

1801
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,110
can have a fixed law of motion
which exists sort of it's given to you

1802
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
which exists sort of it's given to you
 

1803
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,710
which exists sort of it's given to you
you know the great programmer in the sky

1804
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:38,720
you know the great programmer in the sky
 

1805
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,389
you know the great programmer in the sky
gave you this equation

1806
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
gave you this equation
 

1807
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,470
gave you this equation
or this rule and then you just run with

1808
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,480
or this rule and then you just run with
 

1809
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,269
or this rule and then you just run with
it um and the rule doesn't have so a

1810
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
it um and the rule doesn't have so a
 

1811
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,190
it um and the rule doesn't have so a
good feature of the rule is it doesn't

1812
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,200
good feature of the rule is it doesn't
 

1813
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,669
good feature of the rule is it doesn't
have specified in the rule information

1814
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
have specified in the rule information
 

1815
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,750
have specified in the rule information
about the patterns it generates so you

1816
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
about the patterns it generates so you
 

1817
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,389
about the patterns it generates so you
wouldn't want for example the my cup or

1818
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
wouldn't want for example the my cup or
 

1819
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,549
wouldn't want for example the my cup or
my water bottle or you know me sitting

1820
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:56,559
my water bottle or you know me sitting
 

1821
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,149
my water bottle or you know me sitting
here to be specified in the laws of

1822
00:29:58,149 --> 00:29:58,159
here to be specified in the laws of
 

1823
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,430
here to be specified in the laws of
physics that would be ridiculous because

1824
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
physics that would be ridiculous because
 

1825
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,029
physics that would be ridiculous because
it wouldn't be a very simple explanation

1826
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
it wouldn't be a very simple explanation
 

1827
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,230
it wouldn't be a very simple explanation
of all things happening i'd have to

1828
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,240
of all things happening i'd have to
 

1829
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,590
of all things happening i'd have to
explain everything

1830
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
explain everything
 

1831
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,029
explain everything
so and tell your time to have that

1832
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
so and tell your time to have that
 

1833
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,470
so and tell your time to have that
feature

1834
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
feature
 

1835
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,590
feature
and the laws of physics have that

1836
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:07,600
and the laws of physics have that
 

1837
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,630
and the laws of physics have that
feature

1838
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:08,640
feature
 

1839
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,190
feature
um but but you know you also need to

1840
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
um but but you know you also need to
 

1841
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,750
um but but you know you also need to
specify the initial condition um and it

1842
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:13,760
specify the initial condition um and it
 

1843
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,149
specify the initial condition um and it
also it basically means that everything

1844
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:16,159
also it basically means that everything
 

1845
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,470
also it basically means that everything
that happens is sort of a consequence of

1846
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
that happens is sort of a consequence of
 

1847
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,789
that happens is sort of a consequence of
that initial condition and i think this

1848
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:20,799
that initial condition and i think this
 

1849
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,190
that initial condition and i think this
kind of framework is just not the right

1850
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,200
kind of framework is just not the right
 

1851
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,549
kind of framework is just not the right
one for biology um and part of the way

1852
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:26,559
one for biology um and part of the way
 

1853
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,110
one for biology um and part of the way
that it's easiest to see this is

1854
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
that it's easiest to see this is
 

1855
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,870
that it's easiest to see this is
um a lot of people talk about

1856
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
um a lot of people talk about
 

1857
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,350
um a lot of people talk about
self-reference being important in life

1858
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,360
self-reference being important in life
 

1859
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,830
self-reference being important in life
the fact that um you know like the

1860
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:35,840
the fact that um you know like the
 

1861
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,110
the fact that um you know like the
genome has information encoded in it

1862
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
genome has information encoded in it
 

1863
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,269
genome has information encoded in it
that information gets read out

1864
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
that information gets read out
 

1865
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,110
that information gets read out
um it specifies something about the

1866
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
um it specifies something about the
 

1867
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,029
um it specifies something about the
architecture of a cell

1868
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:45,039
architecture of a cell
 

1869
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,470
architecture of a cell
the architecture of the cell includes

1870
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
the architecture of the cell includes
 

1871
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,070
the architecture of the cell includes
the genome so the genome has basically

1872
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,080
the genome so the genome has basically
 

1873
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,750
the genome so the genome has basically
self-referential information

1874
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
self-referential information
 

1875
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,149
self-referential information
self-reference obviously comes up in

1876
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:52,159
self-reference obviously comes up in
 

1877
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,510
self-reference obviously comes up in
computational law because it's kind of

1878
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520
computational law because it's kind of
 

1879
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,950
computational law because it's kind of
foundational um to turing's work and

1880
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960
foundational um to turing's work and
 

1881
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,549
foundational um to turing's work and
what girdle did with the incompleteness

1882
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:58,559
what girdle did with the incompleteness
 

1883
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,350
what girdle did with the incompleteness
theorems and things so there's a lot of

1884
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,360
theorems and things so there's a lot of
 

1885
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,269
theorems and things so there's a lot of
parallels there and and people have

1886
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279
parallels there and and people have
 

1887
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,590
parallels there and and people have
talked about that at depth um but the

1888
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:05,600
talked about that at depth um but the
 

1889
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,710
talked about that at depth um but the
other way of kind of thinking about it

1890
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
other way of kind of thinking about it
 

1891
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,789
other way of kind of thinking about it
in terms of like a more physics-y way of

1892
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:08,799
in terms of like a more physics-y way of
 

1893
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,149
in terms of like a more physics-y way of
talking about it

1894
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
talking about it
 

1895
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,470
talking about it
is that what it looks like in biology is

1896
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,480
is that what it looks like in biology is
 

1897
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,190
is that what it looks like in biology is
that the rules or the laws depend on the

1898
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
that the rules or the laws depend on the
 

1899
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,950
that the rules or the laws depend on the
state this is typical in computer

1900
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:16,960
state this is typical in computer
 

1901
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,789
state this is typical in computer
science this is obvious to you you know

1902
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:18,799
science this is obvious to you you know
 

1903
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,230
science this is obvious to you you know
the update rule depends on the state of

1904
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,240
the update rule depends on the state of
 

1905
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,669
the update rule depends on the state of
the machine right but and you know you

1906
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:21,679
the machine right but and you know you
 

1907
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,590
the machine right but and you know you
don't think about um

1908
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
don't think about um
 

1909
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,750
don't think about um
uh you know that being sort of the

1910
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:25,760
uh you know that being sort of the
 

1911
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,070
uh you know that being sort of the
dynamic and physics it's you know the

1912
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
dynamic and physics it's you know the
 

1913
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,669
dynamic and physics it's you know the
rules given to you and then it you know

1914
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:29,679
rules given to you and then it you know
 

1915
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,830
rules given to you and then it you know
it's a it's a very special subclass say

1916
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:31,840
it's a it's a very special subclass say
 

1917
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,430
it's a it's a very special subclass say
of computations if

1918
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
of computations if
 

1919
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,190
of computations if
you know you don't ever change the

1920
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,200
you know you don't ever change the
 

1921
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,669
you know you don't ever change the
update um but in biology it seems to be

1922
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
update um but in biology it seems to be
 

1923
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,590
update um but in biology it seems to be
that the state and the law change

1924
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:39,600
that the state and the law change
 

1925
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,190
that the state and the law change
together as a function of time and we

1926
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,200
together as a function of time and we
 

1927
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,070
together as a function of time and we
don't have that as a paradigm in physics

1928
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,080
don't have that as a paradigm in physics
 

1929
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,509
don't have that as a paradigm in physics
and so a lot of people talked about this

1930
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:45,519
and so a lot of people talked about this
 

1931
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,590
and so a lot of people talked about this
as being kind of a perplexing feature

1932
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,600
as being kind of a perplexing feature
 

1933
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,669
as being kind of a perplexing feature
that maybe there are certain scenarios

1934
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:49,679
that maybe there are certain scenarios
 

1935
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,590
that maybe there are certain scenarios
where the laws of physics or the laws

1936
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
where the laws of physics or the laws
 

1937
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,070
where the laws of physics or the laws
that govern a particular system actually

1938
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,080
that govern a particular system actually
 

1939
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,590
that govern a particular system actually
change as a function of state of that

1940
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:55,600
change as a function of state of that
 

1941
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,310
change as a function of state of that
system that's trippy so yeah the the

1942
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,320
system that's trippy so yeah the the
 

1943
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,830
system that's trippy so yeah the the
hope of physics it's a hope i guess but

1944
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840
hope of physics it's a hope i guess but
 

1945
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,149
hope of physics it's a hope i guess but
often stated as a

1946
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:04,159
often stated as a
 

1947
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,029
often stated as a
underlying assumption is that the law

1948
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,039
underlying assumption is that the law
 

1949
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,070
underlying assumption is that the law
is uh static right

1950
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
is uh static right
 

1951
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,070
is uh static right
okay and even having laws that vary in

1952
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,080
okay and even having laws that vary in
 

1953
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,830
okay and even having laws that vary in
time and not even as a function of the

1954
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:13,840
time and not even as a function of the
 

1955
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,230
time and not even as a function of the
state is very radical

1956
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
state is very radical
 

1957
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,710
state is very radical
when you the time in general like yeah

1958
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
when you the time in general like yeah
 

1959
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,230
when you the time in general like yeah
you want to remove time from the

1960
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,240
you want to remove time from the
 

1961
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,509
you want to remove time from the
equation as much as possible yeah i i do

1962
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519
equation as much as possible yeah i i do
 

1963
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,269
equation as much as possible yeah i i do
um there's some interesting things in

1964
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:25,279
um there's some interesting things in
 

1965
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,110
um there's some interesting things in
this like when we think it's sort of

1966
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,120
this like when we think it's sort of
 

1967
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,630
this like when we think it's sort of
deep more deeply about the actual

1968
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
deep more deeply about the actual
 

1969
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,909
deep more deeply about the actual
physics that we're trying to propose

1970
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:29,919
physics that we're trying to propose
 

1971
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,990
physics that we're trying to propose
governs life um with me with

1972
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,000
governs life um with me with
 

1973
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,590
governs life um with me with
collaborators and then also other people

1974
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
collaborators and then also other people
 

1975
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,269
collaborators and then also other people
that think about similar things that

1976
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:35,279
that think about similar things that
 

1977
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,789
that think about similar things that
time might actually be fundamental and

1978
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:36,799
time might actually be fundamental and
 

1979
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,870
time might actually be fundamental and
there really is an ordering to time

1980
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:38,880
there really is an ordering to time
 

1981
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,630
there really is an ordering to time
um and that events in the universe are

1982
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640
um and that events in the universe are
 

1983
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,549
um and that events in the universe are
unique because they have a particular

1984
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
unique because they have a particular
 

1985
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,630
unique because they have a particular
you know they they happen like an object

1986
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,640
you know they they happen like an object
 

1987
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,070
you know they they happen like an object
in the universe requires a certain

1988
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,080
in the universe requires a certain
 

1989
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,149
in the universe requires a certain
history of events in order to exist

1990
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
history of events in order to exist
 

1991
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,590
history of events in order to exist
which therefore suggests that time

1992
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,600
which therefore suggests that time
 

1993
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,710
which therefore suggests that time
really does have an ordering i'm not

1994
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:50,720
really does have an ordering i'm not
 

1995
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,750
really does have an ordering i'm not
talking about the flow of time and our

1996
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
talking about the flow of time and our
 

1997
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,269
talking about the flow of time and our
perception of time just the ordering of

1998
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:53,279
perception of time just the ordering of
 

1999
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,430
perception of time just the ordering of
events causation yes causation there's

2000
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,440
events causation yes causation there's
 

2001
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,630
events causation yes causation there's
that word again

2002
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:56,640
that word again
 

2003
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,549
that word again
so causation that's when you say time

2004
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
so causation that's when you say time
 

2005
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,710
so causation that's when you say time
you mean causation yes

2006
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:00,720
you mean causation yes
 

2007
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,669
you mean causation yes
in your proposed model

2008
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:03,679
in your proposed model
 

2009
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,070
in your proposed model
of the physics of life the the

2010
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,080
of the physics of life the the
 

2011
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,310
of the physics of life the the
fundamental thing would be causation if

2012
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
fundamental thing would be causation if
 

2013
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,310
fundamental thing would be causation if
you were to bet your money on on one

2014
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,320
you were to bet your money on on one
 

2015
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,269
you were to bet your money on on one
particular horse or whatever yes and

2016
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
particular horse or whatever yes and
 

2017
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,430
particular horse or whatever yes and
then space is emergent

2018
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,440
then space is emergent
 

2019
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,110
then space is emergent
yes so everything's emergent except time

2020
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
yes so everything's emergent except time
 

2021
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,669
yes so everything's emergent except time
kind of yeah or causation

2022
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:21,679
kind of yeah or causation
 

2023
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,350
kind of yeah or causation
change all the time why it look like

2024
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
change all the time why it look like
 

2025
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,549
change all the time why it look like
laws are the same laws well because uh

2026
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:26,559
laws are the same laws well because uh
 

2027
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,110
laws are the same laws well because uh
well one way um and i actually this idea

2028
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
well one way um and i actually this idea
 

2029
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,230
well one way um and i actually this idea
comes from lee cronin because i work

2030
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240
comes from lee cronin because i work
 

2031
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,909
comes from lee cronin because i work
with him very closely on these things is

2032
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:31,919
with him very closely on these things is
 

2033
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,350
with him very closely on these things is
that the laws of physics look the way

2034
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
that the laws of physics look the way
 

2035
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,350
that the laws of physics look the way
they do because they're low memory laws

2036
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,360
they do because they're low memory laws
 

2037
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,549
they do because they're low memory laws
so they don't require a lot of

2038
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:36,559
so they don't require a lot of
 

2039
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,070
so they don't require a lot of
information to specify them they're very

2040
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,080
information to specify them they're very
 

2041
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,669
information to specify them they're very
easy for the universe to implement but

2042
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
easy for the universe to implement but
 

2043
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,909
easy for the universe to implement but
if you get something like me for example

2044
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
if you get something like me for example
 

2045
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,590
if you get something like me for example
i require 4 billion year history to

2046
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600
i require 4 billion year history to
 

2047
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,029
i require 4 billion year history to
exist in the universe i come with a lot

2048
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:45,039
exist in the universe i come with a lot
 

2049
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,950
exist in the universe i come with a lot
of historical baggage

2050
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
of historical baggage
 

2051
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,789
of historical baggage
and that's part of what i am as a set of

2052
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:48,799
and that's part of what i am as a set of
 

2053
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,549
and that's part of what i am as a set of
causes that exist in the universe

2054
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
causes that exist in the universe
 

2055
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,029
causes that exist in the universe
so i have local rules that apply to me

2056
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
so i have local rules that apply to me
 

2057
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,470
so i have local rules that apply to me
that are associated with sort of the

2058
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
that are associated with sort of the
 

2059
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,149
that are associated with sort of the
information in my history

2060
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:58,159
information in my history
 

2061
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,830
information in my history
that aren't universal to every object in

2062
00:33:59,830 --> 00:33:59,840
that aren't universal to every object in
 

2063
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,269
that aren't universal to every object in
the universe

2064
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
the universe
 

2065
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,789
the universe
and there are some things that are very

2066
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:02,799
and there are some things that are very
 

2067
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,190
and there are some things that are very
easily easy to implement low memory

2068
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,200
easily easy to implement low memory
 

2069
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,870
easily easy to implement low memory
rules that apply to everything in the

2070
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:06,880
rules that apply to everything in the
 

2071
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,629
rules that apply to everything in the
universe

2072
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
universe
 

2073
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,510
universe
so there's no shortcuts to you no i so

2074
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
so there's no shortcuts to you no i so
 

2075
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,710
so there's no shortcuts to you no i so
yeah i don't believe in like things like

2076
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,720
yeah i don't believe in like things like
 

2077
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,230
yeah i don't believe in like things like
boltzmann brains or

2078
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,240
boltzmann brains or
 

2079
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,230
boltzmann brains or
uh you know fluctuations out of the

2080
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
uh you know fluctuations out of the
 

2081
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,550
uh you know fluctuations out of the
vacuum that can produce things like your

2082
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:18,560
vacuum that can produce things like your
 

2083
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,349
vacuum that can produce things like your
desk ornaments

2084
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359
desk ornaments
 

2085
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,430
desk ornaments
i actually think they require a

2086
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
i actually think they require a
 

2087
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,950
i actually think they require a
particular causal chain of events to

2088
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:24,960
particular causal chain of events to
 

2089
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,389
particular causal chain of events to
exist

2090
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
exist
 

2091
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,230
exist
well i appreciate the togetherness of

2092
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,240
well i appreciate the togetherness of
 

2093
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,950
well i appreciate the togetherness of
that but uh so how does that

2094
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
that but uh so how does that
 

2095
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,829
that but uh so how does that
if we have to simulate the entire

2096
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:32,839
if we have to simulate the entire
 

2097
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,669
if we have to simulate the entire
universe to create the ornaments and the

2098
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:35,679
universe to create the ornaments and the
 

2099
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,030
universe to create the ornaments and the
two of us

2100
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,040
two of us
 

2101
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,589
two of us
how are we supposed to create

2102
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:39,599
how are we supposed to create
 

2103
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,710
how are we supposed to create
engineer life yeah that's not

2104
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720
engineer life yeah that's not
 

2105
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,550
engineer life yeah that's not
this goes back to sort of the critique

2106
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
this goes back to sort of the critique
 

2107
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,069
this goes back to sort of the critique
of the rna world i think one of the

2108
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
of the rna world i think one of the
 

2109
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,990
of the rna world i think one of the
problems and i'll get to answering your

2110
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
problems and i'll get to answering your
 

2111
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,190
problems and i'll get to answering your
question but i think this is kind of

2112
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
question but i think this is kind of
 

2113
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,790
question but i think this is kind of
relevant here one of the problems with

2114
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:50,800
relevant here one of the problems with
 

2115
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,710
relevant here one of the problems with
the rna world

2116
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:52,720
the rna world
 

2117
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,389
the rna world
when we test it in the laboratory is how

2118
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:54,399
when we test it in the laboratory is how
 

2119
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,909
when we test it in the laboratory is how
much information we're putting into the

2120
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:55,919
much information we're putting into the
 

2121
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,190
much information we're putting into the
experiment

2122
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,200
experiment
 

2123
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,030
experiment
we specify the flasks we make pure

2124
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
we specify the flasks we make pure
 

2125
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,910
we specify the flasks we make pure
reagents we mix them we take them out we

2126
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920
reagents we mix them we take them out we
 

2127
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,910
reagents we mix them we take them out we
put them in the next flask we change the

2128
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:03,920
put them in the next flask we change the
 

2129
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,990
put them in the next flask we change the
ph we change the uv light and then we

2130
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
ph we change the uv light and then we
 

2131
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,069
ph we change the uv light and then we
get a molecule and it's not even an rna

2132
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
get a molecule and it's not even an rna
 

2133
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,510
get a molecule and it's not even an rna
molecule necessarily it might just be a

2134
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
molecule necessarily it might just be a
 

2135
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,470
molecule necessarily it might just be a
base right um and so

2136
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
base right um and so
 

2137
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,310
base right um and so
people don't usually think about the

2138
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,320
people don't usually think about the
 

2139
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,550
people don't usually think about the
fact that we're agents in the universe

2140
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:16,560
fact that we're agents in the universe
 

2141
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,470
fact that we're agents in the universe
making that experiment and therefore we

2142
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,480
making that experiment and therefore we
 

2143
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,750
making that experiment and therefore we
put a little bit of life into that

2144
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:19,760
put a little bit of life into that
 

2145
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,870
put a little bit of life into that
experiment

2146
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:20,880
experiment
 

2147
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,750
experiment
um

2148
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
um
 

2149
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,030
um
because it's part of our biological

2150
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
because it's part of our biological
 

2151
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,870
because it's part of our biological
lineage in the same sense that a couple

2152
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
lineage in the same sense that a couple
 

2153
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,710
lineage in the same sense that a couple
or i am a part of the biological lineage

2154
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:26,720
or i am a part of the biological lineage
 

2155
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,630
or i am a part of the biological lineage
the experimental ideas

2156
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
the experimental ideas
 

2157
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,670
the experimental ideas
are

2158
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
are
 

2159
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,829
are
injecting life yes

2160
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:31,839
injecting life yes
 

2161
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,190
injecting life yes
and the constraints that we put on the

2162
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,200
and the constraints that we put on the
 

2163
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,870
and the constraints that we put on the
experiments because those conditions

2164
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,880
experiments because those conditions
 

2165
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,109
experiments because those conditions
wouldn't exist in the universe on planet

2166
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
wouldn't exist in the universe on planet
 

2167
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,270
wouldn't exist in the universe on planet
earth at that time without us as the

2168
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,280
earth at that time without us as the
 

2169
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,270
earth at that time without us as the
boundary condition right so

2170
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:41,280
boundary condition right so
 

2171
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,710
boundary condition right so
even though we're not actually adding

2172
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:42,720
even though we're not actually adding
 

2173
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,030
even though we're not actually adding
any actual like chemistry or biology

2174
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,040
any actual like chemistry or biology
 

2175
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,589
any actual like chemistry or biology
that it could be identified as life

2176
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:47,599
that it could be identified as life
 

2177
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,270
that it could be identified as life
are the constraints we're adding to the

2178
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
are the constraints we're adding to the
 

2179
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,109
are the constraints we're adding to the
experiment the design of the experiment

2180
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
experiment the design of the experiment
 

2181
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,069
experiment the design of the experiment
yeah you can think of a design

2182
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
yeah you can think of a design
 

2183
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,270
yeah you can think of a design
experiment as a program you put

2184
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,280
experiment as a program you put
 

2185
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,270
experiment as a program you put
information in it's an algorithmic

2186
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,280
information in it's an algorithmic
 

2187
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,109
information in it's an algorithmic
procedure that you design the experiment

2188
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
procedure that you design the experiment
 

2189
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,829
procedure that you design the experiment
and so um so the original life problem

2190
00:35:59,829 --> 00:35:59,839
and so um so the original life problem
 

2191
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,150
and so um so the original life problem
becomes one of minimizing the

2192
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,160
becomes one of minimizing the
 

2193
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,790
becomes one of minimizing the
information we put into physics

2194
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:04,800
information we put into physics
 

2195
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,470
information we put into physics
to actually watch the spontaneous

2196
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480
to actually watch the spontaneous
 

2197
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,470
to actually watch the spontaneous
original life can we can we have so can

2198
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:08,480
original life can we can we have so can
 

2199
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,230
original life can we can we have so can
is it possible in the lab to have an

2200
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,240
is it possible in the lab to have an
 

2201
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,870
is it possible in the lab to have an
information vacuum then so like if we

2202
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
information vacuum then so like if we
 

2203
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,950
information vacuum then so like if we
could we would that would be amazing i

2204
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:14,960
could we would that would be amazing i
 

2205
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,550
could we would that would be amazing i
don't know that's a good question for

2206
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560
don't know that's a good question for
 

2207
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,550
don't know that's a good question for
more for lee yeah you guys by the way

2208
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:18,560
more for lee yeah you guys by the way
 

2209
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,390
more for lee yeah you guys by the way
for people who don't know lee cronin is

2210
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
for people who don't know lee cronin is
 

2211
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,109
for people who don't know lee cronin is
uh

2212
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:21,119
uh
 

2213
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,390
uh
you guys are uh colleagues and uh

you guys are uh colleagues and uh
 

2215
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,829
you guys are uh colleagues and uh
i've gotten a chance to listen to the

2216
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
i've gotten a chance to listen to the
 

2217
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,670
i've gotten a chance to listen to the
two of you talking there's great sort of

2218
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:27,680
two of you talking there's great sort of
 

2219
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,950
two of you talking there's great sort of
chemistry and you're brilliant

2220
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:28,960
chemistry and you're brilliant
 

2221
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,030
chemistry and you're brilliant
brainstorming together and there's

2222
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,040
brainstorming together and there's
 

2223
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,109
brainstorming together and there's
there's a really exciting

2224
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
there's a really exciting
 

2225
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,349
there's a really exciting
community here of of brilliant people

00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
community here of of brilliant people
 

2227
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,270
community here of of brilliant people
from different disciplines working on

2228
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:37,280
from different disciplines working on
 

2229
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,670
from different disciplines working on
the problem yeah of life of complexity

2230
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:39,680
the problem yeah of life of complexity
 

2231
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,870
the problem yeah of life of complexity
of uh

2232
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:40,880
of uh
 

2233
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,310
of uh
i don't know whatever

2234
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:42,320
i don't know whatever
 

2235
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,790
i don't know whatever
the words fail us to describe the exact

2236
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,800
the words fail us to describe the exact
 

2237
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,550
the words fail us to describe the exact
problem we're trying to actually

2238
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:46,560
problem we're trying to actually
 

2239
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,230
problem we're trying to actually
understand here intelligence all those

2240
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
understand here intelligence all those
 

2241
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,069
understand here intelligence all those
kinds of things

2242
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:50,079
kinds of things
 

2243
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,670
kinds of things
okay so

2244
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
okay so
 

2245
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,349
okay so
what what uh

2246
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,359
what what uh
 

2247
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,069
what what uh
from a lab perspective so lee i guess

2248
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:56,079
from a lab perspective so lee i guess
 

2249
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,630
from a lab perspective so lee i guess
would you call him a chemist no i think

2250
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:58,640
would you call him a chemist no i think
 

2251
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,390
would you call him a chemist no i think
by training he's a chemist but i think

2252
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,400
by training he's a chemist but i think
 

2253
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,349
by training he's a chemist but i think
most of the people that work in the

2254
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:01,359
most of the people that work in the
 

2255
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,470
most of the people that work in the
field we do have lost their discipline

2256
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:04,480
field we do have lost their discipline
 

2257
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,510
field we do have lost their discipline
that's why i couldn't answer your

2258
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,520
that's why i couldn't answer your
 

2259
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,790
that's why i couldn't answer your
question

2260
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:06,800
question
 

2261
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,310
question
okay i don't know what you call them

2262
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:08,320
okay i don't know what you call them
 

2263
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,750
okay i don't know what you call them
yeah i don't know what i call myself i

2264
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:09,760
yeah i don't know what i call myself i
 

2265
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,829
yeah i don't know what i call myself i
don't know what i call any of my friends

2266
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:11,839
don't know what i call any of my friends
 

2267
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,510
don't know what i call any of my friends
so why why is it so hard to create uh

2268
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:15,520
so why why is it so hard to create uh
 

2269
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,870
so why why is it so hard to create uh
and it's an interesting question to

2270
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:16,880
and it's an interesting question to
 

2271
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,270
and it's an interesting question to
create biological life in the lab

2272
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,280
create biological life in the lab
 

2273
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,750
create biological life in the lab
like from your perspective

2274
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:21,760
like from your perspective
 

2275
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,910
like from your perspective
is that an important problem to work on

2276
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,920
is that an important problem to work on
 

2277
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,589
is that an important problem to work on
to try to recreate the historical origin

2278
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:27,599
to try to recreate the historical origin
 

2279
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,990
to try to recreate the historical origin
of life on earth or echoes of the

2280
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
of life on earth or echoes of the
 

2281
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,069
of life on earth or echoes of the
historical origin i think echoes is more

2282
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:32,079
historical origin i think echoes is more
 

2283
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,230
historical origin i think echoes is more
appropriate i don't think asking the

2284
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,240
appropriate i don't think asking the
 

2285
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,150
appropriate i don't think asking the
question of what was the exact

2286
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,160
question of what was the exact
 

2287
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,829
question of what was the exact
historical sequence of events and

2288
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
historical sequence of events and
 

2289
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,550
historical sequence of events and
engineering every step in the process to

2290
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,560
engineering every step in the process to
 

2291
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,630
engineering every step in the process to
make exactly the chemistry of life on

2292
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
make exactly the chemistry of life on
 

2293
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,870
make exactly the chemistry of life on
earth as we know it is a meaningful way

2294
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880
earth as we know it is a meaningful way
 

2295
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,870
earth as we know it is a meaningful way
of asking the question and it's a little

2296
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:46,880
of asking the question and it's a little
 

2297
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,910
of asking the question and it's a little
bit like

2298
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
bit like
 

2299
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,589
bit like
um you know if

2300
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:49,599
um you know if
 

2301
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,109
um you know if
since you're in computer science like if

2302
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:51,119
since you're in computer science like if
 

2303
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,190
since you're in computer science like if
you know the answer to a problem it's

2304
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,200
you know the answer to a problem it's
 

2305
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,790
you know the answer to a problem it's
all it's easier to find a program to

2306
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800
all it's easier to find a program to
 

2307
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,230
all it's easier to find a program to
specify the output right but if you

2308
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,240
specify the output right but if you
 

2309
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,069
specify the output right but if you
don't know the answer or priority you

don't know the answer or priority you
 

2311
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,990
don't know the answer or priority you
know finding an algorithm for like say

finding a prime or something it's easy
 

2315
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,109
finding a prime or something it's easy
to um you know

2316
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
to um you know
 

2317
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,349
to um you know
uh verify it's a prime number it's hard

2318
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
uh verify it's a prime number it's hard
 

2319
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,030
uh verify it's a prime number it's hard
to find the next prime um and uh

2320
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
to find the next prime um and uh
 

2321
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,550
to find the next prime um and uh
the way the original life is structured

2322
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,560
the way the original life is structured
 

2323
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,950
the way the original life is structured
right now in the historical problem is

2324
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:12,960
right now in the historical problem is
 

2325
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,710
right now in the historical problem is
you know the answer and you're trying to

2326
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:14,720
you know the answer and you're trying to
 

2327
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,550
you know the answer and you're trying to
retrodict it by breaking it down into

2328
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:16,560
retrodict it by breaking it down into
 

2329
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,670
retrodict it by breaking it down into
the set of procedures where you're

2330
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:17,680
the set of procedures where you're
 

2331
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,670
the set of procedures where you're
putting a lot of information in and what

2332
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:19,680
putting a lot of information in and what
 

2333
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,470
putting a lot of information in and what
we need to do is ask the question of

2334
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,480
we need to do is ask the question of
 

2335
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,670
we need to do is ask the question of
how is it

2336
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:23,680
how is it
 

2337
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,510
how is it
that the rules of how our universe is

2338
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:25,520
that the rules of how our universe is
 

2339
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,589
that the rules of how our universe is
structured permits things like life to

2340
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:27,599
structured permits things like life to
 

2341
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,670
structured permits things like life to
exist and what is the phenomena of life

2342
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:29,680
exist and what is the phenomena of life
 

2343
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,270
exist and what is the phenomena of life
and those questions are obviously

2344
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,280
and those questions are obviously
 

2345
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,589
and those questions are obviously
essentially the same question and so

2346
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
essentially the same question and so
 

2347
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,150
essentially the same question and so
you're looking essentially for this

2348
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
you're looking essentially for this
 

2349

um
that we we have working in this area

that we we have working in this area
um that this you know sort of i made the

00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:17,440
um that this you know sort of i made the
 

2395
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,630
um that this you know sort of i made the
point about like gravity existing

point about like gravity existing
 

2397
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,109
point about like gravity existing
everywhere right but when you study um

2398
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
everywhere right but when you study um
 

2399
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,870
everywhere right but when you study um
an atomic nucleus you don't care about

2400
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:22,880
an atomic nucleus you don't care about
 

2401
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,550
an atomic nucleus you don't care about
gravity it's not relevant physics there

2402
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
gravity it's not relevant physics there
 

2403
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,589
gravity it's not relevant physics there
right it's it's weak it doesn't matter

2404
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599
right it's it's weak it doesn't matter
 

2405
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,190
right it's it's weak it doesn't matter
and so

2406
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,200
and so
 

2407
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,109
and so
this idea that that there's kind of a

2408
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
this idea that that there's kind of a
 

2409
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,670
this idea that that there's kind of a
physics associated with information

2410
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680
physics associated with information
 

2411
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,790
physics associated with information
for me

2412
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
for me
 

2413
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,990
for me
it's very

2414
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,000
it's very
 

2415
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,750
it's very
evident that that physics doesn't become

2416
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:37,760
evident that that physics doesn't become
 

2417
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,990
evident that that physics doesn't become
relevant until you need information to

2418
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,000
relevant until you need information to
 

2419
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,829
relevant until you need information to
specify the existence of a particular

2420
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:41,839
specify the existence of a particular
 

2421
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,150
specify the existence of a particular
object and the scale of reality where

2422
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,160
object and the scale of reality where
 

2423
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,230
object and the scale of reality where
that happens is in chemistry because of

2424
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,240
that happens is in chemistry because of
 

2425
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,270
that happens is in chemistry because of
the combinatorial diversity of chemical

2426
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:49,280
the combinatorial diversity of chemical
 

2427
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,990
the combinatorial diversity of chemical
objects that can exist far outs

2428
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,000
objects that can exist far outs
 

2429
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,910
objects that can exist far outs
exceeds the amount of resources in our

2430
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:53,920
exceeds the amount of resources in our
 

2431
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,589
exceeds the amount of resources in our
universe so if you want to you can't

2432
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:55,599
universe so if you want to you can't
 

2433
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,030
universe so if you want to you can't
make every possible protein of length um

2434
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,040
make every possible protein of length um
 

2435
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,630
make every possible protein of length um
you know 200 amino acids there's not

2436
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:00,640
you know 200 amino acids there's not
 

2437
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,589
you know 200 amino acids there's not
enough resources so in order for this

2438
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:03,599
enough resources so in order for this
 

2439
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,349
enough resources so in order for this
particular protein to exist and this

2440
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,359
particular protein to exist and this
 

2441
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,910
particular protein to exist and this
protein to exist in high abundance means

2442
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:07,920
protein to exist in high abundance means
 

2443
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,069
protein to exist in high abundance means
that you have to have a system that has

2444
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:10,079
that you have to have a system that has
 

2445
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,510
that you have to have a system that has
knowledge of the existence of that

2446
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,520
knowledge of the existence of that
 

2447
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,589
knowledge of the existence of that
protein and can build it so existence

2448
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:13,599
protein and can build it so existence
 

2449
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,829
protein and can build it so existence
comes to be at the chemical level so

2450
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
comes to be at the chemical level so
 

2451
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,430
comes to be at the chemical level so
existence is most

2452
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
existence is most
 

2453
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,230
existence is most
uh is uh best understood at the chemical

2454
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
uh is uh best understood at the chemical
 

2455
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,069
uh is uh best understood at the chemical
level it's most evident

2456
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:22,079
level it's most evident
 

2457
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,750
level it's most evident
it's a little bit like nobody argues

2458
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,760
it's a little bit like nobody argues
 

2459
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,349
it's a little bit like nobody argues
that gravity doesn't exist in an atomic

2460
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:25,359
that gravity doesn't exist in an atomic
 

2461
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,190
that gravity doesn't exist in an atomic
nucleus it's just not relevant physics

2462
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,200
nucleus it's just not relevant physics
 

2463
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,829
nucleus it's just not relevant physics
there so the physics of information

2464
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:29,839
there so the physics of information
 

2465
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,349
there so the physics of information
is everywhere it exists at every

2466
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:31,359
is everywhere it exists at every
 

2467
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,190
is everywhere it exists at every
combinatorial scale but it becomes more

2468
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,200
combinatorial scale but it becomes more
 

2469
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,630
combinatorial scale but it becomes more
and more relevant the more set of

2470
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:34,640
and more relevant the more set of
 

2471
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,630
and more relevant the more set of
possibilities that could exist

2472
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:36,640
possibilities that could exist
 

2473
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,390
possibilities that could exist
because you're you're you're you have to

2474
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
because you're you're you're you have to
 

2475
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,910
because you're you're you're you have to
specify more and more about why this

2476
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:39,920
specify more and more about why this
 

2477
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,910
specify more and more about why this
thing exists and not the infinite it's

2478
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
thing exists and not the infinite it's
 

2479
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,589
thing exists and not the infinite it's
not an infinite set but you know the set

2480
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:43,599
not an infinite set but you know the set
 

2481
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,190
not an infinite set but you know the set
of undefined set of other things that

2482
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
of undefined set of other things that
 

2483
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,150
of undefined set of other things that
could exist so can ask a weird

2484
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
could exist so can ask a weird
 

2485
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,470
could exist so can ask a weird
yeah question which is

2486
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,480
yeah question which is
 

2487
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,430
yeah question which is
so let's look into the future

2488
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
so let's look into the future
 

2489
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,150
so let's look into the future
i try that every day it never works

2490
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,160
i try that every day it never works
 

2491
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,069
i try that every day it never works
so say a nobel prize is given in physics

2492
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:00,079
so say a nobel prize is given in physics
 

2493
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,069
so say a nobel prize is given in physics
maybe chemistry

2494
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
maybe chemistry
 

2495
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,550
maybe chemistry
for discovering the origin of life

2496
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
for discovering the origin of life
 

2497
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,190
for discovering the origin of life
no not but not the historical origin

2498
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,200
no not but not the historical origin
 

2499
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,870
no not but not the historical origin
some kind of thing that we're talking

2500
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
some kind of thing that we're talking
 

2501
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,790
some kind of thing that we're talking
about

2502
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:12,800
about
 

2503
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,030
about
what exactly

2504
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,040
what exactly
 

2505
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,109
what exactly
would

2506
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
would
 

2507
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,510
would
what do you think

2508
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:19,520
what do you think
 

2509
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,390
what do you think
that like what do you think that person

2510
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,400
that like what do you think that person
 

2511
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,630
that like what do you think that person
maybe you did to get that nobel prize

2512
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
maybe you did to get that nobel prize
 

2513
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,150
maybe you did to get that nobel prize
like what would they have to have done

2514
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,160
like what would they have to have done
 

2515
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,109
like what would they have to have done
because you could do a bunch of

2516
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,119
because you could do a bunch of
 

2517
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,430
because you could do a bunch of
experiments that go like with an aha

2518
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,440
experiments that go like with an aha
 

2519
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,550
experiments that go like with an aha
moment

2520
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560
moment
 

2521
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,670
moment
like you rarely get the nobel prize

2522
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
like you rarely get the nobel prize
 

2523
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,910
like you rarely get the nobel prize
for like you've solved everything we're

2524
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:35,920
for like you've solved everything we're
 

2525
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,550
for like you've solved everything we're
done right it's like some inkling of

2526
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,560
done right it's like some inkling of
 

2527
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,670
done right it's like some inkling of
some deep truth right like what do you

2528
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:41,680
some deep truth right like what do you
 

2529
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,109
some deep truth right like what do you
think that would actually look like

2530
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:43,119
think that would actually look like
 

2531
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,910
think that would actually look like
would it be an experimental result

2532
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
would it be an experimental result
 

2533
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,990
would it be an experimental result
uh i mean it will have to have some kind

2534
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
uh i mean it will have to have some kind
 

2535
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,670
uh i mean it will have to have some kind
of experimental maybe validation

2536
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:49,680
of experimental maybe validation
 

2537
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,150
of experimental maybe validation
component so what would that look like

2538
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,160
component so what would that look like
 

2539
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,550
component so what would that look like
this is an excellent question

2540
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:54,560
this is an excellent question
 

2541
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,670
this is an excellent question
i want to

2542
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
i want to
 

2543
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,109
i want to
sorry i'm going to make a quick point

2544
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
sorry i'm going to make a quick point
 

2545
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,870
sorry i'm going to make a quick point
which is just a slight tangent but you

2546
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
which is just a slight tangent but you
 

2547
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,990
which is just a slight tangent but you
know like when people ask about the

2548
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
know like when people ask about the
 

2549
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,750
know like when people ask about the
origin of mass you know and like looking

2550
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:01,760
origin of mass you know and like looking
 

2551
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,270
origin of mass you know and like looking
for the higgs mechanism and things they

2552
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280
for the higgs mechanism and things they
 

2553
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,870
for the higgs mechanism and things they
never like we need to find the

2554
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:04,880
never like we need to find the
 

2555
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,630
never like we need to find the
historical origins of life in the early

2556
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,640
historical origins of life in the early
 

2557
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,069
historical origins of life in the early
unit although those things are related

2558
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
unit although those things are related
 

2559
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,630
unit although those things are related
right so um so this problem of origins

2560
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:10,640
right so um so this problem of origins
 

2561
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,069
right so um so this problem of origins
of life in the lab i think is really

2562
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:12,079
of life in the lab i think is really
 

2563
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,069
of life in the lab i think is really
important but the the higgs is a good

2564
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079
important but the the higgs is a good
 

2565
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,750
important but the the higgs is a good
example because you had theory to guide

2566
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:15,760
example because you had theory to guide
 

2567
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,670
example because you had theory to guide
it so somehow you need to have an

2568
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
it so somehow you need to have an
 

2569
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,470
it so somehow you need to have an
explanatory framework

2570
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
explanatory framework
 

2571
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,910
explanatory framework
that

2572
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:21,920
that
 

2573
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,589
that
can say that we should be looking for

2574
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
can say that we should be looking for
 

2575
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,910
can say that we should be looking for
these features

2576
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
these features
 

2577
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,829
these features
and explain why they might be there and

2578
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:27,839
and explain why they might be there and
 

2579
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,670
and explain why they might be there and
then be able to do the experiment and

2580
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:29,680
then be able to do the experiment and
 

2581
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,030
then be able to do the experiment and
demonstrate that it matches with the

2582
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,040
demonstrate that it matches with the
 

2583
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,109
demonstrate that it matches with the
theory but it has to be something

2584
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
theory but it has to be something
 

2585
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,270
theory but it has to be something
that is outside sort of the paradigm of

2586
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
that is outside sort of the paradigm of
 

2587
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,870
that is outside sort of the paradigm of
what we might expect based on what we

2588
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
what we might expect based on what we
 

2589
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,470
what we might expect based on what we
know right so this is a really sort of

2590
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,480
know right so this is a really sort of
 

2591
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,750
know right so this is a really sort of
tall order

2592
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:39,760
tall order
 

2593
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,510
tall order
um and

2594
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
um and
 

2595
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,309
um and
i think um

2596
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:44,319
i think um
 

2597
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:45,750
i think um
i mean i i guess the way people would

2598
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:45,760
i mean i i guess the way people would
 

2599
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,950
i mean i i guess the way people would
think about it is like you know if you

2600
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:46,960
think about it is like you know if you
 

2601
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,710
think about it is like you know if you
had a bacteria that climbed out of your

2602
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,720
had a bacteria that climbed out of your
 

2603
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,150
had a bacteria that climbed out of your
test tube or something and it was like

2604
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,160
test tube or something and it was like
 

2605
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,510
test tube or something and it was like
you know moving around on the surface

2606
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:51,520
you know moving around on the surface
 

2607
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,950
you know moving around on the surface
that would be ultimate validation you

2608
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:52,960
that would be ultimate validation you
 

2609
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,950
that would be ultimate validation you
saw the original life in an experiment

2610
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
saw the original life in an experiment
 

2611
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,069
saw the original life in an experiment
but i don't think that's quite what

2612
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
but i don't think that's quite what
 

2613
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,270
but i don't think that's quite what
we're looking for i think what what

2614
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
we're looking for i think what what
 

2615
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,829
we're looking for i think what what
we're looking for is evidence of when

2616
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:03,839
we're looking for is evidence of when
 

2617
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,950
we're looking for is evidence of when
information that originated within

2618
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:06,960
information that originated within
 

2619
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,470
information that originated within
the bounds of your experiment and you

2620
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:08,480
the bounds of your experiment and you
 

2621
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,950
the bounds of your experiment and you
can demonstratively prove emerge

2622
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:10,960
can demonstratively prove emerge
 

2623
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,950
can demonstratively prove emerge
spontaneously in your experiment wasn't

2624
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:12,960
spontaneously in your experiment wasn't
 

2625
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,550
spontaneously in your experiment wasn't
put in by you

2626
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:14,560

2627
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,109
put in by you
actually started to govern the future

2628
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:17,119
actually started to govern the future
 

2629
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,069
actually started to govern the future
dynamics of that system and specify it

2630
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:20,079
dynamics of that system and specify it
 

2631
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,470
dynamics of that system and specify it
and you could somehow relate those two

2632
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:22,480
and you could somehow relate those two
 

2633
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,309
and you could somehow relate those two
features directly so you know that the

2634
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:24,319
features directly so you know that the
 

2635
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,230
features directly so you know that the
program specifying

2636
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240
program specifying
 

2637
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,589
program specifying
what's happening in that system is

2638
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:27,599
what's happening in that system is
 

2639
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,750
what's happening in that system is
actually internal to that system like

2640
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:29,760
actually internal to that system like
 

2641
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,990
actually internal to that system like
say you have a chemical thing in a box

2642
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
say you have a chemical thing in a box
 

2643
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,030
say you have a chemical thing in a box
well

2644
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,040
well
 

2645
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,589
well
so that's that's one nobel prize with

2646
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:35,599
so that's that's one nobel prize with
 

2647
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,589
so that's that's one nobel prize with
the experiment which is like

2648
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:37,599
the experiment which is like
 

2649
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,829
the experiment which is like
information in some fundamental way

2650
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:39,839
information in some fundamental way
 

2651
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,270
information in some fundamental way
originated

2652
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
originated
 

2653
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,710
originated
within the constraints of the system

2654
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:42,720
within the constraints of the system
 

2655
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,710
within the constraints of the system
without you injecting anything but

2656
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:44,720
without you injecting anything but
 

2657
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,870
without you injecting anything but
another experiment is

2658
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:46,880
another experiment is
 

2659
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,069
another experiment is
you injected something yeah

2660
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:50,079
you injected something yeah
 

2661
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,190
you injected something yeah
and got out information yes so like you

2662
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:53,200
and got out information yes so like you
 

2663
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,870
and got out information yes so like you
injected

2664
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:54,880
injected
 

2665
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,870
injected
i don't know like uh

2666
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:56,880
i don't know like uh
 

2667
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,510
i don't know like uh
like some sugar and like something

2668
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
like some sugar and like something
 

2669
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,430
like some sugar and like something
something that doesn't necessarily feel

2670
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:01,440
something that doesn't necessarily feel
 

2671
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,630
something that doesn't necessarily feel
like it should be information yeah so i

2672
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:04,640
like it should be information yeah so i
 

2673
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,870
like it should be information yeah so i
actually no i mean sugar is information

2674
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
actually no i mean sugar is information
 

2675
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,309
actually no i mean sugar is information
right so part of the argument here is

2676
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:08,319
right so part of the argument here is
 

2677
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,069
right so part of the argument here is
that every physical object

2678
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:10,079
that every physical object
 

2679
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,430
that every physical object
is

2680
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:11,440
is
 

2681
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,589
is
well it's information but it's a set of

2682
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
well it's information but it's a set of
 

2683
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,670
well it's information but it's a set of
causal histories and also a set of

2684
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:15,680
causal histories and also a set of
 

2685
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,190
causal histories and also a set of
possible futures so there's an

2686
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
possible futures so there's an
 

2687
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,589
possible futures so there's an
experiment um that i've talked a lot

2688
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:19,599
experiment um that i've talked a lot
 

2689
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,430
experiment um that i've talked a lot
about uh with lee cronin but also with

2690
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,440
about uh with lee cronin but also with
 

2691
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,710
about uh with lee cronin but also with
michael lockman and chris kempies who

2692
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:22,720
michael lockman and chris kempies who
 

2693
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,950
michael lockman and chris kempies who
are at santa fe about this idea that

2694
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
are at santa fe about this idea that
 

2695
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,390
are at santa fe about this idea that
sometimes we talk about is like seating

2696
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:26,400
sometimes we talk about is like seating
 

2697
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,349
sometimes we talk about is like seating
assembly um which is you take a high

2698
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
assembly um which is you take a high
 

2699
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,910
assembly um which is you take a high
high complexity like a an object that

2700
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
high complexity like a an object that
 

2701
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,510
high complexity like a an object that
exists in the universe because of a long

2702
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,520
exists in the universe because of a long
 

2703
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,750
exists in the universe because of a long
causal history and you seed it into a

2704
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:35,760
causal history and you seed it into a
 

2705
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,790
causal history and you seed it into a
system of lower causal history and then

2706
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
system of lower causal history and then
 

2707
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,710
system of lower causal history and then
suddenly you see all of this complexity

2708
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:40,720
suddenly you see all of this complexity
 

2709
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,550
suddenly you see all of this complexity
being generated so i think another

2710
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,560
being generated so i think another
 

2711
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,950
being generated so i think another
validation of the physics would be

2712
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960
validation of the physics would be
 

2713
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,430
validation of the physics would be
say you engineer an organism by by

2714
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:47,440
say you engineer an organism by by
 

2715
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,630
say you engineer an organism by by
purposefully

2716
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
purposefully
 

2717
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,990
purposefully
introducing something where you

2718
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,000
introducing something where you
 

2719
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,910
introducing something where you
understand the relationship between the

2720
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:51,920
understand the relationship between the
 

2721
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,990
understand the relationship between the
causal history of the organism

2722
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
causal history of the organism
 

2723
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,870
causal history of the organism
and the say very complex chemical set of

2724
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:56,880
and the say very complex chemical set of
 

2725
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,109
and the say very complex chemical set of
ingredients you're adding to it and then

2726
00:44:59,109 --> 00:44:59,119
ingredients you're adding to it and then
 

2727
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,950
ingredients you're adding to it and then
you can predict the future evolution of

2728
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
you can predict the future evolution of
 

2729
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,349
you can predict the future evolution of

00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,400
you know i'm a physical structure
 

2741
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,109
you know i'm a physical structure
obviously like i i'm composed of atoms

2742
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:15,119
obviously like i i'm composed of atoms
 

2743
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,270
obviously like i i'm composed of atoms
the configuration of them and the fact

2744
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:17,280
the configuration of them and the fact
 

2745
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,349
the configuration of them and the fact
that they happen to be me

2746
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
that they happen to be me
 

2747
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,309
that they happen to be me
is because i'm not actually my atoms i

2748
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:22,319
is because i'm not actually my atoms i
 

2749
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,430
is because i'm not actually my atoms i
am a informational pattern that keeps

2750
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
am a informational pattern that keeps
 

2751
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,870
am a informational pattern that keeps
re-patterning those atoms into sarah um

2752
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:28,880
re-patterning those atoms into sarah um
 

2753
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,030
re-patterning those atoms into sarah um
and i have also associated to me is like

2754
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,040
and i have also associated to me is like
 

2755
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,190
and i have also associated to me is like
a space of possible things that could

2756
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,200
a space of possible things that could
 

2757
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,150
a space of possible things that could
exist

2758
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,160
exist
 

2759
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,670
exist
that i can help mediate come into

2760
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:37,680
that i can help mediate come into
 

2761
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,230
that i can help mediate come into
existence because of the information in

2762
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:40,240
existence because of the information in
 

2763
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,069
existence because of the information in
my history

2764
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:42,079
my history
 

2765
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,109
my history
and so

2766
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:43,119
and so
 

2767
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,670
and so
when you understand sort of that

2768
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:45,680
when you understand sort of that
 

2769
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,829
when you understand sort of that
time is a real thing embedded in a

2770
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:47,839
time is a real thing embedded in a
 

2771
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,150
time is a real thing embedded in a
physical object

2772
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
physical object
 

2773
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,950
physical object
then it becomes possible to talk about

2774
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:52,960
then it becomes possible to talk about
 

2775
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,990
then it becomes possible to talk about
how

2776
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,000
how
 

2777
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,790
how
histories when they interact

2778
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
histories when they interact
 

2779
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,550
histories when they interact
and history is not a unique thing it's a

2780
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:58,560
and history is not a unique thing it's a
 

2781
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,550
and history is not a unique thing it's a
set of possibilities when they interact

2782
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:00,560
set of possibilities when they interact
 

2783
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,030
set of possibilities when they interact
how do they specify what's coming next

2784
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
how do they specify what's coming next
 

2785
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,309
how do they specify what's coming next
and then where does the novelty come

2786
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,319
and then where does the novelty come
 

2787
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,670
and then where does the novelty come
from in that structure because some of

2788
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:05,680
from in that structure because some of
 

2789
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,870
from in that structure because some of
it is kind of things that haven't

2790
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
it is kind of things that haven't
 

2791
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,470
it is kind of things that haven't
existed in the past can exist in the

2792
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:08,480
existed in the past can exist in the
 

2793
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,750
existed in the past can exist in the
future

2794
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
future
 

2795
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,670
future
let me ask about this entity that you

2796
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
let me ask about this entity that you
 

2797
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,109
let me ask about this entity that you
call sarah yes i talk to myself about

2798
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:15,119
call sarah yes i talk to myself about
 

2799
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,950
call sarah yes i talk to myself about
myself in third person sometimes i don't

2800
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:16,960
myself in third person sometimes i don't
 

2801
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,470
myself in third person sometimes i don't
know why

2802
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:18,480
know why
 

2803
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,349
know why
uh

2804
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:19,359
uh
 

2805
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,349
uh
so maybe this is a good time to bring up

2806
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:21,359
so maybe this is a good time to bring up
 

2807
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,710
so maybe this is a good time to bring up
consciousness sure

2808
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720

 

2809
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,550

it's been here all along

2810
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:26,560
it's been here all along
 

2811
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,510
it's been here all along
wow

2812
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:27,520
wow
 

2813
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,670
wow
has it so what i mean at least in this

2814
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680
has it so what i mean at least in this
 

2815
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,349
has it so what i mean at least in this
conversation i think i've been conscious

2816
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:31,359
conversation i think i've been conscious
 

2817
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,030
conversation i think i've been conscious
most of it but maybe i haven't well yeah

2818
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,040
most of it but maybe i haven't well yeah
 

2819
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,190
most of it but maybe i haven't well yeah
speak so speak for yourself you're

2820
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,200
speak so speak for yourself you're
 

2821
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,470
speak so speak for yourself you're
you're you're projecting your

2822
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480
you're you're projecting your
 

2823
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,309
you're you're projecting your
consciences onto me you don't know if

2824
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:38,319
consciences onto me you don't know if
 

2825
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,550
consciences onto me you don't know if
i'm conscious or not is it

2826
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:40,560
i'm conscious or not is it
 

2827
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,270
i'm conscious or not is it
um you're right is that uh

2828
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,280
um you're right is that uh
 

2829
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,030
um you're right is that uh
he talked about the physics of existence

2830
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
he talked about the physics of existence
 

2831
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,950
he talked about the physics of existence
he talked about the emergence of um

2832
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:48,960
he talked about the emergence of um
 

2833
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,510
he talked about the emergence of um
of causality uh sorry you talked about

2834
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:51,520
of causality uh sorry you talked about
 

2835
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,589
of causality uh sorry you talked about
causality and time being fundamental to

2836
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:53,599
causality and time being fundamental to
 

2837
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,990
causality and time being fundamental to
the universe

2838
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
the universe
 

2839
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,390
the universe
does consciousness fit into all of this

2840
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,400
does consciousness fit into all of this
 

2841
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,349
does consciousness fit into all of this
like uh

2842
00:46:59,349 --> 00:46:59,359
like uh
 

2843
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,630
like uh
do you draw any kind of inspiration or

2844
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
do you draw any kind of inspiration or
 

2845
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,430
do you draw any kind of inspiration or
value with the idea of pan psychism

2846
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:05,440
value with the idea of pan psychism
 

2847
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,630
value with the idea of pan psychism
that maybe one of the things that we

2848
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:08,640
that maybe one of the things that we
 

2849
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,550
that maybe one of the things that we
ought to understand is the physics of

2850
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:10,560
ought to understand is the physics of
 

2851
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,990
ought to understand is the physics of
consciousness

2852
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:12,000
consciousness
 

2853
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,950
consciousness
like

2854
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960
like
 

2855
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,190
like
one of the missing pieces

2856
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
one of the missing pieces
 

2857
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,910
one of the missing pieces
in the physics view of the world is

2858
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:17,920
in the physics view of the world is
 

2859
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,270
in the physics view of the world is
understanding the physics of

2860
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:19,280
understanding the physics of
 

2861
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,470
understanding the physics of
consciousness or like that word

2862
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:22,480
consciousness or like that word
 

2863
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,030
consciousness or like that word
has so many concepts underneath it but

2864
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,040
has so many concepts underneath it but
 

2865
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,790
has so many concepts underneath it but
let's put it

2866
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:26,800
let's put it
 

2867
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,270
let's put it
let's put consciousness as a label on a

2868
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,280
let's put consciousness as a label on a
 

2869
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,109
let's put consciousness as a label on a
black box of mystery that we don't

2870
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:31,119
black box of mystery that we don't
 

2871
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,309
black box of mystery that we don't
understand

2872
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:32,319
understand
 

2873
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,349
understand
do you think

2874
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
do you think
 

2875
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,549
do you think
that black box holds the key

2876
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:36,559
that black box holds the key
 

2877
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,950
that black box holds the key
to uh finally answering the question of

2878
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:38,960
to uh finally answering the question of
 

2879
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,630
to uh finally answering the question of
the physics of life

2880
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,640
the physics of life
 

2881
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,390
the physics of life
the problems are absolutely related i

2882
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:42,400
the problems are absolutely related i
 

2883
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,630
the problems are absolutely related i
think um most and i'm interested in both

2884
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:44,640
think um most and i'm interested in both
 

2885
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,910
think um most and i'm interested in both
because i'm just interested in what we

2886
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920
because i'm just interested in what we
 

2887
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,589
because i'm just interested in what we
are and to me the most interesting

2888
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:47,599
are and to me the most interesting
 

2889
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,589
are and to me the most interesting
feature of what we are is our minds and

2890
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:49,599
feature of what we are is our minds and
 

2891
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,190
feature of what we are is our minds and
the way they interact with other minds

2892
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:51,200
the way they interact with other minds
 

2893
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,549
the way they interact with other minds
like minds are the most beautiful thing

2894
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:52,559
like minds are the most beautiful thing
 

2895
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:53,750
like minds are the most beautiful thing
that exists in the universe so how did

2896
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:53,760
that exists in the universe so how did
 

2897
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,109
that exists in the universe so how did
they come to be

2898
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:55,119
they come to be
 

2899
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,950
they come to be
i'm sorry to interrupt so when you say

2900
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960
i'm sorry to interrupt so when you say
 

2901
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,270
i'm sorry to interrupt so when you say
we you mean humans i mean humans right

2902
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,280
we you mean humans i mean humans right
 

2903
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,750
we you mean humans i mean humans right
now but i but that's because i'm a human

2904
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,760
now but i but that's because i'm a human
 

2905
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,190
now but i but that's because i'm a human
i think i am you think there's something

2906
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:03,200
i think i am you think there's something
 

2907
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,470
i think i am you think there's something
special to this particular no no no um

2908
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,480
special to this particular no no no um
 

2909
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,390
special to this particular no no no um
no um

2910
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,400
no um
 

2911
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,190
no um
i don't i'm not a human-centric thinker

2912
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,200
i don't i'm not a human-centric thinker
 

2913
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,270
i don't i'm not a human-centric thinker
but are you one entity you said a bunch

2914
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:13,280
but are you one entity you said a bunch
 

2915
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,349
but are you one entity you said a bunch
of stuff came together to make a sarah

2916
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:15,359
of stuff came together to make a sarah
 

2917
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,390
of stuff came together to make a sarah
like

2918
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,400
like
 

2919
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,190
like
yourself

2920
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:17,200
yourself
 

2921
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,270
yourself
as one entity are you just

2922
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
as one entity are you just
 

2923
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,950
as one entity are you just
a bunch of different components like is

2924
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:20,960
a bunch of different components like is
 

2925
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,710
a bunch of different components like is
there any value to understand the

2926
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
there any value to understand the
 

2927
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,270
there any value to understand the
physics of sarah like or are you just a

2928
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,280
physics of sarah like or are you just a
 

2929
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,430
physics of sarah like or are you just a
bunch of different things that are like

2930
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
bunch of different things that are like
 

2931
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,790
bunch of different things that are like
a nice little temporary side effect yeah

2932
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
a nice little temporary side effect yeah
 

2933
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,390
a nice little temporary side effect yeah
you could think of me as a bundle of

2934
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:32,400
you could think of me as a bundle of
 

2935
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,150
you could think of me as a bundle of
information that just became temporarily

2936
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,160
information that just became temporarily
 

2937
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,630
information that just became temporarily
aggregated or individual yeah that's

2938
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
aggregated or individual yeah that's
 

2939
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,470
aggregated or individual yeah that's
fine i agree with that view

2940
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:38,480
fine i agree with that view
 

2941
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,390
fine i agree with that view
um

2942
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,400
um
 

2943
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,750
um
okay i think that is a compliment

2944
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:41,760
okay i think that is a compliment
 

2945
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,829
okay i think that is a compliment
actually but you you've

2946
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:43,839
actually but you you've
 

2947
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,910
actually but you you've
but nevertheless that bundle of

2948
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:45,920
but nevertheless that bundle of
 

2949
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,990
but nevertheless that bundle of
information has become conscious or at

2950
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
information has become conscious or at
 

2951
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,950
information has become conscious or at
least keeps calling her self-conscious

2952
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:50,960
least keeps calling her self-conscious
 

2953
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,790
least keeps calling her self-conscious
yeah i think i'm conscious right now but

2954
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:52,800
yeah i think i'm conscious right now but
 

2955
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,270
yeah i think i'm conscious right now but
i might not be but that's okay um or you

2956
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,280
i might not be but that's okay um or you
 

2957
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,270
i might not be but that's okay um or you
wouldn't know um so yeah so this is the

2958
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:57,280
wouldn't know um so yeah so this is the
 

2959
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,109
wouldn't know um so yeah so this is the
problem so yeah usually people when

2960
00:48:59,109 --> 00:48:59,119
problem so yeah usually people when
 

2961
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,549
problem so yeah usually people when
they're talking about consciousness are

2962
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:00,559
they're talking about consciousness are
 

2963
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,230
they're talking about consciousness are
worried about the subjective experience

2964
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:02,240
worried about the subjective experience
 

2965
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,990
worried about the subjective experience
and so i think that's why you're saying

2966
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:04,000
and so i think that's why you're saying
 

2967
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,190
and so i think that's why you're saying
i don't know if you're conscious because

2968
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:05,200
i don't know if you're conscious because
 

2969
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,950
i don't know if you're conscious because
i don't know if you're experiencing this

2970
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:06,960
i don't know if you're experiencing this
 

2971
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,549
i don't know if you're experiencing this
conversation right now

2972
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559
conversation right now
 

2973
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,790
conversation right now
um and nor do you know if i'm

2974
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:10,800
um and nor do you know if i'm
 

2975
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,230
um and nor do you know if i'm
experienced in the conversation right

2976
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:12,240
experienced in the conversation right
 

2977
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,109
experienced in the conversation right
now

2978
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:13,119
now
 

2979
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,230
now
and so this is why this is called the

2980
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
and so this is why this is called the
 

2981
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,670
and so this is why this is called the
hard problem of consciousness because it

2982
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:15,680
hard problem of consciousness because it
 

2983
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,510
hard problem of consciousness because it
seems impenetrable from the outside to

2984
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:17,520
seems impenetrable from the outside to
 

2985
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,510
seems impenetrable from the outside to
know if something's having a conscious

2986
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520
know if something's having a conscious
 

2987
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,349
know if something's having a conscious
experience um

2988
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:21,359
experience um
 

2989
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,589
experience um
and i really like um

2990
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:23,599
and i really like um
 

2991
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,430
and i really like um
the idea of also like the hard problem

2992
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
the idea of also like the hard problem
 

2993
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,910
the idea of also like the hard problem
of matter which is related to the hard

2994
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:27,920
of matter which is related to the hard
 

2995
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,910
of matter which is related to the hard
problem of consciousness which is you

2996
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:29,920
problem of consciousness which is you
 

2997
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,589
problem of consciousness which is you
don't know the intrinsic properties of

2998
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:31,599
don't know the intrinsic properties of
 

2999
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,589
don't know the intrinsic properties of
an electron not interacting say for

3000
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:33,599
an electron not interacting say for
 

3001
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,710
an electron not interacting say for
example with anything else in the

3002
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:34,720
example with anything else in the
 

3003
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,030
example with anything else in the
universe all the properties of anything

3004
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:37,040
universe all the properties of anything
 

3005
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,549
universe all the properties of anything
that exists in the universe are divine

3006
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:38,559
that exists in the universe are divine
 

3007
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,150
that exists in the universe are divine
by its interaction because you have to

3008
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:40,160
by its interaction because you have to
 

3009
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,750
by its interaction because you have to
interact with it in order to be able to

3010
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
interact with it in order to be able to
 

3011
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,069
interact with it in order to be able to
observe it so we can only actually know

3012
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:44,079
observe it so we can only actually know
 

3013
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,349
observe it so we can only actually know
the things that are observable from the

3014
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:45,359
the things that are observable from the
 

3015
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,190
the things that are observable from the
outside and so this is one of the

3016
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:47,200
outside and so this is one of the
 

3017
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,870
outside and so this is one of the
reasons that consciousness is hard for

3018
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:48,880
reasons that consciousness is hard for
 

3019
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,030
reasons that consciousness is hard for
science because you're asking questions

3020
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
science because you're asking questions
 

3021
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,710
science because you're asking questions
about something that's subjective and

3022
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
about something that's subjective and
 

3023
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,630
about something that's subjective and
supposed to be intrinsic to what that

3024
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:54,640
supposed to be intrinsic to what that
 

3025
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,870
supposed to be intrinsic to what that
thing is as it exists and how it feels

3026
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:56,880
thing is as it exists and how it feels
 

3027
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,109
thing is as it exists and how it feels
about existing

3028
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
about existing
 

3029
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,230
about existing
and so

3030
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:00,240
and so
 

3031
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,390
and so
i have thought a lot about this problem

3032
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:02,400
i have thought a lot about this problem
 

3033
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,870
i have thought a lot about this problem
and its relationship to the problem of

3034
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:04,880
and its relationship to the problem of
 

3035
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,790
and its relationship to the problem of
life and the only thing i can come up

3036
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:06,800
life and the only thing i can come up
 

3037
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,309
life and the only thing i can come up
with to try to make

3038
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:08,319
with to try to make
 

3039
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,150
with to try to make
that problem

3040
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,160
that problem
 

3041
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,870
that problem
scientifically tractable

3042
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:12,880
scientifically tractable
 

3043
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,510
scientifically tractable
and also related to how i think about

3044
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:15,520
and also related to how i think about
 

3045
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,910
and also related to how i think about
the physics of life

3046
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
the physics of life
 

3047
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,230
the physics of life
is to ask the question

3048
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,240
is to ask the question
 

3049
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,309
is to ask the question
are there things that can only happen in

3050
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:22,319
are there things that can only happen in
 

3051
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,549
are there things that can only happen in
the universe because

3052
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:24,559
the universe because
 

3053
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,549
the universe because
there are physical systems that have

3054
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:26,559
there are physical systems that have
 

3055
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,710
there are physical systems that have
subjective experience

3056
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:28,720
subjective experience
 

3057
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,790
subjective experience
so does subjective experience have

3058
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:30,800
so does subjective experience have
 

3059
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,549
so does subjective experience have
different causes

3060
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:32,559
different causes
 

3061
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,510
different causes
that things that it can cause to occur

3062
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:35,520
that things that it can cause to occur
 

3063
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,390
that things that it can cause to occur
um

3064
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
um
 

3065
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,470
um
that would happen in the absence of that

3066
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:38,480
that would happen in the absence of that
 

3067
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,990
that would happen in the absence of that
i don't know the answer to that question

3068
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:40,000
i don't know the answer to that question
 

3069
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,910
i don't know the answer to that question
but i think that's a meaningful ask way

3070
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:41,920
but i think that's a meaningful ask way
 

3071
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,589
but i think that's a meaningful ask way
of asking the question of consciousness

3072
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:43,599
of asking the question of consciousness
 

3073
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,150
of asking the question of consciousness
i can't ask if you're having experience

3074
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:46,160
i can't ask if you're having experience
 

3075
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,069
i can't ask if you're having experience
right now but i can ask if you having

3076
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:48,079
right now but i can ask if you having
 

3077
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,990
right now but i can ask if you having
experience right now changes something

3078
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,000
experience right now changes something
 

3079
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,670
experience right now changes something
about you and the way you interact with

3080
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:51,680
about you and the way you interact with
 

3081
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,670
about you and the way you interact with
the world

3082
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
the world
 

3083
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,790
the world
so

3084
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:54,800
so
 

3085
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,270
so
does stuff happen it's just it's a good

3086
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:57,280
does stuff happen it's just it's a good
 

3087
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,109
does stuff happen it's just it's a good
question to ask this stuff happen if

3088
00:50:59,109 --> 00:50:59,119
question to ask this stuff happen if
 

3089
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,270
question to ask this stuff happen if
consciousness is

3090
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
consciousness is
 

3091
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,109
consciousness is
then it's a real physical thing right it

3092
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:03,119
then it's a real physical thing right it
 

3093
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,549
then it's a real physical thing right it
has physical consequences i'm a

3094
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:04,559
has physical consequences i'm a
 

3095
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,710
has physical consequences i'm a
physicist i'm biased so i don't you know

3096
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,720
physicist i'm biased so i don't you know
 

3097
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,470
physicist i'm biased so i don't you know
i can't get rid of that bias it's really

3098
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:08,480
i can't get rid of that bias it's really
 

3099
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,510
i can't get rid of that bias it's really
deeply ingrained um i've tried

3100
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,520
deeply ingrained um i've tried
 

3101
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,750
deeply ingrained um i've tried
but but i mean you're saying information

3102
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:13,760
but but i mean you're saying information
 

3103
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,589
but but i mean you're saying information
is physical too so like virtual reality

3104
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
is physical too so like virtual reality
 

3105
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,270
is physical too so like virtual reality
and stimulation all that program is

3106
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,280
and stimulation all that program is
 

3107
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,270
and stimulation all that program is
physical too yes everything's physical

3108
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,280
physical too yes everything's physical
 

3109
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,870
physical too yes everything's physical
it's just not physical the way it's

3110
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:20,880
it's just not physical the way it's
 

3111
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,870
it's just not physical the way it's
represented in our minds

3112
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:22,880
represented in our minds
 

3113
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,230
represented in our minds
right so you i love your twitter so you

3114
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,240
right so you i love your twitter so you
 

3115
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,790
right so you i love your twitter so you
tweet these like deep thoughts

3116
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:28,800
tweet these like deep thoughts
 

3117
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,390
tweet these like deep thoughts
and deep dust that's what a theorist

3118
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:30,400
and deep dust that's what a theorist
 

3119
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,270
and deep dust that's what a theorist
does when she's trying to experiment

3120
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
does when she's trying to experiment
 

3121
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,349
does when she's trying to experiment
is tweet it's just like

3122
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:35,359
is tweet it's just like
 

3123
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,750
is tweet it's just like
sitting there i mean i can just imagine

3124
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:37,760
sitting there i mean i can just imagine
 

3125
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,270
sitting there i mean i can just imagine
you sitting there for like hours and all

3126
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:39,280
you sitting there for like hours and all
 

3127
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,109
you sitting there for like hours and all
of a sudden just like this thought comes

3128
00:51:41,109 --> 00:51:41,119
of a sudden just like this thought comes
 

3129
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,390
of a sudden just like this thought comes
out and you get a little um

3130
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400
out and you get a little um
 

3131
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,710
out and you get a little um
like inkling into the thought process

3132
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:46,720
like inkling into the thought process
 

3133
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,990
like inkling into the thought process
yeah usually it's like when i'm running

3134
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
yeah usually it's like when i'm running
 

3135
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,870
yeah usually it's like when i'm running
between things

3136
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:52,880

 

3137
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,630

articulate one of the things you tweeted

3138
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
articulate one of the things you tweeted
 

3139
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,030
articulate one of the things you tweeted
is ideologically there are many

3140
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
is ideologically there are many
 

3141
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,430
is ideologically there are many
parallels between the search for neural

3142
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,440
parallels between the search for neural
 

3143
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,069
parallels between the search for neural
correlates of consciousness and for

3144
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
correlates of consciousness and for
 

3145
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,470
correlates of consciousness and for
chemical correlates of life how the

3146
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
chemical correlates of life how the
 

3147
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,630
chemical correlates of life how the
neuroscience and astrobiology

3148
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,640
neuroscience and astrobiology
 

3149
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,630
neuroscience and astrobiology
communities treat those correlates is

3150
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
communities treat those correlates is
 

3151
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,390
communities treat those correlates is
entirely different

3152
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:10,400
entirely different
 

3153
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,270
entirely different
can you elaborate against this kind of

3154
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:13,280
can you elaborate against this kind of
 

3155
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,349
can you elaborate against this kind of
yeah the parallels it has to do a little

3156
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:15,359
yeah the parallels it has to do a little
 

3157
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,069
yeah the parallels it has to do a little
bit with the consciousness and the

3158
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:18,079
bit with the consciousness and the
 

3159
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,430
bit with the consciousness and the
and the matter thing you're talking

3160
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:19,440
and the matter thing you're talking
 

3161
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,670
and the matter thing you're talking
about yeah it does and i i can't

3162
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:21,680
about yeah it does and i i can't
 

3163
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,109
about yeah it does and i i can't
remember what state of mind i was when i

3164
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:23,119
remember what state of mind i was when i
 

3165
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,670
remember what state of mind i was when i
was actually thinking about that but um

3166
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:25,680
was actually thinking about that but um
 

3167
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,750
was actually thinking about that but um
but i think part of it is but you never

3168
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:27,760
but i think part of it is but you never
 

3169
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,270
but i think part of it is but you never
thought you're gonna have to analyze

3170
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:29,280
thought you're gonna have to analyze
 

3171
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,270
thought you're gonna have to analyze
your own twitter no i didn't it's an

3172
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:31,280
your own twitter no i didn't it's an
 

3173
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,829
your own twitter no i didn't it's an
interesting uh historical juxtaposition

3174
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:33,839
interesting uh historical juxtaposition
 

3175
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,270
interesting uh historical juxtaposition
of thinking so the tweet is a historical

3176
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,280
of thinking so the tweet is a historical
 

3177
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,069
of thinking so the tweet is a historical
uh

3178
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:38,079
uh
 

3179
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,589
uh
you're doing an assembly experiment

3180
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:39,599
you're doing an assembly experiment
 

3181
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:40,710
you're doing an assembly experiment
right now because you're bringing a

3182
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:40,720
right now because you're bringing a
 

3183
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,230
right now because you're bringing a
thought from the past into the present

3184
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,240
thought from the past into the present
 

3185
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,230
thought from the past into the present
and trying to actually in the lab

3186
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:44,240
and trying to actually in the lab
 

3187
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,230
and trying to actually in the lab
yeah yeah this is this is experimental

3188
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
yeah yeah this is this is experimental
 

3189
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,230
yeah yeah this is this is experimental
science right here okay on the podcast

3190
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:48,240
science right here okay on the podcast
 

3191
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,190
science right here okay on the podcast
live

3192
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,200
live
 

3193
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,630
live
um

3194
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:50,640
um
 

3195
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,630
um
so so go let's see how the consciousness

3196
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:52,640
so so go let's see how the consciousness
 

3197
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,510
so so go let's see how the consciousness
evolves on this one yeah so um in

3198
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:55,520
evolves on this one yeah so um in
 

3199
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,670
evolves on this one yeah so um in
neuroscience it's kind of accepted that

3200
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:57,680
neuroscience it's kind of accepted that
 

3201
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,750
neuroscience it's kind of accepted that
we can't get the subjective

3202
00:52:59,750 --> 00:52:59,760
we can't get the subjective
 

3203
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,549
we can't get the subjective
aspect of consciousness so people are

3204
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
aspect of consciousness so people are
 

3205
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,630
aspect of consciousness so people are
very interested in what would be a

3206
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:04,640
very interested in what would be a
 

3207
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,790
very interested in what would be a
correlate of consciousness so

3208
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:06,800
correlate of consciousness so
 

3209
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,589
correlate of consciousness so
um

3210
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,599
um
 

3211
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,630
um
so

3212
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
so
 

3213
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,870
so
that's a correlation a correlate is a

3214
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
that's a correlation a correlate is a
 

3215
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,829
that's a correlation a correlate is a
feature

3216
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:11,839
feature
 

3217
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,549
feature
that relates to conscious activity so

3218
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:14,559
that relates to conscious activity so
 

3219
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,910
that relates to conscious activity so
for example um you know a verbal report

3220
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:17,920
for example um you know a verbal report
 

3221
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,069
for example um you know a verbal report
is a correlate of consciousness because

3222
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:20,079
is a correlate of consciousness because
 

3223
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,510
is a correlate of consciousness because
um you know i can tell you when i'm

3224
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:21,520
um you know i can tell you when i'm
 

3225
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,790
um you know i can tell you when i'm
conscious

3226
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,800
conscious
 

3227
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,030
conscious
and then when i'm sleeping for example i

3228
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:25,040
and then when i'm sleeping for example i
 

3229
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,710
and then when i'm sleeping for example i
can't tell you i'm conscious so we have

3230
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:26,720
can't tell you i'm conscious so we have
 

3231
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,150
can't tell you i'm conscious so we have
this assumption that you're not

3232
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,160
this assumption that you're not
 

3233
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,430
this assumption that you're not
conscious when you're sleeping and

3234
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:29,440
conscious when you're sleeping and
 

3235
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,270
conscious when you're sleeping and
you're conscious when you're awake yeah

3236
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
you're conscious when you're awake yeah
 

3237
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,829
you're conscious when you're awake yeah
um and so so that's sort of like a a

3238
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:33,839
um and so so that's sort of like a a
 

3239
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,910
um and so so that's sort of like a a
very obvious example but uh

3240
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:35,920
very obvious example but uh
 

3241
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,990
very obvious example but uh
neuroscientists which you know i'm no

3242
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,000
neuroscientists which you know i'm no
 

3243
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,510
neuroscientists which you know i'm no
neuroscientist and i'm not an expert in

3244
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:39,520
neuroscientist and i'm not an expert in
 

3245
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,510
neuroscientist and i'm not an expert in
this field so um but you know they have

3246
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,520
this field so um but you know they have
 

3247
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,430
this field so um but you know they have
very sophisticated ways of measuring you

3248
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
very sophisticated ways of measuring you
 

3249
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,109
very sophisticated ways of measuring you
know activity in our brain and trying to

3250
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:45,119
know activity in our brain and trying to
 

3251
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,150
know activity in our brain and trying to
relate that to verbal report and other

3252
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,160
relate that to verbal report and other
 

3253
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,589
relate that to verbal report and other
proxies for whether someone is

3254
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:49,599
proxies for whether someone is
 

3255
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,309
proxies for whether someone is
experiencing something um and that's

3256
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:52,319
experiencing something um and that's
 

3257
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,630
experiencing something um and that's
what is meant by neural correlates

3258
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,640
what is meant by neural correlates
 

3259
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,870
what is meant by neural correlates
um and then so when people are trying to

3260
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
um and then so when people are trying to
 

3261
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,549
um and then so when people are trying to
think about

3262
00:53:58,549 --> 00:53:58,559
think about
 

3263
00:53:58,559 --> 00:53:59,829
think about
um

3264
00:53:59,829 --> 00:53:59,839
um
 

3265
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,829
um
studying consciousness or developing

3266
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:01,839
studying consciousness or developing
 

3267
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,630
studying consciousness or developing
theories for consciousness they often

3268
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:04,640
theories for consciousness they often
 

3269
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,870
theories for consciousness they often
are trying to build an experimental

3270
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:06,880
are trying to build an experimental
 

3271
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,670
are trying to build an experimental
bridge to these neural correlates

3272
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:09,680
bridge to these neural correlates
 

3273
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,270
bridge to these neural correlates
recognizing the fact that a neural

3274
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:11,280
recognizing the fact that a neural
 

3275
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,069
recognizing the fact that a neural
correlate may or may not correspond

3276
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
correlate may or may not correspond
 

3277
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,150
correlate may or may not correspond
to consciousness because that problem's

3278
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,160
to consciousness because that problem's
 

3279
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,069
to consciousness because that problem's
hard and there's all these associated

3280
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
hard and there's all these associated
 

3281
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,670
hard and there's all these associated
issues to it

3282
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:19,680
issues to it
 

3283
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,510
issues to it
so that that's from a neuroscience

3284
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:21,520
so that that's from a neuroscience
 

3285
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,109
so that that's from a neuroscience
perspective it's like fake it till you

3286
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119
perspective it's like fake it till you
 

3287
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,109
perspective it's like fake it till you
make it so you pretty much yeah you fake

3288
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:25,119
make it so you pretty much yeah you fake
 

3289
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,030
make it so you pretty much yeah you fake
whatever the correlates are and

3290
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:27,040
whatever the correlates are and
 

3291
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,309
whatever the correlates are and
hopefully that

3292
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:28,319
hopefully that
 

3293
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,030
hopefully that
the uh that's going to uh summon

3294
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,040
the uh that's going to uh summon
 

3295
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,710
the uh that's going to uh summon
the thing that is consciousness or

3296
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:32,720
the thing that is consciousness or
 

3297
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,230
the thing that is consciousness or
something like that and so the same

3298
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
something like that and so the same
 

3299
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,990
something like that and so the same
thing on the chemical

3300
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000
thing on the chemical
 

3301
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,230
thing on the chemical
correlates of life is it that sounds

3302
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:38,240
correlates of life is it that sounds
 

3303
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,990
correlates of life is it that sounds
like that's an awesome concept is that

3304
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,000
like that's an awesome concept is that
 

3305
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,670
like that's an awesome concept is that
something that people no i just made

3306
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:41,680
something that people no i just made
 

3307
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,510
something that people no i just made
that up okay that was the originals to

3308
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:43,520
that up okay that was the originals to
 

3309
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,510
that up okay that was the originals to
that tweet you can cite the tweet

3310
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:45,520
that tweet you can cite the tweet
 

3311
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,750
that tweet you can cite the tweet
maybe i'll write it in a paper someday

3312
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:47,760
maybe i'll write it in a paper someday
 

3313
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,910
maybe i'll write it in a paper someday
uh chemical correlates of life that's a

3314
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:49,920
uh chemical correlates of life that's a
 

3315
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,069
uh chemical correlates of life that's a
good title i mean first of all your your

3316
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:52,079
good title i mean first of all your your
 

3317
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,829
good title i mean first of all your your
papers too that people should check out

3318
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:53,839
papers too that people should check out
 

3319
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,670
papers too that people should check out
have great titles

3320
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:55,680
have great titles
 

3321
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,069
have great titles
or paper papers you're involved with

3322
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:58,079
or paper papers you're involved with
 

3323
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,630
or paper papers you're involved with
so your tweets and titles are are

3324
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:00,640
so your tweets and titles are are
 

3325
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,710
so your tweets and titles are are
stellar and also your ideas but the

3326
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
stellar and also your ideas but the
 

3327
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,910
stellar and also your ideas but the
tweets and titles are much more

3328
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:03,920
tweets and titles are much more
 

3329
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,950
tweets and titles are much more
important of course so these will live

3330
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:06,960
important of course so these will live
 

3331
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,549
important of course so these will live
longer

3332
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:08,559
longer
 

3333
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,829
longer
yeah

3334
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839
yeah
 

3335
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,150
yeah
they're much more diffused though um

3336
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:12,160
they're much more diffused though um
 

3337
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,990
they're much more diffused though um
well it's yeah it's the

3338
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,000
well it's yeah it's the
 

3339
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,990
well it's yeah it's the
tweet is the trojan horse or the idea

3340
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,000
tweet is the trojan horse or the idea
 

3341
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,150
tweet is the trojan horse or the idea
that that sticks on for a long time okay

3342
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:18,160
that that sticks on for a long time okay
 

3343
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,589
that that sticks on for a long time okay
so is there anything to say about the

3344
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:19,599
so is there anything to say about the
 

3345
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,910
so is there anything to say about the
chemical coils you're saying

3346
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:21,920
chemical coils you're saying
 

3347
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,230
chemical coils you're saying
there are similar kind of ways of

3348
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
there are similar kind of ways of
 

3349
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,750
there are similar kind of ways of
thinking about it

3350
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760
thinking about it
 

3351
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,150
thinking about it
but uh

3352
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:28,160
but uh
 

3353
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,549
but uh
you you mentioned about the communities

3354
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:30,559
you you mentioned about the communities
 

3355
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,270
you you mentioned about the communities
yeah so i think in astrobiology it's not

3356
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
yeah so i think in astrobiology it's not
 

3357
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,430
yeah so i think in astrobiology it's not
um

3358
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:35,440
um
 

3359
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,870
um
there's no concept of chemical

3360
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:36,880
there's no concept of chemical
 

3361
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,470
there's no concept of chemical
correlates of life we don't think about

3362
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,480
correlates of life we don't think about
 

3363
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,990
correlates of life we don't think about
it that way we think if we find

3364
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,000
it that way we think if we find
 

3365
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,710
it that way we think if we find
molecules that are involved in biology

3366
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:42,720
molecules that are involved in biology
 

3367
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,470
molecules that are involved in biology
we found life

3368
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:44,480
we found life
 

3369
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,190
we found life
so i think i i i think one of my

3370
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,200
so i think i i i think one of my
 

3371
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,710
so i think i i i think one of my
motivations there was just to separate

3372
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:48,720
motivations there was just to separate
 

3373
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,990
motivations there was just to separate
the fact that

3374
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:50,000
the fact that
 

3375
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,630
the fact that
life has abstract properties associated

3376
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:52,640
life has abstract properties associated
 

3377
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,950
life has abstract properties associated
to it they become imprinted in in

3378
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:54,960
to it they become imprinted in in
 

3379
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,750
to it they become imprinted in in
material substrates um and those

3380
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
material substrates um and those
 

3381
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,430
material substrates um and those
substrates are correlates for that thing

3382
00:55:59,430 --> 00:55:59,440
substrates are correlates for that thing
 

3383
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,030
substrates are correlates for that thing
but they are not necessarily the thing

3384
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:01,040
but they are not necessarily the thing
 

3385
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,230
but they are not necessarily the thing
we're actually looking for the thing

3386
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,240
we're actually looking for the thing
 

3387
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,910
we're actually looking for the thing
that we're looking for is the physics

3388
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
that we're looking for is the physics
 

3389
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,510
that we're looking for is the physics
that's organizing that system to begin

3390
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520
that's organizing that system to begin
 

3391
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,670
that's organizing that system to begin
with not the particular molecules

3392
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:07,680
with not the particular molecules
 

3393
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,910
with not the particular molecules
um in the same sense that that you know

3394
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:09,920
um in the same sense that that you know
 

3395
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,190
um in the same sense that that you know
your consciousness is not your brain

3396
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:13,200
your consciousness is not your brain
 

3397
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,710
your consciousness is not your brain
it's it's it

3398
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:14,720
it's it's it
 

3399
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,789
it's it's it
it's instantiated in your brain that you

3400
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:16,799
it's instantiated in your brain that you
 

3401
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,630
it's instantiated in your brain that you
know it has to have a physical substrate

3402
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:18,640
know it has to have a physical substrate
 

3403
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,230
know it has to have a physical substrate
but it's not the

3404
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
but it's not the
 

3405
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,750
but it's not the
the matter is not the thing that you're

3406
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:21,760
the matter is not the thing that you're
 

3407
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,829
the matter is not the thing that you're
looking at it's some other at least not

3408
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:23,839
looking at it's some other at least not
 

3409
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,910
looking at it's some other at least not
in the way that we have come to look at

3410
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
in the way that we have come to look at
 

3411
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,829
in the way that we have come to look at
matter you know with traditional physics

3412
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:27,839
matter you know with traditional physics
 

3413
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,030
matter you know with traditional physics
and things there's there's something

3414
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,040
and things there's there's something
 

3415
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,549
and things there's there's something
else there and it might be this feature

3416
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:30,559
else there and it might be this feature
 

3417
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,069
else there and it might be this feature
of history i was talking about our time

3418
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:32,079
of history i was talking about our time
 

3419
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:32,870
of history i was talking about our time
being

3420
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
being
 

3421
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,710
being
actually you know physically represented

3422
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:34,720
actually you know physically represented
 

3423
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,750
actually you know physically represented
there

3424
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:35,760
there
 

3425
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,109
there
do you think consciousness can be

3426
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:37,119
do you think consciousness can be
 

3427
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,549
do you think consciousness can be
engineered

3428
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:38,559
engineered
 

3429
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,910
engineered
yes

3430
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:39,920
yes
 

3431
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,430
yes
in the same way that life can be well

3432
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:41,440
in the same way that life can be well
 

3433
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,710
in the same way that life can be well
that was a fast answer i didn't even

3434
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
that was a fast answer i didn't even
 

3435
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,549
that was a fast answer i didn't even
think about that that's interesting

3436
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:44,559
think about that that's interesting
 

3437
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,470
think about that that's interesting
you don't have a free will that was no i

3438
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
you don't have a free will that was no i
 

3439
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,150
you don't have a free will that was no i
do have free will but it's interesting

3440
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,160
do have free will but it's interesting
 

3441
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,750
do have free will but it's interesting
because some i mean

3442
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:49,760
because some i mean
 

3443
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,829
because some i mean
i you know you know you're backtracking

3444
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:51,839
i you know you know you're backtracking
 

3445
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,589
i you know you know you're backtracking
no no that was predestined yeah no no

3446
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
no no that was predestined yeah no no
 

3447
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,589
no no that was predestined yeah no no
no i do believe in free will but i also

3448
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:57,599
no i do believe in free will but i also
 

3449
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,870
no i do believe in free will but i also
think that there's kind of kind of an

3450
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:58,880
think that there's kind of kind of an
 

3451
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,470
think that there's kind of kind of an
interesting um

3452
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:00,480
interesting um
 

3453
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,230
interesting um
you know like what you're you speaking

3454
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:02,240
you know like what you're you speaking
 

3455
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,510
you know like what you're you speaking
about consciousness what are you

3456
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520
about consciousness what are you
 

3457
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,589
about consciousness what are you
consciously aware of versus like what is

3458
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:05,599
consciously aware of versus like what is
 

3459
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,750
consciously aware of versus like what is
your subconscious brain actually

3460
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:07,760
your subconscious brain actually
 

3461
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,670
your subconscious brain actually
processing and doing and and sometimes

3462
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:09,680
processing and doing and and sometimes
 

3463
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,109
processing and doing and and sometimes
there's conflict between your

3464
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:11,119
there's conflict between your
 

3465
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,030
there's conflict between your
consciousness and your subconsciousness

3466
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,040
consciousness and your subconsciousness
 

3467
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,789
consciousness and your subconsciousness
or your consciousness a little slower

3468
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:14,799
or your consciousness a little slower
 

3469
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,349
or your consciousness a little slower
than your subconscious and intuition is

3470
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:17,359
than your subconscious and intuition is
 

3471
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,789
than your subconscious and intuition is
a really important feature of that and

3472
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:18,799
a really important feature of that and
 

3473
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,549
a really important feature of that and
so a lot of the ways i do my science is

3474
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:20,559
so a lot of the ways i do my science is
 

3475
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,150
so a lot of the ways i do my science is
guided by intuition

3476
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:22,160
guided by intuition
 

3477
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,829
guided by intuition
so when i give fast answers like that i

3478
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:23,839
so when i give fast answers like that i
 

3479
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:24,870
so when i give fast answers like that i
think it's usually because i haven't

3480
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:24,880
think it's usually because i haven't
 

3481
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,230
think it's usually because i haven't
really thought about them and therefore

3482
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,240
really thought about them and therefore
 

3483
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,670
really thought about them and therefore
that's probably

3484
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:27,680
that's probably
 

3485
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,829
that's probably
telling me something let's continue the

3486
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:29,839
telling me something let's continue the
 

3487
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,270
telling me something let's continue the
deep analysis of your tweets

3488
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:31,280
deep analysis of your tweets
 

3489
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,270
deep analysis of your tweets
[Laughter]

3490
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:33,280
[Laughter]
 

3491
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,750
[Laughter]
you said that determinism in a tweet

3492
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:35,760
you said that determinism in a tweet
 

3493
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,589
you said that determinism in a tweet
determinism and randomness play

3494
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
determinism and randomness play
 

3495
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,349
determinism and randomness play
important roles in understanding what

3496
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:39,359
important roles in understanding what
 

3497
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,390
important roles in understanding what
life is

3498
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:40,400
life is
 

3499
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,470
life is
so let me ask on this topic of free will

3500
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,480
so let me ask on this topic of free will
 

3501
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,589
so let me ask on this topic of free will
what is determinism what is randomness

3502
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:45,599
what is determinism what is randomness
 

3503
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,670
what is determinism what is randomness
and why the heck do they have anything

3504
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:47,680
and why the heck do they have anything
 

3505
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,230
and why the heck do they have anything
to do with understanding life

3506
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,240
to do with understanding life
 

3507
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,190
to do with understanding life
yeah

3508
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:51,200
yeah
 

3509
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,710
yeah
and you threw free will in there just

3510
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:52,720
and you threw free will in there just
 

3511
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,870
and you threw free will in there just
throwing all the the stuff in the bag

3512
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:54,880
throwing all the the stuff in the bag
 

3513
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,030
throwing all the the stuff in the bag
are they not related no no they are they

3514
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
are they not related no no they are they
 

3515
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,030
are they not related no no they are they
are related then no no that's all right

3516
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,040
are related then no no that's all right
 

3517
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,789
are related then no no that's all right
i was being unfair you didn't even

3518
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:00,799
i was being unfair you didn't even
 

3519
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,390
i was being unfair you didn't even
capitalize the tweet by the way it was

3520
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:02,400
capitalize the tweet by the way it was
 

3521
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,190
capitalize the tweet by the way it was
all lower case i must have been angry oh

3522
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200
all lower case i must have been angry oh
 

3523
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,109
all lower case i must have been angry oh
that was was saying can you analyze the

3524
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:07,119
that was was saying can you analyze the
 

3525
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,789
that was was saying can you analyze the
emotion behind that no i actually did

3526
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:08,799
emotion behind that no i actually did
 

3527
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,670
emotion behind that no i actually did
frustration yeah maybe so

3528
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:11,680
frustration yeah maybe so
 

3529
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,589
frustration yeah maybe so
i already argued that i don't think that

3530
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:13,599
i already argued that i don't think that
 

3531
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,510
i already argued that i don't think that
can happen without that whole causal

3532
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:15,520
can happen without that whole causal
 

3533
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,309
can happen without that whole causal
history and so i guess in some sense um

3534
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:18,319
history and so i guess in some sense um
 

3535
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:21,270
history and so i guess in some sense um
the determinism for me arises because of

3536
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,280
the determinism for me arises because of
 

3537
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,789
the determinism for me arises because of
the causal history

3538
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:22,799
the causal history
 

3539
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,190
the causal history
um and i'm not really sure actually

3540
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:25,200
um and i'm not really sure actually
 

3541
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,069
um and i'm not really sure actually
about whether the universe is random or

3542
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,079
about whether the universe is random or
 

3543
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,549
about whether the universe is random or
deterministic i just had this sort of

3544
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:30,559
deterministic i just had this sort of
 

3545
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,390
deterministic i just had this sort of
intuition for a long time i'm not sure

3546
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
intuition for a long time i'm not sure
 

3547
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,230
intuition for a long time i'm not sure
if i agree with it anymore but it's

3548
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
if i agree with it anymore but it's
 

3549
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,670
if i agree with it anymore but it's
still kind of lingering and i don't know

3550
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:35,680
still kind of lingering and i don't know
 

3551
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,589
still kind of lingering and i don't know
what to do with this question but it

3552
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:37,599
what to do with this question but it
 

3553
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,990
what to do with this question but it
seems to me you know so there's you ask

3554
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,000
seems to me you know so there's you ask
 

3555
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,750
seems to me you know so there's you ask
the question what is life but you could

3556
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:41,760
the question what is life but you could
 

3557
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,910
the question what is life but you could
also why life why does life exist what

3558
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:43,920
also why life why does life exist what
 

3559
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,750
also why life why does life exist what
does the universe need life for not that

3560
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:45,760
does the universe need life for not that
 

3561
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,190
does the universe need life for not that
the universe has needs but you know we

3562
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:47,200
the universe has needs but you know we
 

3563
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,390
the universe has needs but you know we
have to anthropocentrize things

3564
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:48,400
have to anthropocentrize things
 

3565
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,270
have to anthropocentrize things
sometimes to talk about them um and i

3566
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,280
sometimes to talk about them um and i
 

3567
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,829
sometimes to talk about them um and i
had this feeling that if it was possible

3568
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:53,839
had this feeling that if it was possible
 

3569
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:54,710
had this feeling that if it was possible
for

3570
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:54,720
for
 

3571
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,789
for
a cup or a desk ornament or a phone on

3572
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:56,799
a cup or a desk ornament or a phone on
 

3573
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,789
a cup or a desk ornament or a phone on
mars to spontaneously fluctuate into

3574
00:58:58,789 --> 00:58:58,799
mars to spontaneously fluctuate into
 

3575
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,549
mars to spontaneously fluctuate into
existence the universe didn't need life

3576
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:00,559
existence the universe didn't need life
 

3577
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,990
existence the universe didn't need life
to create those objects it wasn't

3578
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:02,000
to create those objects it wasn't
 

3579
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,510
to create those objects it wasn't
necessary for their existence it was

3580
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:03,520
necessary for their existence it was
 

3581
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,470
necessary for their existence it was
just a random fluke event and so somehow

3582
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:06,480
just a random fluke event and so somehow
 

3583
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,470
just a random fluke event and so somehow
to me it seems that

3584
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:08,480
to me it seems that
 

3585
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,230
to me it seems that
it can't be that those things formed by

3586
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:10,240
it can't be that those things formed by
 

3587
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,470
it can't be that those things formed by
rand random processes they actually have

3588
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:12,480
rand random processes they actually have
 

3589
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,349
rand random processes they actually have
to have a set of causes that

3590
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:15,359
to have a set of causes that
 

3591
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,349
to have a set of causes that
accrue and form those things and they

3592
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:17,359
accrue and form those things and they
 

3593
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,190
accrue and form those things and they
have to have that history and so it

3594
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:19,200
have to have that history and so it
 

3595
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,670
have to have that history and so it
seems to me that that life was

3596
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,680
seems to me that that life was
 

3597
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,990
seems to me that that life was
somehow deeply related to the question

3598
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:24,000
somehow deeply related to the question
 

3599
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,069
somehow deeply related to the question
of whether the underlying rules of our

3600
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:26,079
of whether the underlying rules of our
 

3601
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,829
of whether the underlying rules of our
universe had randomness in them or they

3602
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:27,839
universe had randomness in them or they
 

3603
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,349
universe had randomness in them or they
were fully deterministic and in some

3604
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:29,359
were fully deterministic and in some
 

3605
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,109
were fully deterministic and in some
ways you can think about life as being

3606
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
ways you can think about life as being
 

3607
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,750
ways you can think about life as being
the most deterministic part of physics

3608
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:33,760
the most deterministic part of physics
 

3609
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,150
the most deterministic part of physics
because it's where the causes are

3610
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:36,160
because it's where the causes are
 

3611
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,109
because it's where the causes are
um

3612
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119
um
 

3613
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,230
um
precise in some sense um or most stable

3614
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:40,240
precise in some sense um or most stable
 

3615
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,870
precise in some sense um or most stable
so like most stable yes most reliable

3616
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:42,880
so like most stable yes most reliable
 

3617
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,190
so like most stable yes most reliable
most reliable for for our

3618
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:45,200
most reliable for for our
 

3619
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,190
most reliable for for our
for how we for the tools of physics but

3620
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:47,200
for how we for the tools of physics but
 

3621
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,270
for how we for the tools of physics but
what um right well so where's the

3622
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,280
what um right well so where's the
 

3623
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,430
what um right well so where's the
randomness come from then if okay so you

3624
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:51,440
randomness come from then if okay so you
 

3625
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,870
randomness come from then if okay so you
you were at

3626
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:52,880
you were at
 

3627
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,670
you were at
uh speaking with i've gone in a tangent

3628
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:55,680
uh speaking with i've gone in a tangent
 

3629
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,789
uh speaking with i've gone in a tangent
so i'm not sure where we are in the yeah

3630
00:59:58,789 --> 00:59:58,799
so i'm not sure where we are in the yeah
 

3631
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,789
so i'm not sure where we are in the yeah
all of the universe is a kind of tangent

3632
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
all of the universe is a kind of tangent
 

3633
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,829
all of the universe is a kind of tangent
so uh we're embracing the tangent so

3634
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:03,839
so uh we're embracing the tangent so
 

3635
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:05,430
so uh we're embracing the tangent so
free will

3636
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:05,440
free will
 

3637
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,190
free will
you believe

3638
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:07,200
you believe
 

3639
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,870
you believe
at this current time that you have free

3640
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:08,880
at this current time that you have free
 

3641
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,870
at this current time that you have free
will i believe my whole life i have free

3642
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:10,880
will i believe my whole life i have free
 

3643
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,510
will i believe my whole life i have free
will what is illusion

3644
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:13,520
will what is illusion
 

3645
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,109
will what is illusion
i still believe it you still believe it

3646
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
i still believe it you still believe it
 

3647
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,870
i still believe it you still believe it
so uh at the same time you think that

3648
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:18,880
so uh at the same time you think that
 

3649
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,789
so uh at the same time you think that
in your conception of the universe

3650
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:20,799
in your conception of the universe
 

3651
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:23,030
in your conception of the universe
causality seems to be pretty fundamental

3652
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040
causality seems to be pretty fundamental
 

3653
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,430
causality seems to be pretty fundamental
that's right which kind of wants the

3654
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
that's right which kind of wants the
 

3655
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,349
that's right which kind of wants the
universe to be deterministic

3656
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
universe to be deterministic
 

3657
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,190
universe to be deterministic
so how the heck

3658
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,200
so how the heck
 

3659
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,630
so how the heck
because i mean you think you have a free

3660
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:30,640
because i mean you think you have a free
 

3661
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,910
because i mean you think you have a free
will and yet you value causality

3662
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:33,920
will and yet you value causality
 

3663
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,109
will and yet you value causality
um

3664
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:35,119
um
 

3665
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,549
um
because i depart from the

3666
01:00:38,549 --> 01:00:38,559
because i depart from the
 

3667
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,630
because i depart from the
conception of physics that you can write

3668
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
conception of physics that you can write
 

3669
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,589
conception of physics that you can write
down

3670
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:41,599
down
 

3671
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,430
down
an initial condition and a fixed law of

01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
an initial condition and a fixed law of
 

3673
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,670
an initial condition and a fixed law of
motion and that will describe everything

3674
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:45,680
motion and that will describe everything
 

3675
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,589
motion and that will describe everything
there's no incompatibility if you are

3676
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:47,599
there's no incompatibility if you are
 

3677
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,670
there's no incompatibility if you are
willing to reject that assertion so

3678
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:49,680
willing to reject that assertion so
 

3679
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,589
willing to reject that assertion so
where is the randomness where's the

3680
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:51,599
where is the randomness where's the
 

3681
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,069
where is the randomness where's the
magic that gives birth to the free will

3682
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
magic that gives birth to the free will
 

3683
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:55,829
magic that gives birth to the free will
is it the randomness of the laws of

3684
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:55,839
is it the randomness of the laws of
 

3685
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:56,870
is it the randomness of the laws of
physics

3686
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
physics
 

3687
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,470
physics
no free um

3688
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,480
no free um
 

3689
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,630
no free um
in my mind what free will is is the fact

3690
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:00,640
in my mind what free will is is the fact
 

3691
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,589
in my mind what free will is is the fact
that i

3692
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:01,599
that i
 

3693
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,750
that i
i as a physical system have causal

01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,430
causal control over everything but i
have a certain set of things and i'm

3700
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:09,440
have a certain set of things and i'm
 

3701
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,390
have a certain set of things and i'm
also

3702
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:10,400
also
 

3703
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,349
also
um you know as i described sort of a

3704
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
um you know as i described sort of a
 

3705
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,190
um you know as i described sort of a
nexus of a particular set of histories

3706
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,200
nexus of a particular set of histories
 

3707
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,309
nexus of a particular set of histories
that exist in the universe on a

3708
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
that exist in the universe on a
 

3709
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,670
that exist in the universe on a
particular set of futures that might

3710
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:17,680
particular set of futures that might
 

3711
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,950
particular set of futures that might
exist

3712
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960
exist
 

3713
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,789
exist
and those futures that might exist are

3714
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:20,799
and those futures that might exist are
 

3715
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,190
and those futures that might exist are
in part specified by my physical

3716
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:23,200
in part specified by my physical
 

3717
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,349
in part specified by my physical
configuration as me

3718
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
configuration as me
 

3719
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:26,630
configuration as me
um and

3720
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:26,640
um and
 

3721
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,829
um and
therefore

3722
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:27,839
therefore
 

3723
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,750
therefore
you know it may not be free will in the

3724
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
you know it may not be free will in the
 

3725
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,349
you know it may not be free will in the
traditional sense i don't even know what

3726
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:31,359
traditional sense i don't even know what
 

3727
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,470
traditional sense i don't even know what
people mean when they're talking about

3728
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:32,480
people mean when they're talking about
 

3729
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,990
people mean when they're talking about
free will honestly it's like the whole

3730
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,000
free will honestly it's like the whole
 

3731
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,829
free will honestly it's like the whole
discussion is really muddled but in the

3732
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:35,839
discussion is really muddled but in the
 

3733
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:38,470
discussion is really muddled but in the
sense that i am a causal agent if you

3734
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
sense that i am a causal agent if you
 

3735
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,829
sense that i am a causal agent if you
want to call it that that exists in the

3736
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:39,839
want to call it that that exists in the
 

3737
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,510
want to call it that that exists in the
universe and there are certain things

3738
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
universe and there are certain things
 

3739
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,910
universe and there are certain things
that happen because i exist as me

3740
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
that happen because i exist as me
 

3741
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,349
that happen because i exist as me
then yes i have free will no but

3742
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:47,359
then yes i have free will no but
 

3743
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:48,710
then yes i have free will no but
do you

3744
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:48,720
do you
 

3745
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,630
do you
sarah have a choice about what's going

3746
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:50,640
sarah have a choice about what's going
 

3747
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,589
sarah have a choice about what's going
to happen next oh i see um if the

3748
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:53,599
to happen next oh i see um if the
 

3749
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,309
to happen next oh i see um if the
universe could i have if i run this yes

3750
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:56,319
universe could i have if i run this yes
 

3751
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,470
universe could i have if i run this yes
i think so you have a choice

3752
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:58,480
i think so you have a choice
 

3753
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,309
i think so you have a choice
where's the choice come from is it i

3754
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
where's the choice come from is it i
 

3755
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,670
where's the choice come from is it i
think that's related to the physics of

3756
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:01,680
think that's related to the physics of
 

3757
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,870
think that's related to the physics of
consciousness so one of the things i

3758
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:02,880
consciousness so one of the things i
 

3759
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,630
consciousness so one of the things i
didn't say about that i don't know maybe

3760
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:04,640
didn't say about that i don't know maybe
 

3761
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,390
didn't say about that i don't know maybe
this is me just being hopeful

3762
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
this is me just being hopeful
 

3763
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,150
this is me just being hopeful
um because i maybe i just want to have

3764
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,160
um because i maybe i just want to have
 

3765
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,750
um because i maybe i just want to have
free will but i don't think that we can

3766
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:09,760
free will but i don't think that we can
 

3767
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,270
free will but i don't think that we can
rule out the possibility because i don't

3768
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,280
rule out the possibility because i don't
 

3769
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,109
rule out the possibility because i don't
think that we understand enough about

3770
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:13,119
think that we understand enough about
 

3771
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,029
think that we understand enough about
any of these problems but i think one of

3772
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:15,039
any of these problems but i think one of
 

3773
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,309
any of these problems but i think one of
the things that's interesting for me

3774
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:16,319
the things that's interesting for me
 

3775
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,069
the things that's interesting for me
about the sort of inversion of the

3776
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:18,079
about the sort of inversion of the
 

3777
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:19,910
about the sort of inversion of the
question of consciousness that i

3778
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:19,920
question of consciousness that i
 

3779
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,029
question of consciousness that i
proposed

3780
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:21,039
proposed
 

3781
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,190
proposed
is one of the features that

3782
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:23,200
is one of the features that
 

3783
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,870
is one of the features that
that we do

3784
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:24,880
that we do
 

3785
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,190
that we do
is we have imagination right and people

3786
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,200
is we have imagination right and people
 

3787
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,630
is we have imagination right and people
don't think about imagination as a

3788
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640
don't think about imagination as a
 

3789
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,150
don't think about imagination as a
physical thing but it is a physical

3790
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:30,160
physical thing but it is a physical
 

3791
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,870
physical thing but it is a physical
thing it exists in the universe right um

3792
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:32,880
thing it exists in the universe right um
 

3793
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,470
thing it exists in the universe right um
and so i'm like really intrigued by the

3794
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
and so i'm like really intrigued by the
 

3795
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,789
and so i'm like really intrigued by the
fact that say humans for

3796
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
fact that say humans for
 

3797
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,230
fact that say humans for
you know another physical system could

3798
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:38,240
you know another physical system could
 

3799
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,670
you know another physical system could
do this too it's not special to humans

3800
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:39,680
do this too it's not special to humans
 

3801
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,390
do this too it's not special to humans
but uh you know for centuries imagined

3802
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,400
but uh you know for centuries imagined
 

3803
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,470
but uh you know for centuries imagined
flying machines and rockets and then we

3804
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:44,480
flying machines and rockets and then we
 

3805
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,069
flying machines and rockets and then we
finally built them right so they were

3806
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079
finally built them right so they were
 

3807
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,670
finally built them right so they were
they were represented in our minds and

3808
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:47,680
they were represented in our minds and
 

3809
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,990
they were represented in our minds and
on the pages of things that we drew

3810
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,000
on the pages of things that we drew
 

3811
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,510
on the pages of things that we drew
for hundreds of years before we could

3812
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:51,520
for hundreds of years before we could
 

3813
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,789
for hundreds of years before we could
build those physical objects in the

3814
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:52,799
build those physical objects in the
 

3815
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:53,910
build those physical objects in the
universe

3816
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
universe
 

3817
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,470
universe
but certainly the existence of rockets

3818
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:56,480
but certainly the existence of rockets
 

3819
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,789
but certainly the existence of rockets
is in part

3820
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799
is in part
 

3821
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,710
is in part
causally

3822
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
causally
 

3823
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,230
causally
you know caused by the fact that we

3824
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:02,240
you know caused by the fact that we
 

3825
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,589
you know caused by the fact that we
could imagine them

3826
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:03,599
could imagine them
 

3827
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,990
could imagine them
um and so um

3828
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,000
um and so um
 

3829
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,230
um and so um
so there seems to be this property that

3830
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:08,240
so there seems to be this property that
 

3831
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,309
so there seems to be this property that
some things don't exist they've never

3832
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
some things don't exist they've never
 

3833
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,069
some things don't exist they've never
physically existed in the universe but

3834
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
physically existed in the universe but
 

3835
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,670
physically existed in the universe but
we can imagine the possibility of them

3836
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:13,680
we can imagine the possibility of them
 

3837
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,390
we can imagine the possibility of them
existing and then cause them to exist

3838
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
existing and then cause them to exist
 

3839
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,789
existing and then cause them to exist
maybe individually or collectively um

3840
01:03:18,789 --> 01:03:18,799
maybe individually or collectively um
 

3841
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,109
maybe individually or collectively um
and i think that property is related to

3842
01:03:21,109 --> 01:03:21,119
and i think that property is related to
 

3843
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,630
and i think that property is related to
what i would say about having choice or

3844
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:22,640
what i would say about having choice or
 

3845
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,230
what i would say about having choice or
free will because that set of

3846
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:24,240
free will because that set of
 

3847
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,750
free will because that set of
possibilities that thing those set of

3848
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:25,760
possibilities that thing those set of
 

3849
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,750
possibilities that thing those set of
things that you can imagine is not

3850
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:27,760
things that you can imagine is not
 

3851
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,190
things that you can imagine is not
constrained to your local physical

3852
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:29,200
constrained to your local physical
 

3853
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,950
constrained to your local physical
environment and history and this is

3854
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
environment and history and this is
 

3855
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,150
environment and history and this is
what's a little bit different about

3856
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:32,160
what's a little bit different about
 

3857
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,789
what's a little bit different about
intelligence as we see it in humans and

3858

01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,309
the history of things it's seen in the

past but something happened with the
 

3869
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,549

01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,390
multicellular organisms that they don't
just have access to the past history of

01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:50,400
just have access to the past history of
 

3875
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,309
just have access to the past history of
their particular you know set of events

3876
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
their particular you know set of events
 

3877
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,390
their particular you know set of events
but they can imagine things that haven't

3878
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,400
but they can imagine things that haven't
 

3879
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,549
but they can imagine things that haven't
happened aren't on their timeline and as

01:03:56,549 --> 01:03:56,559
happened aren't on their timeline and as
 

3881
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:57,589

long as they're consistent with the laws

3882
01:03:57,589 --> 01:03:57,599
long as they're consistent with the laws
 

3883
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,510

so

3886
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:01,119
so
 

3887
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,950
so
this is fascinating

3888
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
this is fascinating

01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,349
this is fascinating

01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,150
in that same way maybe whatever the
physics of consciousness might be

3900
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:16,160
physics of consciousness might be
 

3901
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,829
physics of consciousness might be
it might be morphing that's like what

it might be morphing that's like what
 

3903
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,390
it might be morphing that's like what
free will is it's morphing like

3904
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:20,400
free will is it's morphing like
 

3905
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,589

01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:27,119
it's somehow
 

3911
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,750
it's somehow
changing the space of possible

3912
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:29,760
changing the space of possible
 

3913
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,470

3915
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,710

yeah okay but life is kind of basically

3916
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:34,720
yeah okay but life is kind of basically
 

3917
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,910
yeah okay but life is kind of basically
if you want to think about it like life

3918
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:35,920
if you want to think about it like life
 

3919
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,750
if you want to think about it like life
is sort of changing the probability

3920
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:37,760
is sort of changing the probability
 

3921
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,349
is sort of changing the probability

3923
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,510
distributions over what can exist that's
the physics of what life is and then

3924
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:41,520
the physics of what life is and then
 

3925
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,950
the physics of what life is and then
consciousness is a sort of layered

don't i don't know it's it's kind of

3934
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
don't i don't know it's it's kind of
 

3935
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,710
don't i don't know it's it's kind of
it we don't know how to describe it

it we don't know how to describe it
 

3937
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,910
it we don't know how to describe it
right like that's why it's interesting

3938
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:53,920
right like that's why it's interesting
 

3939
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,990
right like that's why it's interesting
but it's probabilistic so you do think

01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,000
but it's probabilistic so you do think
 

3941
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,870
but it's probabilistic so you do think
like god plays dice so let me um no i

know what concepts to hold on to so i
 

3969
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,069

3973
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,069

maybe you can talk to the theory of

01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,670
maybe you can talk to the theory of
everything uh the this attempt in the

everything uh the this attempt in the
 

3995
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,670
everything uh the this attempt in the
current set of physical laws to try to

current set of physical laws to try to
 

3997
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,109
current set of physical laws to try to
unify them is there any hope that

01:05:53,109 --> 01:05:53,119
unify them is there any hope that
 

3999
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:53,990
unify them is there any hope that
once

once
 

4001
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,910
once
a theory of everything is developed and

01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,349
a theory of everything is developed and
by theory of everything i mean in a

like in order to do that unification you

4012
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
like in order to do that unification you
 

4013
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,950
like in order to do that unification you
would have to get something that would

would have to get something that would

01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,870
then give hints about the physics of
life physics of existence

4018
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:14,880
life physics of existence
 

4019
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,630
life physics of existence
physics of consciousness yeah

4020
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:16,640
physics of consciousness yeah
 

4021
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,510
physics of consciousness yeah
i used to not but i actually uh i have

4022
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:19,520
i used to not but i actually uh i have
 

4023
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,910
i used to not but i actually uh i have
become increasingly convinced that

4024
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:21,920
become increasingly convinced that
 

4025
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,750
become increasingly convinced that
it probably will

4026
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:23,760
it probably will
 

4027
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,150
it probably will
um and part of the reason is um i think

4028
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,160
um and part of the reason is um i think
 

4029
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,990
um and part of the reason is um i think
i've talked a little bit already about

4030
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:28,000
i've talked a little bit already about
 

4031
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,150
i've talked a little bit already about
these holes in physics like these

4032
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:30,160
these holes in physics like these
 

4033
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,630
these holes in physics like these
the the theories we have in physics you

4034
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:32,640
the the theories we have in physics you
 

4035
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,150
the the theories we have in physics you
know they have problems they have lots

4036
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,160
know they have problems they have lots
 

4037
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,309
know they have problems they have lots
of problems um and they're very deep

4038
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:36,319
of problems um and they're very deep
 

4039
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:37,910
of problems um and they're very deep
problems um and we don't know how to

4040
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
problems um and we don't know how to
 

4041
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,309
problems um and we don't know how to
patch them um and some of those problems

4042
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
patch them um and some of those problems
 

4043
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:41,670
patch them um and some of those problems
become very evident when you try to

4044
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:41,680
become very evident when you try to
 

4045
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,670
become very evident when you try to
patch um quantum mechanics and general

4046
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:43,680
patch um quantum mechanics and general
 

4047
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,589
patch um quantum mechanics and general
relativity together

4048
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
relativity together
 

4049
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,109
relativity together
so there is this kind of interesting

4050
01:06:47,109 --> 01:06:47,119
so there is this kind of interesting
 

4051
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,710
so there is this kind of interesting
feature that some of the ways of

4052
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:48,720
feature that some of the ways of
 

4053
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,910
feature that some of the ways of
patching that might actually um closely

4054
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:51,920
patching that might actually um closely
 

4055
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,029
patching that might actually um closely
resemble

4056
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039
resemble
 

4057
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,710
resemble
uh the physics of life and so the place

4058
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:54,720
uh the physics of life and so the place
 

4059
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,630
uh the physics of life and so the place
where that actually comes up most and

4060
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:56,640
where that actually comes up most and
 

4061
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,150
where that actually comes up most and
actually we just had a workshop in the

4062
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:58,160
actually we just had a workshop in the
 

4063
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,349
actually we just had a workshop in the

um and lee smolin made this point that

4068
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,160
um and lee smolin made this point that
 

4069
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,829
um and lee smolin made this point that
he thinks that the theory of quantum

4070
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:03,839
he thinks that the theory of quantum
 

4071
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,349
he thinks that the theory of quantum
gravity when we solve it is going to be

4072
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:05,359
gravity when we solve it is going to be
 

4073
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,829
gravity when we solve it is going to be
the same theory that gives rise to life

4074
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:07,839
the same theory that gives rise to life
 

4075
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,710
the same theory that gives rise to life
um and i think that i agree with him on

4076
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:10,720
um and i think that i agree with him on
 

4077
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,990
um and i think that i agree with him on
some levels because there's something

4078
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,000
some levels because there's something
 

4079
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,150
some levels because there's something
very interesting where if you look at

4080
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,160
very interesting where if you look at
 

4081
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,230
very interesting where if you look at
these sort of causal set theories of

4082
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:16,240
these sort of causal set theories of
 

4083
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,870
these sort of causal set theories of
gravity where they're looking for space

4084
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:18,880
gravity where they're looking for space
 

4085
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,150
gravity where they're looking for space
um

4086
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:20,160
um
 

4087
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,670
um
as being emergent

4088
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:21,680
as being emergent
 

4089
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,510
as being emergent
and so space time is an emergent concept

4090
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,520
and so space time is an emergent concept
 

4091
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,670
and so space time is an emergent concept
from a causal set which is is also sort

4092
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:25,680
from a causal set which is is also sort
 

4093
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,109
from a causal set which is is also sort
of related i think to what wolfram's

4094
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:27,119
of related i think to what wolfram's
 

4095
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,349
of related i think to what wolfram's
doing with his physics project um it's

4096
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:29,359
doing with his physics project um it's
 

4097
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:30,950
doing with his physics project um it's
the same kind of underlying math that we

4098
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:30,960
the same kind of underlying math that we
 

4099
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,309
the same kind of underlying math that we
have in in this theory that we've been

4100
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:32,319
have in in this theory that we've been
 

4101
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,750
have in in this theory that we've been
developing related to life called

4102
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:33,760
developing related to life called
 

4103
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,549
developing related to life called
assembly theory um which is you know

4104
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:36,559
assembly theory um which is you know
 

4105
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,870
assembly theory um which is you know
basically trying to look at

4106
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:38,880
basically trying to look at
 

4107
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,990
basically trying to look at
complex objects like molecules and

4108
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,000
complex objects like molecules and
 

4109
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,150
complex objects like molecules and
bacteria and living things

4110
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,160

as
sort of uh

4114
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:47,520
sort of uh
 

4115
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,069
sort of uh
as basically being assembled from a set

4116
01:07:50,069 --> 01:07:50,079
as basically being assembled from a set
 

4117
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,230
as basically being assembled from a set
of component parts

4118
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:52,240
of component parts
 

4119
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,750
of component parts
and that they actually encode all the

4120
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:53,760
and that they actually encode all the
 

4121
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,270
and that they actually encode all the
possible histories that they could have

4122
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:55,280
possible histories that they could have
 

4123
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,510
possible histories that they could have
in that physical object so the

4124
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:57,520
in that physical object so the
 

4125
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,950
in that physical object so the
mathematically all these ideas i think

4126
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960
mathematically all these ideas i think
 

4127
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,069
mathematically all these ideas i think
are related i think a lot of people are

4128
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:00,079
are related i think a lot of people are
 

4129
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,349
are related i think a lot of people are
thinking about this from

thinking about this from
 

4131
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:02,309
thinking about this from
different perspectives and then

think getting at some similar ideas so

4140
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:09,119
think getting at some similar ideas so
 

4141
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,309
think getting at some similar ideas so
it's a really interesting time right now

4142
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:10,319
it's a really interesting time right now
 

4143
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,150
it's a really interesting time right now
i think for the frontiers of physics and

01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,230
i think for the frontiers of physics and
how it's relating um to maybe deeper

is
 

4163
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,510
is
to ask what should we look for in alien

01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:50,719
is there
 

4179
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,709
is there
like set of rules

4180
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:52,719
like set of rules
 

4181
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,349
like set of rules
uh like it's both the tools

4182
01:08:55,349 --> 01:08:55,359
uh like it's both the tools
 

4183
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,990
uh like it's both the tools
and the tools that are

4184
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
and the tools that are
 

4185
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,910
and the tools that are
service census for certain kind of

4186
01:08:59,910 --> 01:08:59,920
service census for certain kind of
 

4187
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,590
service census for certain kind of
properties of life

4188
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:01,600
properties of life
 

4189
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,149
properties of life
so what should we look for

4190
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:04,159
so what should we look for
 

4191
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:06,630
so what should we look for
in alien life yeah so we have a paper

4192
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:06,640
in alien life yeah so we have a paper
 

4193
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,229
in alien life yeah so we have a paper
actually coming out monday which is

4194
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:08,239
actually coming out monday which is
 

4195
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,470
actually coming out monday which is
collaboration um it's actually really

4196
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
collaboration um it's actually really
 

4197
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,390
collaboration um it's actually really
lee cronin's lab but my group worked

4198
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:12,400
lee cronin's lab but my group worked
 

4199
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,430
lee cronin's lab but my group worked
with him on it and we're working on the

4200
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:13,440
with him on it and we're working on the
 

4201
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,749
with him on it and we're working on the
theory which is this idea that we should

4202
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
theory which is this idea that we should
 

4203
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:16,630
theory which is this idea that we should
look

4204
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:16,640
look
 

4205
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,229
look
for life um as high assembly objects

4206
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:20,239
for life um as high assembly objects
 

4207
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,229
for life um as high assembly objects
what we mean by that is

4208
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:22,239
what we mean by that is
 

4209
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:23,829
what we mean by that is
which is actually observationally

4210
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:23,839
which is actually observationally
 

4211
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,870
which is actually observationally
measurable and this is one of the

4212
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:24,880
measurable and this is one of the
 

4213
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,470
measurable and this is one of the
reasons that i started working with leon

4214
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,480
reasons that i started working with leon
 

4215
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,709
reasons that i started working with leon
these ideas is because being a theorist

4216
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:28,719
these ideas is because being a theorist
 

4217
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,390
these ideas is because being a theorist
it's easy to work in a vacuum it's very

4218
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:30,400
it's easy to work in a vacuum it's very
 

4219
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,709
it's easy to work in a vacuum it's very
hard to connect abstract ideas about the

4220
01:09:32,709 --> 01:09:32,719
hard to connect abstract ideas about the
 

4221
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,229
hard to connect abstract ideas about the
nature of life to anything that's

4222
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:34,239
nature of life to anything that's
 

4223
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:36,789
nature of life to anything that's
experimentally tractable

4224
01:09:36,789 --> 01:09:36,799
experimentally tractable
 

4225
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,669
experimentally tractable
but what his lab has been able to do is

4226
01:09:39,669 --> 01:09:39,679
but what his lab has been able to do is
 

4227
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,309
but what his lab has been able to do is
develop this method where they look at a

4228
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:42,319
develop this method where they look at a
 

4229
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,630
develop this method where they look at a
molecule and they break it apart into

4230
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:44,640
molecule and they break it apart into
 

4231
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,630
molecule and they break it apart into
all its component parts and so you say

4232
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:46,640
all its component parts and so you say
 

4233
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,309
all its component parts and so you say
you have some elementary building blocks

4234
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:48,319
you have some elementary building blocks
 

4235
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,309
you have some elementary building blocks
and you can build up all the ways of

4236
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:50,319
and you can build up all the ways of
 

4237
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,430
and you can build up all the ways of
putting those together to make the

4238
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:51,440
putting those together to make the
 

4239
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,269
putting those together to make the
original object and then you look for

4240
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:53,279
original object and then you look for
 

4241
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,510
original object and then you look for
the shortest path in that space

4242
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:55,520
the shortest path in that space
 

4243
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,550
the shortest path in that space
and you say that's sort of the assembly

4244
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:58,560
and you say that's sort of the assembly
 

4245
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,270
and you say that's sort of the assembly
number associated to that object

4246
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
number associated to that object
 

4247
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,510
number associated to that object
and if that number's higher it assumes

4248
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:03,520
and if that number's higher it assumes
 

4249
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,990
and if that number's higher it assumes
that a longer causal history is

4250
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:06,000
that a longer causal history is
 

4251
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,750
that a longer causal history is
necessary to produce that object or more

4252
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:07,760
necessary to produce that object or more
 

4253
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,669
necessary to produce that object or more
information is necessary to specify the

4254
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:09,679
information is necessary to specify the
 

4255
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,350
information is necessary to specify the
creation of that object in the universe

4256
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:11,360
creation of that object in the universe
 

4257
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,870
creation of that object in the universe
now that kind of

4258
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:12,880
now that kind of
 

4259
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,709
now that kind of
idea at a superficial level has existed

4260
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
idea at a superficial level has existed
 

4261
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,189
idea at a superficial level has existed
for a long time that kind of idea as a

4262
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:17,199
for a long time that kind of idea as a
 

4263
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,669
for a long time that kind of idea as a
physical observable of molecules is

4264
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:19,679
physical observable of molecules is
 

4265
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,510
physical observable of molecules is
completely novel and what his lab has

4266
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
completely novel and what his lab has
 

4267
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,790
completely novel and what his lab has
been able to show

4268
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800
been able to show
 

4269
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,990
been able to show
is that if you look at a bunch of

4270
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:24,000
is that if you look at a bunch of
 

4271
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,750
is that if you look at a bunch of
samples of non-biological things and

4272
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:25,760
samples of non-biological things and
 

4273
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,189
samples of non-biological things and
biological things there's this kind of

4274
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:28,199
biological things there's this kind of
 

4275
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:29,990
biological things there's this kind of
threshold

4276
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,000
threshold
 

4277
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,550
threshold
of assembly where

4278
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:32,560
of assembly where
 

4279
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,790
of assembly where
as far as the experimental evidence is

4280
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:34,800
as far as the experimental evidence is
 

4281
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,030
as far as the experimental evidence is
and also your intuitive intuition would

4282
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:37,040
and also your intuitive intuition would
 

4283
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,070
and also your intuitive intuition would
suggest

4284
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
suggest
 

4285
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,470
suggest
that by non-biological systems don't

4286
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:40,480
that by non-biological systems don't
 

4287
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,189
that by non-biological systems don't
produce things with high assembly number

4288
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:43,199
produce things with high assembly number
 

4289
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,030
produce things with high assembly number
so this goes back to the idea like a

4290
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,040
so this goes back to the idea like a
 

4291
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,550
so this goes back to the idea like a
protein is not going to spontaneously

4292
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560
protein is not going to spontaneously
 

4293
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,149
protein is not going to spontaneously
fluctuate into existence on the surface

4294
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:48,159
fluctuate into existence on the surface
 

4295
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,590
fluctuate into existence on the surface
of mars it requires an evolutionary

4296
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:49,600
of mars it requires an evolutionary
 

4297
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,270
of mars it requires an evolutionary
process and a biological architecture to

4298
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:51,280
process and a biological architecture to
 

4299
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,430
process and a biological architecture to
produce a protein you generalize that

4300
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:53,440
produce a protein you generalize that
 

4301
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,070
produce a protein you generalize that
argument you know a complex molecule

4302
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:56,080
argument you know a complex molecule
 

4303
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,790
argument you know a complex molecule
or a cup or a desk ornament

4304
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:58,800
or a cup or a desk ornament
 

4305
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,310
or a cup or a desk ornament
in this sort of abstract idea of

4306
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,320
in this sort of abstract idea of
 

4307
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,430
in this sort of abstract idea of
assembly spaces as being the causal

4308
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,440
assembly spaces as being the causal
 

4309
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,110
assembly spaces as being the causal
history of objects and you can talk

4310
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:05,120
history of objects and you can talk
 

4311
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,270
history of objects and you can talk
about the shortest path from elementary

4312
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,280
about the shortest path from elementary
 

4313
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,350
about the shortest path from elementary
objects to an object given an elementary

4314
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
objects to an object given an elementary
 

4315
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,870
objects to an object given an elementary
set of operations

4316
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:10,880
set of operations
 

4317
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,189
set of operations
and you can experimentally measure that

4318
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:13,199
and you can experimentally measure that
 

4319
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,189
and you can experimentally measure that
with mass spec and that's basically sort

4320
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:15,199
with mass spec and that's basically sort
 

4321
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,750
with mass spec and that's basically sort
of the idea that's really fascinating i

4322
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:17,760
of the idea that's really fascinating i
 

4323
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,430
of the idea that's really fascinating i
can't get out of my head and start

4324
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
can't get out of my head and start
 

4325
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,669
can't get out of my head and start
imagining legos and all the legos i've

4326
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:21,679
imagining legos and all the legos i've
 

4327
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,510
imagining legos and all the legos i've
ever built and how many steps what is

4328
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:23,520
ever built and how many steps what is
 

4329
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,669
ever built and how many steps what is
the shortest path to the final right

4330
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679
the shortest path to the final right
 

4331
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,310
the shortest path to the final right
right to find a little lego castles

4332
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:28,320
right to find a little lego castles
 

4333
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,470
right to find a little lego castles
so they so yeah so then like asking

4334
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:30,480
so they so yeah so then like asking
 

4335
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,830
so they so yeah so then like asking
about going to look for alien life the

4336
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:31,840
about going to look for alien life the
 

4337
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,110
about going to look for alien life the
idea is

01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
idea is

01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,110
idea is
you know most the instruments that nasa

4340
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
you know most the instruments that nasa
 

4341
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,870
you know most the instruments that nasa
builds for example or any of the space

agencies looking for life in the

4344
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:38,080
agencies looking for life in the
 

4345
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,390
agencies looking for life in the
universe are looking for chemical

4346
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:40,400
universe are looking for chemical
 

4347
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,470
universe are looking for chemical
correlates of life right but here we

4348
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:42,480
correlates of life right but here we
 

4349
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,310
correlates of life right but here we
have something that

4350
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:44,320
have something that
 

4351
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,390
have something that
is based on properties of molecules it's

4352
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:46,400
is based on properties of molecules it's
 

4353
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,030
is based on properties of molecules it's
not a chemical correlate it's agnostic

4354
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040
not a chemical correlate it's agnostic
 

4355
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,470
not a chemical correlate it's agnostic
it doesn't care about the molecule it

4356
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:50,480
it doesn't care about the molecule it
 

4357
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,830
it doesn't care about the molecule it
cares about

4358
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:51,840
cares about
 

4359
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,550
cares about
what is the history necessary to produce

4360
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:54,560
what is the history necessary to produce
 

4361
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,229
what is the history necessary to produce
this molecule

4362
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:56,239
this molecule
 

4363
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,910
this molecule
how complex is it in terms of how much

4364
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:57,920
how complex is it in terms of how much
 

4365
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,830
how complex is it in terms of how much
time is needing how much information is

4366
01:11:59,830 --> 01:11:59,840
time is needing how much information is
 

4367
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,430
time is needing how much information is
required to produce it so when you

4368
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
required to produce it so when you
 

4369
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,709
required to produce it so when you
observe a thing on another planet you're

4370
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:04,719
observe a thing on another planet you're
 

4371
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,390
observe a thing on another planet you're
essentially

4372
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:06,400
essentially
 

4373
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,830
essentially
the process looks like reverse

4374
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
the process looks like reverse
 

4375
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,510
the process looks like reverse
engineering trying to figure out what is

4376
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:09,520
engineering trying to figure out what is
 

4377
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,510
engineering trying to figure out what is
the shortest path to create that thing

4378
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
the shortest path to create that thing
 

4379
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,229
the shortest path to create that thing
yeah so most yeah and i would say most

4380
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:14,239
yeah so most yeah and i would say most
 

4381
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,070
yeah so most yeah and i would say most
like most examples of biology or

4382
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,080
like most examples of biology or
 

4383
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,669
like most examples of biology or
technology don't take the shortest path

4384
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:17,679
technology don't take the shortest path
 

4385
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,189
technology don't take the shortest path
right but the shortest path is a bound

4386
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:19,199
right but the shortest path is a bound
 

4387
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,630
right but the shortest path is a bound
on how hard it is for the universe to

4388
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:20,640
on how hard it is for the universe to
 

4389
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,910
on how hard it is for the universe to
make that yeah and so i guess what you

4390
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:23,920
make that yeah and so i guess what you
 

4391
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,510
make that yeah and so i guess what you
and lee are saying that there's a

4392
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:25,520
and lee are saying that there's a
 

4393
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,750
and lee are saying that there's a
heuristic that's a good

4394
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:27,760
heuristic that's a good
 

4395
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,470
heuristic that's a good
metric for uh like better perhaps than

4396
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
metric for uh like better perhaps than
 

4397
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,870
metric for uh like better perhaps than
chemical correlates yes because it

4398
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:32,880
chemical correlates yes because it
 

4399
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,189
chemical correlates yes because it
doesn't it's not contingent on looking

4400
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:35,199
doesn't it's not contingent on looking
 

4401
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,590
doesn't it's not contingent on looking
for the chemistry of life on earth on

4402
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:37,600
for the chemistry of life on earth on
 

4403
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,870
for the chemistry of life on earth on
other planets

4404
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
other planets
 

4405
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,510
other planets
and it also has a deeper explanatory

4406
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520
and it also has a deeper explanatory
 

4407
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,750
and it also has a deeper explanatory
framework associated to it as far as the

4408
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:43,760
framework associated to it as far as the
 

4409
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,110
framework associated to it as far as the
kind of theory that we're trying to

4410
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
kind of theory that we're trying to
 

4411
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,350
kind of theory that we're trying to
develop associated to what life is and i

4412
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
develop associated to what life is and i
 

4413
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,870
develop associated to what life is and i
think this is one of the problems i have

4414
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:48,880
think this is one of the problems i have
 

4415
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,310
think this is one of the problems i have
in my my field personally in

4416
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:50,320
in my my field personally in
 

4417
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,030
in my my field personally in
astrobiology is people observe something

4418
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:53,040
astrobiology is people observe something
 

4419
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,149
astrobiology is people observe something
on earth say oxygen in the atmosphere or

4420
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:56,159
on earth say oxygen in the atmosphere or
 

4421
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,870
on earth say oxygen in the atmosphere or
an amino acid in a cell and then they

4422
01:12:58,870 --> 01:12:58,880
an amino acid in a cell and then they
 

4423
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,950
an amino acid in a cell and then they
say let's go look for that on another

4424
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960
say let's go look for that on another
 

4425
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,149
say let's go look for that on another
planet

4426
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:02,159
planet
 

4427
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,149
planet
let's look for oxygen on exoplanets or

4428
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:04,159
let's look for oxygen on exoplanets or
 

4429
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,310
let's look for oxygen on exoplanets or
let's look for amino acids on mars and

4430
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:06,320
let's look for amino acids on mars and
 

4431
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,310
let's look for amino acids on mars and
then they assume that's a way of looking

4432
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:08,320
then they assume that's a way of looking
 

4433
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,350
then they assume that's a way of looking
for life

4434
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,360
for life
 

4435
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,550
for life
um

4436
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:10,560
um
 

4437
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,990
um
and it

4438
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,000
and it
 

4439
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,070
and it
or even phosphine on venus but you know

4440
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:14,080
or even phosphine on venus but you know
 

4441
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,430
or even phosphine on venus but you know
like there's all these examples of let's

4442
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440
like there's all these examples of let's
 

4443
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,990
like there's all these examples of let's
look for one molecule a molecule is not

4444
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,000
look for one molecule a molecule is not
 

4445
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,870
look for one molecule a molecule is not
life life is a system that patterns

4446
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:20,880
life life is a system that patterns
 

4447
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,550
life life is a system that patterns
particular structures into matter that's

4448
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:22,560
particular structures into matter that's
 

4449
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,790
particular structures into matter that's
like it's that's what it is and it

4450
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:24,800
like it's that's what it is and it
 

4451
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,630
like it's that's what it is and it
doesn't care what molecules are there

4452
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:26,640
doesn't care what molecules are there
 

4453
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,310
doesn't care what molecules are there
it's something about the patterns and

4454
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,320
it's something about the patterns and
 

4455
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,189
it's something about the patterns and
and that structure and that history um

4456
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:31,199
and that structure and that history um
 

4457
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,110
and that structure and that history um
and if you're looking for a molecule

4458
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:33,120
and if you're looking for a molecule
 

4459
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,790
and if you're looking for a molecule
you're not testing any hypotheses about

4460
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:34,800
you're not testing any hypotheses about
 

4461
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,470
you're not testing any hypotheses about
the nature of what life is it doesn't

4462
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:36,480
the nature of what life is it doesn't
 

4463
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,390
the nature of what life is it doesn't
tell me anything if we discover oxygen

4464
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:38,400
tell me anything if we discover oxygen
 

4465
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,830
tell me anything if we discover oxygen
and exoplanet about what kind of life is

4466
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:39,840
and exoplanet about what kind of life is
 

4467
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,149
and exoplanet about what kind of life is
there just oxygen on an exoplanet it's

4468
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:42,159
there just oxygen on an exoplanet it's
 

4469
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,070
there just oxygen on an exoplanet it's
not there there's

4470
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,080
not there there's
 

4471
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,830
not there there's
i i guess i think like when you think

4472
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:45,840
i i guess i think like when you think
 

4473
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,350
i i guess i think like when you think
about the question are we alone in the

4474
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:47,360
about the question are we alone in the
 

4475
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,030
about the question are we alone in the
universe that's a pretty freaking deep

4476
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
universe that's a pretty freaking deep
 

4477
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,550
universe that's a pretty freaking deep
question it should have a freaking deep

4478
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,560
question it should have a freaking deep
 

4479
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,830
question it should have a freaking deep
answer it shouldn't just be there's a

4480
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:51,840
answer it shouldn't just be there's a
 

4481
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,590
answer it shouldn't just be there's a
molecule and an exoplanet wow we solved

4482
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:53,600
molecule and an exoplanet wow we solved
 

4483
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,189
molecule and an exoplanet wow we solved
the problem it should tell us something

4484
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:55,199
the problem it should tell us something
 

4485
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,709
the problem it should tell us something
meaningful about our existence and i

4486
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:56,719
meaningful about our existence and i
 

4487
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,510
meaningful about our existence and i
feel like we've fallen short on how

4488
01:13:59,510 --> 01:13:59,520
feel like we've fallen short on how
 

4489
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,669
feel like we've fallen short on how
we're searching for life in terms of

we're searching for life in terms of
 

4491
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:05,189
we're searching for life in terms of
actually searching for things like us

actually searching for things like us
 

4493
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,229
actually searching for things like us
in this kind of deeper way

in this kind of deeper way
but how do you do that initial kind of

4496
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
but how do you do that initial kind of
 

4497
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,470
but how do you do that initial kind of
say i'm walking down the street and i'm

4498
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:12,480
say i'm walking down the street and i'm
 

4499
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,470
say i'm walking down the street and i'm
looking for that double take test of

4500
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:14,480
looking for that double take test of
 

4501
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,430
looking for that double take test of
like

4502
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:15,440
like
 

4503
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,830
like
like what the hell is that like that

4504
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:17,840
like what the hell is that like that
 

4505
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,590
like what the hell is that like that
that initial

4506
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:19,600
that initial
 

4507
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,149
that initial
like how do we look for

4508
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:22,159
like how do we look for
 

4509
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,310
like how do we look for
the possibility of weirdness at the

4510
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:24,320
the possibility of weirdness at the
 

4511
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,709
the possibility of weirdness at the
possibility of high assembly number well

4512
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:26,719
possibility of high assembly number well
 

4513
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:29,990
possibility of high assembly number well
yeah

4514
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000

 

4515
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,310

if they don't have two eyes and are

4516
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:32,320
if they don't have two eyes and are
 

4517
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,350
if they don't have two eyes and are
green

4518
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:33,360
green
 

4519
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,630
green
you know i would have probably already

4520
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:34,640
you know i would have probably already
 

4521
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,310
you know i would have probably already
solved the problem right there's another

4522
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,320
solved the problem right there's another
 

4523
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,910
solved the problem right there's another
nobel prize in there somewhere i think

4524
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:37,920
nobel prize in there somewhere i think
 

4525
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,709
nobel prize in there somewhere i think
actually

4526
01:14:38,709 --> 01:14:38,719
actually
 

4527
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,750
actually
um

4528
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,760
um
 

4529
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,750
um
well i think it's it's kind of so so

4530
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
well i think it's it's kind of so so
 

4531
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,910
well i think it's it's kind of so so
there is a bias here right so

4532
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:43,920
there is a bias here right so
 

4533
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,590
there is a bias here right so
we've evolved to recognize life on earth

4534
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600
we've evolved to recognize life on earth
 

4535
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,830
we've evolved to recognize life on earth
right like i you know children at a very

4536
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:47,840
right like i you know children at a very
 

4537
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,270
right like i you know children at a very
early age can tell the difference

4538
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:49,280
early age can tell the difference
 

4539
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,189
early age can tell the difference
between a puppy and a plant and then the

4540
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:51,199
between a puppy and a plant and then the
 

4541
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,590
between a puppy and a plant and then the
plant and a chair for example you know

4542
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:53,600
plant and a chair for example you know
 

4543
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,630
plant and a chair for example you know
like it just it seems innate um and so i

4544
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
like it just it seems innate um and so i
 

4545
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,790
like it just it seems innate um and so i
think and also because we're life

4546
01:14:58,790 --> 01:14:58,800
think and also because we're life
 

4547
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,830
think and also because we're life
um

4548
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840
um
 

4549
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,669
um
you know i think like there's this

4550
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
you know i think like there's this
 

4551
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:03,110
you know i think like there's this
implicit bias that we should know it

4552
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:03,120
implicit bias that we should know it
 

4553
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,229
implicit bias that we should know it
when we see it and it should be

4554
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239
when we see it and it should be
 

4555
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,229
when we see it and it should be
completely obvious to us

4556
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:06,239
completely obvious to us
 

4557
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:07,830
completely obvious to us
um but there are a lot of features of

4558
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:07,840
um but there are a lot of features of
 

4559
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,669
um but there are a lot of features of
our universe that are not completely

4560
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:09,679
our universe that are not completely
 

4561
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:11,110
our universe that are not completely
obvious to us like the fact that this

4562
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:11,120
obvious to us like the fact that this
 

4563
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,270
obvious to us like the fact that this
table is made of atoms and that i'm

4564
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:13,280
table is made of atoms and that i'm
 

4565
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,870
table is made of atoms and that i'm
sitting in a gravitational potential

4566
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:14,880
sitting in a gravitational potential
 

4567
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,310
sitting in a gravitational potential
well right now um and i guess um

4568
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:18,320
well right now um and i guess um
 

4569
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,229
well right now um and i guess um
my point with this is i think life is

4570
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,239
my point with this is i think life is
 

4571
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,030
my point with this is i think life is
much

4572
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:21,040
much
 

4573
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,510
much
less obvious than we think it is

4574
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:23,520
less obvious than we think it is
 

4575
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,110
less obvious than we think it is
and so it could be in many more forms

4576
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
and so it could be in many more forms
 

4577
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,910
and so it could be in many more forms
than we think it is um and i guess let's

4578
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:27,920
than we think it is um and i guess let's
 

4579
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,110
than we think it is um and i guess let's
go back to the point about being

4580
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120
go back to the point about being
 

4581
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,750
go back to the point about being
open-minded that we may not know what

4582
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:31,760
open-minded that we may not know what
 

4583
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,510
open-minded that we may not know what
alien life looks like it might not even

4584
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
alien life looks like it might not even
 

4585
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,350
alien life looks like it might not even
be possible to interact with alien life

4586
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:35,360
be possible to interact with alien life
 

4587
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,470
be possible to interact with alien life
because maybe

4588
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
because maybe
 

4589
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,709
because maybe
something about you know our our

4590
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
something about you know our our
 

4591
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,470
something about you know our our
informational lineage it makes it

4592
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:40,480
informational lineage it makes it
 

4593
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,790
informational lineage it makes it
impossible for information from an alien

4594
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:42,800
impossible for information from an alien
 

4595
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,030
impossible for information from an alien
to be copied to us therefore there's no

4596
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
to be copied to us therefore there's no
 

4597
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,229
to be copied to us therefore there's no
you know

4598
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:46,239
you know
 

4599
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:47,830
you know
so to speak communication channel and i

4600
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:47,840
so to speak communication channel and i
 

4601
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,750
so to speak communication channel and i
don't mean you know verbal communication

4602
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,760
don't mean you know verbal communication
 

4603
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,630
don't mean you know verbal communication
just

4604
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:50,640
just
 

4605
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,510
just
it's not in our observational space like

4606
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
it's not in our observational space like
 

4607
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,350
it's not in our observational space like
you know like you know there's there's

4608
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:55,360
you know like you know there's there's
 

4609
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,870
you know like you know there's there's
fundamental questions about why we

4610
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:56,880
fundamental questions about why we
 

4611
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,229
fundamental questions about why we
observe the universe in position rather

4612
01:15:58,229 --> 01:15:58,239
observe the universe in position rather
 

4613
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,709
observe the universe in position rather
than momentum but we also you know

4614
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
than momentum but we also you know
 

4615
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,070
than momentum but we also you know
observe it in terms of certain

4616
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,080
observe it in terms of certain
 

4617
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,669
observe it in terms of certain
informational patterns and things like

4618
01:16:03,669 --> 01:16:03,679
informational patterns and things like
 

4619
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:04,950
informational patterns and things like
that's what our brain constructs and

4620
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:04,960
that's what our brain constructs and
 

4621
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,430
that's what our brain constructs and
maybe aliens just interact with a

4622
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
maybe aliens just interact with a
 

4623
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,630
maybe aliens just interact with a
different part of reality than we do

4624
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:08,640
different part of reality than we do
 

4625
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,470
different part of reality than we do
that's wildly speculative but i think i

4626
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:10,480
that's wildly speculative but i think i
 

4627
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,830
that's wildly speculative but i think i
think um

4628
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:11,840
think um
 

4629
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,510
think um
it's possible it's possible and i think

4630
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
it's possible it's possible and i think
 

4631
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,350
it's possible it's possible and i think
it's consistent with the physics so i

4632
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,360
it's consistent with the physics so i
 

4633
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,110
it's consistent with the physics so i
think the best ways we can ask questions

4634
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:17,120
think the best ways we can ask questions
 

4635
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,310
think the best ways we can ask questions
are about

4636
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:18,320
are about
 

4637
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,470
are about
life and chemistry and asking questions

4638
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480
life and chemistry and asking questions
 

4639
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,470
life and chemistry and asking questions
about if information is a real physical

4640
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:22,480
about if information is a real physical
 

4641
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,030
about if information is a real physical
thing what would its signatures be in

4642
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,040
thing what would its signatures be in
 

4643
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:25,990
thing what would its signatures be in
matter

4644
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
matter
 

4645
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,870
matter
um

4646
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:26,880
um
 

4647
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,430
um
and and how do we recognize those and i

4648
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
and and how do we recognize those and i
 

4649
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,510
and and how do we recognize those and i
think the ones that are most obvious are

4650
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:31,520
think the ones that are most obvious are
 

4651
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,189
think the ones that are most obvious are
the ones i've already articulated you

4652
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
the ones i've already articulated you
 

4653
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:35,030
the ones i've already articulated you
have these objects that seem completely

4654
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,040
have these objects that seem completely
 

4655
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,790
have these objects that seem completely
improbable for the universe to produce

4656
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:36,800
improbable for the universe to produce
 

4657
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,630
improbable for the universe to produce
because the universe doesn't have the

4658
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:38,640
because the universe doesn't have the
 

4659
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,950
because the universe doesn't have the
design of that object in the laws

4660
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:40,960
design of that object in the laws
 

4661
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,390
design of that object in the laws
so therefore an object had to evolve

4662
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:44,400
so therefore an object had to evolve
 

4663
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,790
so therefore an object had to evolve
we we talked we call it evolution but it

4664
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:46,800
we we talked we call it evolution but it
 

4665
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,630
we we talked we call it evolution but it
had to be produced by the universe that

4666
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:48,640
had to be produced by the universe that
 

4667
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,350
had to be produced by the universe that
then had all of the possible tasks to

4668
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:51,360
then had all of the possible tasks to
 

4669
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,030
then had all of the possible tasks to
make that object

4670
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
make that object
 

4671
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,830
make that object
um specified i mean there's some like

4672
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,840
um specified i mean there's some like
 

4673
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,030
um specified i mean there's some like
there's an engineering question here of

4674
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
there's an engineering question here of
 

4675
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,350
there's an engineering question here of
are there sensors we can create that can

4676
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,360
are there sensors we can create that can
 

4677
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,270
are there sensors we can create that can
give us uh

4678
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,280
give us uh
 

4679
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,830
give us uh
can help us discover certain pockets of

4680
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:05,840
can help us discover certain pockets of
 

4681
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,390
can help us discover certain pockets of
high assemblies yeah aliens

4682
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
high assemblies yeah aliens
 

4683
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,430
high assemblies yeah aliens
like

4684
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:09,440
like
 

4685
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,149
like
i mean there is a hope

4686
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:12,159
i mean there is a hope
 

4687
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:14,470
i mean there is a hope
setting dogs and chairs aside

4688
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:14,480
setting dogs and chairs aside
 

4689
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,350
setting dogs and chairs aside
there's a hope that visually

4690
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:17,360
there's a hope that visually
 

4691
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,430
there's a hope that visually
and we could detect

4692
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:19,440
and we could detect
 

4693
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,510
and we could detect
like

4694
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520
like
 

4695
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,430
like
because our universe i mean at least the

4696
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:23,440
because our universe i mean at least the
 

4697
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,790
because our universe i mean at least the
way we look at it now like this

4698
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:24,800
way we look at it now like this
 

4699
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,110
way we look at it now like this
three-dimensional like space-time

4700
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
three-dimensional like space-time
 

4701
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,270
three-dimensional like space-time
we can visually comprehend it

4702
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:29,280
we can visually comprehend it
 

4703
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,669
we can visually comprehend it
it's interesting to think like if we got

4704
01:17:31,669 --> 01:17:31,679
it's interesting to think like if we got
 

4705
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,830
it's interesting to think like if we got
to hang out you know if there's an alien

4706
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
to hang out you know if there's an alien
 

4707
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,830
to hang out you know if there's an alien
in this room

4708
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:35,840
in this room
 

4709
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,910
in this room
like would we be able to detect it with

4710
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:37,920
like would we be able to detect it with
 

4711
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,709
like would we be able to detect it with
our current sensors not the fancy kinds

4712
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:40,719
our current sensors not the fancy kinds
 

4713
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,390
our current sensors not the fancy kinds
but but like what you're standing over

4714
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:42,400
but but like what you're standing over
 

4715
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,270
but but like what you're standing over
there

4716
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:43,280
there
 

4717
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,110
there
yeah standing over there or maybe like

4718
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
yeah standing over there or maybe like
 

4719
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,390
yeah standing over there or maybe like
in this carpet see there's all these

4720
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:46,400
in this carpet see there's all these
 

4721
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,790
in this carpet see there's all these
kinds of patterns right yeah uh i don't

4722
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:48,800
kinds of patterns right yeah uh i don't
 

4723
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,669
kinds of patterns right yeah uh i don't
know

4724
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:49,679
know
 

4725
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:50,950
know
if if

4726
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:50,960
if if
 

4727
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,790
if if
i don't know if this carpet is an alien

4728
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
i don't know if this carpet is an alien
 

4729
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,910
i don't know if this carpet is an alien
well so

4730
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:53,920
well so
 

4731
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,070
well so
i see what you're saying um

4732
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,080
i see what you're saying um
 

4733
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,750
i see what you're saying um
so assembly theory is pretty general

4734
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:57,760
so assembly theory is pretty general
 

4735
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,430
so assembly theory is pretty general
like i mean we've been applying it to

4736
01:17:59,430 --> 01:17:59,440
like i mean we've been applying it to
 

4737
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,510
like i mean we've been applying it to
molecules because it makes sense applied

4738
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:01,520
molecules because it makes sense applied
 

4739
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,510
molecules because it makes sense applied
to molecules but it's supposed to

4740
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:03,520
to molecules but it's supposed to
 

4741
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,189
to molecules but it's supposed to
explain life

4742
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:05,199
explain life
 

4743
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,270
explain life
um you know like the physics of life so

4744
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:07,280
um you know like the physics of life so
 

4745
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,790
um you know like the physics of life so
it should explain you know the things in

4746
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
it should explain you know the things in
 

4747
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,350
it should explain you know the things in
this room in addition to molecules um so

4748
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:11,360
this room in addition to molecules um so
 

4749
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,669
this room in addition to molecules um so
i guess uh and you can apply it to

4750
01:18:13,669 --> 01:18:13,679
i guess uh and you can apply it to
 

4751
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,709
i guess uh and you can apply it to
images and things so i guess the idea

4752
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:16,719
images and things so i guess the idea
 

4753
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,270
images and things so i guess the idea
you know you could explore is just

4754
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280
you know you could explore is just
 

4755
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,350
you know you could explore is just
looking at everything on planet earth in

4756
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:21,360
looking at everything on planet earth in
 

4757
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,350
looking at everything on planet earth in
terms of its assembly structure and then

4758
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:23,360
terms of its assembly structure and then
 

4759
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,470
terms of its assembly structure and then
looking for

4760
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:24,480
looking for
 

4761
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,830
looking for
things that aren't part of our

4762
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:25,840
things that aren't part of our
 

4763
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,510
things that aren't part of our
biological lineage if they have high

4764
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:27,520
biological lineage if they have high
 

4765
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,430
biological lineage if they have high
assembly they might be aliens on earth i

4766
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:29,440
assembly they might be aliens on earth i
 

4767
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,790
assembly they might be aliens on earth i
mean that that is a very kind of

4768
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:30,800
mean that that is a very kind of
 

4769
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,790
mean that that is a very kind of
rigorous computer vision question can we

4770
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:32,800
rigorous computer vision question can we
 

4771
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,910
rigorous computer vision question can we
visually

4772
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
visually
 

4773
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,470
visually
is there a strong correlation

4774
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480
is there a strong correlation
 

4775
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,070
is there a strong correlation
between certain kind of high assembly

4776
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:38,080
between certain kind of high assembly
 

4777
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,910
between certain kind of high assembly
objects when they get to the scale where

4778
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:39,920
objects when they get to the scale where
 

4779
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,070
objects when they get to the scale where
they're visually observable

4780
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:42,080
they're visually observable
 

4781
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:42,870
they're visually observable
and

4782
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:42,880
and
 

4783
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,709
and
some like when it's

4784
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:44,719
some like when it's
 

4785
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,510
some like when it's
say uh projected onto a 2d plane can we

4786
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:47,520
say uh projected onto a 2d plane can we
 

4787
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,590
say uh projected onto a 2d plane can we
right can we figure out something right

4788
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:49,600
right can we figure out something right
 

4789
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,870
right can we figure out something right
i am glad you brought up a computer

4790
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:50,880
i am glad you brought up a computer
 

4791
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,229
i am glad you brought up a computer
vision point because for a while i had

4792
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
vision point because for a while i had
 

4793
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:53,750
vision point because for a while i had
this kind of thought in my mind that we

4794
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:53,760
this kind of thought in my mind that we
 

4795
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,510
this kind of thought in my mind that we
can't even see ourselves clearly so one

4796
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:55,520
can't even see ourselves clearly so one
 

4797
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,709
can't even see ourselves clearly so one
of the things you know people are

4798
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
of the things you know people are
 

4799
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:57,910
of the things you know people are
worried about artificial intelligence

4800
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:57,920
worried about artificial intelligence
 

4801
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,030
worried about artificial intelligence
for a lot of reasons but i think it's

4802
01:18:59,030 --> 01:18:59,040
for a lot of reasons but i think it's
 

4803
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,470
for a lot of reasons but i think it's
really fascinating because it's like the

4804
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480
really fascinating because it's like the
 

4805
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,750
really fascinating because it's like the
first time

4806
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:01,760
first time
 

4807
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,310
first time
in history that we're building a system

4808
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
in history that we're building a system
 

4809
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,390
in history that we're building a system
that can help us understand ourselves

4810
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:06,400
that can help us understand ourselves
 

4811
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,070
that can help us understand ourselves
so like you know people talk about ai

4812
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:08,080
so like you know people talk about ai
 

4813
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,310
so like you know people talk about ai
physics but like um

4814
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
physics but like um
 

4815
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,990
physics but like um
you know when i when i look at another

4816
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,000
you know when i when i look at another
 

4817
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,669
you know when i when i look at another
person i don't see them as a four

4818
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
person i don't see them as a four
 

4819
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:15,750
person i don't see them as a four
billion year lineage but that's what

4820
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:15,760
billion year lineage but that's what
 

4821
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,149
billion year lineage but that's what
they are and so is everything here right

4822
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:18,159
they are and so is everything here right
 

4823
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,030
they are and so is everything here right
so

4824
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:19,040
so
 

4825
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,350
so
imagine that we built artificial systems

4826
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:21,360
imagine that we built artificial systems
 

4827
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,470
imagine that we built artificial systems
that could actually

4828
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,480
that could actually
 

4829
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,229
that could actually
see that feature of us

4830
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:24,239
see that feature of us
 

4831
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,470
see that feature of us
what else would they see

4832
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:26,480
what else would they see
 

4833
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,630
what else would they see
and i think that's what you're asking

4834
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:28,640
and i think that's what you're asking
 

4835
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,270
and i think that's what you're asking
and i think i think that would be so

4836
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:31,280
and i think i think that would be so
 

4837
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,229
and i think i think that would be so
cool

4838
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:34,239

 

4839
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,510

i want that to happen but i think i

4840
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:35,520
i want that to happen but i think i
 

4841
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,030
i want that to happen but i think i
think we're a little ways off from it

4842
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:37,040
think we're a little ways off from it
 

4843
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,470
think we're a little ways off from it
but yeah

4844
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:38,480
but yeah
 

4845
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,149
but yeah
we're going there i hope

4846
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:40,159
we're going there i hope
 

4847
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:43,030
we're going there i hope
okay let me ask you uh i apologize ahead

4848
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:43,040
okay let me ask you uh i apologize ahead
 

4849
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,709
okay let me ask you uh i apologize ahead
of time but let me ask you the internet

4850
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
of time but let me ask you the internet
 

4851
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,630
of time but let me ask you the internet
question so you're a physicist you ask

4852
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:46,640
question so you're a physicist you ask
 

4853
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,030
question so you're a physicist you ask
rigorous questions about the physics of

4854
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:49,040
rigorous questions about the physics of
 

4855
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,390
rigorous questions about the physics of
existence and

4856
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
existence and
 

4857
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,870
existence and
these models of high assembly objects

4858
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:52,880
these models of high assembly objects
 

4859
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,030
these models of high assembly objects
now when the internet would see an alien

4860
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:55,040
now when the internet would see an alien
 

4861
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,189
now when the internet would see an alien
they would ask two questions one can i

4862
01:19:57,189 --> 01:19:57,199
they would ask two questions one can i
 

4863
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:00,550
they would ask two questions one can i
eat it and two can have sex with it yes

4864
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,560
eat it and two can have sex with it yes
 

4865
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:10,550
eat it and two can have sex with it yes
so

4866
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560

 

4867
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,990

so you kind of mentioned that it's very

4868
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:12,000
so you kind of mentioned that it's very
 

4869
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,910
so you kind of mentioned that it's very
difficult it's possible that we may not

4870
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:13,920
difficult it's possible that we may not
 

4871
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,070
difficult it's possible that we may not
be even able to communicate with it

4872
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,080
be even able to communicate with it
 

4873
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,510
be even able to communicate with it
right but i think the internet has more

4874
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:17,520
right but i think the internet has more
 

4875
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,990
right but i think the internet has more
hope than we do yes it's a hopeful place

4876
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:20,000
hope than we do yes it's a hopeful place
 

4877
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,750
hope than we do yes it's a hopeful place
yes uh do you

4878
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:21,760
yes uh do you
 

4879
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,870
yes uh do you
do you think in terms of like

4880
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:22,880
do you think in terms of like
 

4881
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,149
do you think in terms of like
interacting on this very primal level of

4882
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159
interacting on this very primal level of
 

4883
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,070
interacting on this very primal level of
of sharing resources like what would

4884
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,080
of sharing resources like what would
 

4885
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,229
of sharing resources like what would
aliens eat what would we eat would we

4886
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239
aliens eat what would we eat would we
 

4887
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,669
aliens eat what would we eat would we
eat the same thing would could we

4888
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:31,679
eat the same thing would could we
 

4889
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,990
eat the same thing would could we
potentially eat each other uh one one

4890
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:34,000
potentially eat each other uh one one
 

4891
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,550
potentially eat each other uh one one
person eats the other or or the aliens

4892
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:36,560
person eats the other or or the aliens
 

4893
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,709
person eats the other or or the aliens
eat us and the same thing with

4894
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:38,719
eat us and the same thing with
 

4895
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,790
eat us and the same thing with
not sex in general reproduction but

4896
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:40,800
not sex in general reproduction but
 

4897
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,510
not sex in general reproduction but
genetically mixing stuff like would we

4898
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:43,520
genetically mixing stuff like would we
 

4899
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,470
genetically mixing stuff like would we
would be able to mix genetic information

4900
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:46,480
would be able to mix genetic information
 

4901
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,470
would be able to mix genetic information
maybe not genetic but maybe information

4902
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:48,480
maybe not genetic but maybe information
 

4903
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,669
maybe not genetic but maybe information
right and i think part of your question

4904
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:49,679
right and i think part of your question
 

4905
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,270
right and i think part of your question
is like so

4906
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:51,280
is like so
 

4907
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,110
is like so
so if you if you think of life as like

4908
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:53,120
so if you if you think of life as like
 

4909
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,030
so if you if you think of life as like
this history of events that happen in

4910
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:55,040
this history of events that happen in
 

4911
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,470
this history of events that happen in
the universe like there's this question

4912
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:56,480
the universe like there's this question
 

4913
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,990
the universe like there's this question
of like how divergent are those

4914
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
of like how divergent are those
 

4915
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,910
of like how divergent are those
histories right so when we get to the

4916
01:20:59,910 --> 01:20:59,920
histories right so when we get to the
 

4917
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,510
histories right so when we get to the
scale of technology it's possible to

4918
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:01,520
scale of technology it's possible to
 

4919
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,870
scale of technology it's possible to
imagine

4920
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
imagine
 

4921
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,470
imagine
imagine although we can't even do it

4922
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:04,480
imagine although we can't even do it
 

4923
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,510
imagine although we can't even do it
like imagine all the possible

4924
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:05,520
like imagine all the possible
 

4925
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,870
like imagine all the possible
technologies that could exist in the

4926
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:06,880
technologies that could exist in the
 

4927
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,070
technologies that could exist in the
universe but if you think about all the

4928
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
universe but if you think about all the
 

4929
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,669
universe but if you think about all the
possible chemistries somehow that seems

4930
01:21:09,669 --> 01:21:09,679
possible chemistries somehow that seems
 

4931
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,350
possible chemistries somehow that seems
like a lower dimensional space and a

4932
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:11,360
like a lower dimensional space and a
 

4933
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,510
like a lower dimensional space and a
lower set of possibilities so it might

4934
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
lower set of possibilities so it might
 

4935
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,189
lower set of possibilities so it might
be that like when we interact with

4936
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
be that like when we interact with
 

4937
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,430
be that like when we interact with
aliens we do have to go back to those

4938
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:17,440
aliens we do have to go back to those
 

4939
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,229
aliens we do have to go back to those
more

4940
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:18,239
more
 

4941
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,709
more
basal levels to figure out sort of what

4942
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:20,719
basal levels to figure out sort of what
 

4943
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,070
basal levels to figure out sort of what
the map is

4944
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,080
the map is
 

4945
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,030
the map is
right um like the sort of where we have

4946
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:25,040
right um like the sort of where we have
 

4947
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,189
right um like the sort of where we have
a common history we all we must have a

4948
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:27,199
a common history we all we must have a
 

4949
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,189
a common history we all we must have a
common history somewhere in the universe

4950
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
common history somewhere in the universe
 

4951
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,270
common history somewhere in the universe
but in order to be able to actually

4952
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:31,280
but in order to be able to actually
 

4953
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,030
but in order to be able to actually
interact in a meaningful way you have to

4954
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,040
interact in a meaningful way you have to
 

4955
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,149
interact in a meaningful way you have to
have some shared history i mean the

4956
01:21:34,149 --> 01:21:34,159
have some shared history i mean the
 

4957
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:35,430
have some shared history i mean the
reason we can exchange genetic

4958
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:35,440
reason we can exchange genetic
 

4959
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,750
reason we can exchange genetic
information in each other's food or eat

4960
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:37,760
information in each other's food or eat
 

4961
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,430
information in each other's food or eat
each other as food

4962
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:39,440
each other as food
 

4963
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,189
each other as food
is because we have a shared history so

4964
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:41,199
is because we have a shared history so
 

4965
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:42,629
is because we have a shared history so
we have to find that shared history the

4966
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
we have to find that shared history the
 

4967
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,070
we have to find that shared history the
other we have to find the common

4968
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,080
other we have to find the common
 

4969
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,629
other we have to find the common
ancestor in this causality map the the

4970
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:46,639
ancestor in this causality map the the
 

4971
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:47,590
ancestor in this causality map the the
something yes

4972
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:47,600
something yes
 

4973
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,430
something yes
yes and we have a last universal common

4974
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:49,440
yes and we have a last universal common
 

4975
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,189
yes and we have a last universal common
ancestor for all life on earth which i

4976
01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:51,199
ancestor for all life on earth which i
 

4977
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,390
ancestor for all life on earth which i
think is sort of the nexus of that

4978
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:52,400
think is sort of the nexus of that
 

4979
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,629
think is sort of the nexus of that
causality map for life on earth but the

4980
01:21:54,629 --> 01:21:54,639
causality map for life on earth but the
 

4981
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,189
causality map for life on earth but the
question is where would other aliens

4982
01:21:57,189 --> 01:21:57,199
question is where would other aliens
 

4983
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:59,030
question is where would other aliens
diverge on that sound

4984
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
diverge on that sound
 

4985
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,470
diverge on that sound
and i mean

4986
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
and i mean
 

4987
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,669
and i mean
that

4988
01:22:01,669 --> 01:22:01,679
that
 

4989
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,590
that
so say there's a lot of aliens out there

4990
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:03,600
so say there's a lot of aliens out there
 

4991
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,390
so say there's a lot of aliens out there
in the universe each each set of

4992
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,400
in the universe each each set of
 

4993
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,229
in the universe each each set of
organisms will probably have like a

4994
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:08,239
organisms will probably have like a
 

4995
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,229
organisms will probably have like a
number you know like erdos number of

4996
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:10,239
number you know like erdos number of
 

4997
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:11,030
number you know like erdos number of
like

4998
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:11,040
like
 

4999
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,189
like
how far

5000
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:13,199
how far
 

5001
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,070
how far
like how far our common ancestor is and

5002
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
like how far our common ancestor is and
 

5003
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,229
like how far our common ancestor is and
so the closer the common ancestor like

5004
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:18,239
so the closer the common ancestor like
 

5005
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,590
so the closer the common ancestor like
it is on earth

5006
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:19,600
it is on earth
 

5007
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,590
it is on earth
the more like each other the more likely

5008
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:21,600
the more like each other the more likely
 

5009
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,430
the more like each other the more likely
we are to be able to have sexual

5010
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:23,440
we are to be able to have sexual
 

5011
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,870
we are to be able to have sexual
reproduction well it's like sort of like

5012
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:24,880
reproduction well it's like sort of like
 

5013
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,149
reproduction well it's like sort of like
humans having common culture and

5014
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:26,159
humans having common culture and
 

5015
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:28,709
humans having common culture and
languages right yeah exactly language

5016
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:28,719
languages right yeah exactly language
 

5017
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,149
languages right yeah exactly language
communication

5018
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:30,159
communication
 

5019
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,590
communication
it might take a lot of work though with

5020
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:31,600
it might take a lot of work though with
 

5021
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,270
it might take a lot of work though with
an alien because you really have to get

5022
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:33,280
an alien because you really have to get
 

5023
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,510
an alien because you really have to get
over a language barrier

5024
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:35,520
over a language barrier
 

5025
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,870
over a language barrier
oh boy so it says communication it's uh

5026
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
oh boy so it says communication it's uh
 

5027
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,510
oh boy so it says communication it's uh
uh resources i mean it's all the whole

5028
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:43,520

 

5029
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,830

and i think tied into that is the

5030
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:45,840
and i think tied into that is the
 

5031
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,070
and i think tied into that is the
questions of like who's gonna harm who

5032
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,080
questions of like who's gonna harm who
 

5033
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,229
questions of like who's gonna harm who
right and actually definitions parents

5034
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:50,239
right and actually definitions parents
 

5035
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,590
right and actually definitions parents
approve you know all those kind of

5036
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:51,600
approve you know all those kind of
 

5037
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,709
approve you know all those kind of
questions

5038
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:52,719
questions
 

5039
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,629
questions
whether the common ancestor approves

5040
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:54,639
whether the common ancestor approves
 

5041
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,910
whether the common ancestor approves
yeah that's just very true uh

5042
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
yeah that's just very true uh
 

5043
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,750
yeah that's just very true uh
how many alien civilizations do you

5044
01:22:59,750 --> 01:22:59,760
how many alien civilizations do you
 

5045
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,669
how many alien civilizations do you
think are out there

5046
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:01,679
think are out there
 

5047
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,470
think are out there
i don't have intuition for that

5048
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,480
i don't have intuition for that
 

5049
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,470
i don't have intuition for that
um which i i have always thought was

5050
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
um which i i have always thought was
 

5051
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,790
um which i i have always thought was
deeply intriguing so and and part of

5052
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
deeply intriguing so and and part of
 

5053
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,149
deeply intriguing so and and part of
this uh

5054
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:10,159
this uh
 

5055
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,750
this uh
i mean i say it specifically is i don't

5056
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:11,760
i mean i say it specifically is i don't
 

5057
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,030
i mean i say it specifically is i don't
have intuition for that because it's

5058
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:13,040
have intuition for that because it's
 

5059
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,390
have intuition for that because it's
like one of those questions that you

5060
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
like one of those questions that you
 

5061
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,910
like one of those questions that you
feel around for a while and you really

5062
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:15,920
feel around for a while and you really
 

5063
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,669
feel around for a while and you really
just you you can't see it um even though

5064
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:19,679
just you you can't see it um even though
 

5065
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,830
just you you can't see it um even though
it might be right there and

5066
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:21,840
it might be right there and
 

5067
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,030
it might be right there and
um

5068
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:23,040
um
 

5069
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,229
um
in that sense it's a little like the

5070
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:24,239
in that sense it's a little like the
 

5071
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:25,910
in that sense it's a little like the
quantum to classical transition you're

5072
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:25,920
quantum to classical transition you're
 

5073
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,110
quantum to classical transition you're
like really talking about two different

5074
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:27,120
like really talking about two different
 

5075
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,709
like really talking about two different
kinds of physics and i think that's kind

5076
01:23:28,709 --> 01:23:28,719
kinds of physics and i think that's kind
 

5077
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:29,590
kinds of physics and i think that's kind
of part of the problem once we

5078
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:29,600
of part of the problem once we
 

5079
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,709
of part of the problem once we
understand the physics that question

5080
01:23:30,709 --> 01:23:30,719
understand the physics that question
 

5081
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,550
understand the physics that question
might become more meaningful

5082
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:32,560
might become more meaningful
 

5083
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,830
might become more meaningful
um but there's also this other issue um

5084
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:35,840
um but there's also this other issue um
 

5085
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,669
um but there's also this other issue um
uh and this was really instilled in me

5086
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
uh and this was really instilled in me
 

5087
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,189
uh and this was really instilled in me
by my mentor paul davies when i was a

5088
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:39,199
by my mentor paul davies when i was a
 

5089
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:41,189
by my mentor paul davies when i was a
postdoc because he always talks about

5090
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:41,199
postdoc because he always talks about
 

5091
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,590
postdoc because he always talks about
how you know whether aliens are common

5092
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:43,600
how you know whether aliens are common
 

5093
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,790
how you know whether aliens are common
or rare is kind of just um you know it's

5094
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:46,800
or rare is kind of just um you know it's
 

5095
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,310
or rare is kind of just um you know it's
like you know it follows a wave of

5096
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:48,320
like you know it follows a wave of
 

5097
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,149
like you know it follows a wave of
popularity and it just depends on like

5098
01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:50,159
popularity and it just depends on like
 

5099
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,990
popularity and it just depends on like
the mood of you know what the culture is

5100
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:52,000
the mood of you know what the culture is
 

5101
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,669
the mood of you know what the culture is
at the time and i always thought that

5102
01:23:53,669 --> 01:23:53,679
at the time and i always thought that
 

5103
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:55,350
at the time and i always thought that
was kind of an intriguing observation

5104
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:55,360
was kind of an intriguing observation
 

5105
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,189
was kind of an intriguing observation
but but also there's this you know set

5106
01:23:57,189 --> 01:23:57,199
but but also there's this you know set
 

5107
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,950
but but also there's this you know set
of points about if you go by

5108
01:23:58,950 --> 01:23:58,960
of points about if you go by
 

5109
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,229
of points about if you go by
observational evidence which we're

5110
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:00,239
observational evidence which we're
 

5111
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,910
observational evidence which we're
supposed to do with scientists right um

5112
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:03,920
supposed to do with scientists right um
 

5113
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,790
supposed to do with scientists right um
you know

5114
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:04,800
you know
 

5115
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,189
you know
we have evidence of

5116
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:07,199
we have evidence of
 

5117
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:08,629
we have evidence of
us

5118
01:24:08,629 --> 01:24:08,639
us
 

5119
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,629
us
and one original life event from which

5120
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:10,639
and one original life event from which
 

5121
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,550
and one original life event from which
we emerged and people want to make

5122
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:12,560
we emerged and people want to make
 

5123
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,229
we emerged and people want to make
arguments that because that event was

5124
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
arguments that because that event was
 

5125
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,669
arguments that because that event was
rapid

5126
01:24:15,669 --> 01:24:15,679
rapid
 

5127
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:17,270
rapid
or because there's other planets that

5128
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
or because there's other planets that
 

5129
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,790
or because there's other planets that
have properties similar to ours that

5130
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:18,800
have properties similar to ours that
 

5131
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,709
have properties similar to ours that
that event should be common but you

5132
01:24:20,709 --> 01:24:20,719
that event should be common but you
 

5133
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,229
that event should be common but you
actually can't reason on that because

5134
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:22,239
actually can't reason on that because
 

5135
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,750
actually can't reason on that because
our existence observing that event is

5136
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:23,760
our existence observing that event is
 

5137
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,830
our existence observing that event is
contingent on that event happening which

5138
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:25,840
contingent on that event happening which
 

5139
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,030
contingent on that event happening which
means it could have been completely

5140
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:27,040
means it could have been completely
 

5141
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,510
means it could have been completely
improbable or very common

5142
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:29,520
improbable or very common
 

5143
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,950
improbable or very common
and brandon carter like clearly

5144
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:30,960
and brandon carter like clearly
 

5145
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,629
and brandon carter like clearly
articulated that in terms of anthropic

5146
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:32,639
articulated that in terms of anthropic
 

5147
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,470
articulated that in terms of anthropic
arguments um

5148
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:34,480
arguments um
 

5149
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,629
arguments um
a few decades ago so so there is this

5150
01:24:36,629 --> 01:24:36,639
a few decades ago so so there is this
 

5151
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,790
a few decades ago so so there is this
kind of issue that we have to contend

5152
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:38,800
kind of issue that we have to contend
 

5153
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,470
kind of issue that we have to contend
with dealing with life that's closer to

5154
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:40,480
with dealing with life that's closer to
 

5155
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,229
with dealing with life that's closer to
home than we have to deal with with any

5156
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:42,239
home than we have to deal with with any
 

5157
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:44,310
home than we have to deal with with any
other problems in physics which we're

5158
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:44,320
other problems in physics which we're
 

5159
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,669
other problems in physics which we're
talking about the physics of ourselves

5160
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:45,679
talking about the physics of ourselves
 

5161
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:46,790
talking about the physics of ourselves
and when you're asked about the original

5162
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:46,800
and when you're asked about the original
 

5163
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,550
and when you're asked about the original
life event that event happening in the

5164
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:48,560
life event that event happening in the
 

5165
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,390
life event that event happening in the
universe at least is like our existence

5166
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,400
universe at least is like our existence
 

5167
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,189
universe at least is like our existence
is contingent on it um and so you can

5168
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:53,199
is contingent on it um and so you can
 

5169
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,229
is contingent on it um and so you can
think about sort of fine tuning

5170
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:54,239
think about sort of fine tuning
 

5171
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:55,669
think about sort of fine tuning
arguments um

5172
01:24:55,669 --> 01:24:55,679
arguments um
 

5173
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:58,709
arguments um
that way too so um but the the sort of

5174
01:24:58,709 --> 01:24:58,719
that way too so um but the the sort of
 

5175
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,310
that way too so um but the the sort of
odder part of it is like when i think

5176
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:00,320
odder part of it is like when i think
 

5177
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,270
odder part of it is like when i think
about

5178
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,280
about
 

5179
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,990
about
uh how likely it is i think it's because

5180
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,000
uh how likely it is i think it's because
 

5181
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,310
uh how likely it is i think it's because
we don't understand this mechanism yet

5182
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:06,320
we don't understand this mechanism yet
 

5183
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,350
we don't understand this mechanism yet
about

5184
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:07,360
about
 

5185
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,030
about
how information can be generated

5186
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,040
how information can be generated
 

5187
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,709
how information can be generated
spontaneously

5188
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:10,719
spontaneously
 

5189
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,550
spontaneously
that i like because i can't see that

5190
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:12,560
that i like because i can't see that
 

5191
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,390
that i like because i can't see that
physics clearly yet even though i have a

5192
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:14,400
physics clearly yet even though i have a
 

5193
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,430
physics clearly yet even though i have a
lot of

5194
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:15,440
lot of
 

5195
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,870
lot of
you know like some things around the

5196
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:16,880
you know like some things around the
 

5197
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,189
you know like some things around the
space of it in my mind i can't

5198
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:19,199
space of it in my mind i can't
 

5199
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,070
space of it in my mind i can't
articulate how likely that process is

5200
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:22,080
articulate how likely that process is
 

5201
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,070
articulate how likely that process is
um so my honest answer is i don't know

5202
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:24,080
um so my honest answer is i don't know
 

5203
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,830
um so my honest answer is i don't know
and it sometimes feels like a cop-out

5204
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:25,840
and it sometimes feels like a cop-out
 

5205
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,030
and it sometimes feels like a cop-out
but i feel like that's a more honest

5206
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,040
but i feel like that's a more honest
 

5207
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,390
but i feel like that's a more honest
answer and a more meaningful way of

5208
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:28,400
answer and a more meaningful way of
 

5209
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,110
answer and a more meaningful way of
making progress than um what a lot of

5210
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:31,120
making progress than um what a lot of
 

5211
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,189
making progress than um what a lot of
people want to do which is say oh well

5212
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:33,199
people want to do which is say oh well
 

5213
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,790
people want to do which is say oh well
we have a one-in-ten chance of having on

5214
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:34,800
we have a one-in-ten chance of having on
 

5215
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,390
we have a one-in-ten chance of having on
an exoplanet with earth-like properties

5216
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:36,400
an exoplanet with earth-like properties
 

5217
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,910
an exoplanet with earth-like properties
because there's lots of earth-like

5218
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:37,920
because there's lots of earth-like
 

5219
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,430
because there's lots of earth-like
planets out there and life happen fast

5220
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:39,440
planets out there and life happen fast
 

5221
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,510
planets out there and life happen fast
on earth well so

5222
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:41,520
on earth well so
 

5223
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,110
on earth well so
i have kind of a follow-up question but

5224
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,120
i have kind of a follow-up question but
 

5225
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,189
i have kind of a follow-up question but
as a side comment

as a side comment

01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,270
as a side comment
what i really am enjoying about the way

5228
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:47,280
what i really am enjoying about the way
 

5229
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,189
what i really am enjoying about the way
you're talking about human beings is you

5230
01:25:49,189 --> 01:25:49,199
you're talking about human beings is you
 

5231
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,790
you're talking about human beings is you
always say not to make yourself

5232
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:50,800
always say not to make yourself
 

5233
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,990
always say not to make yourself
conscious about it because i really

5234
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:52,000
conscious about it because i really
 

5235
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,390
conscious about it because i really
really enjoy it do you say we

5236
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:54,400
really enjoy it do you say we
 

5237
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,189
really enjoy it do you say we
yes you don't say humans

5238
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:57,199
yes you don't say humans
 

5239
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,830
yes you don't say humans
you say because often times like and you

5240
01:25:59,830 --> 01:25:59,840
you say because often times like and you
 

5241
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,030
you say because often times like and you
know i don't know evolutionary

5242
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
know i don't know evolutionary
 

5243
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,629
know i don't know evolutionary
biologists will kind of

5244
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:02,639
biologists will kind of
 

5245
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,070
biologists will kind of
put yourself out

5246
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,080
put yourself out
 

5247
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,310
put yourself out
yes as an observer but you're

5248
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:06,320
yes as an observer but you're
 

5249
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,149
yes as an observer but you're
it's it's kind of fascinating to think

5250
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:08,159
it's it's kind of fascinating to think
 

5251
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,669
it's it's kind of fascinating to think
that you as a human are struggling about

5252
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:09,679
that you as a human are struggling about
 

5253
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,030
that you as a human are struggling about
your own origins

5254
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:11,040
your own origins
 

5255
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,470
your own origins
yes that's the problem and yeah and i i

5256
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:14,480
yes that's the problem and yeah and i i
 

5257
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,030
yes that's the problem and yeah and i i
think um i don't do that deliberately

5258
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:17,040
think um i don't do that deliberately
 

5259
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,870
think um i don't do that deliberately
but i do think that way and this is sort

5260
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:18,880
but i do think that way and this is sort
 

5261
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,390
but i do think that way and this is sort
of the inversion from the logic of

5262
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:20,400
of the inversion from the logic of
 

5263
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,149
of the inversion from the logic of
physics because physics as it's always

5264
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:22,159
physics because physics as it's always
 

5265
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,390
physics because physics as it's always
been constructed has treated us as

5266
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:24,400
been constructed has treated us as
 

5267
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,390
been constructed has treated us as
external observers of the universe and

5268
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:26,400
external observers of the universe and
 

5269
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,830
external observers of the universe and
we are not part of the universe and this

5270
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
we are not part of the universe and this
 

5271
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,510
we are not part of the universe and this
is why the problem of life i think

5272
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:29,520
is why the problem of life i think
 

5273
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,510
is why the problem of life i think
demands completely new thinking because

5274
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,520
demands completely new thinking because
 

5275
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,750
demands completely new thinking because
we have to think about ourselves as

5276
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:33,760
we have to think about ourselves as
 

5277
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,750
we have to think about ourselves as
minds that exist in the universe and are

5278
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:35,760
minds that exist in the universe and are
 

5279
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,830
minds that exist in the universe and are
at this particular moment in history and

5280
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
at this particular moment in history and
 

5281
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,750
at this particular moment in history and
looking out at the things around us and

5282
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,760
looking out at the things around us and
 

5283
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,910
looking out at the things around us and
trying to understand what we are inside

5284
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:41,920
trying to understand what we are inside
 

5285
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,990
trying to understand what we are inside
the system not outside the system we

5286
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,000
the system not outside the system we
 

5287
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,390
the system not outside the system we
don't have descriptions at a fundamental

5288
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:46,400
don't have descriptions at a fundamental
 

5289
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,229
don't have descriptions at a fundamental
level that describe us as inside the

5290
01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:48,239
level that describe us as inside the
 

5291
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:49,750
level that describe us as inside the
system and this was my problem with

5292
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:49,760
system and this was my problem with
 

5293
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,830
system and this was my problem with
cellular automata also you're always an

5294
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:51,840
cellular automata also you're always an
 

5295
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,750
cellular automata also you're always an
external observer for a cellular

5296
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:53,760
external observer for a cellular
 

5297
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,270
external observer for a cellular
automata you're not in the system what

5298
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
automata you're not in the system what
 

5299
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,470
automata you're not in the system what
does the cellular automata look like

5300
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:56,480
does the cellular automata look like
 

5301
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,790
does the cellular automata look like
from the inside

5302
01:26:58,790 --> 01:26:58,800
from the inside
 

5303
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,070
from the inside
i think you just broke my brain with

5304
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,080
i think you just broke my brain with
 

5305
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,750
i think you just broke my brain with
that question exactly but i thought

5306
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:01,760
that question exactly but i thought
 

5307
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,310
that question exactly but i thought
about that for a long time

5308
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:04,320
about that for a long time
 

5309
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,350
about that for a long time
i'm gonna

5310
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,360
i'm gonna
 

5311
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,750
i'm gonna
uh yeah that's a that's a really clean

5312
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:07,760
uh yeah that's a that's a really clean
 

5313
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,070
uh yeah that's a that's a really clean
formulation of a very fundamental

01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:10,080
formulation of a very fundamental
 

5315
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,390
formulation of a very fundamental
question because you can only to

5316
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:12,400
question because you can only to
 

5317
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,910
question because you can only to
understand cellular autonomy you have to

5318
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:13,920
understand cellular autonomy you have to
 

5319
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,470
understand cellular autonomy you have to
be inside of it

5320
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:16,480
be inside of it
 

5321
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,990
be inside of it
but as a human sort of a poetic romantic

5322
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:20,000
but as a human sort of a poetic romantic
 

5323
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,310
but as a human sort of a poetic romantic
question does it make you sad does it

5324
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:22,320
question does it make you sad does it
 

5325
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,750
question does it make you sad does it
make you

5326
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:23,760
make you
 

5327
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,510
make you
hopeful

5328
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:25,520
hopeful
 

5329
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,229
hopeful
whether we're alone or not like in the

5330
01:27:28,229 --> 01:27:28,239
whether we're alone or not like in the
 

5331
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:31,030
whether we're alone or not like in the
different possible versions of that

5332
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:31,040
different possible versions of that
 

5333
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,830
different possible versions of that
if we're the highest assembly object in

5334
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:33,840
if we're the highest assembly object in
 

5335
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,070
if we're the highest assembly object in
the entire universe

5336
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:36,080
the entire universe
 

5337
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,390
the entire universe
does that at this moment in time at this

5338
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:38,400
does that at this moment in time at this
 

5339
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,550
does that at this moment in time at this
moment in the causality because we might

5340
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:40,560
moment in the causality because we might
 

5341
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,070
moment in the causality because we might
i assume we have a future well we

5342
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:42,080
i assume we have a future well we
 

5343
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,510
i assume we have a future well we
definitely have a future and the

5344
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:43,520
definitely have a future and the
 

5345
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,550
definitely have a future and the
question is well yeah where that future

5346
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:46,560
question is well yeah where that future
 

5347
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,870
question is well yeah where that future
decreases the assembly like it could be

5348
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:48,880
decreases the assembly like it could be
 

5349
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,390
decreases the assembly like it could be
where at the peak

5350
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:50,400
where at the peak
 

5351
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,790
where at the peak
or we could be just um

5352
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:52,800
or we could be just um
 

5353
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,390
or we could be just um
that would be inconsistent with the

5354
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:54,400
that would be inconsistent with the
 

5355
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,030
that would be inconsistent with the
physics in my mind but

5356
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:57,040
physics in my mind but
 

5357
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,189
physics in my mind but
so so i i should give a caveat i've

5358
01:27:59,189 --> 01:27:59,199
so so i i should give a caveat i've
 

5359
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:00,870
so so i i should give a caveat i've
given the the caveat that i'm biased as

5360
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:00,880
given the the caveat that i'm biased as
 

5361
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,550
given the the caveat that i'm biased as
a physicist but i'm also biased as an

5362
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:02,560
a physicist but i'm also biased as an
 

5363
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,950
a physicist but i'm also biased as an
eternal optimist so pretty much all of

5364
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:04,960
eternal optimist so pretty much all of
 

5365
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,950
eternal optimist so pretty much all of
my modes of operation for building

5366
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
my modes of operation for building
 

5367
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,270
my modes of operation for building
theories about the world are not like an

5368
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:09,280
theories about the world are not like an
 

5369
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,870
theories about the world are not like an
occam's razor what's the simplest

5370
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:10,880
occam's razor what's the simplest
 

5371
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,149
occam's razor what's the simplest
explanation but what's the most

5372
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:12,159
explanation but what's the most
 

5373
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,709
explanation but what's the most
optimistic explanation

5374
01:28:14,709 --> 01:28:14,719
optimistic explanation
 

5375
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,470
optimistic explanation
and part of the reason for that is if

5376
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:16,480
and part of the reason for that is if
 

5377
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,790
and part of the reason for that is if
you really think explanations have

5378
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800
you really think explanations have
 

5379
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,310
you really think explanations have
causal power

5380
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:20,320
causal power
 

5381
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,229
causal power
um in the sense that our theo like the

5382
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:22,239
um in the sense that our theo like the
 

5383
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,350
um in the sense that our theo like the
fact that we have theories about the

5384
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:23,360
fact that we have theories about the
 

5385
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,110
fact that we have theories about the
world has enabled technologies and

5386
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:25,120
world has enabled technologies and
 

5387
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,790
world has enabled technologies and
physically transformed the world around

5388
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:26,800
physically transformed the world around
 

5389
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,030
physically transformed the world around
us i think i have to take seriously that

5390
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:29,040
us i think i have to take seriously that
 

5391
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,149
us i think i have to take seriously that
as a part of the physics i want to

5392
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:30,159
as a part of the physics i want to
 

5393
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:31,270
as a part of the physics i want to
describe

5394
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:31,280
describe
 

5395
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,870
describe
and try to

5396
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:32,880
and try to
 

5397
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,310
and try to
build

5398
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:34,320
build
 

5399
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,709
build
theories of reality that are optimistic

5400
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:36,719
theories of reality that are optimistic
 

5401
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,149
theories of reality that are optimistic
about what's coming next because the

5402
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:38,159
about what's coming next because the
 

5403
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:39,750
about what's coming next because the
theories are in part the causes of what

5404
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:39,760
theories are in part the causes of what
 

5405
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,229
theories are in part the causes of what
comes next

5406
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:42,239
comes next
 

5407
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,629
comes next
so there could be a physics of

5408
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:44,639
so there could be a physics of
 

5409
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,790
so there could be a physics of
hope or physics of optimism in there too

5410
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:46,800
hope or physics of optimism in there too
 

5411
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,830
hope or physics of optimism in there too
yes

5412
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:47,840
yes
 

5413
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,510
yes
because um

5414
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:49,520
because um
 

5415
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,910
because um
that seems like also i mean optimism

5416
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:51,920
that seems like also i mean optimism
 

5417
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,550
that seems like also i mean optimism
does seem to be a kind of engine that

5418
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:54,560
does seem to be a kind of engine that
 

5419
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,830
does seem to be a kind of engine that
results in innovation yes so this is dr

5420
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:57,840
results in innovation yes so this is dr
 

5421
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,510
results in innovation yes so this is dr
like what why the hell

5422
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520
like what why the hell
 

5423
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,910
like what why the hell
are we trying to come up with new stuff

5424
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:01,920
are we trying to come up with new stuff
 

5425
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,229
are we trying to come up with new stuff
oh so um so i made this point about

5426
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
oh so um so i made this point about
 

5427
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,430
oh so um so i made this point about
thinking life is the physics of

5428
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:05,440
thinking life is the physics of
 

5429
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,950
thinking life is the physics of
existence and it's not just the physics

5430
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:06,960
existence and it's not just the physics
 

5431
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,510
existence and it's not just the physics
of existence it's the physics of

5432
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:09,520
of existence it's the physics of
 

5433
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,270
of existence it's the physics of
more things existing

5434
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:11,280
more things existing
 

5435
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,270
more things existing
so i think one of these drives

5436
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:13,280
so i think one of these drives
 

5437
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,830
so i think one of these drives
the yeah creativity like optimism the

5438
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:15,840
the yeah creativity like optimism the
 

5439
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,550
the yeah creativity like optimism the
story so if you like people like entropy

5440
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:18,560
story so if you like people like entropy
 

5441
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,149
story so if you like people like entropy
i don't i don't like entropy as it was

5442
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:20,159
i don't i don't like entropy as it was
 

5443
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,669
i don't i don't like entropy as it was
formulated in the 1800s i think it's an

5444
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:21,679
formulated in the 1800s i think it's an
 

5445
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:24,870
formulated in the 1800s i think it's an
antiquated concept but um but this idea

5446
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:24,880
antiquated concept but um but this idea
 

5447
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,510
antiquated concept but um but this idea
of maximizing over the possible number

5448
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:27,520
of maximizing over the possible number
 

5449
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,189
of maximizing over the possible number
of states that could exist imagine the

5450
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:29,199
of states that could exist imagine the
 

5451
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,950
of states that could exist imagine the
universe is actually trying to maximize

5452
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:30,960
universe is actually trying to maximize
 

5453
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,070
universe is actually trying to maximize
over the number of things that could

5454
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:32,080
over the number of things that could
 

5455
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,910
over the number of things that could
physically exist what would be the best

5456
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:33,920
physically exist what would be the best
 

5457
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,270
physically exist what would be the best
way to do that the best way to do that

5458
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
way to do that the best way to do that
 

5459
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,550
way to do that the best way to do that
would be evolve intelligent

5460
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:36,560
would be evolve intelligent
 

5461
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,310
would be evolve intelligent
technological things that could explore

5462
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:38,320
technological things that could explore
 

5463
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,590
technological things that could explore
that space

5464
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:41,600

 

5465
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,750

so okay that's talking about alien life

5466
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:43,760
so okay that's talking about alien life
 

5467
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,510
so okay that's talking about alien life
out there in the universe but you've

5468
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:45,520
out there in the universe but you've
 

5469
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,950
out there in the universe but you've
also earlier in the conversation

5470
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:46,960
also earlier in the conversation
 

5471
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,390
also earlier in the conversation
mentioned

5472
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:48,400
mentioned
 

5473
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,950
mentioned
the shadow biosphere so is it possible

5474
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:52,960
the shadow biosphere so is it possible
 

5475
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,669
the shadow biosphere so is it possible
that we have weird life here

5476
01:29:55,669 --> 01:29:55,679
that we have weird life here
 

5477
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:58,390
that we have weird life here
on earth that we're just not

5478
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:58,400
on earth that we're just not
 

5479
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,110
on earth that we're just not
like even in a high assembly formulation

5480
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:01,120
like even in a high assembly formulation
 

5481
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,709
like even in a high assembly formulation
of life yeah that we're just not

5482
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:04,719
of life yeah that we're just not
 

5483
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:07,110
of life yeah that we're just not
paying attention to we're blind to like

5484
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:07,120
paying attention to we're blind to like
 

5485
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,350
paying attention to we're blind to like
life we're potentially able to detect

5486
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:09,360
life we're potentially able to detect
 

5487
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,030
life we're potentially able to detect
but we're blind to and maybe you could

5488
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:11,040
but we're blind to and maybe you could
 

5489
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,189
but we're blind to and maybe you could
say what is the shadow bias sure sure

5490
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:13,199
say what is the shadow bias sure sure
 

5491
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,110
say what is the shadow bias sure sure
yeah the shadow biosphere is this idea

5492
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:15,120
yeah the shadow biosphere is this idea
 

5493
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,790
yeah the shadow biosphere is this idea
that there might have been other

5494
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:16,800
that there might have been other
 

5495
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,470
that there might have been other
original life events that happened on

5496
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
original life events that happened on
 

5497
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,750
original life events that happened on
earth

5498
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:19,760
earth
 

5499
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,229
earth
that were independent from the original

5500
01:30:22,229 --> 01:30:22,239
that were independent from the original
 

5501
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:24,629
that were independent from the original
life event that led to us and all of the

5502
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:24,639
life event that led to us and all of the
 

5503
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:27,750
life event that led to us and all of the
life that we know on earth and therefore

5504
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:27,760
life that we know on earth and therefore
 

5505
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,910
life that we know on earth and therefore
there could be aliens in the sense they

5506
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:29,920
there could be aliens in the sense they
 

5507
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,070
there could be aliens in the sense they
have a different origin event

5508
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:32,080
have a different origin event
 

5509
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,510
have a different origin event
living among us um uh and it was

5510
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:35,520
living among us um uh and it was
 

5511
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,149
living among us um uh and it was
proposed by a number of people um

5512
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:38,159
proposed by a number of people um
 

5513
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,990
proposed by a number of people um
but one of them was a paul davies that i

5514
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:40,000
but one of them was a paul davies that i
 

5515
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,510
but one of them was a paul davies that i
mentioned earlier as my mentor and he

5516
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:41,520
mentioned earlier as my mentor and he
 

5517
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,030
mentioned earlier as my mentor and he
has a really a cute way of saying that

5518
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:43,040
has a really a cute way of saying that
 

5519
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,790
has a really a cute way of saying that
aliens could be right under our noses or

5520
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:44,800
aliens could be right under our noses or
 

5521
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,310
aliens could be right under our noses or
even in our noses

5522
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,320
even in our noses
 

5523
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,750
even in our noses
uh with a british accent it sounds

5524
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:49,760
uh with a british accent it sounds
 

5525
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,870
uh with a british accent it sounds
better but um but uh but anyway so the

5526
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:52,880
better but um but uh but anyway so the
 

5527
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,709
better but um but uh but anyway so the
idea is like it could literally be

5528
01:30:54,709 --> 01:30:54,719
idea is like it could literally be
 

5529
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,030
idea is like it could literally be
anywhere around us um and if you think

5530
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,040
anywhere around us um and if you think
 

5531
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,390
anywhere around us um and if you think
actually about the discovery of like

5532
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:58,400
actually about the discovery of like
 

5533
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,470
actually about the discovery of like
viruses and bacteria you know for a long

5534
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:00,480
viruses and bacteria you know for a long
 

5535
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,510
viruses and bacteria you know for a long
time we didn't they were kind of a

5536
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,520
time we didn't they were kind of a
 

5537
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,990
time we didn't they were kind of a
shadow biosphere it was life that was

5538
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:04,000
shadow biosphere it was life that was
 

5539
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,470
shadow biosphere it was life that was
around us but invisible

5540
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:06,480
around us but invisible
 

5541
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,149
around us but invisible
um and

5542
01:31:08,149 --> 01:31:08,159
um and
 

5543
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:09,669
um and
but this takes it a little bit further

5544
01:31:09,669 --> 01:31:09,679
but this takes it a little bit further
 

5545
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,430
but this takes it a little bit further
in saying that you know all of those

5546
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:11,440
in saying that you know all of those
 

5547
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,350
in saying that you know all of those
examples viruses bacteria and everything

5548
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:13,360
examples viruses bacteria and everything
 

5549
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,270
examples viruses bacteria and everything
that we've discovered so far has this

5550
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:15,280
that we've discovered so far has this
 

5551
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,709
that we've discovered so far has this
common ancestry in the last universal

5552
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:16,719
common ancestry in the last universal
 

5553
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,870
common ancestry in the last universal
common ancestor of life on earth so

5554
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:18,880
common ancestor of life on earth so
 

5555
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,470
common ancestor of life on earth so
maybe there was a different origin event

5556
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:20,480
maybe there was a different origin event
 

5557
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,709
maybe there was a different origin event
and that life is weirder still

5558
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:22,719
and that life is weirder still
 

5559
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,270
and that life is weirder still
and might be among us and we could find

5560
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:25,280
and might be among us and we could find
 

5561
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,550
and might be among us and we could find
it

5562
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:26,560
it
 

5563
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,830
it
we don't have to go out and stars live

5564
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:27,840
we don't have to go out and stars live
 

5565
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,990
we don't have to go out and stars live
for aliens just here on earth do you

5566
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:30,000
for aliens just here on earth do you
 

5567
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,070
for aliens just here on earth do you
think that's a serious

5568
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:32,080
think that's a serious
 

5569
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,149
think that's a serious
possibility that we should explore with

5570
01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:34,159
possibility that we should explore with
 

5571
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:35,750
possibility that we should explore with
the tools of science like this should be

5572
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:35,760
the tools of science like this should be
 

5573
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,950
the tools of science like this should be
a serious effort i think um yes and no

5574
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:38,960
a serious effort i think um yes and no
 

5575
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,390
a serious effort i think um yes and no
um and

5576
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:40,400
um and
 

5577
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,229
um and
i mean yes because i think it's a

5578
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:42,239
i mean yes because i think it's a
 

5579
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:45,189
i mean yes because i think it's a
serious hypothesis um and i think it's

5580
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:45,199
serious hypothesis um and i think it's
 

5581
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,830
serious hypothesis um and i think it's
worth exploring and it is certainly more

5582
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:47,840
worth exploring and it is certainly more
 

5583
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,229
worth exploring and it is certainly more
economical to look for

5584
01:31:50,229 --> 01:31:50,239
economical to look for
 

5585
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,550
economical to look for
signs of alien life on earth than it is

5586
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:52,560
signs of alien life on earth than it is
 

5587
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,709
signs of alien life on earth than it is
to go and build spacecraft and send

5588
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:54,719
to go and build spacecraft and send
 

5589
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,629
to go and build spacecraft and send
robots to other planets and that was one

5590
01:31:56,629 --> 01:31:56,639
robots to other planets and that was one
 

5591
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:58,390
robots to other planets and that was one
of the reasons it was proposed is well

5592
01:31:58,390 --> 01:31:58,400
of the reasons it was proposed is well
 

5593
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,550
of the reasons it was proposed is well
if we do find an example of another

5594
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:00,560
if we do find an example of another
 

5595
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,470
if we do find an example of another
original life on earth it's hugely

5596
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:02,480
original life on earth it's hugely
 

5597
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,990
original life on earth it's hugely
informative because it means the

5598
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:04,000
informative because it means the
 

5599
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,590
informative because it means the
original life is not a rare event if it

5600
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:05,600
original life is not a rare event if it
 

5601
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,550
original life is not a rare event if it
happened

5602
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:06,560
happened
 

5603
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,390
happened
twice on the same planet that means it's

5604
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:08,400
twice on the same planet that means it's
 

5605
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,750
twice on the same planet that means it's
probably pretty probable given

5606
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:09,760
probably pretty probable given
 

5607
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,189
probably pretty probable given
conditions are right

5608
01:32:11,189 --> 01:32:11,199
conditions are right
 

5609
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,510
conditions are right
um so it has huge potential scientific

5610
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:13,520
um so it has huge potential scientific
 

5611
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,189
um so it has huge potential scientific
impact not to mention the fact that you

5612
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:15,199
impact not to mention the fact that you
 

5613
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,790
impact not to mention the fact that you
might have like biochemistry and stuff

5614
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:16,800
might have like biochemistry and stuff
 

5615
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,470
might have like biochemistry and stuff
that's informative for like medicine and

5616
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
that's informative for like medicine and
 

5617
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,750
that's informative for like medicine and
stuff like that but

5618
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:19,760
stuff like that but
 

5619
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,629
stuff like that but
um

5620
01:32:20,629 --> 01:32:20,639
um
 

5621
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:22,310
um
but i think that the thing for me that's

5622
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:22,320
but i think that the thing for me that's
 

5623
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,669
but i think that the thing for me that's
challenging about it and this really

5624
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:23,679
challenging about it and this really
 

5625
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,189
challenging about it and this really
comes from my own work like thinking

5626
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:25,199
comes from my own work like thinking
 

5627
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:26,870
comes from my own work like thinking
about

5628
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:26,880
about
 

5629
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,950
about
life as a planetary scale process and

5630
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:28,960
life as a planetary scale process and
 

5631
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,950
life as a planetary scale process and
also trying to understand

5632
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:30,960
also trying to understand
 

5633
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:31,990
also trying to understand
sometimes what i call like the

5634
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000
sometimes what i call like the
 

5635
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,750
sometimes what i call like the
statistical mechanics of biochemistry

5636
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:33,760
statistical mechanics of biochemistry
 

5637
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,669
statistical mechanics of biochemistry
but large scale statistical patterns in

5638
01:32:35,669 --> 01:32:35,679
but large scale statistical patterns in
 

5639
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:38,390
but large scale statistical patterns in
the chemistry that life uses on earth

5640
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:38,400
the chemistry that life uses on earth
 

5641
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,709
the chemistry that life uses on earth
there are a lot of regularities there

5642
01:32:40,709 --> 01:32:40,719
there are a lot of regularities there
 

5643
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:43,990
there are a lot of regularities there
and life does seem to have planetary

5644
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:44,000
and life does seem to have planetary
 

5645
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,470
and life does seem to have planetary
scale organization that's consistent

5646
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:46,480
scale organization that's consistent
 

5647
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,990
scale organization that's consistent
even with some of the patterns that we

5648
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:48,000
even with some of the patterns that we
 

5649
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,510
even with some of the patterns that we
see at the individual scale so if you

5650
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:49,520
see at the individual scale so if you
 

5651
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,950
see at the individual scale so if you
think life is a planetary scale

5652
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:50,960
think life is a planetary scale
 

5653
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,189
think life is a planetary scale
phenomena and the chemistry of life has

5654
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:53,199
phenomena and the chemistry of life has
 

5655
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:54,390
phenomena and the chemistry of life has
to be sort of

5656
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:54,400
to be sort of
 

5657
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,189
to be sort of
um

5658
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:55,199
um
 

5659
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,590
um
not just it's not an individual is not

5660
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
not just it's not an individual is not
 

5661
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,590
not just it's not an individual is not
necessarily the fundamental unit of life

5662
01:32:59,590 --> 01:32:59,600
necessarily the fundamental unit of life
 

5663
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,350
necessarily the fundamental unit of life
right the fundamental you know life is

5664
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:01,360
right the fundamental you know life is
 

5665
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,910
right the fundamental you know life is
these uh informational lineages and

5666
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:03,920
these uh informational lineages and
 

5667
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,149
these uh informational lineages and
they're kind of you know they intersect

5668
01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:06,159
they're kind of you know they intersect
 

5669
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,030
they're kind of you know they intersect
over

5670
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:07,040
over
 

5671
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,510
over
spatial scales so everything on earth is

5672
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:09,520
spatial scales so everything on earth is
 

5673
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,189
spatial scales so everything on earth is
kind of related by the common causal

5674
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:11,199
kind of related by the common causal
 

5675
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:14,070
kind of related by the common causal
history yeah so it's hard for me

5676
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,080
history yeah so it's hard for me
 

5677
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,430
history yeah so it's hard for me
based on the way i think about the

5678
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:15,440
based on the way i think about the
 

5679
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,070
based on the way i think about the
physics and also some of the stuff that

5680
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:18,080
physics and also some of the stuff that
 

5681
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,990
physics and also some of the stuff that
my group has done to really think that

5682
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:20,000
my group has done to really think that
 

5683
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,430
my group has done to really think that
there could be

5684
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:21,440
there could be
 

5685
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,990
there could be
uh evidence or there could be a second

5686
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
uh evidence or there could be a second
 

5687
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,510
uh evidence or there could be a second
sample of life on earth but i think

5688
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:25,520
sample of life on earth but i think
 

5689
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,030
sample of life on earth but i think
there are ways that we need to be more

5690
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:27,040
there are ways that we need to be more
 

5691
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,669
there are ways that we need to be more
concrete about that and i have thought a

5692
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:29,679
concrete about that and i have thought a
 

5693
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,070
concrete about that and i have thought a
little bit about like um you know like

5694
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:32,080
little bit about like um you know like
 

5695
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,590
little bit about like um you know like
you can represent the chemistry in an

5696
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:33,600
you can represent the chemistry in an
 

5697
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,629
you can represent the chemistry in an
individual cell as a network and then

5698
01:33:36,629 --> 01:33:36,639
individual cell as a network and then
 

5699
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:38,390
individual cell as a network and then
those networks something my group has

5700
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:38,400
those networks something my group has
 

5701
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,270
those networks something my group has
shown

5702
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:39,280
shown
 

5703
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,350
shown
actually scale

5704
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
actually scale
 

5705
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,110
actually scale
with the same properties so ecosystems

5706
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:43,120
with the same properties so ecosystems
 

5707
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,550
with the same properties so ecosystems
have the same properties as individuals

5708
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:44,560
have the same properties as individuals
 

5709
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,629
have the same properties as individuals
as planetary scale and then you could

5710
01:33:46,629 --> 01:33:46,639
as planetary scale and then you could
 

5711
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,470
as planetary scale and then you could
imagine if you had alien chemistry

5712
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:48,480
imagine if you had alien chemistry
 

5713
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,149
imagine if you had alien chemistry
intermixed in there that scaling would

5714
01:33:50,149 --> 01:33:50,159
intermixed in there that scaling would
 

5715
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,310
intermixed in there that scaling would
be broken so if there's some robustness

5716
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,320
be broken so if there's some robustness
 

5717
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,470
be broken so if there's some robustness
property or something associated to it

5718
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:54,480
property or something associated to it
 

5719
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,990
property or something associated to it
and you get alien chemistry in there it

5720
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
and you get alien chemistry in there it
 

5721
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,590
and you get alien chemistry in there it
just breaks everything and you don't

5722
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:57,600
just breaks everything and you don't
 

5723
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,070
just breaks everything and you don't
have a planetary ecosystem functioning

5724
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:02,080
have a planetary ecosystem functioning
 

5725
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,910
have a planetary ecosystem functioning
an individual's functioning across all

5726
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:03,920
an individual's functioning across all
 

5727
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,070
an individual's functioning across all
these scales so i guess what i'm arguing

5728
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:06,080
these scales so i guess what i'm arguing
 

5729
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,830
these scales so i guess what i'm arguing
is life is not a scale-dependent

5730
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:07,840
is life is not a scale-dependent
 

5731
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,310
is life is not a scale-dependent
phenomena it's not just cellular life so

5732
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:10,320
phenomena it's not just cellular life so
 

5733
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,669
phenomena it's not just cellular life so
if you have a shadow biosphere it has to

5734
01:34:11,669 --> 01:34:11,679
if you have a shadow biosphere it has to
 

5735
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:12,950
if you have a shadow biosphere it has to
be integrated with all of these other

5736
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:12,960
be integrated with all of these other
 

5737
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,430
be integrated with all of these other
scales in it and that and that would

5738
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:15,440
scales in it and that and that would
 

5739
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,709
scales in it and that and that would
lose the meaning of the word shadow

5740
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
lose the meaning of the word shadow
 

5741
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,229
lose the meaning of the word shadow
biosphere i think so yeah so so i i it's

5742
01:34:20,229 --> 01:34:20,239
biosphere i think so yeah so so i i it's
 

5743
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,830
biosphere i think so yeah so so i i it's
an open question right and i think it

5744
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:21,840
an open question right and i think it
 

5745
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,430
an open question right and i think it
would it would tell us a lot so there

5746
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:23,440
would it would tell us a lot so there
 

5747
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,750
would it would tell us a lot so there
has been very minimal effort of people

5748
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:25,760
has been very minimal effort of people
 

5749
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,990
has been very minimal effort of people
to look for a shadow biosphere

5750
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:28,000
to look for a shadow biosphere
 

5751
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,910
to look for a shadow biosphere
but then the question it could be

5752
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:29,920
but then the question it could be
 

5753
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,750
but then the question it could be
possible that uh

5754
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:31,760
possible that uh
 

5755
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,189
possible that uh
there's like sufficiently distinct

5756
01:34:35,189 --> 01:34:35,199
there's like sufficiently distinct
 

5757
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:37,910
there's like sufficiently distinct
planets within one planet meaning like

5758
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:37,920
planets within one planet meaning like
 

5759
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,390
planets within one planet meaning like
environments within one planet yeah like

5760
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:40,400
environments within one planet yeah like
 

5761
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,390
environments within one planet yeah like
i don't know

5762
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:42,400
i don't know
 

5763
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,550
i don't know
i've been looking uh recently

5764
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:44,560
i've been looking uh recently
 

5765
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,629
i've been looking uh recently
uh because of having a chat with

5766
01:34:46,629 --> 01:34:46,639
uh because of having a chat with
 

5767
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,709
uh because of having a chat with
catherine declare about io the moon of

5768
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:48,719
catherine declare about io the moon of
 

5769
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:50,470
catherine declare about io the moon of
jupiter that's like all volcanoes and

5770
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:50,480
jupiter that's like all volcanoes and
 

5771
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,310
jupiter that's like all volcanoes and
volcanoes a badass but like yeah

5772
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:52,320
volcanoes a badass but like yeah
 

5773
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,760
volcanoes a badass but like yeah
imagining

5774
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:53,770
imagining
 

5775
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:55,910
imagining
[Laughter]

5776
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:55,920
[Laughter]
 

5777
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,910
[Laughter]
imagining life inside volcanoes right

5778
01:34:57,910 --> 01:34:57,920
imagining life inside volcanoes right
 

5779
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,070
imagining life inside volcanoes right
like yeah it seems like sufficiently

5780
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080
like yeah it seems like sufficiently
 

5781
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,510
like yeah it seems like sufficiently
chemically

5782
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:01,520
chemically
 

5783
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,950
chemically
different

5784
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:02,960
different
 

5785
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,350
different
like to be living in the darkness right

5786
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:05,360
like to be living in the darkness right
 

5787
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,350
like to be living in the darkness right
where there's a lot of heat and maybe

5788
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:07,360
where there's a lot of heat and maybe
 

5789
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,350
where there's a lot of heat and maybe
you could have different earths on like

5790
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:09,360
you could have different earths on like
 

5791
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,669
you could have different earths on like
a planet yeah or like if you go deep

5792
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:11,679
a planet yeah or like if you go deep
 

5793
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,189
a planet yeah or like if you go deep
enough in the crust maybe there's like a

5794
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:13,199
enough in the crust maybe there's like a
 

5795
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:14,470
enough in the crust maybe there's like a
layer where there's no life and then

5796
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:14,480
layer where there's no life and then
 

5797
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,149
layer where there's no life and then
there's suddenly life again and maybe

5798
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:16,159
there's suddenly life again and maybe
 

5799
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:18,470
there's suddenly life again and maybe
those you know lizard

5800
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:18,480
those you know lizard
 

5801
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,709
those you know lizard
men or whatever that people dream about

5802
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:20,719
men or whatever that people dream about
 

5803
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,350
men or whatever that people dream about
are really down there um i know that's a

5804
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:23,360
are really down there um i know that's a
 

5805
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,030
are really down there um i know that's a
little flippant but but really like

5806
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:25,040
little flippant but but really like
 

5807
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,870
little flippant but but really like
there could be like chemical cycles deep

5808
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:26,880
there could be like chemical cycles deep
 

5809
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,109
there could be like chemical cycles deep
in those crests that might be alive and

5810
01:35:29,109 --> 01:35:29,119
in those crests that might be alive and
 

5811
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:31,030
in those crests that might be alive and
are completely distinct in chemical or

5812
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,040
are completely distinct in chemical or
 

5813
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,350
are completely distinct in chemical or
origin to surface life

5814
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:33,360
origin to surface life
 

5815
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,870
origin to surface life
right that they wouldn't be interacting

5816
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:34,880
right that they wouldn't be interacting
 

5817
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,990
right that they wouldn't be interacting
with each other yeah and that's one of

5818
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,000
with each other yeah and that's one of
 

5819
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,590
with each other yeah and that's one of
the proposals for the shadow biosphere

5820
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:37,600
the proposals for the shadow biosphere
 

5821
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,109
the proposals for the shadow biosphere
is like sometimes people talk about it

5822
01:35:39,109 --> 01:35:39,119
is like sometimes people talk about it
 

5823
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:41,990
is like sometimes people talk about it
as being geologically or geographically

5824
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:42,000
as being geologically or geographically
 

5825
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,910
as being geologically or geographically
distinct that it might be you know you

5826
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:43,920
distinct that it might be you know you
 

5827
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,590
distinct that it might be you know you
have no life for this region and then a

5828
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:45,600
have no life for this region and then a
 

5829
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,189
have no life for this region and then a
different example and then sometimes

5830
01:35:47,189 --> 01:35:47,199
different example and then sometimes
 

5831
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,629
different example and then sometimes
people talk about it being chemically

5832
01:35:48,629 --> 01:35:48,639
people talk about it being chemically
 

5833
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:50,629
people talk about it being chemically
distinct that the chemistry is

5834
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:50,639
distinct that the chemistry is
 

5835
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:51,750
distinct that the chemistry is
sufficiently different that it's

5836
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:51,760
sufficiently different that it's
 

5837
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,669
sufficiently different that it's
completely orthogonal or non-interacting

5838
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:53,679
completely orthogonal or non-interacting
 

5839
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,030
completely orthogonal or non-interacting
with our chemistry it seems to me at

5840
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:55,040
with our chemistry it seems to me at
 

5841
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,790
with our chemistry it seems to me at
least the chemistry is

5842
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:56,800
least the chemistry is
 

5843
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,790
least the chemistry is
a a more powerful

5844
01:35:58,790 --> 01:35:58,800
a a more powerful
 

5845
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,310
a a more powerful
boundary yes than than than geographic

5846
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:02,320
boundary yes than than than geographic
 

5847
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,990
boundary yes than than than geographic
it just seems like life

5848
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:04,000
it just seems like life
 

5849
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,350
it just seems like life
finds a way literally to travel yeah

5850
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:07,360
finds a way literally to travel yeah
 

5851
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,149
finds a way literally to travel yeah
yes

5852
01:36:08,149 --> 01:36:08,159
yes
 

5853
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,550
yes
what do you think about all these ufo

5854
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:10,560
what do you think about all these ufo
 

5855
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,990
what do you think about all these ufo
sightings so to me it's really inspiring

5856
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:14,000
sightings so to me it's really inspiring
 

5857
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,990
sightings so to me it's really inspiring
it's yet another

5858
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:16,000
it's yet another
 

5859
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,830
it's yet another
localized way to dream about right the

5860
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:19,840
localized way to dream about right the
 

5861
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,390
localized way to dream about right the
mysterious that is out there yeah

5862
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:22,400
mysterious that is out there yeah
 

5863
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,629
mysterious that is out there yeah
so i've actually been more intrigued by

5864
01:36:24,629 --> 01:36:24,639
so i've actually been more intrigued by
 

5865
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:26,709
so i've actually been more intrigued by
the cultural phenomena ufos than the

5866
01:36:26,709 --> 01:36:26,719
the cultural phenomena ufos than the
 

5867
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:28,629
the cultural phenomena ufos than the
phenomena ufos themselves because i

5868
01:36:28,629 --> 01:36:28,639
phenomena ufos themselves because i
 

5869
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:31,270
phenomena ufos themselves because i
think it's intriguing about how

5870
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:31,280
think it's intriguing about how
 

5871
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,149
think it's intriguing about how
uh

5872
01:36:32,149 --> 01:36:32,159
uh
 

5873
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:35,510
uh
we are preparing ourselves mentally

5874
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
we are preparing ourselves mentally
 

5875
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,070
we are preparing ourselves mentally
for understanding others and how we have

5876
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,080
for understanding others and how we have
 

5877
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,070
for understanding others and how we have
thought about that historically and what

5878
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:40,080
thought about that historically and what
 

5879
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,430
thought about that historically and what
the sort of

5880
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:41,440
the sort of
 

5881
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,229
the sort of
modern incarnations of that are um

5882
01:36:44,229 --> 01:36:44,239
modern incarnations of that are um
 

5883
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:45,750
modern incarnations of that are um
it's more like

5884
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:45,760
it's more like
 

5885
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,750
it's more like
i want an explanation for us that's my

5886
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:47,760
i want an explanation for us that's my
 

5887
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,390
i want an explanation for us that's my
motivation and having some you know

5888
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,400
motivation and having some you know
 

5889
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,149
motivation and having some you know
streaks across the sky or something and

5890
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:52,159
streaks across the sky or something and
 

5891
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:54,070
streaks across the sky or something and
saying that's aliens it doesn't tell you

5892
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:54,080
saying that's aliens it doesn't tell you
 

5893
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,109
saying that's aliens it doesn't tell you
anything

5894
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:55,119
anything
 

5895
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,870
anything
um so unless you have a deeper

5896
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:56,880
um so unless you have a deeper
 

5897
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,550
um so unless you have a deeper
explanation and you have you know more

5898
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:58,560
explanation and you have you know more
 

5899
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,910
explanation and you have you know more
lines of

5900
01:36:59,910 --> 01:36:59,920
lines of
 

5901
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,590
lines of
uh you know where is this going to take

5902
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:01,600
uh you know where is this going to take
 

5903
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,669
uh you know where is this going to take
us in the future it's just not as

5904
01:37:03,669 --> 01:37:03,679
us in the future it's just not as
 

5905
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:05,510
us in the future it's just not as
interesting to me as the problem of

5906
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:05,520
interesting to me as the problem of
 

5907
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,510
interesting to me as the problem of
understanding life itself and aliens as

5908
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:07,520
understanding life itself and aliens as
 

5909
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,109
understanding life itself and aliens as
a more general phenomenon i do think

5910
01:37:09,109 --> 01:37:09,119
a more general phenomenon i do think
 

5911
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,950
a more general phenomenon i do think
it's uh just as you said

5912
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:10,960
it's uh just as you said
 

5913
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,870
it's uh just as you said
a good way to psychologically and

5914
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
a good way to psychologically and
 

5915
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,430
a good way to psychologically and
sociologically prepare ourselves to sort

5916
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:15,440
sociologically prepare ourselves to sort
 

5917
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,430
sociologically prepare ourselves to sort
of like what would that look like right

5918
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:17,440
of like what would that look like right
 

5919
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,350
of like what would that look like right
and very importantly which is what a lot

5920
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
and very importantly which is what a lot
 

5921
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,430
and very importantly which is what a lot
of people talk about politically

5922
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:21,440
of people talk about politically
 

5923
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,550
of people talk about politically
sort of uh there's this idea from the so

5924
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:24,560
sort of uh there's this idea from the so
 

5925
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,629
sort of uh there's this idea from the so
it came from the soviet union of like

5926
01:37:26,629 --> 01:37:26,639
it came from the soviet union of like
 

5927
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:29,669
it came from the soviet union of like
the cold war and we have to hide secrets

5928
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:29,679
the cold war and we have to hide secrets
 

5929
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:32,229
the cold war and we have to hide secrets
yeah there's some way in us searching

5930
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,239
yeah there's some way in us searching
 

5931
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:33,910
yeah there's some way in us searching
for life on other planets are searching

5932
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:33,920
for life on other planets are searching
 

5933
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,070
for life on other planets are searching
for life in general

5934
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
for life in general
 

5935
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,750
for life in general
the

5936
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:37,760
the
 

5937
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,510
the
the way we've done government in the

5938
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:39,520
the way we've done government in the
 

5939
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,629
the way we've done government in the
past yeah we tend to think of all new

5940
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
past yeah we tend to think of all new
 

5941
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:45,350
past yeah we tend to think of all new
things as potential military secrets so

5942
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:45,360
things as potential military secrets so
 

5943
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,030
things as potential military secrets so
we want to hide them

5944
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,040
we want to hide them
 

5945
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,950
we want to hide them
and one of the ways that people kind of

5946
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960
and one of the ways that people kind of
 

5947
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,590
and one of the ways that people kind of
look at ufo sightings is like

5948
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:51,600
look at ufo sightings is like
 

5949
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,430
look at ufo sightings is like
like maybe we shouldn't hide this stuff

5950
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:53,440
like maybe we shouldn't hide this stuff
 

5951
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,189
like maybe we shouldn't hide this stuff
like what is the government hiding right

5952
01:37:55,189 --> 01:37:55,199
like what is the government hiding right
 

5953
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:57,350
like what is the government hiding right
i think that's a really

5954
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
i think that's a really
 

5955
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,709
i think that's a really
you know in one sense it's a

5956
01:37:58,709 --> 01:37:58,719
you know in one sense it's a
 

5957
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:01,590
you know in one sense it's a
conspiratorial question but i think

5958
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:01,600
conspiratorial question but i think
 

5959
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,430
conspiratorial question but i think
in another it's an

5960
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:03,440
in another it's an
 

5961
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:06,550
in another it's an
inspiration to change the way we do

5962
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:06,560
inspiration to change the way we do
 

5963
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,910
inspiration to change the way we do
government to where secrets don't uh

5964
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:09,920
government to where secrets don't uh
 

5965
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,590
government to where secrets don't uh
maybe there are times when you want to

5966
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:11,600
maybe there are times when you want to
 

5967
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,590
maybe there are times when you want to
keep secrets as military secrets but

5968
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:13,600
keep secrets as military secrets but
 

5969
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,270
keep secrets as military secrets but
maybe we need to release a lot more

5970
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:15,280
maybe we need to release a lot more
 

5971
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:18,470
maybe we need to release a lot more
stuff and see us as a human species as

5972
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:18,480
stuff and see us as a human species as
 

5973
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,390
stuff and see us as a human species as
together in this whole search yeah the

5974
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:20,400
together in this whole search yeah the
 

5975
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,310
together in this whole search yeah the
public engagement part there is really

5976
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:22,320
public engagement part there is really
 

5977
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,149
public engagement part there is really
interesting

5978
01:38:24,149 --> 01:38:24,159
interesting
 

5979
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:25,910
interesting
and it's almost like a challenge to the

5980
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
and it's almost like a challenge to the
 

5981
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,910
and it's almost like a challenge to the
way we've done stuff in the past in

5982
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:27,920
way we've done stuff in the past in
 

5983
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,830
way we've done stuff in the past in
terms of keeping secrets when they're

5984
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:29,840
terms of keeping secrets when they're
 

5985
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,830
terms of keeping secrets when they're
not so like

5986
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:31,840
not so like
 

5987
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,229
not so like
the the first step if you don't know how

5988
01:38:34,229 --> 01:38:34,239
the the first step if you don't know how
 

5989
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,870
the the first step if you don't know how
something how something works if there's

5990
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:36,880
something how something works if there's
 

5991
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:39,910
something how something works if there's
a mysterious thing the the first

5992
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:39,920
a mysterious thing the the first
 

5993
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,750
a mysterious thing the the first
instinct should not be like let's hide

5994
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:41,760
instinct should not be like let's hide
 

5995
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,310
instinct should not be like let's hide
it put it in the closet right so that

5996
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:44,320
it put it in the closet right so that
 

5997
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,070
it put it in the closet right so that
the chinese or the russian government or

5998
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
the chinese or the russian government or
 

5999
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,149
the chinese or the russian government or
whatever government doesn't uh doesn't

6000
01:38:48,149 --> 01:38:48,159
whatever government doesn't uh doesn't
 

6001
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:50,629
whatever government doesn't uh doesn't
find it maybe the first one the first

6002
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:50,639
find it maybe the first one the first
 

6003
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,709
find it maybe the first one the first
instinct should be let's understand it

6004
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:52,719
instinct should be let's understand it
 

6005
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:54,149
instinct should be let's understand it
yeah perhaps let's understand it

6006
01:38:54,149 --> 01:38:54,159
yeah perhaps let's understand it
 

6007
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:55,669
yeah perhaps let's understand it
together right

6008
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:55,679
together right
 

6009
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,750
together right
no i think that's good and and something

6010
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:57,760
no i think that's good and and something
 

6011
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,270
no i think that's good and and something
i realized recently that i never thought

6012
01:38:59,270 --> 01:38:59,280
i realized recently that i never thought
 

6013
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,390
i realized recently that i never thought
was going to be a problem but i think

6014
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:00,400
was going to be a problem but i think
 

6015
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,709
was going to be a problem but i think
this actually helps with quite a bit

6016
01:39:02,709 --> 01:39:02,719
this actually helps with quite a bit
 

6017
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:05,750
this actually helps with quite a bit
is because so many um people nowadays

6018
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:05,760
is because so many um people nowadays
 

6019
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,229
is because so many um people nowadays
believe we've already made contact

6020
01:39:08,229 --> 01:39:08,239
believe we've already made contact
 

6021
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:09,030
believe we've already made contact
that

6022
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:09,040
that
 

6023
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,830
that
as an astrobiologist if we you know

6024
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:11,840
as an astrobiologist if we you know
 

6025
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,430
as an astrobiologist if we you know
actually want to understand life and

6026
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:13,440
actually want to understand life and
 

6027
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,350
actually want to understand life and
make contact we kind of have to

6028
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:15,360
make contact we kind of have to
 

6029
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,709
make contact we kind of have to
deconstruct

6030
01:39:16,709 --> 01:39:16,719
deconstruct
 

6031
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:18,149
deconstruct
the narratives we've already built from

6032
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:18,159
the narratives we've already built from
 

6033
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:19,910
the narratives we've already built from
ourselves and kind of unteach ourselves

6034
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:19,920
ourselves and kind of unteach ourselves
 

6035
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,669
ourselves and kind of unteach ourselves
that we've learned about aliens and then

6036
01:39:21,669 --> 01:39:21,679
that we've learned about aliens and then
 

6037
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:23,510
that we've learned about aliens and then
reteach ourselves so there's this really

6038
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:23,520
reteach ourselves so there's this really
 

6039
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,390
reteach ourselves so there's this really
interesting sort of dialogue there um

6040
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:26,400
interesting sort of dialogue there um
 

6041
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,910
interesting sort of dialogue there um
and making it open to the public that

6042
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:27,920
and making it open to the public that
 

6043
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,189
and making it open to the public that
they actually have to think critically

6044
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:29,199
they actually have to think critically
 

6045
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:30,470
they actually have to think critically
about it and they see the evidence for

6046
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,480
about it and they see the evidence for
 

6047
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:31,910
about it and they see the evidence for
themselves i think is really important

6048
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:31,920
themselves i think is really important
 

6049
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,750
themselves i think is really important
for that process

6050
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:33,760
for that process
 

6051
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,990
for that process
yeah the restriction that aliens might

6052
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:36,000
yeah the restriction that aliens might
 

6053
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,270
yeah the restriction that aliens might
be way weirder than we can imagine yes

6054
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:39,280
be way weirder than we can imagine yes
 

6055
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,510
be way weirder than we can imagine yes
yes i'm i'm pretty sure they're probably

6056
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
yes i'm i'm pretty sure they're probably
 

6057
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,070
yes i'm i'm pretty sure they're probably
weirder than we can imagine

6058
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:44,080
weirder than we can imagine
 

6059
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,550
weirder than we can imagine
okay we've uh in 2020

6060
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:46,560
okay we've uh in 2020
 

6061
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,189
okay we've uh in 2020
and still living through a pandemic

all those kinds of things aside i've
 

6067
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,149
all those kinds of things aside i've
always found

6068
01:39:56,149 --> 01:39:56,159
always found

as
dynamical systems i was going to say

6076
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:02,320
dynamical systems i was going to say
 

6077
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,310
dynamical systems i was going to say
living systems but

6078
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:04,320
living systems but
 

6079
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,830
living systems but
i've always kind of thought of them as

6080
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:05,840
i've always kind of thought of them as
 

6081
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,229
i've always kind of thought of them as
living you know but that's a whole

6082
01:40:08,229 --> 01:40:08,239
living you know but that's a whole
 

6083
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:10,470
living you know but that's a whole
nother kind of discussion maybe

6084
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:10,480
nother kind of discussion maybe
 

6085
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,430
nother kind of discussion maybe
it'd be great to put that on the table

6086
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,440
it'd be great to put that on the table
 

6087
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,590
it'd be great to put that on the table
one do you find viruses

6088
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:15,600
one do you find viruses
 

6089
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,149

you think they're living
 

6093
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:21,430
you think they're living
things

6094
01:40:21,430 --> 01:40:21,440
things
 

6095
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,830
things
or there's some aspect to them

6096
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:23,840
or there's some aspect to them
 

6097
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,390
or there's some aspect to them

them living
 

6101
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,109
them living
i mean living in a pandemic saying

6102
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:29,119
i mean living in a pandemic saying
 

6103
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,629
i mean living in a pandemic saying
viruses are beautiful is probably a hard

6104
01:40:30,629 --> 01:40:30,639
viruses are beautiful is probably a hard
 

6105
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:33,270
viruses are beautiful is probably a hard
thing but i do find them

6106
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:33,280
thing but i do find them
 

6107
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,270
thing but i do find them
beautiful to a degree i think

6108
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:35,280
beautiful to a degree i think
 

6109
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,629
beautiful to a degree i think
even even even in the sense of mediating

even even even in the sense of mediating
 

6111
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,310
even even even in the sense of mediating
a global pandemic there's something like

6112
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:40,320
a global pandemic there's something like
 

6113
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,310
a global pandemic there's something like
deeply intriguing there because

deeply intriguing there because
 

6115
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,070
deeply intriguing there because

you know these these are tiny
 

6117
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,629
you know these these are tiny
tiny little things right and yet they

01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:05,840
scales of those things is just
 

6137
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,189
scales of those things is just
a really amazing feature of our world

6138
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:09,199
a really amazing feature of our world

way like right kind of run
 

6147
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,149

you know like

6148
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:20,159
you know like
 

6149
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:22,550
you know like
as opposed to like one thing makes

6150
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:22,560
as opposed to like one thing makes
 

6151
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,830
as opposed to like one thing makes
another thing

6152
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:23,840
another thing
 

6153
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,830
another thing
makes another thing it's one thing makes

6154
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:25,840
makes another thing it's one thing makes
 

6155
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,430
makes another thing it's one thing makes
two things and those two things make

6156
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:27,440
two things and those two things make
 

6157
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,910
two things and those two things make
four things and then like that kind of

6158
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:29,920
four things and then like that kind of
 

6159
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,149
four things and then like that kind of
process

6160
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:32,159
process
 

6161
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:35,430
process
also seems to be fundamental to life yes

6162
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:35,440
also seems to be fundamental to life yes
 

6163
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:36,950
also seems to be fundamental to life yes
and uh

6164
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:36,960
and uh
 

6165
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,270
and uh
it's terrifying because in in a matter

6166
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:39,280
it's terrifying because in in a matter
 

6167
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:42,629
it's terrifying because in in a matter
of in a very short time scale

6168
01:41:42,629 --> 01:41:42,639
of in a very short time scale
 

6169
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:45,189
of in a very short time scale
it can uh

6170
01:41:45,189 --> 01:41:45,199
it can uh
 

6171
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,350
it can uh
if it's good at being life

6172
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:47,360
if it's good at being life
 

6173
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,430
if it's good at being life
whatever that is yeah it can quickly

6174
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:49,440
whatever that is yeah it can quickly
 

6175
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,910
whatever that is yeah it can quickly
overtake the the other competing forms

6176
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:51,920
overtake the the other competing forms
 

6177
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,430
overtake the the other competing forms
of life right

6178
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:53,440
of life right
 

6179
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:56,629
of life right
and that's scary both for ai and

6180
01:41:56,629 --> 01:41:56,639
and that's scary both for ai and
 

6181
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,310
and that's scary both for ai and
for viruses and it seems like

6182
01:41:58,310 --> 01:41:58,320
for viruses and it seems like
 

6183
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,550
for viruses and it seems like
understanding these processes

6184
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:00,560
understanding these processes
 

6185
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,470
understanding these processes
that are underlying viruses and i don't

6186
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,480
that are underlying viruses and i don't
 

6187
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,470
that are underlying viruses and i don't
mean like on the virology or biology

6188
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:04,480
mean like on the virology or biology
 

6189
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,109
mean like on the virology or biology
side but on some kind of

6190
01:42:07,109 --> 01:42:07,119
side but on some kind of
 

6191
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,189
side but on some kind of
more computational physics yeah

6192
01:42:09,189 --> 01:42:09,199
more computational physics yeah
 

6193
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:10,790
more computational physics yeah
perspective as we've been talking about

6194
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:10,800
perspective as we've been talking about
 

6195
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,550
perspective as we've been talking about
yeah seems to be really important to

6196
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:14,560
yeah seems to be really important to
 

6197
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,510
yeah seems to be really important to
figure out how humans can

6198
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:17,520
figure out how humans can
 

6199
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,030
figure out how humans can
survive

6200
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:19,040
survive
 

6201
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,470
survive
right

6202
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:20,480
right
 

6203
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,030
right
along with these kinds of

6204
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:23,040
along with these kinds of
 

6205
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,149
along with these kinds of
this kind of life and perhaps becoming a

6206
01:42:25,149 --> 01:42:25,159
this kind of life and perhaps becoming a
 

6207
01:42:25,159 --> 01:42:27,830
this kind of life and perhaps becoming a
multi-planetary species is

6208
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:27,840
multi-planetary species is
 

6209
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,390
multi-planetary species is
is a part of that like there's no maybe

6210
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:30,400
is a part of that like there's no maybe
 

6211
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,830
is a part of that like there's no maybe
like what we'll figure out from a

6212
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:31,840
like what we'll figure out from a
 

6213
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,910
like what we'll figure out from a
physics perspective is like there's no

6214
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:33,920
physics perspective is like there's no
 

6215
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,590
physics perspective is like there's no
way

6216
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:35,600
way
 

6217
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,990
way
any living system

6218
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:38,000
any living system
 

6219
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,390
any living system
can be stable for a prolonged period of

01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:40,400
can be stable for a prolonged period of
 

6221
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,550
can be stable for a prolonged period of
time and survive unless it expands

01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:42,560
time and survive unless it expands
 

6223
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,470
time and survive unless it expands
exponentially throughout like

6224
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:44,480
exponentially throughout like
 

6225
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,750
exponentially throughout like
we have to multiply otherwise

6226
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:47,760
we have to multiply otherwise
 

6227
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,189
we have to multiply otherwise
anything that doesn't multiply

6228
01:42:49,189 --> 01:42:49,199
anything that doesn't multiply
 

6229
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:51,030
anything that doesn't multiply
exponentially will die eventually maybe

6230
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:51,040
exponentially will die eventually maybe
 

6231
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,790
exponentially will die eventually maybe
that's a fundamental law

6232
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:52,800
that's a fundamental law
 

6233
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,070
that's a fundamental law
um

6234
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,080
um
 

6235
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,270

01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:10,400
creativity
 

6257
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,550
creativity
right so like the drive is actually the

6258
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:12,560
right so like the drive is actually the
 

6259
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,870
right so like the drive is actually the
drive is creativity but if you want to

6260
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:14,880
drive is creativity but if you want to
 

6261
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,709
drive is creativity but if you want to
keep the creativity that's existed in

6262
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:16,719
keep the creativity that's existed in
 

6263
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:18,310
keep the creativity that's existed in
the past it has to be copied into the

6264
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:18,320
the past it has to be copied into the
 

6265
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,270
the past it has to be copied into the
future

6266
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:19,280
future
 

6267
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,590
future
right so replication like if you

6268
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:21,600
right so replication like if you
 

6269
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,189
right so replication like if you
so that for me is

6270
01:43:23,189 --> 01:43:23,199
so that for me is
 

6271
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:25,510
so that for me is
so i had this set of arguments um with

6272
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:25,520
so i had this set of arguments um with
 

6273
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,669
so i had this set of arguments um with
michael lachman and lee cronin about the

6274
01:43:27,669 --> 01:43:27,679
michael lachman and lee cronin about the
 

6275
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:29,510
michael lachman and lee cronin about the
like life being about persistence they

6276
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:29,520
like life being about persistence they
 

6277
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:30,709
like life being about persistence they
thought it was about persistence and

6278
01:43:30,709 --> 01:43:30,719
thought it was about persistence and
 

6279
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,229
thought it was about persistence and
like survival of fittest kind of thing

6280
01:43:32,229 --> 01:43:32,239
like survival of fittest kind of thing
 

6281
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,750
like survival of fittest kind of thing
and i'm like no it's about existence

6282
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:33,760
and i'm like no it's about existence
 

6283
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,669
and i'm like no it's about existence
it's like because when you're talking

6284
01:43:35,669 --> 01:43:35,679
it's like because when you're talking
 

6285
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:37,910
it's like because when you're talking
about that it's easy to say that in

6286
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:37,920
about that it's easy to say that in
 

6287
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,590
about that it's easy to say that in
retrospect you can post select on the

6288
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:39,600
retrospect you can post select on the
 

6289
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,510
retrospect you can post select on the
things that survived and then say why

6290
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:41,520
things that survived and then say why
 

6291
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,950
things that survived and then say why
they survived

6292
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:42,960
they survived
 

6293
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,030
they survived
but um but you can't do that going

6294
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:45,040
but um but you can't do that going
 

6295
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,149
but um but you can't do that going
forward

6296
01:43:46,149 --> 01:43:46,159
forward
 

6297
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:47,910
forward
that's really profound

6298
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:47,920
that's really profound
 

6299
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,870
that's really profound
that survival is just a nice little

6300
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:50,880
that survival is just a nice little
 

6301
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,510
that survival is just a nice little
side effect feature of

6302
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:53,520
side effect feature of
 

6303
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,430
side effect feature of
maximizing creativity but it doesn't

6304
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:55,440
maximizing creativity but it doesn't
 

6305
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,669
maximizing creativity but it doesn't
need to be there yeah

6306
01:43:57,669 --> 01:43:57,679
need to be there yeah
 

6307
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:00,070
need to be there yeah
i like people yeah yeah like i said i

6308
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:00,080
i like people yeah yeah like i said i
 

6309
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,990
i like people yeah yeah like i said i
like optimistic theories well i don't

6310
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:02,000
like optimistic theories well i don't
 

6311
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,270
like optimistic theories well i don't
know if that's up to me that that could

6312
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:03,280
know if that's up to me that that could
 

6313
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,270
know if that's up to me that that could
be terrifying to people because

6314
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:05,280
be terrifying to people because
 

6315
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,990
be terrifying to people because
yeah because uh you know a system that

6316
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:08,000
yeah because uh you know a system that
 

6317
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,030
yeah because uh you know a system that
maximizes creativity may very quickly

6318
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:11,040
maximizes creativity may very quickly
 

6319
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,189
maximizes creativity may very quickly
get rid of humans for some reason if it

6320
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:13,199
get rid of humans for some reason if it
 

6321
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:15,750
get rid of humans for some reason if it
comes up with some other creative

6322
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:15,760
comes up with some other creative
 

6323
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,270
comes up with some other creative
i mean yeah

6324
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:17,280
i mean yeah
 

6325
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,950
i mean yeah
forms of existence

6326
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:18,960
forms of existence
 

6327
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,350
forms of existence
yeah right this is the ai thing it's

6328
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:21,360
yeah right this is the ai thing it's
 

6329
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,669
yeah right this is the ai thing it's
like the moment you have an ai

6330
01:44:23,669 --> 01:44:23,679
like the moment you have an ai
 

6331
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:26,229
like the moment you have an ai
system that can

6332
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:26,239
system that can
 

6333
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:28,870
system that can
that can flourish in the space of ideas

6334
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:28,880
that can flourish in the space of ideas
 

6335
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,030
that can flourish in the space of ideas
or in some other space much more

6336
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:31,040
or in some other space much more
 

6337
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,189
or in some other space much more
effectively than humans

6338
01:44:33,189 --> 01:44:33,199
effectively than humans
 

6339
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:35,350
effectively than humans
and it's sufficiently integrated into

6340
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:35,360
and it's sufficiently integrated into
 

6341
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,030
and it's sufficiently integrated into
into the physical space to be able to

6342
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:37,040
into the physical space to be able to
 

6343
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,109
into the physical space to be able to
modify the environment

6344
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:39,119
modify the environment
 

6345
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:40,629
modify the environment
i think we'll just be like the core

6346
01:44:40,629 --> 01:44:40,639
i think we'll just be like the core
 

6347
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,070
i think we'll just be like the core
genetic architecture or something we'll

6348
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:42,080
genetic architecture or something we'll
 

6349
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,709
genetic architecture or something we'll
be like the dna for ai right it's like

6350
01:44:44,709 --> 01:44:44,719
be like the dna for ai right it's like
 

6351
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,390
be like the dna for ai right it's like
we haven't lost the past informational

6352
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:46,400
we haven't lost the past informational
 

6353
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,830
we haven't lost the past informational
architectures on this planet they're

6354
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:47,840
architectures on this planet they're
 

6355
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,750
architectures on this planet they're
still there

6356
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:49,760
still there
 

6357
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,629
still there
yeah also they'll ai will use our brains

6358
01:44:52,629 --> 01:44:52,639
yeah also they'll ai will use our brains
 

6359
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:55,669
yeah also they'll ai will use our brains
in some part to like like ride like

6360
01:44:55,669 --> 01:44:55,679
in some part to like like ride like
 

6361
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,910
in some part to like like ride like
it'll accelerate the exchange of ideas

6362
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:57,920
it'll accelerate the exchange of ideas
 

6363
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,870
it'll accelerate the exchange of ideas
that's the neural link dream is that

6364
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:00,880
that's the neural link dream is that
 

6365
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,350
that's the neural link dream is that
well the humans will be still around

6366
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360
well the humans will be still around
 

6367
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,430
well the humans will be still around
because you're saying architecture yeah

6368
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:05,440
because you're saying architecture yeah
 

6369
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,470
because you're saying architecture yeah
but i don't i don't even think they

6370
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:06,480
but i don't i don't even think they
 

6371
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,310
but i don't i don't even think they
necessarily need to tap in our brains i

6372
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:08,320
necessarily need to tap in our brains i
 

6373
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,990
necessarily need to tap in our brains i
mean just collectively we do interesting

6374
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:10,000
mean just collectively we do interesting
 

6375
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,590
mean just collectively we do interesting
things what if they were just using like

6376
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:11,600
things what if they were just using like
 

6377
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,109
things what if they were just using like
the patterns in our communication or

6378
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:13,119
the patterns in our communication or
 

6379
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:14,629
the patterns in our communication or
something

6380
01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
something
 

6381
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:15,510
something
oh

6382
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:15,520
oh
 

6383
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,350
oh
without controlling it just

6384
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:17,360
without controlling it just
 

6385
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,270
without controlling it just
observing well i i don't know in what

6386
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:19,280
observing well i i don't know in what
 

6387
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,629
observing well i i don't know in what
sense do you control the chemistry

6388
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:20,639
sense do you control the chemistry
 

6389
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:23,189
sense do you control the chemistry
happening in your body

6390
01:45:23,189 --> 01:45:23,199
happening in your body
 

6391
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:24,149
happening in your body
hmm

6392
01:45:24,149 --> 01:45:24,159
hmm
 

6393
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:25,109
hmm
yeah

6394
01:45:25,109 --> 01:45:25,119
yeah
 

6395
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:27,430
yeah
i i mean i i obviously i don't know i'm

6396
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,440
i i mean i i obviously i don't know i'm
 

6397
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,030
i i mean i i obviously i don't know i'm
just i i just

6398
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:29,040
just i i just
 

6399
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,550
just i i just
like the way i look at like people look

6400
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:30,560
like the way i look at like people look
 

6401
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,149
like the way i look at like people look
at ai and then they look at this thing

6402
01:45:32,149 --> 01:45:32,159
at ai and then they look at this thing
 

6403
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,149
at ai and then they look at this thing
that's bigger than us and is coming in

6404
01:45:34,149 --> 01:45:34,159
that's bigger than us and is coming in
 

6405
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:35,990
that's bigger than us and is coming in
the future and is smarter than us

6406
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:36,000
the future and is smarter than us
 

6407
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,910
the future and is smarter than us
and i think though that looking at the

6408
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:37,920
and i think though that looking at the
 

6409
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,750
and i think though that looking at the
past history of life on the planet and

6410
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:39,760
past history of life on the planet and
 

6411
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,189
past history of life on the planet and
what information has been doing for the

6412
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:41,199
what information has been doing for the
 

6413
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:43,030
what information has been doing for the
last four billion years is probably very

6414
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:43,040
last four billion years is probably very
 

6415
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,950
last four billion years is probably very
informative to asking questions about

6416
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:44,960
informative to asking questions about
 

6417
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,550
informative to asking questions about
what's coming next

6418
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:46,560
what's coming next
 

6419
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,669
what's coming next
um

6420
01:45:47,669 --> 01:45:47,679
um
 

6421
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:50,550
um
and i don't

6422
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:50,560
and i don't
 

6423
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,550
and i don't
one is planetary scale transitions are

6424
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:52,560
one is planetary scale transitions are
 

6425
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,709
one is planetary scale transitions are
really important for new phases so the

6426
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
really important for new phases so the
 

6427
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,070
really important for new phases so the
global internet and sort of global

6428
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:56,080
global internet and sort of global
 

6429
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,430
global internet and sort of global
integration of our technology i think

6430
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:57,440
integration of our technology i think
 

6431
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,870
integration of our technology i think
it's an important thing so that's again

6432
01:45:58,870 --> 01:45:58,880
it's an important thing so that's again
 

6433
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,189
it's an important thing so that's again
life is a planetary scale phenomena but

6434
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:01,199
life is a planetary scale phenomena but
 

6435
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:02,709
life is a planetary scale phenomena but
we're an integrated component of that

6436
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:02,719
we're an integrated component of that
 

6437
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,310
we're an integrated component of that
phenomenon i don't really see that the

6438
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:04,320
phenomenon i don't really see that the
 

6439
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,470
phenomenon i don't really see that the
technology is going to replace us

6440
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:06,480
technology is going to replace us
 

6441
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:07,669
technology is going to replace us
in that way it's just going to keep

6442
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:07,679
in that way it's just going to keep
 

6443
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:08,950
in that way it's just going to keep
scaffolding

6444
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:08,960
scaffolding
 

6445
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,870
scaffolding
and building and and i also don't have

6446
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:10,880
and building and and i also don't have
 

6447
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,149
and building and and i also don't have
an idea that we're going to build ai in

6448
01:46:12,149 --> 01:46:12,159
an idea that we're going to build ai in
 

6449
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:14,950
an idea that we're going to build ai in
a box i think ai is going to emerge agi

6450
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:14,960
a box i think ai is going to emerge agi
 

6451
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,950
a box i think ai is going to emerge agi
to be is a planetary scale phenomena

6452
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:16,960
to be is a planetary scale phenomena
 

6453
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,830
to be is a planetary scale phenomena
that's going to emerge from our

6454
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:17,840
that's going to emerge from our
 

6455
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,830
that's going to emerge from our
technology

6456
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:19,840
technology
 

6457
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,470
technology
planetary scale phenomena but do you

6458
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:22,480
planetary scale phenomena but do you
 

6459
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,430
planetary scale phenomena but do you
think

6460
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:23,440
think
 

6461
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,990
think
an agi is not distinct from humans we're

6462
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:26,000
an agi is not distinct from humans we're
 

6463
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,229
an agi is not distinct from humans we're
the whole package the whole package

6464
01:46:28,229 --> 01:46:28,239
the whole package the whole package
 

6465
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:29,990
the whole package the whole package
comes as a planetary scale phenomenon

6466
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:30,000
comes as a planetary scale phenomenon
 

6467
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,510
comes as a planetary scale phenomenon
and that goes back to the fact that like

6468
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:31,520
and that goes back to the fact that like
 

6469
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,030
and that goes back to the fact that like
you were you know asking questions about

6470
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:33,040
you were you know asking questions about
 

6471
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,709
you were you know asking questions about
you as an individual

6472
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:34,719
you as an individual
 

6473
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:35,990
you as an individual
like what are you as an individual

6474
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,000
like what are you as an individual
 

6475
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,149
like what are you as an individual
you're like a packet of information that

6476
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:38,159
you're like a packet of information that
 

6477
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:40,070
you're like a packet of information that
exists in the particular physical thing

6478
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:40,080
exists in the particular physical thing
 

6479
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,470
exists in the particular physical thing
that is you we're all just

6480
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:42,480
that is you we're all just
 

6481
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,149
that is you we're all just
packets of information and some of us

6482
01:46:44,149 --> 01:46:44,159
packets of information and some of us
 

6483
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:45,750
packets of information and some of us
are aggregates in certain ways but it's

6484
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:45,760
are aggregates in certain ways but it's
 

6485
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,189
are aggregates in certain ways but it's
all just kind of exchanging and

6486
01:46:47,189 --> 01:46:47,199
all just kind of exchanging and
 

6487
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:49,590
all just kind of exchanging and
propagating right and processing

6488
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:49,600
propagating right and processing
 

6489
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,109
propagating right and processing
is your

6490
01:46:51,109 --> 01:46:51,119
is your
 

6491
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:53,669
is your
packet of information that you've

6492
01:46:53,669 --> 01:46:53,679
packet of information that you've
 

6493
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:55,990
packet of information that you've
continually referred to as sarah

6494
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:56,000
continually referred to as sarah
 

6495
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,350
continually referred to as sarah
afraid

6496
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:57,360
afraid
 

6497
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,669
afraid
of the dissipation of the

6498
01:46:59,669 --> 01:46:59,679
of the dissipation of the
 

6499
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,830
of the dissipation of the
death of that packet are you afraid of

6500
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:01,840
death of that packet are you afraid of
 

6501
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:02,870
death of that packet are you afraid of
death

6502
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:02,880
death
 

6503
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,550
death
do you ponder death

6504
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:04,560
do you ponder death
 

6505
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,189
do you ponder death
does death have meaning in this process

6506
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:07,199
does death have meaning in this process
 

6507
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:11,270
does death have meaning in this process
of creativity i think i have the natural

6508
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:11,280
of creativity i think i have the natural
 

6509
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,109
of creativity i think i have the natural
biological urge that everyone has to

6510
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:13,119
biological urge that everyone has to
 

6511
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:14,550
biological urge that everyone has to
fear death

6512
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:14,560
fear death
 

6513
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,430
fear death
um

6514
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:15,440
um
 

6515
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,189
um
i think the thing that i think is

6516
01:47:17,189 --> 01:47:17,199
i think the thing that i think is
 

6517
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:18,629
i think the thing that i think is
interesting is if i think about it

6518
01:47:18,629 --> 01:47:18,639
interesting is if i think about it
 

6519
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,070
interesting is if i think about it
rationally

6520
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,080
rationally
 

6521
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,750
rationally
i'm not necessarily afraid of death for

6522
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:21,760
i'm not necessarily afraid of death for
 

6523
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,910
i'm not necessarily afraid of death for
me because i won't be aware of being

6524
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:23,920
me because i won't be aware of being
 

6525
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:24,790
me because i won't be aware of being
dead

6526
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:24,800
dead
 

6527
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,629
dead
um but i am afraid like for my kids

6528
01:47:26,629 --> 01:47:26,639
um but i am afraid like for my kids
 

6529
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,030
um but i am afraid like for my kids
because it matters to them if i die

6530
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:29,040
because it matters to them if i die
 

6531
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,709
because it matters to them if i die
um so

6532
01:47:30,709 --> 01:47:30,719
um so
 

6533
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:33,030
um so
so again like i think death becomes more

6534
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:33,040
so again like i think death becomes more
 

6535
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,030
so again like i think death becomes more
significant as a collective property not

6536
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:35,040
significant as a collective property not
 

6537
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,189
significant as a collective property not
as an individual one

6538
01:47:37,189 --> 01:47:37,199
as an individual one
 

6539
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,189
as an individual one
yeah but isn't there something to fear

6540
01:47:39,189 --> 01:47:39,199
yeah but isn't there something to fear
 

6541
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:40,070
yeah but isn't there something to fear
about

6542
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:40,080
about
 

6543
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,870
about
the fact that the way

6544
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:42,880
the fact that the way
 

6545
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,070
the fact that the way
like

6546
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:44,080
like
 

6547
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,870
like
the creative uh

6548
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:46,880
the creative uh
 

6549
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,870
the creative uh
the complexity of information that's

6550
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:48,880
the complexity of information that's
 

6551
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,310
the complexity of information that's
been like created in you yeah the the

6552
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:52,320
been like created in you yeah the the
 

6553
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,709
been like created in you yeah the the
fact that it kind of

6554
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:54,719
fact that it kind of
 

6555
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:56,070
fact that it kind of
breaks apart

6556
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:56,080
breaks apart
 

6557
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,669
breaks apart
and disappears

6558
01:47:57,669 --> 01:47:57,679
and disappears
 

6559
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:58,790
and disappears
it doesn't but i don't think it

6560
01:47:58,790 --> 01:47:58,800
it doesn't but i don't think it
 

6561
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:02,229
it doesn't but i don't think it
disappears it's just not me anymore

6562
01:48:02,229 --> 01:48:02,239
disappears it's just not me anymore
 

6563
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:05,430
disappears it's just not me anymore
right so you're but the that process of

6564
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:05,440
right so you're but the that process of
 

6565
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,189
right so you're but the that process of
you it being not you anymore that

6566
01:48:07,189 --> 01:48:07,199
you it being not you anymore that
 

6567
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:08,950
you it being not you anymore that
doesn't scare you

6568
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:08,960
doesn't scare you
 

6569
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,709
doesn't scare you
of course it does the mystery of it i

6570
01:48:10,709 --> 01:48:10,719
of course it does the mystery of it i
 

6571
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:12,709
of course it does the mystery of it i
mean the yeah but i guess i'm heartened

6572
01:48:12,709 --> 01:48:12,719
mean the yeah but i guess i'm heartened
 

6573
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,070
mean the yeah but i guess i'm heartened
by the fact that there will be some

6574
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:14,080
by the fact that there will be some
 

6575
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,750
by the fact that there will be some
imprints of the fact that i existed

6576
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:15,760
imprints of the fact that i existed
 

6577
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,910
imprints of the fact that i existed
still in the universe after i leave it

6578
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:17,920
still in the universe after i leave it
 

6579
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,550
still in the universe after i leave it
yeah but there'll be a okay and also

6580
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:20,560
yeah but there'll be a okay and also
 

6581
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,910
yeah but there'll be a okay and also
that has to do with my perception of

6582
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:21,920
that has to do with my perception of
 

6583
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:24,149
that has to do with my perception of
time right so you know i perceive time

6584
01:48:24,149 --> 01:48:24,159
time right so you know i perceive time
 

6585
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:25,510
time right so you know i perceive time
as flowing but that might not be the

6586
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:25,520
as flowing but that might not be the
 

6587
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,590
as flowing but that might not be the
case

6588
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:27,600
case
 

6589
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,109
case
i mean this is you know standard

6590
01:48:29,109 --> 01:48:29,119
i mean this is you know standard
 

6591
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:31,189
i mean this is you know standard
physicists comfort is you know every

6592
01:48:31,189 --> 01:48:31,199
physicists comfort is you know every
 

6593
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,350
physicists comfort is you know every
time moment exists you know and is you

6594
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:33,360
time moment exists you know and is you
 

6595
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,950
time moment exists you know and is you
know there's no and the flow of time is

6596
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:34,960
know there's no and the flow of time is
 

6597
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,709
know there's no and the flow of time is
just our perception of

6598
01:48:36,709 --> 01:48:36,719
just our perception of
 

6599
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:40,470
just our perception of
you know us um you know us changing

6600
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:40,480
you know us um you know us changing
 

6601
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,510
you know us um you know us changing
um

6602
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:41,520
um
 

6603
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,950
um
so you can travel back in time and

6604
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:42,960
so you can travel back in time and
 

6605
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,109
so you can travel back in time and
that's comforting like from a physics

6606
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:45,119
that's comforting like from a physics
 

6607
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:46,310
that's comforting like from a physics
condition no no i'm not talking about

6608
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:46,320
condition no no i'm not talking about
 

6609
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,830
condition no no i'm not talking about
traveling back in time i'm just saying

6610
01:48:47,830 --> 01:48:47,840
traveling back in time i'm just saying
 

6611
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,390
traveling back in time i'm just saying
that the moments in the past still exist

6612
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:50,400
that the moments in the past still exist
 

6613
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,229
that the moments in the past still exist
um now whether the moments in the future

6614
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:52,239
um now whether the moments in the future
 

6615
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,310
um now whether the moments in the future
exist or not is a different question

6616
01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:54,320
exist or not is a different question
 

6617
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,990
exist or not is a different question
that's not comforting to me in terms of

6618
01:48:55,990 --> 01:48:56,000
that's not comforting to me in terms of
 

6619
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,510
that's not comforting to me in terms of
death

6620
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:57,520
death
 

6621
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,910
death
the flow of time is not that does not i

6622
01:48:59,910 --> 01:48:59,920
the flow of time is not that does not i
 

6623
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,550
the flow of time is not that does not i
think uh i think it's i think there's no

6624
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:02,560
think uh i think it's i think there's no
 

6625
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,629
think uh i think it's i think there's no
comfort in the face of death for what we

6626
01:49:04,629 --> 01:49:04,639
comfort in the face of death for what we
 

6627
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:06,470
comfort in the face of death for what we
are uh

6628
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:06,480
are uh
 

6629
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,070
are uh
because we like existing and i think

6630
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:08,080
because we like existing and i think
 

6631
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,550
because we like existing and i think
it's especially true if you if you love

6632
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:10,560
it's especially true if you if you love
 

6633
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,510
it's especially true if you if you love
life

6634
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:11,520
life
 

6635
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,589
life
and you love what life is

6636
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:13,599
and you love what life is
 

6637
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:14,950
and you love what life is
do you think there's a certain sense in

6638
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:14,960
do you think there's a certain sense in
 

6639
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,070
do you think there's a certain sense in
which

6640
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,080
which
 

6641
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,669
which
the fear of death or the fear of

6642
01:49:17,669 --> 01:49:17,679
the fear of death or the fear of
 

6643
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:20,149
the fear of death or the fear of
non-existence maybe fear is not the

6644
01:49:20,149 --> 01:49:20,159
non-existence maybe fear is not the
 

6645
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:21,350
non-existence maybe fear is not the
right word

6646
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:21,360
right word
 

6647
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:25,669
right word
is the actual very phenomena that gives

6648
01:49:25,669 --> 01:49:25,679
is the actual very phenomena that gives
 

6649
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:27,990
is the actual very phenomena that gives
birth to existence like maybe death is

6650
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:28,000
birth to existence like maybe death is
 

6651
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,550
birth to existence like maybe death is
fundamental like this it just feels like

6652
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:30,560
fundamental like this it just feels like
 

6653
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,550
fundamental like this it just feels like
freaking out oh

6654
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:32,560
freaking out oh
 

6655
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,390
freaking out oh
this ride ends

6656
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,400
this ride ends
 

6657
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,070
this ride ends
is actually like

6658
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:36,080
is actually like
 

6659
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,270
is actually like
the

6660
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:37,280
the
 

6661
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,070
the
that's

6662
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:38,080
that's
 

6663
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,589
that's
that's the thing that gives birth to

6664
01:49:39,589 --> 01:49:39,599
that's the thing that gives birth to
 

6665
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:43,109
that's the thing that gives birth to
this this whole thing yeah that like

6666
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:43,119
this this whole thing yeah that like
 

6667
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:45,430
this this whole thing yeah that like
it's constantly

6668
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:45,440
it's constantly
 

6669
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,070
it's constantly
is matter constantly freaking out about

6670
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,080
is matter constantly freaking out about
 

6671
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,669
is matter constantly freaking out about
the fact that it's good enough no i

6672
01:49:49,669 --> 01:49:49,679
the fact that it's good enough no i
 

6673
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:51,589
the fact that it's good enough no i
think i think things like to exist i

6674
01:49:51,589 --> 01:49:51,599
think i think things like to exist i
 

6675
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:53,510
think i think things like to exist i
think they want to exist yeah there's a

6676
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:53,520
think they want to exist yeah there's a
 

6677
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,709
think they want to exist yeah there's a
there's a desire whatever to exist yeah

6678
01:49:56,709 --> 01:49:56,719
there's a desire whatever to exist yeah
 

6679
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,149
there's a desire whatever to exist yeah
and there's a drive to exist and there's

6680
01:49:58,149 --> 01:49:58,159
and there's a drive to exist and there's
 

6681
01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:00,470
and there's a drive to exist and there's
a drive for more things to exist i guess

6682
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:00,480
a drive for more things to exist i guess
 

6683
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,950
a drive for more things to exist i guess
um yeah i would like to i like existing

6684
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:02,960
um yeah i would like to i like existing
 

6685
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,070
um yeah i would like to i like existing
i like i like i like it a lot um

6686
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:06,080
i like i like i like it a lot um
 

6687
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,870
i like i like i like it a lot um
and i don't know it any other way

6688
01:50:08,870 --> 01:50:08,880
and i don't know it any other way
 

6689
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,350
and i don't know it any other way
but see i don't even know if i like

6690
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:11,360
but see i don't even know if i like
 

6691
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,750
but see i don't even know if i like
existing i think i really don't like not

6692
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:13,760
existing i think i really don't like not
 

6693
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,189
existing i think i really don't like not
existing yes yeah that's you

6694
01:50:17,189 --> 01:50:17,199
existing yes yeah that's you
 

6695
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:18,229
existing yes yeah that's you
uh yeah

6696
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:18,239
uh yeah
 

6697
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:19,669
uh yeah
yeah maybe it's that i

6698
01:50:19,669 --> 01:50:19,679
yeah maybe it's that i
 

6699
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,750
yeah maybe it's that i
some days i you know i might like

6700
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:21,760
some days i you know i might like
 

6701
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:24,629
some days i you know i might like
existing less than others but

6702
01:50:24,629 --> 01:50:24,639
existing less than others but
 

6703
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:26,629
existing less than others but
yes but like i think those are like

6704
01:50:26,629 --> 01:50:26,639
yes but like i think those are like
 

6705
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:28,629
yes but like i think those are like
surface feelings there is yeah it seems

6706
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:28,639
surface feelings there is yeah it seems
 

6707
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:29,990
surface feelings there is yeah it seems
like there's something fundamental about

6708
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:30,000
like there's something fundamental about
 

6709
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,910
like there's something fundamental about
wanting to exist no i think that's right

6710
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:31,920
wanting to exist no i think that's right
 

6711
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:32,790
wanting to exist no i think that's right
but i

6712
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:32,800
but i
 

6713
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,830
but i
but i think

6714
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:33,840
but i think
 

6715
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,750
but i think
to your point that that might go back to

6716
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:35,760
to your point that that might go back to
 

6717
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,589
to your point that that might go back to
the more fundamental

6718
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:37,599
the more fundamental
 

6719
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:39,510
the more fundamental
idea that you know if life is the

6720
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:39,520
idea that you know if life is the
 

6721
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,270
idea that you know if life is the
physics of existence and maximizing

6722
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:41,280
physics of existence and maximizing
 

6723
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,270
physics of existence and maximizing
existence individual organisms of course

6724
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:43,280
existence individual organisms of course
 

6725
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,430
existence individual organisms of course
want to maximize their existence

6726
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:45,440
want to maximize their existence
 

6727
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,510
want to maximize their existence
and everything you know like wants to

6728
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:47,520
and everything you know like wants to
 

6729
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,270
and everything you know like wants to
exist but i guess for me the small

6730
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:49,280
exist but i guess for me the small
 

6731
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,550
exist but i guess for me the small
comfort is

6732
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:50,560
comfort is
 

6733
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,390
comfort is
my existence matters to future existence

6734
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:54,400
my existence matters to future existence
 

6735
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,550
my existence matters to future existence
speaking of future existence is there

6736
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:56,560
speaking of future existence is there
 

6737
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,430
speaking of future existence is there

question about like like working on such
 

6761
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,709
question about like like working on such
hard problems like how can you make a

hard problems like how can you make a
 

6763
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:28,390
hard problems like how can you make a
successful career out of that but i

successful career out of that but i
 

6765
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,750
successful career out of that but i
think for me

6766
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:29,760
think for me
 

6767
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,470
think for me
it couldn't be otherwise like i have to

6768
01:51:32,470 --> 01:51:32,480
it couldn't be otherwise like i have to
 

6769
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,149
it couldn't be otherwise like i have to
to be fulfilled you have to work on

6770
01:51:34,149 --> 01:51:34,159
to be fulfilled you have to work on
 

6771
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:35,750
to be fulfilled you have to work on
things you care about and that's always

6772
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:35,760
things you care about and that's always
 

6773
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:38,070
things you care about and that's always
kind of driven me and that's been

6774
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:38,080
kind of driven me and that's been
 

6775
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,149
kind of driven me and that's been

01:51:46,229 --> 01:51:46,239
independent because i'm i
 

6785
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:48,310
independent because i'm i
i started at community college actually

6786
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:48,320
i started at community college actually
 

6787
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,149
i started at community college actually
and i was taking a physics class and i

6788
01:51:50,149 --> 01:51:50,159
and i was taking a physics class and i
 

6789
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:51,189
and i was taking a physics class and i
learned about

6790
01:51:51,189 --> 01:51:51,199
learned about
 

6791
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:53,510
learned about
uh you know magnetic monopoles and they

6792
01:51:53,510 --> 01:51:53,520
uh you know magnetic monopoles and they
 

6793
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:54,709
uh you know magnetic monopoles and they
we didn't know if they existed in the

6794
01:51:54,709 --> 01:51:54,719
we didn't know if they existed in the
 

6795
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:56,470
we didn't know if they existed in the
universe and but we could predict them

6796
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:56,480
universe and but we could predict them
 

6797
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,149
universe and but we could predict them
and we could go look for them and i was

6798
01:51:58,149 --> 01:51:58,159
and we could go look for them and i was
 

6799
01:51:58,159 --> 01:51:59,669
and we could go look for them and i was
so deeply intrigued by this idea that we

6800
01:51:59,669 --> 01:51:59,679
so deeply intrigued by this idea that we
 

6801
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:01,430
so deeply intrigued by this idea that we
had this mathematical formula to go look

6802
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:01,440
had this mathematical formula to go look
 

6803
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:02,870
had this mathematical formula to go look
for things

6804
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:02,880
for things
 

6805
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,149
for things
and then i wanted to become a

6806
01:52:04,149 --> 01:52:04,159
and then i wanted to become a
 

6807
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:05,589
and then i wanted to become a
theoretical physicist because of that

6808
01:52:05,589 --> 01:52:05,599
theoretical physicist because of that
 

6809
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,189
theoretical physicist because of that
but that actually wasn't my driving

6810
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:07,199
but that actually wasn't my driving
 

6811
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,270
but that actually wasn't my driving
question i realized my driving question

6812
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:09,280
question i realized my driving question
 

6813
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:10,070
question i realized my driving question
is

6814
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:10,080
is
 

6815
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,669
is
the nature of the correspondence between

6816
01:52:11,669 --> 01:52:11,679
the nature of the correspondence between
 

6817
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:13,270
the nature of the correspondence between
our minds and physical reality and what

6818
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:13,280
our minds and physical reality and what
 

6819
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,310
our minds and physical reality and what
we are

6820
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:14,320
we are
 

6821
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:15,350
we are
and

6822
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:15,360
and
 

6823
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,790
and
that question's very deep so you can

6824
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:16,800
that question's very deep so you can
 

6825
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,470
that question's very deep so you can
work across a lot of fields doing that

6826
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:18,480
work across a lot of fields doing that
 

6827
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,589
work across a lot of fields doing that
but i think without that driving

6828
01:52:19,589 --> 01:52:19,599
but i think without that driving
 

6829
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,510
but i think without that driving
question i never would have been able to

6830
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:21,520
question i never would have been able to
 

6831
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,270
question i never would have been able to
do all the things that i've done it's

6832
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:23,280
do all the things that i've done it's
 

6833
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,669
do all the things that i've done it's
really the passion that drives it and i

6834
01:52:25,669 --> 01:52:25,679
really the passion that drives it and i
 

6835
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,270
really the passion that drives it and i
and usually when when students ask me

6836
01:52:27,270 --> 01:52:27,280
and usually when when students ask me
 

6837
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:30,070
and usually when when students ask me
these kind of questions i i tell them

6838
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,080
these kind of questions i i tell them
 

6839
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,910
these kind of questions i i tell them
like you have to find something you

6840
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920
like you have to find something you
 

6841
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,830
like you have to find something you
really care about working on because if

6842
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:33,840
really care about working on because if
 

6843
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,750
really care about working on because if
you don't really care about it a you're

6844
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:35,760
you don't really care about it a you're
 

6845
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,830
you don't really care about it a you're
not going to be your best at it

6846
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:37,840
not going to be your best at it
 

6847
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,430
not going to be your best at it
and b it's not going to be worth your

6848
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:39,440
and b it's not going to be worth your
 

6849
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,790
and b it's not going to be worth your
time why would you spend your time

6850
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:40,800
time why would you spend your time
 

6851
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:41,830
time why would you spend your time
working on something you're not

6852
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:41,840
working on something you're not
 

6853
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,149
working on something you're not
interested in so find the driving

6854
01:52:44,149 --> 01:52:44,159
interested in so find the driving
 

6855
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:45,910
interested in so find the driving
questions yeah find the driving question

6856
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:45,920
questions yeah find the driving question
 

6857
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,910
questions yeah find the driving question
find your your passion i mean i think

6858
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:47,920
find your your passion i mean i think
 

6859
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,750
find your your passion i mean i think
passion makes a huge difference in terms

6860
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:49,760
passion makes a huge difference in terms
 

6861
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,189
passion makes a huge difference in terms
of creativity

6862
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:51,199
of creativity
 

6863
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:53,669
of creativity
talent and potential and also being able

6864
01:52:53,669 --> 01:52:53,679
talent and potential and also being able
 

6865
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:55,030
talent and potential and also being able
to tolerate all the hard things that

6866
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:55,040
to tolerate all the hard things that
 

6867
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,750
to tolerate all the hard things that
come with any career or life

6868
01:52:57,750 --> 01:52:57,760
come with any career or life
 

6869
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,510
come with any career or life
yeah i've had a bunch of moments in my

6870
01:52:59,510 --> 01:52:59,520
yeah i've had a bunch of moments in my
 

6871
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,910
yeah i've had a bunch of moments in my
life where i've just been captivated by

6872
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:01,920
life where i've just been captivated by
 

6873
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,790
life where i've just been captivated by
some beautiful phenomena and i guess

6874
01:53:04,790 --> 01:53:04,800
some beautiful phenomena and i guess
 

6875
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,870
some beautiful phenomena and i guess
being rigorous about it and asking what

6876
01:53:06,870 --> 01:53:06,880
being rigorous about it and asking what
 

6877
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,310
being rigorous about it and asking what
is the question underlying this

6878
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:08,320
is the question underlying this
 

6879
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:11,030
is the question underlying this
phenomenon phenomena like

6880
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:11,040
phenomenon phenomena like
 

6881
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:14,070
phenomenon phenomena like
robots bring a smile to my face and yeah

6882
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:14,080
robots bring a smile to my face and yeah
 

6883
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,149
robots bring a smile to my face and yeah
that's cool forming a

6884
01:53:16,149 --> 01:53:16,159
that's cool forming a
 

6885
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:18,550
that's cool forming a
question of like why the hell is this so

6886
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:18,560
question of like why the hell is this so
 

6887
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,950
question of like why the hell is this so
fascinating yeah why is this uh

6888
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:20,960
fascinating yeah why is this uh
 

6889
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,189
fascinating yeah why is this uh
specifically the human robot

6890
01:53:23,189 --> 01:53:23,199
specifically the human robot
 

6891
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:25,510
specifically the human robot
interaction question that's something

6892
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:25,520
interaction question that's something
 

6893
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,030
interaction question that's something
beautiful

6894
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:27,040
beautiful
 

6895
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,790
beautiful
is brought to life when humans and

6896
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:28,800
is brought to life when humans and
 

6897
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,709
is brought to life when humans and
robots interact

6898
01:53:30,709 --> 01:53:30,719

understanding that deeply yeah
it's like okay so this is going to be my

6902
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:35,520
it's like okay so this is going to be my
 

6903
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,109
it's like okay so this is going to be my
life work then i don't know what the

6904
01:53:37,109 --> 01:53:37,119
life work then i don't know what the
 

6905
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:38,629
life work then i don't know what the
hell it is but that that's what i want

6906
01:53:38,629 --> 01:53:38,639
hell it is but that that's what i want
 

6907
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:39,510
hell it is but that that's what i want
to do

6908
01:53:39,510 --> 01:53:39,520
to do
 

6909
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,589
to do
interesting and doing that doing that

6910
01:53:41,589 --> 01:53:41,599
interesting and doing that doing that
 

6911
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:43,109
interesting and doing that doing that
for whatever the hell gives you that

6912
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:43,119
for whatever the hell gives you that
 

6913
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:45,270
for whatever the hell gives you that
kind of feeling i guess is the point

6914
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:45,280
kind of feeling i guess is the point
 

6915
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,310
kind of feeling i guess is the point
yeah

6916
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:46,320
yeah
 

6917
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,310
yeah
am i allowed to ask you a question sure

6918
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:48,320
am i allowed to ask you a question sure
 

6919
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,669
am i allowed to ask you a question sure
okay um

6920
01:53:49,669 --> 01:53:49,679
okay um
 

6921
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:52,629
okay um
on that point because i like um at this

6922
01:53:52,629 --> 01:53:52,639
on that point because i like um at this
 

6923
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:53,910
on that point because i like um at this
colleague that suggests the idea that

6924
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:53,920
colleague that suggests the idea that
 

6925
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,990
colleague that suggests the idea that
like consciousness might be contagious

6926
01:53:55,990 --> 01:53:56,000
like consciousness might be contagious
 

6927
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,149
like consciousness might be contagious
and so interacting with things you know

6928
01:53:58,149 --> 01:53:58,159
and so interacting with things you know
 

6929
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:00,229
and so interacting with things you know
isn't it no yeah it's an interesting

6930
01:54:00,229 --> 01:54:00,239
isn't it no yeah it's an interesting
 

6931
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:01,990
isn't it no yeah it's an interesting
idea right so i'm i'm wondering like

6932
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:02,000
idea right so i'm i'm wondering like
 

6933
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,189
idea right so i'm i'm wondering like
sort of

6934
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:03,199
sort of
 

6935
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:04,709
sort of
you know the motivation there is it the

6936
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:04,719
you know the motivation there is it the
 

6937
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,709
you know the motivation there is it the
motivation that you want

6938
01:54:06,709 --> 01:54:06,719
motivation that you want
 

6939
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:08,470
motivation that you want
more of the universe

6940
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:08,480
more of the universe
 

6941
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,070
more of the universe
to appreciate

6942
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:10,080
to appreciate
 

6943
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,750
to appreciate
things the way we do and appreciate

6944
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:11,760
things the way we do and appreciate
 

6945
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,550
things the way we do and appreciate
those interactions or is it really more

6946
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:14,560
those interactions or is it really more
 

6947
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,990
those interactions or is it really more
the enjoyment of the human in those

6948
01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:16,000
the enjoyment of the human in those
 

6949
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,070
the enjoyment of the human in those
interactions like is it

6950
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:18,080
interactions like is it
 

6951
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,189
interactions like is it
is it

6952
01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:19,199
is it
 

6953
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:20,470
is it
i don't do you know what i'm asking yeah

6954
01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:20,480
i don't do you know what i'm asking yeah
 

6955
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,950
i don't do you know what i'm asking yeah
yeah see i think consciousness is

6956
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:22,960
yeah see i think consciousness is
 

6957
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:26,390
yeah see i think consciousness is
created in the interaction between

6958
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:26,400
created in the interaction between
 

6959
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,149
created in the interaction between
yes things yes

6960
01:54:28,149 --> 01:54:28,159
yes things yes
 

6961
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:30,310
yes things yes
so the joy is in the creation of

6962
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:30,320
so the joy is in the creation of
 

6963
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,870
so the joy is in the creation of
consciousness and i see i really

6964
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:32,880
consciousness and i see i really
 

6965
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,030
consciousness and i see i really
like the idea that

6966
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:35,040
like the idea that
 

6967
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:37,030
like the idea that
it doesn't

6968
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:37,040
it doesn't
 

6969
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,870
it doesn't
just have to be two humans creating

6970
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:38,880
just have to be two humans creating
 

6971
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,109
just have to be two humans creating
costumes together it could be

6972
01:54:41,109 --> 01:54:41,119
costumes together it could be
 

6973
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:43,669
costumes together it could be
humans and other entities yeah we talked

6974
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:43,679
humans and other entities yeah we talked
 

6975
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:45,750
humans and other entities yeah we talked
offline about dogs and other pets and so

6976
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:45,760
offline about dogs and other pets and so
 

6977
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,589
offline about dogs and other pets and so
on there's a magic i mean i've been

6978
01:54:47,589 --> 01:54:47,599
on there's a magic i mean i've been
 

6979
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:48,950
on there's a magic i mean i've been
calling it

6980
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:48,960
calling it
 

6981
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,950
calling it
love is

6982
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:50,960
love is
 

6983
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,109
love is
this beauty of the human experience

6984
01:54:53,109 --> 01:54:53,119
this beauty of the human experience
 

6985
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,510
this beauty of the human experience
that's created and it just feels like

6986
01:54:55,510 --> 01:54:55,520
that's created and it just feels like
 

6987
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:58,149
that's created and it just feels like
fascinating that you could do that

6988
01:54:58,149 --> 01:54:58,159
fascinating that you could do that
 

6989
01:54:58,159 --> 01:55:02,830
fascinating that you could do that
with a robotic system right and

6990
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:02,840
with a robotic system right and
 

6991
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:06,070
with a robotic system right and
right there's something really powerful

6992
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:06,080
right there's something really powerful
 

6993
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:08,070
right there's something really powerful
at least to me about

6994
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:08,080
at least to me about
 

6995
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:10,470
at least to me about
engineering systems that allow you to

6996
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:10,480
engineering systems that allow you to
 

6997
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,990
engineering systems that allow you to
create some of the magic of the human

6998
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:12,000
create some of the magic of the human
 

6999
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,350
create some of the magic of the human
experience because then you get to

7000
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:13,360
experience because then you get to
 

7001
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,550
experience because then you get to
understand

7002
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:14,560
understand
 

7003
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,109
understand
what it takes at least get inklings of

7004
01:55:17,109 --> 01:55:17,119
what it takes at least get inklings of
 

7005
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,510
what it takes at least get inklings of
what it takes to uh

7006
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:19,520
what it takes to uh
 

7007
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:22,310
what it takes to uh
to to create consciousness and i i don't

7008
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:22,320
to to create consciousness and i i don't
 

7009
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,910
to to create consciousness and i i don't
get this um

7010
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:23,920
get this um
 

7011
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,350
get this um
you know philosophers get really upset

7012
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:25,360
you know philosophers get really upset
 

7013
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,270
you know philosophers get really upset
about this idea that sort of

7014
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:27,280
about this idea that sort of
 

7015
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,870
about this idea that sort of
the illusion of consciousness is

7016
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:28,880
the illusion of consciousness is
 

7017
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,709
the illusion of consciousness is
consciousness but

7018
01:55:30,709 --> 01:55:30,719
consciousness but
 

7019
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:32,709
consciousness but
i really like the idea of engineering

7020
01:55:32,709 --> 01:55:32,719
i really like the idea of engineering
 

7021
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:35,430
i really like the idea of engineering
systems that fool you

7022
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:35,440
systems that fool you
 

7023
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,830
systems that fool you
into thinking they're conscious right

7024
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:37,840
into thinking they're conscious right
 

7025
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,070
into thinking they're conscious right
because that's sufficient to create the

7026
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:40,080
because that's sufficient to create the
 

7027
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,550
because that's sufficient to create the
magical experience right because it's

7028
01:55:42,550 --> 01:55:42,560
magical experience right because it's
 

7029
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:43,669
magical experience right because it's
the interaction yeah it's the

7030
01:55:43,669 --> 01:55:43,679
the interaction yeah it's the
 

7031
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:46,629
the interaction yeah it's the
interaction yeah right and this is the

7032
01:55:46,629 --> 01:55:46,639
interaction yeah right and this is the
 

7033
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,149
interaction yeah right and this is the
russian head i wear which is like i

7034
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:48,159
russian head i wear which is like i
 

7035
01:55:48,159 --> 01:55:49,109
russian head i wear which is like i
think

7036
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:49,119
think
 

7037
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:50,950
think
i think there's an ocean of loneliness

7038
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:50,960
i think there's an ocean of loneliness
 

7039
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,350
i think there's an ocean of loneliness
in the world i think we're deeply lonely

7040
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:53,360
in the world i think we're deeply lonely
 

7041
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,910
in the world i think we're deeply lonely
we're not even allowing ourselves to

7042
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:55,920
we're not even allowing ourselves to
 

7043
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,830
we're not even allowing ourselves to
acknowledge that and i kind of think

7044
01:55:57,830 --> 01:55:57,840
acknowledge that and i kind of think
 

7045
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,470
acknowledge that and i kind of think
that's what love is between romantic

7046
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:00,480
that's what love is between romantic
 

7047
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,910
that's what love is between romantic
love and friendship

7048
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:01,920
love and friendship
 

7049
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,709
love and friendship
is two people kind of getting a little

7050
01:56:04,709 --> 01:56:04,719
is two people kind of getting a little
 

7051
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:05,750
is two people kind of getting a little
bit

7052
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:05,760
bit
 

7053
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,030
bit
like

7054
01:56:07,030 --> 01:56:07,040
like
 

7055
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:11,270
like
like uh alleviating for a brief moment

7056
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
like uh alleviating for a brief moment
 

7057
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,669
like uh alleviating for a brief moment
that loneliness that loneliness but not

7058
01:56:13,669 --> 01:56:13,679
that loneliness that loneliness but not
 

7059
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:16,550
that loneliness that loneliness but not
but we're not they're it's not the full

7060
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:16,560
but we're not they're it's not the full

the depth of that loneliness
so creating systems that can truly hear

7076
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:35,840
so creating systems that can truly hear
 

7077
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:38,550
so creating systems that can truly hear
you right truly listen make the universe

7078

told me as a physicist i'm not allowed

7098
01:56:59,430 --> 01:56:59,440
told me as a physicist i'm not allowed
 

7099

told me as a physicist i'm not allowed
to ask why questions but i don't believe

7100

um the ability to yeah to create
 

7117
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,790
um the ability to yeah to create
more possibilities and more things to

7118

more possibilities and more things to
 

7119
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,390
more possibilities and more things to
exist

7120
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:20,400
exist
 

7121
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,310
exist
how what what is uh

7122
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:22,320

creation and beauty
 

7131
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:34,950
creation and beauty
i think so

7132
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:34,960
i think so
 

7133
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,229
i think so
so is that like

7134
01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:36,239
so is that like
 

7135
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:38,550
so is that like
are they is his beauty a correlate of

7136
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:38,560
are they is his beauty a correlate of
 

7137
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,189
are they is his beauty a correlate of
creation it might be i don't know um i

7138
01:57:41,189 --> 01:57:41,199
creation it might be i don't know um i
 

7139
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:43,270
creation it might be i don't know um i
mean why is it i you know

7140
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:43,280
mean why is it i you know
 

7141
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:44,310
mean why is it i you know
a lot of people have asked these kind of

7142
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:44,320
a lot of people have asked these kind of
 

7143
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,830
a lot of people have asked these kind of
questions but like why is it we have

7144
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:45,840
questions but like why is it we have
 

7145
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,510
questions but like why is it we have
such an emotional response to

7146
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:47,520
such an emotional response to
 

7147
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,830
such an emotional response to
intellectual activity or creativity

7148
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:49,840
intellectual activity or creativity
 

7149
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:51,589
intellectual activity or creativity
um and that seems kind of a deep

7150
01:57:51,589 --> 01:57:51,599
um and that seems kind of a deep
 

7151
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:53,270
um and that seems kind of a deep
question to me like it seems very

7152
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:53,280
question to me like it seems very
 

7153
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,950
question to me like it seems very
intrinsic to

7154
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:54,960
intrinsic to
 

7155
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,629
intrinsic to
what we are so i

7156
01:57:56,629 --> 01:57:56,639
what we are so i
 

7157
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:57,830
what we are so i
i do

7158
01:57:57,830 --> 01:57:57,840
i do
 

7159
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,830
i do
have an interest in the questions i ask

7160
01:57:59,830 --> 01:57:59,840
have an interest in the questions i ask
 

7161
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,430
have an interest in the questions i ask
because i think they're beautiful and i

7162
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:01,440
because i think they're beautiful and i
 

7163
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:04,149
because i think they're beautiful and i
think the universe is beautiful and

7164
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:04,159
think the universe is beautiful and
 

7165
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:06,629
think the universe is beautiful and
um i'm just so deeply fascinated by the

7166
01:58:06,629 --> 01:58:06,639
um i'm just so deeply fascinated by the
 

7167
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:08,709
um i'm just so deeply fascinated by the
fact that i exist at all

7168
01:58:08,709 --> 01:58:08,719
fact that i exist at all
 

7169
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:10,390
fact that i exist at all
um

7170
01:58:10,390 --> 01:58:10,400
um
 

7171
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:13,189
um
and so maybe maybe it's that

7172
01:58:13,189 --> 01:58:13,199
and so maybe maybe it's that
 

7173
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,189
and so maybe maybe it's that
you know that that intrinsic feeling of

7174
01:58:15,189 --> 01:58:15,199
you know that that intrinsic feeling of
 

7175
01:58:15,199 --> 01:58:17,350
you know that that intrinsic feeling of
beauty that's in part driving you know

7176
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:17,360
beauty that's in part driving you know
 

7177
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,109
beauty that's in part driving you know
the physics of creating more things so

7178
01:58:19,109 --> 01:58:19,119
the physics of creating more things so
 

7179
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:22,070
the physics of creating more things so
they could be deeply related in that way

7180
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:22,080
they could be deeply related in that way
 

7181
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,669
they could be deeply related in that way
