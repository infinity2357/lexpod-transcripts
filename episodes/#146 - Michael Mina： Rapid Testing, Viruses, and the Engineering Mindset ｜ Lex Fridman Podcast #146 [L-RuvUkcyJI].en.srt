sorry for the overly philosophical
 

173
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,110
sorry for the overly philosophical
question

174
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
question
 

175
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,670
question
wow well that's a great question you

176
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
wow well that's a great question you
 

177
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,309
wow well that's a great question you
know i love the pathogenesis of viruses

178
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
know i love the pathogenesis of viruses
 

179
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,150
know i love the pathogenesis of viruses
and one of the things that i've worked

180
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
and one of the things that i've worked
 

181
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,430
and one of the things that i've worked
on

182
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
on
 

183
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,630
on
a lot is trying to understand how

184
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
a lot is trying to understand how
 

185
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,149
a lot is trying to understand how
viruses interact with each other and

186
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
viruses interact with each other and
 

187
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,270
viruses interact with each other and
so pre all this covered stuff

188
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
so pre all this covered stuff
 

189
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,750
so pre all this covered stuff
it was uh i was really really dedicated

190
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
it was uh i was really really dedicated
 

191
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,190
it was uh i was really really dedicated
to understanding

192
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
to understanding
 

193
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,869
to understanding
uh how uh how viruses

194
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
uh how uh how viruses
 

195
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,350
uh how uh how viruses
impact uh other pathogens so how if

196
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
impact uh other pathogens so how if
 

197
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,030
impact uh other pathogens so how if
somebody gets an infection

198
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
somebody gets an infection
 

199
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,910
somebody gets an infection
with one thing or a vaccine does it

200
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
with one thing or a vaccine does it
 

201
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,990
with one thing or a vaccine does it
either benefit or harm you from other

202
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
either benefit or harm you from other
 

203
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,710
either benefit or harm you from other
things that

204
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
things that
 

205
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,750
things that
appear to be unrelated to in the

206
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
appear to be unrelated to in the
 

207
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,869
appear to be unrelated to in the
to most people and so one

208
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
to most people and so one
 

209
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,830
to most people and so one
one system which is highly detrimental

210
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
one system which is highly detrimental
 

211
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,830
one system which is highly detrimental
to humans but what i think is just

212
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
to humans but what i think is just
 

213
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,190
to humans but what i think is just
immensely fascinating is measles

214
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
immensely fascinating is measles
 

215
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,710
immensely fascinating is measles
and measles gets into a kid's body

216
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
and measles gets into a kid's body
 

217
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,990
and measles gets into a kid's body
the immune system picks it up and

218
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
the immune system picks it up and
 

219
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,589
the immune system picks it up and
essentially grabs the virus

220
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
essentially grabs the virus
 

221
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,390
essentially grabs the virus
and does exactly what it's supposed to

222
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
and does exactly what it's supposed to
 

223
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,470
and does exactly what it's supposed to
do which is to take this virus and bring

224
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
do which is to take this virus and bring
 

225
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,309
do which is to take this virus and bring
it into the immune system so the immune

226
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
it into the immune system so the immune
 

227
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,229
it into the immune system so the immune
system can learn from it

228
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
system can learn from it
 

229
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,789
system can learn from it
can develop an immune response to it but

230
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
can develop an immune response to it but
 

231
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,949
can develop an immune response to it but
instead measles plays a trick it gets

232
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
instead measles plays a trick it gets
 

233
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,949
instead measles plays a trick it gets
into the immune system

234
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
into the immune system
 

235
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,270
into the immune system
serves almost as a trojan horse and

236
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
serves almost as a trojan horse and
 

237
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,390
serves almost as a trojan horse and
instead of getting

238
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
instead of getting
 

239
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,630
instead of getting
eaten by these by these cells it just

240
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
eaten by these by these cells it just
 

241
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,910
eaten by these by these cells it just
takes them over

242
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
takes them over
 

243
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,750
takes them over
and it ends up proliferating in the very

244
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
and it ends up proliferating in the very
 

245
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,670
and it ends up proliferating in the very
cells that were supposed to

246
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
cells that were supposed to
 

247
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,789
cells that were supposed to
kill it and it just distributes

248
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
kill it and it just distributes
 

249
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,310
kill it and it just distributes
throughout the entire body gets into the

250
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
throughout the entire body gets into the
 

251
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,749
throughout the entire body gets into the
bone marrow kills off

252
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
bone marrow kills off
 

253
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,950
bone marrow kills off
children's immune memories and so it

254
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
children's immune memories and so it
 

255
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,629
children's immune memories and so it
essentially

256
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
essentially
 

257
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,230
essentially
what i've found and what my research has

258
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
what i've found and what my research has
 

259
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,550
what i've found and what my research has
found is that this one virus

260
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
found is that this one virus
 

261
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,590
found is that this one virus
was responsible for as much as half of

262
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
was responsible for as much as half of
 

263
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,430
was responsible for as much as half of
all the infectious disease deaths in

264
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
all the infectious disease deaths in
 

265
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,150
all the infectious disease deaths in
kids

266
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
kids
 

267
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,230
kids
before we started vaccinating against it

268
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
before we started vaccinating against it
 

269
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,150
before we started vaccinating against it
because it was just wiping out

270
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
because it was just wiping out
 

271
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,390
because it was just wiping out
children's immune memories to all

272
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
children's immune memories to all
 

273
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,550
children's immune memories to all
different pathogens which is

274
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
different pathogens which is
 

275
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,110
different pathogens which is
you know i think um just astounding it's

276
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
you know i think um just astounding it's
 

277
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,629
you know i think um just astounding it's
just amazing to

278
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
just amazing to
 

279
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,950
just amazing to
watch it spread throughout bodies we've

280
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
watch it spread throughout bodies we've
 

281
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,710
watch it spread throughout bodies we've
done the studies in monkeys and and you

282
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
done the studies in monkeys and and you
 

283
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,230
done the studies in monkeys and and you
can watch it just

284
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
can watch it just
 

285
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,070
can watch it just
destroy and obliterate people's immune

286
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
destroy and obliterate people's immune
 

287
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,230
destroy and obliterate people's immune

and it's is that a evolutionary
 

295
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,070
and it's is that a evolutionary
just coincidence or is there some kind

296
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
just coincidence or is there some kind
 

297
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,510
just coincidence or is there some kind
of advantage to this kind of

298
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
of advantage to this kind of
 

299
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,110
of advantage to this kind of
interactivity between

300
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
interactivity between
 

301
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,150
interactivity between
pathogen well i think in that sense it's

302
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
pathogen well i think in that sense it's
 

303
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,950
pathogen well i think in that sense it's
just coincidence uh it probably is a

304
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
just coincidence uh it probably is a
 

305
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,830
just coincidence uh it probably is a
it's a good way for measles to

306
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
it's a good way for measles to
 

307
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,790
it's a good way for measles to
uh it's a good way for measles to

308
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
uh it's a good way for measles to
 

309
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,230
uh it's a good way for measles to
essentially be able to

310
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
essentially be able to
 

311
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,629
essentially be able to
survive uh long enough to replicate in

312
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
survive uh long enough to replicate in
 

313
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,029
survive uh long enough to replicate in
the body it just replicates in the cells

314
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
the body it just replicates in the cells
 

315
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,270
the body it just replicates in the cells
that are meant to destroy it so

316
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
that are meant to destroy it so
 

317
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,909
that are meant to destroy it so
it's uh it's utilizing our immune cells

318
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
it's uh it's utilizing our immune cells
 

319
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,749
it's uh it's utilizing our immune cells
for its own replication

320
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
for its own replication
 

321
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,830
for its own replication
uh but in so doing it's destroying the

322
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
uh but in so doing it's destroying the
 

323
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,189
uh but in so doing it's destroying the
memories of all the other

324
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
memories of all the other
 

325
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,110
memories of all the other
the other immunological memories so but

326
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
the other immunological memories so but
 

327
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,270
the other immunological memories so but
there are other viruses so a different

328
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
there are other viruses so a different
 

329
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,110
there are other viruses so a different
system is influenza and uh

330
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
system is influenza and uh
 

331
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,310
system is influenza and uh
flu predisposes to severe bacterial

332
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
flu predisposes to severe bacterial
 

333
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,749
flu predisposes to severe bacterial
infections

334
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
infections
 

335
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,390
infections
and that i think is another coincidence

336
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
and that i think is another coincidence
 

337
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,029
and that i think is another coincidence
but i

338
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
but i
 

339
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,270
but i
but i also think that there are that

340
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
but i also think that there are that
 

341
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,189
but i also think that there are that
there are some evolutionary benefits

342
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
there are some evolutionary benefits
 

343
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,189
there are some evolutionary benefits
that bacteria may hijack

344
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
that bacteria may hijack
 

345
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,710
that bacteria may hijack
and sort of piggyback on viral

346
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
and sort of piggyback on viral
 

347
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,270
and sort of piggyback on viral
infections viruses can

348
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
infections viruses can
 

349
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,870
infections viruses can
they just grow so much quicker than

350
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
they just grow so much quicker than
 

351
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,670
they just grow so much quicker than
bacteria they replicate faster and so

352
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
bacteria they replicate faster and so
 

353
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:05,990
bacteria they replicate faster and so
there's

354
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
there's
 

355
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,469
there's
the system with viruses with flu and and

356
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
the system with viruses with flu and and
 

357
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,830
the system with viruses with flu and and
bacteria where

358
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
bacteria where
 

359
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,710
bacteria where
the influenza has these proteins that

360
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
the influenza has these proteins that
 

361
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,510
the influenza has these proteins that
cleave certain receptors

362
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
cleave certain receptors
 

363
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,029
cleave certain receptors
and the bacteria want to cleave those

364
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
and the bacteria want to cleave those
 

365
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,870
and the bacteria want to cleave those
same receptors i want to cleave the same

366
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
same receptors i want to cleave the same
 

367
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,150
same receptors i want to cleave the same
molecules that gave

368
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
molecules that gave
 

369
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,189
molecules that gave
entrance to those receptors so instead

370
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
entrance to those receptors so instead
 

371
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,230
entrance to those receptors so instead
the bacteria

372
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
the bacteria
 

373
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,670
the bacteria
found out like hey you know we could

374
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
found out like hey you know we could
 

375
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,909
found out like hey you know we could
just piggyback on these viruses

376
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
just piggyback on these viruses
 

377
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,430
just piggyback on these viruses
they'll do it a hundred or a thousand

378
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
they'll do it a hundred or a thousand
 

379
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,590
they'll do it a hundred or a thousand
times faster than we can

380
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
times faster than we can
 

381
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,909
times faster than we can
and so then they just piggy back on and

382
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
and so then they just piggy back on and
 

383
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,830
and so then they just piggy back on and
they let flu cleave all these cyalic

384
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
they let flu cleave all these cyalic
 

385
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,790
they let flu cleave all these cyalic
acids

386
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
acids
 

387
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,950
acids
and then the bacteria just glom on and

388
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
and then the bacteria just glom on and
 

389
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,390
and then the bacteria just glom on and
in the wake of it so

390
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
in the wake of it so
 

391
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,830
in the wake of it so
there's all different interactions

392
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
there's all different interactions
 

393
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,990
there's all different interactions
between pathogens that are just

394
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
between pathogens that are just
 

395
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,510
between pathogens that are just
remarkable so does this whole system of

396
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
remarkable so does this whole system of
 

397
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,270
remarkable so does this whole system of
viruses that interact with each other

398
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
viruses that interact with each other
 

399
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,110
viruses that interact with each other
and so damn good at getting inside our

400
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
and so damn good at getting inside our
 

401
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,909
and so damn good at getting inside our
bodies

402
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
bodies
 

403
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,790
bodies
does that fascinate you or terrify you

404
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
does that fascinate you or terrify you
 

405
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,870
does that fascinate you or terrify you
i'm very much a scientist and so

406
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
i'm very much a scientist and so
 

407
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,790
i'm very much a scientist and so
uh it fascinates me much more than it

408
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
uh it fascinates me much more than it
 

409
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,309
uh it fascinates me much more than it
terrifies me

410
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
terrifies me
 

411
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,350
terrifies me
but knowing enough i know just how well

412
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
but knowing enough i know just how well
 

413
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,469
but knowing enough i know just how well
you know we get the wrong virus um

414
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
you know we get the wrong virus um
 

415
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,950
you know we get the wrong virus um
in our population whether it's through

416
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
in our population whether it's through
 

417
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,710
in our population whether it's through
some random mutation or whether it's

418
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
some random mutation or whether it's
 

419
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,270
some random mutation or whether it's
this same covid19 virus and it

this same covid19 virus and it
 

421
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,950
this same covid19 virus and it
you know these things are tricky they're

422
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
you know these things are tricky they're
 

423
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,430
you know these things are tricky they're
able to mutate quickly they're able to

424
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
able to mutate quickly they're able to
 

425
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,589
able to mutate quickly they're able to
find new hosts and rearrange in the case

426
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
find new hosts and rearrange in the case
 

427
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,909
find new hosts and rearrange in the case
of influenza

428

so what terrifies me is just how easily

430
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
so what terrifies me is just how easily
 

431
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,790
so what terrifies me is just how easily
this particular pandemic could have been

432
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
this particular pandemic could have been
 

433
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,230
this particular pandemic could have been
so much worse this could have been a

434
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
so much worse this could have been a
 

435
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,990
so much worse this could have been a
virus that is

436
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
virus that is
 

437
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,230
virus that is
uh much worse than it is you know same

438
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
uh much worse than it is you know same
 

439
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,870
uh much worse than it is you know same
thing with h1n1 back in 2009

440
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
thing with h1n1 back in 2009
 

441
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,029
thing with h1n1 back in 2009
uh that terrifies me if a virus like

442
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
uh that terrifies me if a virus like
 

443
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,990
uh that terrifies me if a virus like
that was

444
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
that was
 

445
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,270
that was
much more detrimental uh you know that

446
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
much more detrimental uh you know that
 

447
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,390
much more detrimental uh you know that
would be

448
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
would be
 

449
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,550
would be
it could be much more devastating

450
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
it could be much more devastating
 

451
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,150
it could be much more devastating
although it's hard to say you know the

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
quite serious enough on an individual
 

471
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,029
quite serious enough on an individual
level that humans just don't

response by many humans
 

477
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,029
response by many humans
like a lot of people even think it's a

478
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
like a lot of people even think it's a
 

479
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,589
like a lot of people even think it's a
hoax and so it's led us down this path

480
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
hoax and so it's led us down this path
 

481
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,869
hoax and so it's led us down this path
of

482
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
of
 

483
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,110
of
uh it's not quite serious enough to get

484
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
uh it's not quite serious enough to get
 

485
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,309
uh it's not quite serious enough to get
everyone to respond

486
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
everyone to respond
 

487
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,790
everyone to respond
immediately and with the most urgency

488
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
immediately and with the most urgency
 

489
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,350
immediately and with the most urgency
but it's

490
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
but it's
 

491
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,350
but it's
enough it's bad enough that you know

492
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
enough it's bad enough that you know
 

493
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,270
enough it's bad enough that you know
it's caused our economies to shut down

494
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
it's caused our economies to shut down
 

495
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,029
it's caused our economies to shut down
and collapse and so

496
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
and collapse and so
 

497
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,430
and collapse and so
um i think i know enough about virus

498
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
um i think i know enough about virus
 

499
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,269
um i think i know enough about virus
biology to be

500
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
biology to be
 

501
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,110
biology to be
terrified for humans that you know it

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
terrified for humans that you know it
 

503
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,110
terrified for humans that you know it
can it just takes one virus

504
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
can it just takes one virus
 

505
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,110
can it just takes one virus
just takes the wrong one to just

506
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
just takes the wrong one to just
 

507
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,630
just takes the wrong one to just
obliterate us or or

508
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
obliterate us or or
 

509
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,630
obliterate us or or
not obliterate us but but really do much

510
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
not obliterate us but but really do much
 

511
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,750
not obliterate us but but really do much
more damage than we've seen it's

512
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
more damage than we've seen it's
 

513
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,750
more damage than we've seen it's
fascinating to think that code 19 is

514
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
fascinating to think that code 19 is
 

515
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,630
fascinating to think that code 19 is
uh as a result of a virus evolving

516
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
uh as a result of a virus evolving
 

517
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,389
uh as a result of a virus evolving
together with like twitter

yeah like figuring out how we can sneak

520
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
yeah like figuring out how we can sneak
 

521
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,630
yeah like figuring out how we can sneak
past the defenses of the humans

522
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
past the defenses of the humans
 

523
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,350
past the defenses of the humans
so it's not bad enough and then the

524
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
so it's not bad enough and then the
 

525
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,350
so it's not bad enough and then the

together is operating in such a way that
 

529
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,350

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
the virus can spread
 

531
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,710
the virus can spread
effectively i wonder i mean obviously uh

532
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
effectively i wonder i mean obviously uh
 

533
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,310
effectively i wonder i mean obviously uh
a virus is not intelligent but there's a

534
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
a virus is not intelligent but there's a
 

535
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,990
a virus is not intelligent but there's a
uh there's a rhyme and a rhythm

536
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
uh there's a rhyme and a rhythm
 

537
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,430
uh there's a rhyme and a rhythm
to the way this whole evolutionary

throughout the entire civilization
 

545
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,310
throughout the entire civilization
absolutely it's um

547
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,190

yeah i'm i'm completely fascinated by

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
yeah i'm i'm completely fascinated by
 

549
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,509
yeah i'm i'm completely fascinated by
this

00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
this
 

551
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,590

idea of social media in particular
 

553
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,470
idea of social media in particular
how it replicates how it grows you know

554
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
how it replicates how it grows you know
 

555
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,030
how it replicates how it grows you know
i've been

556
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
i've been
 

557
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,350
i've been
how it inner how it like actually starts

558
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
how it inner how it like actually starts

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,949
how it inner how it like actually starts
interacting with the biology of the

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
who's going to get vaccinated politics
 

565
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,470
who's going to get vaccinated politics
like these seem so

566
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
like these seem so
 

567
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,670
like these seem so
external to virus biology but it's

568
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
external to virus biology but it's
 

569
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,550
external to virus biology but it's
become so

570
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
become so
 

571
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,990
become so
in intertwined and uh

572
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
in intertwined and uh
 

573
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,430
in intertwined and uh
and it's it's interesting and i actually

574
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
and it's it's interesting and i actually
 

575
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,030
and it's it's interesting and i actually
think we could find out that you know

576
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
think we could find out that you know
 

577
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,230
think we could find out that you know
the virus actually

578
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
the virus actually
 

579
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,430
the virus actually
becomes uh obviously not

580
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
becomes uh obviously not
 

581
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,470
becomes uh obviously not
uh intentionally but

582
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
uh intentionally but
 

583
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,150
uh intentionally but
you know we could find that choosing

584
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
you know we could find that choosing
 

585
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,750
you know we could find that choosing
people choosing not to wear masks

586
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
people choosing not to wear masks
 

587
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,310
people choosing not to wear masks
choosing

588
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
choosing
 

589
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,509
choosing
choosing not to counter this virus in a

590
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
choosing not to counter this virus in a
 

591
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,150
choosing not to counter this virus in a
regimented and sort of organized way

592
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
regimented and sort of organized way
 

593
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,829
regimented and sort of organized way
effectively gives the virus more

594
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
effectively gives the virus more
 

595
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,870
effectively gives the virus more
opportunity

596
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
opportunity
 

597
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,470
opportunity
to escape we can look at vaccines you

598
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
to escape we can look at vaccines you
 

599
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,150
to escape we can look at vaccines you
know we're about to

600
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
know we're about to
 

601
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,590
know we're about to
we're about to have one of the most

602
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
we're about to have one of the most
 

603
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,350
we're about to have one of the most
aggressive vaccination programs the

604
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
aggressive vaccination programs the
 

605
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,509
aggressive vaccination programs the
world has ever seen

606
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
world has ever seen
 

607
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,910
world has ever seen
but we are unfortunately doing it right

608
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
but we are unfortunately doing it right
 

609
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,630
but we are unfortunately doing it right
at the peak

610
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
at the peak
 

611
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,269
at the peak
of viral transmission when millions and

612
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
of viral transmission when millions and
 

613
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,550
of viral transmission when millions and
millions of people are still getting

614
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
millions of people are still getting
 

615
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,230
millions of people are still getting
infected

616
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
infected
 

617
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,069
infected
and when we do that that just gives this

618
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
and when we do that that just gives this
 

619
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,630
and when we do that that just gives this
virus so many more opportunities i mean

620
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
virus so many more opportunities i mean
 

621
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,389
virus so many more opportunities i mean
orders of magnitude

622
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
orders of magnitude
 

623
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,790
orders of magnitude
more opportunity to mutate around our

624
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
more opportunity to mutate around our
 

625
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,069
more opportunity to mutate around our
immune system

626
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
immune system
 

627
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,069
immune system
now if we were to vaccinate everyone

628
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
now if we were to vaccinate everyone
 

629
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,550
now if we were to vaccinate everyone
when there's not a lot of virus

630
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
when there's not a lot of virus
 

631
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,069
when there's not a lot of virus
then there's just not a lot of virus and

632
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
then there's just not a lot of virus and
 

633
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,670
then there's just not a lot of virus and
so there's not going to be as

634
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
so there's not going to be as
 

635
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,670
so there's not going to be as
many you know i don't even know how many

636
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
many you know i don't even know how many
 

637
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,509
many you know i don't even know how many
zeros are at the end of however many

638
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
zeros are at the end of however many
 

639
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,949
zeros are at the end of however many
viral particles there are in the world

640
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
viral particles there are in the world
 

641
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,150
viral particles there are in the world
right now you know

642
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
right now you know
 

643
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,509
right now you know
more than quadrillions you know and so

644
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
more than quadrillions you know and so
 

645
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,350
more than quadrillions you know and so
if you assume that at any given time

646
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
if you assume that at any given time
 

647
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,870
if you assume that at any given time
somebody might have trillions of virus

648
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
somebody might have trillions of virus
 

649
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,430
somebody might have trillions of virus
in them and

650
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
in them and
 

651
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,590
in them and
any given individual so then you know

652
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
any given individual so then you know
 

653
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,750
any given individual so then you know
multiply trillions by millions and yeah

654
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
multiply trillions by millions and yeah
 

655
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,110
multiply trillions by millions and yeah
you know you get a lot of viruses out

656
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
you know you get a lot of viruses out
 

657
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,670
you know you get a lot of viruses out
there and

658
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
there and
 

659
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,670
there and
and if you start applying pressure

660
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
and if you start applying pressure
 

661
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,990
and if you start applying pressure
ecological pressure to

662
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
ecological pressure to
 

663
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,230
ecological pressure to
this virus that that you know when it's

664
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
this virus that that you know when it's
 

665
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,829
this virus that that you know when it's
that abundant

666
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
that abundant
 

667
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,470

stop the spread of kobe 19 by christmas
let's jot down the fact that this is a

let's jot down the fact that this is a
 

717
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,269
let's jot down the fact that this is a
month ago so maybe your timeline would

718
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
month ago so maybe your timeline would
 

719
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,430
month ago so maybe your timeline would
be different but let's say in a month so

720
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
be different but let's say in a month so
 

721
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,269
be different but let's say in a month so
you've talked about this powerful idea

722
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
you've talked about this powerful idea
 

723
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,069
you've talked about this powerful idea
for

724
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
for
 

725
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,230
for
quite a while throughout the covid 19

726
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
quite a while throughout the covid 19
 

727
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,269
quite a while throughout the covid 19
pandemic

00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
pandemic
 

729
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,430
pandemic
how do we stop the spread of covad19 in

730
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
how do we stop the spread of covad19 in
 

731
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,110
how do we stop the spread of covad19 in
a month

732
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
a month
 

733
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,790
a month
well we uh we use tests like these

734
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
well we uh we use tests like these
 

735
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,949
well we uh we use tests like these
you know so so the only reason the virus

736
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
you know so so the only reason the virus
 

737
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,870
you know so so the only reason the virus
continues spreading

738
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
continues spreading
 

739
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,790
continues spreading
is because people spread it to each

740
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
is because people spread it to each
 

741
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,910
is because people spread it to each
other this isn't

742
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
other this isn't
 

743
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,269
other this isn't
this isn't magic yes um and so

744
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
this isn't magic yes um and so
 

745
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,590
this isn't magic yes um and so
there's a few ways to stop the virus

746
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
there's a few ways to stop the virus
 

747
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,910
there's a few ways to stop the virus
from spreading to each other

748
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
from spreading to each other
 

749
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,829
from spreading to each other
and that is uh you either can vaccinate

750
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
and that is uh you either can vaccinate
 

751
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,310
and that is uh you either can vaccinate
everyone and

752
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
everyone and
 

753
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,389
everyone and
vaccinating everyone is a way to

754
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
vaccinating everyone is a way to
 

755
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,230
vaccinating everyone is a way to
immunologically prevent the virus from

756
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
immunologically prevent the virus from
 

757
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,829
immunologically prevent the virus from
growing inside of somebody and therefore

758
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
growing inside of somebody and therefore
 

759
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,629
growing inside of somebody and therefore
spreading

760
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
spreading
 

761
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,550
spreading
we don't know yet actually if this

762
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
we don't know yet actually if this
 

763
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,230
we don't know yet actually if this
vaccine if any of these vaccines are

764
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
vaccine if any of these vaccines are
 

765
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,350
vaccine if any of these vaccines are
going to

766
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
going to
 

767
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,470
going to
prevent onward transmission so

768
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
prevent onward transmission so
 

769
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,030
prevent onward transmission so
so that may or may not serve to be one

770
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
so that may or may not serve to be one
 

771
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,990
so that may or may not serve to be one
opportunity

772
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
opportunity
 

773
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,430
opportunity
certainly i think it will decrease

774
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
certainly i think it will decrease
 

775
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,829
certainly i think it will decrease
transmission but the other idea that we

776
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
transmission but the other idea that we
 

777
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,069
transmission but the other idea that we
have at our disposal now

778
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
have at our disposal now
 

779
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,790
have at our disposal now
we had it in may we added in june july

780
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
we had it in may we added in june july
 

781
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,949
we had it in may we added in june july
august september october november

and now it's december we still have it

784
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
and now it's december we still have it
 

785
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,430
and now it's december we still have it
we still choose not to use it in this

786
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
we still choose not to use it in this
 

787
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,990
we still choose not to use it in this
country and in much of the world

788
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000
country and in much of the world
 

789
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,150

and that's rapid testing that is giving

790
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
and that's rapid testing that is giving
 

791
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,190
and that's rapid testing that is giving
it's empowering people to know

792
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
it's empowering people to know
 

793
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,030
it's empowering people to know
that they are infected and giving them

794
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
that they are infected and giving them
 

795
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,949
that they are infected and giving them
the opportunity to not spread it to

the opportunity to not spread it to
 

797
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,150
the opportunity to not spread it to
their loved ones

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,629
whoever else
we could have done this we still can

804
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
we could have done this we still can
 

805
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,230
we could have done this we still can
today we could start

806
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
today we could start
 

807
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,710
today we could start
we have millions of these tests these

808
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
we have millions of these tests these
 

809
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,509
we have millions of these tests these
tests are

810
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
tests are
 

811
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,710
tests are
uh simple paper strip tests they are

812
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
uh simple paper strip tests they are
 

813
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,269
uh simple paper strip tests they are
uh inside of this thing is just a little

814
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
uh inside of this thing is just a little
 

815
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,829
uh inside of this thing is just a little
piece of paper

816
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
piece of paper
 

817
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,150
piece of paper
now and i can actually open it up here

818
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
now and i can actually open it up here
 

819
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,430
now and i can actually open it up here
there we go

820
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
there we go
 

821
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,110
there we go
so this this is how we do it right here

822
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
so this this is how we do it right here
 

823
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,990
so this this is how we do it right here
we have this little paper strip test

824
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
we have this little paper strip test
 

825
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,750
we have this little paper strip test
this is enough to let you know if you're

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
this is enough to let you know if you're

833
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,990
sensitivity
99 specificity you can know

834
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
99 specificity you can know
 

835
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,790
99 specificity you can know
if you have infectious virus in you if

836
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
if you have infectious virus in you if
 

837
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,189
if you have infectious virus in you if
we can get these out to everyone's homes

838
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
we can get these out to everyone's homes
 

839
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,030
we can get these out to everyone's homes
build these make 10 million 20 million

840
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
build these make 10 million 20 million
 

841
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,629
build these make 10 million 20 million
30 million of them a day

842
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
30 million of them a day
 

843
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,629
30 million of them a day
you know we make more bottles of dasani

844
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
you know we make more bottles of dasani
 

845
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,829
you know we make more bottles of dasani
water

846
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
water
 

847
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,069
water
every day we can make these little paper

848
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
every day we can make these little paper
 

849
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,350
every day we can make these little paper
strip tests

850
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
strip tests
 

851
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,750
strip tests
and if we do that and we get these into

852
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
and if we do that and we get these into
 

853
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,430
and if we do that and we get these into
people's homes that they can use them

854
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
people's homes that they can use them
 

855
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,870
people's homes that they can use them
twice a week

856
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
twice a week
 

857
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,910
twice a week
then we can know if we're infectious you

858
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
then we can know if we're infectious you
 

859
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,030
then we can know if we're infectious you
know is it perfect

860
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
know is it perfect
 

861
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,110
know is it perfect
absolutely not but is it near perfect

862
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
absolutely not but is it near perfect
 

863
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,150
absolutely not but is it near perfect
absolutely

864
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
absolutely
 

865
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,030
absolutely
you know and so if we can say hey the

866
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
you know and so if we can say hey the
 

867
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,750
you know and so if we can say hey the
the

868
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
the
 

869
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,430
the
transmission of this is you know for

870
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
transmission of this is you know for
 

871
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,350
transmission of this is you know for
every 100 people that get infected right

872
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
every 100 people that get infected right
 

873
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,550
every 100 people that get infected right
now

874
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
now
 

875
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,710
now
they go on to infect maybe 130

876
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
they go on to infect maybe 130
 

877
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,790
they go on to infect maybe 130
additional people and that's exponential

878
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
additional people and that's exponential
 

879
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,189
additional people and that's exponential
growth so 100 becomes 130.

880
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
growth so 100 becomes 130.
 

881
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,470
growth so 100 becomes 130.
a couple days later that 130 becomes uh

882
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
a couple days later that 130 becomes uh
 

883
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,430
a couple days later that 130 becomes uh
another another 165 people have now been

884
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
another another 165 people have now been
 

885
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,470
another another 165 people have now been
infected

886
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
infected
 

887
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,870
infected
and you know go over three weeks and 100

888
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
and you know go over three weeks and 100
 

889
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,150
and you know go over three weeks and 100
people become 500

890
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
people become 500
 

891
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,030
people become 500
people infected now it doesn't take much

892
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
people infected now it doesn't take much
 

893
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,350
people infected now it doesn't take much
to

894
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
to
 

895
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,389
to
have those hundred people not infect 130

896
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
have those hundred people not infect 130
 

897
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,629
have those hundred people not infect 130
but infect 90.

898
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
but infect 90.
 

899
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,110
but infect 90.
all we have to do is remove say 30 40 of

900
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
all we have to do is remove say 30 40 of
 

901
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,470
all we have to do is remove say 30 40 of
new infections

902
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
new infections
 

903
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,629
new infections
from continuing their spread and then

904
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
from continuing their spread and then
 

905
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,150
from continuing their spread and then
instead of exponential growth you have

906
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
instead of exponential growth you have
 

907
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,990
instead of exponential growth you have
exponential decay

908
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
exponential decay
 

909
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,990
exponential decay
so this doesn't need to be perfect we

910
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
so this doesn't need to be perfect we
 

911
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,069
so this doesn't need to be perfect we
don't have to go from 100 to zero

912
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
don't have to go from 100 to zero
 

913
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,269
don't have to go from 100 to zero
we just have to go and have those

914
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
we just have to go and have those
 

915
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,110
we just have to go and have those
hundred people infect 90

916
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
hundred people infect 90
 

917
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,470
hundred people infect 90
and those 90 people infect you know 82

918
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
and those 90 people infect you know 82
 

919
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,470
and those 90 people infect you know 82
whatever it might be and you do that for

920
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
whatever it might be and you do that for
 

921
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,310
whatever it might be and you do that for
a few weeks and boom you have now gone

922
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
a few weeks and boom you have now gone
 

923
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,310
a few weeks and boom you have now gone
instead of 100 to 500 you've gone from

924
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
instead of 100 to 500 you've gone from
 

925
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,509
instead of 100 to 500 you've gone from
100 to 20.

926
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
100 to 20.
 

927
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,710
100 to 20.
yes it's not very hard and so

928
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
yes it's not very hard and so
 

929
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,150
yes it's not very hard and so
the way to do that is to let people know

930
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
the way to do that is to let people know
 

931
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,310
the way to do that is to let people know
that they're infectious i mean i've

932
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
that they're infectious i mean i've
 

933
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,629
that they're infectious i mean i've
we're a perfect example right now i i

934
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
we're a perfect example right now i i
 

935
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,829
we're a perfect example right now i i
this morning i used these tests uh to

936
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
this morning i used these tests uh to
 

937
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,590
this morning i used these tests uh to
make sure that i wasn't infectious

938
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
make sure that i wasn't infectious
 

939
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,509
make sure that i wasn't infectious
is it perfect no but it reduced my odds

940
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
is it perfect no but it reduced my odds
 

941
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,710
is it perfect no but it reduced my odds
99

942
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
99
 

943
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,550
99
i already was at extremely low odds

944
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
i already was at extremely low odds
 

945
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,310
i already was at extremely low odds
because i spent my life quarantining

946
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
because i spent my life quarantining
 

947
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,269
because i spent my life quarantining
these days

948
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
these days
 

949
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,470
these days
well the interesting thing with this

950
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
well the interesting thing with this
 

951
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,470
well the interesting thing with this
test which uh with the testing in

952
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
test which uh with the testing in
 

953
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,230
test which uh with the testing in
general which is why i love

954
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
general which is why i love
 

955
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,509
general which is why i love
what you've been espousing is it's

956
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
what you've been espousing is it's
 

957
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,269
what you've been espousing is it's
really confusing to me that this has not

958
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
really confusing to me that this has not
 

959
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,069
really confusing to me that this has not
been

960
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
been
 

961
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,430
been
taken on as it's one an

962
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
taken on as it's one an
 

963
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,269
taken on as it's one an
actual solution that's those available

964
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
actual solution that's those available
 

965
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,749
actual solution that's those available
for a long time there's there doesn't

966
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
for a long time there's there doesn't
 

967
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,269
for a long time there's there doesn't
seem to have been

968
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
seem to have been
 

969
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,189
seem to have been
solutions uh proposed at a large scale

970
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
solutions uh proposed at a large scale
 

971
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,110
solutions uh proposed at a large scale
and a solution that it seems like a lot

972
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
and a solution that it seems like a lot
 

973
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,710
and a solution that it seems like a lot
of people would be able to get behind

974
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
of people would be able to get behind
 

975
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,829
of people would be able to get behind
there's some

976
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:40,839
there's some
 

977
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,670
there's some
politicization or fear of other

978
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
politicization or fear of other
 

979
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,550
politicization or fear of other
solutions that people

980
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
solutions that people
 

981
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,110
solutions that people
propose which is like lock down and

982
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
propose which is like lock down and
 

983
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,629
propose which is like lock down and
there's a worry you know especially in

984
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,639
there's a worry you know especially in
 

985
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,550
there's a worry you know especially in
the american spirit of freedom

986
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
the american spirit of freedom
 

987
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,430
the american spirit of freedom
like you can't tell me what to do the

988
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
like you can't tell me what to do the
 

989
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,550
like you can't tell me what to do the
thing about tests

990
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
thing about tests
 

991
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,829
thing about tests
is it like empowers you with information

992
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
is it like empowers you with information
 

993
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,629
is it like empowers you with information
essentially

994
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
essentially
 

995
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,990
essentially
yes so like you it's

996
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
yes so like you it's
 

997
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,150
yes so like you it's
it gives you more information about your

998
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
it gives you more information about your
 

999
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,150
it gives you more information about your
like your role in this pandemic and then

1000
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,160
like your role in this pandemic and then
 

1001
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,309
like your role in this pandemic and then
you can do whatever the hell you want

1002
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
you can do whatever the hell you want
 

1003
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,470
you can do whatever the hell you want
like it's all up to your ethics and and

1004
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
like it's all up to your ethics and and
 

1005
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,470
like it's all up to your ethics and and
so on so like

1006
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
so on so like
 

1007
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,150
so on so like
and it's it's obvious that with that

1008
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
and it's it's obvious that with that
 

1009
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,750
and it's it's obvious that with that
information people would be able to

1010
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
information people would be able to
 

1011
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,429
information people would be able to
protect their loved ones

1012
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
protect their loved ones
 

1013
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,549
protect their loved ones
and also do uh do their sort of

1014
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
and also do uh do their sort of
 

1015
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,390
and also do uh do their sort of
quote-unquote duty for their country

1016
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
quote-unquote duty for their country
 

1017
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,909
quote-unquote duty for their country
right it's protect the rest of the

1018
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
right it's protect the rest of the
 

1019
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,630
right it's protect the rest of the
country

1020
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
country
 

1021
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,270
country
that's exactly right i mean it's just

1022
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
that's exactly right i mean it's just
 

1023
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,110
that's exactly right i mean it's just
it's empowerment but you know this is a

1024
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
it's empowerment but you know this is a
 

1025
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,070
it's empowerment but you know this is a
problem

1026
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
problem
 

1027
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,549
problem
we have not put these into action in

1028
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
we have not put these into action in
 

1029
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,390
we have not put these into action in
large part because

1030
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
large part because
 

1031
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,230
large part because
we have a medical industry that doesn't

1032
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
we have a medical industry that doesn't
 

1033
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,070
we have a medical industry that doesn't
want to see them be used

1034
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
want to see them be used
 

1035
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,590
want to see them be used
we have a political and a regulatory

1036
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
we have a political and a regulatory
 

1037
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,029
we have a political and a regulatory
industry that doesn't want to see them

1038
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
industry that doesn't want to see them
 

1039
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:45,990
industry that doesn't want to see them
be used that sounds

1040
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
be used that sounds
 

1041
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,510
be used that sounds
crazy why wouldn't they want them to be

1042
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
crazy why wouldn't they want them to be
 

1043
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,630
crazy why wouldn't they want them to be
used we have a very paternalistic

1044
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
used we have a very paternalistic
 

1045
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,470
used we have a very paternalistic
approach to everything in this country

1046
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
approach to everything in this country
 

1047
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,909
approach to everything in this country
you know despite

1048
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
you know despite
 

1049
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,510
you know despite
this country kind of being founded on

1050
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
this country kind of being founded on
 

1051
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,190
this country kind of being founded on
this individualistic

1052
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
this individualistic
 

1053
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,190
this individualistic
ideal pull yourself up from your

00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
ideal pull yourself up from your
 

1055
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,270
ideal pull yourself up from your
bootstraps all that stuff

1056
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
bootstraps all that stuff
 

1057
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,270
bootstraps all that stuff
uh when it comes to public health we

1058
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
uh when it comes to public health we
 

1059
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,590
uh when it comes to public health we
have a bunch of

1060
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
have a bunch of
 

1061
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,350
have a bunch of
ivory tower academics who want data that

1062
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
ivory tower academics who want data that
 

1063
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,710
ivory tower academics who want data that
you know they want to see

1064
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
you know they want to see
 

1065
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,710
you know they want to see
perfection and we have this issue of

1066
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
perfection and we have this issue of
 

1067
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,470
perfection and we have this issue of
letting perfection get in the way of

1068
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
letting perfection get in the way of
 

1069
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,470
letting perfection get in the way of
actually doing something

1070
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
actually doing something
 

1071
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,549
actually doing something
at all you know doing something

1072
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
at all you know doing something
 

1073
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,710
at all you know doing something
effective and

1074
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
effective and
 

1075
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,470
effective and
so we keep comparing these tests for

1076
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
so we keep comparing these tests for
 

1077
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,909
so we keep comparing these tests for
example to the laboratory-based pcr test

1078
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
example to the laboratory-based pcr test
 

1079
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,870
example to the laboratory-based pcr test
and

1080
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
and
 

1081
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,950
and
sure this isn't a pcr test but this

1082
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960
sure this isn't a pcr test but this
 

1083
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,549
sure this isn't a pcr test but this
doesn't cost a hundred dollars and it

1084
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
doesn't cost a hundred dollars and it
 

1085
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,549
doesn't cost a hundred dollars and it
doesn't take five days to get back

1086
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
doesn't take five days to get back
 

1087
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,630
doesn't take five days to get back
which means in every single scenario

1088
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,640
which means in every single scenario
 

1089
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,710
which means in every single scenario
this is the more effective test

1090
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
this is the more effective test
 

1091
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,510
this is the more effective test
and we have unfortunately a system

1092
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
and we have unfortunately a system
 

1093
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,710
and we have unfortunately a system
that's not about public health we have

1094
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
that's not about public health we have
 

1095
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,830
that's not about public health we have
entirely eroded any ideals of public

1096
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
entirely eroded any ideals of public
 

1097
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,270
entirely eroded any ideals of public
health in our country

1098
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
health in our country
 

1099
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,669
health in our country
for the biomedical complex you know this

1100
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
for the biomedical complex you know this
 

1101
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,270
for the biomedical complex you know this
medical industrial complex which

1102
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
medical industrial complex which
 

1103
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,110
medical industrial complex which
overrides everything

1104
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
overrides everything
 

1105
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,470
overrides everything
and that's why you know i'm just

1106
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
and that's why you know i'm just
 

1107

and that's why you know i'm just
can i swear on this podcast yes

1108
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480

 

1109
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,029

i'm just so [\h__\h] pissed that these

1110
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
i'm just so [\h__\h] pissed that these
 

1111
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,870
i'm just so [\h__\h] pissed that these
tests don't exist meanwhile and everyone

1112
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
tests don't exist meanwhile and everyone
 

1113
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,909
tests don't exist meanwhile and everyone
says

1114
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
says
 

1115
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,750
says
you know how we couldn't make these you

1116
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
you know how we couldn't make these you
 

1117
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,190
you know how we couldn't make these you
know that we could never do it that

1118
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
know that we could never do it that
 

1119
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,710
know that we could never do it that
would be such a hard

1120
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
would be such a hard
 

1121
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,870
would be such a hard
a difficult problem meanwhile the

a difficult problem meanwhile the
 

1123
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,150
a difficult problem meanwhile the
vaccine gets

1124

we've we have at the same time that we
could have gotten these stupid little

1128
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
could have gotten these stupid little
 

1129
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,909
could have gotten these stupid little
paper strip tests out to every household

1130
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
paper strip tests out to every household
 

1131
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,110
paper strip tests out to every household
we have uh developed a brand new vaccine

1132
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
we have uh developed a brand new vaccine
 

1133
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,950
we have uh developed a brand new vaccine
we've gone through phase one phase two

1134
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
we've gone through phase one phase two
 

1135
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,789
we've gone through phase one phase two
phase three trials we've scaled up its

1136
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
phase three trials we've scaled up its
 

1137
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,830
phase three trials we've scaled up its
production

1138

production
 

1139
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,909
production
and now we have ups and fedex and all

1140
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
and now we have ups and fedex and all
 

1141
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,669
and now we have ups and fedex and all
the logistics in the world

00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
the logistics in the world
 

1143
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,350
the logistics in the world
getting freezers out to where they need

1144
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
getting freezers out to where they need
 

1145
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,110
getting freezers out to where they need
to be we have this immense

1146
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
to be we have this immense
 

1147
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,190
to be we have this immense
we see with when it comes to sort of

1148
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
we see with when it comes to sort of
 

1149
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,390
we see with when it comes to sort of
medicine you know something you're

1150
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
medicine you know something you're
 

1151
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,230
medicine you know something you're
injecting into somebody

1152
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
injecting into somebody
 

1153
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,310
injecting into somebody
then all of a sudden people say oh yes

1154
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320
then all of a sudden people say oh yes
 

1155
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,070
then all of a sudden people say oh yes
we can yeah but you say

1156
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
we can yeah but you say
 

1157
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,830
we can yeah but you say
oh no that's that's too simple a

1158
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
oh no that's that's too simple a
 

1159
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,830
oh no that's that's too simple a
solution too cheap a solution no way

1160
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
solution too cheap a solution no way
 

1161
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,990
solution too cheap a solution no way
could we possibly do that

1162
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
could we possibly do that
 

1163
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,909
could we possibly do that
it's this faulty thinking in our country

1164
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:53,919
it's this faulty thinking in our country
 

1165
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,110
it's this faulty thinking in our country
which you know frankly is driven by

00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
which you know frankly is driven by
 

1167
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,750
which you know frankly is driven by
big money big you know the only time

big money big you know the only time
 

1169
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,190
big money big you know the only time
when we actually think that we can do

1170
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
when we actually think that we can do
 

1171
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,310
when we actually think that we can do
something

1172
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,320
something
 

1173
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,149
something
that's maybe aggressive and complicated

1174
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
that's maybe aggressive and complicated
 

1175
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,510
that's maybe aggressive and complicated

some some number like this so you also

1196
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
some some number like this so you also
 

1197
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,350
some some number like this so you also
have to acknowledge that

1198
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
have to acknowledge that
 

1199
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,990
have to acknowledge that
all the money that's been invested like

there doesn't appear to be a solution to
 

1203

i don't know if you know this number but

1210
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
i don't know if you know this number but
 

1211
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,310
i don't know if you know this number but
for taking a strip

1212
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
for taking a strip
 

1213
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,029
for taking a strip
like a rapid test like this i bet you

1214
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,039
like a rapid test like this i bet you
 

1215
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,950
like a rapid test like this i bet you
people would say

1216
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
people would say
 

1217
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,310
people would say
like the percentage of people that

1218
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
like the percentage of people that
 

1219
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,230
like the percentage of people that
wouldn't take it is in the single digits

1220
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
wouldn't take it is in the single digits
 

1221
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,190
wouldn't take it is in the single digits
probably

1222
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
probably
 

1223
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,270
probably
i completely think so and you know

1224
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
i completely think so and you know
 

1225
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,310
i completely think so and you know
there's a lot of people who don't want

1226
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
there's a lot of people who don't want
 

1227
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,230
there's a lot of people who don't want
to get a test today

1228
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
to get a test today
 

1229
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,950
to get a test today
and that's because it gets sent to a lab

1230
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
and that's because it gets sent to a lab
 

1231
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,310
and that's because it gets sent to a lab
it gets reported

1232
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
it gets reported
 

1233
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,190
it gets reported
it has all the stuff and in our country

1234
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
it has all the stuff and in our country
 

1235
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,990
it has all the stuff and in our country
which

1236
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
which
 

1237
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,590
which
teaches people from the time they're

data close to them we have hipaa we have
 

1243
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,870
data close to them we have hipaa we have
all these we have immense rules and

1244

all these we have immense rules and

people's

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,549
people's
medical data and then a pandemic comes

1250
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
medical data and then a pandemic comes
 

1251
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,549
medical data and then a pandemic comes
around and we just assume that all that

1252
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
around and we just assume that all that
 

1253
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,070
around and we just assume that all that
the average person is going to wipe

1254
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
the average person is going to wipe
 

1255
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,230
the average person is going to wipe
all that away and say oh no i'm happy

1256
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
all that away and say oh no i'm happy
 

1257
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,470
all that away and say oh no i'm happy
giving out not just my own medical data

1258
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
giving out not just my own medical data
 

1259
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,909
giving out not just my own medical data
but also to tell

1260
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
but also to tell
 

1261
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,669
but also to tell
the authorities everyone who i've spent

1262
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
the authorities everyone who i've spent
 

1263
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,830
the authorities everyone who i've spent
my time with so that they all get a call

1264
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
my time with so that they all get a call
 

1265
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,750
my time with so that they all get a call
and are pissed at me for giving up their

1266
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
and are pissed at me for giving up their
 

1267
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,110
and are pissed at me for giving up their
names you know so people aren't getting

1268
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
names you know so people aren't getting
 

1269
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,430
names you know so people aren't getting
tested and they're definitely not giving

1270
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
tested and they're definitely not giving
 

1271
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,990
tested and they're definitely not giving
up

1272
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
up
 

1273
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,750
up
their contacts when it comes to contact

1274
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
their contacts when it comes to contact
 

1275
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,470
their contacts when it comes to contact
tracing and so for so many reasons that

1276
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
tracing and so for so many reasons that
 

1277
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,310
tracing and so for so many reasons that
approach is failing

1278
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
approach is failing
 

1279
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,549
approach is failing
uh not to even mention the delays in

1280
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
uh not to even mention the delays in
 

1281
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,470
uh not to even mention the delays in
testing and things like that and so

1282
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
testing and things like that and so
 

1283
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,549
testing and things like that and so
this is a whole different approach but

1284
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
this is a whole different approach but
 

1285
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,750
this is a whole different approach but
it's an approach that

1286
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
it's an approach that
 

1287
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,789
it's an approach that
empowers people and takes the power

1288
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
empowers people and takes the power
 

1289
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,270
empowers people and takes the power
a bit away from the people in charge you

1290
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
a bit away from the people in charge you
 

1291
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,630
a bit away from the people in charge you
know and that's what's that's what's

1292
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
know and that's what's that's what's
 

1293
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,510
know and that's what's that's what's
really grating on

1294
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,520
really grating on
 

1295
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,750
really grating on
on i think public health officials who

1296
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
on i think public health officials who
 

1297
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,350
on i think public health officials who
say no we need the data

1298
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
say no we need the data
 

1299
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,830
say no we need the data
so they're effectively saying if i can't

1300
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
so they're effectively saying if i can't
 

1301
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,350
so they're effectively saying if i can't
have the data i don't want the

1302
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
have the data i don't want the
 

1303
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,950
have the data i don't want the
individuals i don't want the public to

1304
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
individuals i don't want the public to
 

1305
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,549
individuals i don't want the public to
have their own data either

1306
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
have their own data either
 

1307
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,990
have their own data either
which is a terrible approach to a

1308
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
which is a terrible approach to a
 

1309
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,750
which is a terrible approach to a
pandemic where we can't

1310
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
pandemic where we can't
 

1311
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,870
pandemic where we can't
solve a public health crisis without

1312
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880

absolutely we can get costs this
this thing right here cost less than a

1354
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
this thing right here cost less than a
 

1355
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,110
this thing right here cost less than a
dollar to make

1356
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
dollar to make
 

1357
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,669
dollar to make
with everything combined plus the swabs

1358
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
with everything combined plus the swabs
 

1359
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,909

you know maybe it costs a dollar fifty
 

1361
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,510

could be sold for uh frankly it could be

1362

could be sold for uh frankly it could be
 

1363
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,950
could be sold for uh frankly it could be
sold for three dollars and still make a

sold for three dollars and still make a
 

1365
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,630
sold for three dollars and still make a
profit if they want to sell it for five

1366
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
profit if they want to sell it for five
 

1367
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,070
profit if they want to sell it for five
this one here this is a slightly more

1368
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
this one here this is a slightly more
 

1369
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,390
this one here this is a slightly more
complicated one but you can see it's

1370
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
complicated one but you can see it's
 

1371
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,310
complicated one but you can see it's
just got the exact same paper strip

1372
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320
just got the exact same paper strip
 

1373
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,669
just got the exact same paper strip
inside

1374
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
inside
 

1375
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,590
inside
this is really it doesn't look like much

1376
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
this is really it doesn't look like much
 

1377
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,870
this is really it doesn't look like much
but it's kind of the cream of the crop

1378
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
but it's kind of the cream of the crop
 

1379
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,830
but it's kind of the cream of the crop
in terms of these

1380
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
in terms of these
 

1381
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,070
in terms of these
rapid tests this is the one that the us

1382
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
rapid tests this is the one that the us
 

1383
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,070
rapid tests this is the one that the us
government bought and it is doing

1384
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
government bought and it is doing
 

1385
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,110
government bought and it is doing
an amazing job it has a 99.9

1386
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
an amazing job it has a 99.9
 

1387
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,830
an amazing job it has a 99.9
uh sensitivity and specificity so it's

1388
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
uh sensitivity and specificity so it's
 

1389
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,390
uh sensitivity and specificity so it's
really

1390
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
really
 

1391
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,310
really
it's really good and so essentially the

1392
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320
it's really good and so essentially the
 

1393
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,669
it's really good and so essentially the
way it works is you just

1394
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
way it works is you just
 

1395
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,870
way it works is you just
you use a swab you put the once you you

1396
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
you use a swab you put the once you you
 

1397
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,070
you use a swab you put the once you you
kind of use the swelling yourself you

1398
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
kind of use the swelling yourself you
 

1399
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,830
kind of use the swelling yourself you
put the swab into these little holes

1400
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
put the swab into these little holes
 

1401
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,789
put the swab into these little holes
here

1402
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
here
 

1403
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,350
here
you put some buffer on and you close it

1404
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
you put some buffer on and you close it
 

1405
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,190
you put some buffer on and you close it
and uh and a line will show up if it's

1406
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
and uh and a line will show up if it's
 

1407
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,149
and uh and a line will show up if it's
positive and

1408
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
positive and
 

1409
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,669
positive and
a line won't show up but it's negative

1410
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
a line won't show up but it's negative
 

1411
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,310
a line won't show up but it's negative
it takes 5-10 minutes

1412
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
it takes 5-10 minutes
 

1413
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,029
it takes 5-10 minutes
this whole thing the this this can be

1414
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
this whole thing the this this can be
 

1415
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,029
this whole thing the this this can be
made so cheap that the us government was

1416
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
made so cheap that the us government was
 

1417
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,470
made so cheap that the us government was
able to buy them

1418
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480
able to buy them
 

1419
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,669
able to buy them
by 150 million of them from uh

1420
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
by 150 million of them from uh
 

1421
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,310
by 150 million of them from uh
abbott for five dollars a piece you know

00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
pay for it or a hundred dollars you know
 

1491
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,190
pay for it or a hundred dollars you know
it might only cost me 50 cents to make

1492
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
it might only cost me 50 cents to make
 

1493

it might only cost me 50 cents to make
but

but
 

1495
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,830
but
but by pushing all of these tests

but by pushing all of these tests
 

1497

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
they what what extrudes out the other
 

1501
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,710

side is an expensive medical device
 

1503
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,549

that's erroneously expensive it doesn't

1504
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
that's erroneously expensive it doesn't
 

1505
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,669
that's erroneously expensive it doesn't
need to be

1506
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:21,679
need to be
 

1507
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,230
need to be
inflated in cost but the companies say

1508
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
inflated in cost but the companies say
 

1509
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,870
inflated in cost but the companies say
well i'd rather make fewer of them

1510
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
well i'd rather make fewer of them
 

1511
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,549
well i'd rather make fewer of them
and just sell them all for thirty

1512
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
and just sell them all for thirty
 

1513
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,230
and just sell them all for thirty
dollars a piece

1514

dollars a piece
 

1515
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,549
dollars a piece
then make tens of millions of them which

1516
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
then make tens of millions of them which
 

1517
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,830
then make tens of millions of them which
i could do

1518
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
i could do
 

1519
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,510
i could do
and sell them at a dollar uh marginal uh

1520
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
and sell them at a dollar uh marginal uh
 

1521
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,110
and sell them at a dollar uh marginal uh
uh profit you know and so

1522
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,120
uh profit you know and so
 

1523
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,789
uh profit you know and so
it's a problem with our with our whole

1524
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
it's a problem with our with our whole
 

1525
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,310
it's a problem with our with our whole
medical industry that we see

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
medical industry that we see
 

1527
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,110
medical industry that we see
tests only as medical devices and uh you

1528
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
tests only as medical devices and uh you
 

1529
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,630

bought
 

1535
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,950
bought
150 million of these from abbott they

150 million of these from abbott they
 

1537
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,269
150 million of these from abbott they
should be buying

1538
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
should be buying
 

1539
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,789
should be buying
you know all of these tests that they

1540
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:56,799
you know all of these tests that they
 

1541
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,950
you know all of these tests that they
should be buying 20 million a day

1542
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:58,960
should be buying 20 million a day
 

1543
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,470
should be buying 20 million a day
and getting them out to people's homes

1544
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
and getting them out to people's homes
 

1545
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,990
and getting them out to people's homes
this virus has cost

1546
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
this virus has cost
 

1547
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,909
this virus has cost
trillions of dollars to the american

1548
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
trillions of dollars to the american
 

1549

trillions of dollars to the american
people it's closed down restaurants and

1550
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
people it's closed down restaurants and
 

1551
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,710
people it's closed down restaurants and
stores and you know obviously the main

1552
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
stores and you know obviously the main
 

1553
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,549
stores and you know obviously the main
streets across america have shut have

1554
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
streets across america have shut have
 

1555
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,669
streets across america have shut have
shuttered

1556
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
shuttered
 

1557
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,269
shuttered
it's killing people it's killing our

1558
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:13,279
it's killing people it's killing our
 

1559
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,630
it's killing people it's killing our
economy it's killing lifestyles

1560
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640
economy it's killing lifestyles
 

1561
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,190
economy it's killing lifestyles
and and this is an obvious solution to

1562
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
and and this is an obvious solution to
 

1563
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,029
and and this is an obvious solution to
me this is exciting this is like this is

1564
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039
me this is exciting this is like this is
 

1565
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,710
me this is exciting this is like this is
a solution i wish uh

1566
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
a solution i wish uh
 

1567
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,510
a solution i wish uh
like in april or something like that uh

1568
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,520
like in april or something like that uh
 

1569
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,909
like in april or something like that uh
to

1570
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
to
 

1571
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,029
to
launch like the larger scale

1572
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,039
launch like the larger scale
 

1573
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,149
launch like the larger scale
manufacturing deployment of uh

1574
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
manufacturing deployment of uh
 

1575
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,029
manufacturing deployment of uh
tests doesn't matter what test they are

1576
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:35,039
tests doesn't matter what test they are
 

1577
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,870
tests doesn't matter what test they are
it's obviously the capitalist system

1578
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
it's obviously the capitalist system
 

1579
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,590
it's obviously the capitalist system
would create

1580
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
would create
 

1581
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,190
would create
cheaper and cheaper tests that that

1582
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
cheaper and cheaper tests that that
 

1583
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,430
cheaper and cheaper tests that that
would be hopefully driving down to one

1584
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,440
would be hopefully driving down to one
 

1585
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,310
would be hopefully driving down to one
dollar

1586
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
dollar
 

1587
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,029
dollar
so what are we talking about in america

1588
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
so what are we talking about in america
 

1589
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,909
so what are we talking about in america
there's i don't know

1590
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
there's i don't know
 

1591
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,029
there's i don't know
300 plus a million people

1592
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
300 plus a million people
 

1593
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,669
300 plus a million people
so that means you want to be testing

1594
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
so that means you want to be testing
 

1595
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,549
so that means you want to be testing
regularly

1596
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
regularly
 

1597
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,590
regularly
right so how many

1598
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
right so how many
 

1599
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,350
right so how many
do you think is possible to manufacture

1600
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
do you think is possible to manufacture
 

1601
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,590
do you think is possible to manufacture
will be the ultimate goal to manufacture

1602
00:26:59,590 --> 00:26:59,600
will be the ultimate goal to manufacture
 

1603
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,350
will be the ultimate goal to manufacture
per month yep so if we want to slow this

1604
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,360
per month yep so if we want to slow this
 

1605
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,950
per month yep so if we want to slow this
virus and actually stop it from

1606
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
virus and actually stop it from
 

1607
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,630
virus and actually stop it from
transmitting achieve what i call herd

1608
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:06,640
transmitting achieve what i call herd
 

1609
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,269
transmitting achieve what i call herd
effects

1610
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
effects
 

1611
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,390
effects
like vaccine herd immunity hurt effects

1612
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,400
like vaccine herd immunity hurt effects
 

1613
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,029
like vaccine herd immunity hurt effects
are when you get that r value below one

1614
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
are when you get that r value below one
 

1615
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,549
are when you get that r value below one
through preventing onward transmission

1616
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559
through preventing onward transmission
 

1617
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,830
through preventing onward transmission
if we want to do that with these tests

1618
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
if we want to do that with these tests
 

1619
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,909
if we want to do that with these tests
we need about 20 million to 40 million

1620
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919
we need about 20 million to 40 million
 

1621
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,310
we need about 20 million to 40 million
of them

1622
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,320
of them
 

1623
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,430
of them
every day uh which is not a lot

1624
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
every day uh which is not a lot
 

1625
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,710
every day uh which is not a lot
in the united states in the united

in the united states in the united
 

1627
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,789
in the united states in the united
states so we could do it there's other

1628
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799
states so we could do it there's other
 

1629
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,389
states so we could do it there's other
ways you can have two people in a

1630
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:26,399
ways you can have two people in a

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,440
household
 

1633
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,669
household
uh swab each other you know swab

1634
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
uh swab each other you know swab
 

1635
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,870
uh swab each other you know swab
themselves rather

1636
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
themselves rather
 

1637
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,710
themselves rather
and then mix you know put the swabs into

1638
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
and then mix you know put the swabs into
 

1639
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,230
and then mix you know put the swabs into
the same tube and onto one test so you

1640
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
the same tube and onto one test so you
 

1641
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,269
the same tube and onto one test so you
can pool

1642
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
can pool
 

1643
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,190
can pool
so you can get a a 2 or 3x

1644
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
so you can get a a 2 or 3x
 

1645
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,190
so you can get a a 2 or 3x
gain inefficiency through pooling in the

1646
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
gain inefficiency through pooling in the
 

1647
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,190
gain inefficiency through pooling in the
household you could do that in schools

1648
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
household you could do that in schools
 

1649
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,029
household you could do that in schools
or offices too where everyone just uses

1650
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
or offices too where everyone just uses
 

1651
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,149
or offices too where everyone just uses
a swab you have a

1652
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:46,159
a swab you have a
 

1653
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,230
a swab you have a
there's two people like i mean even if

1654
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
there's two people like i mean even if
 

1655
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,070
there's two people like i mean even if
it's just standing in line

1656
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
it's just standing in line
 

1657
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,149
it's just standing in line
at a public testing site or something

1658
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
at a public testing site or something
 

1659
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,590
at a public testing site or something
you know you could just say okay

1660
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,600
you know you could just say okay
 

1661
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,149
you know you could just say okay
these two are the last people to test or

1662
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:56,159
these two are the last people to test or
 

1663
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,990
these two are the last people to test or
swab themselves they go into one

1664
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,000
swab themselves they go into one
 

1665
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,750
swab themselves they go into one
one thing and if it comes back positive

1666
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
one thing and if it comes back positive
 

1667
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,190
one thing and if it comes back positive
then you just do each person and you

1668
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
then you just do each person and you
 

1669
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,990
then you just do each person and you
know it's rapid

1670
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
know it's rapid
 

1671
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,830
know it's rapid
so you can just say to the people one of

1672
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
so you can just say to the people one of
 

1673
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,350
so you can just say to the people one of
you is positive

1674
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360
you is positive
 

1675
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,549
you is positive
let's test you again um so there's ways

1676
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
let's test you again um so there's ways
 

1677
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,389
let's test you again um so there's ways
to get the efficiency gains much better

1678
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:10,399
to get the efficiency gains much better
 

1679
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,269
to get the efficiency gains much better
but let's say

1680
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
but let's say
 

1681
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,190
but let's say
i think that that the optimal number

1682
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,200
i think that that the optimal number
 

1683
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,630
i think that that the optimal number
right now that matches sort of what we

1684
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
right now that matches sort of what we
 

1685
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,350
right now that matches sort of what we
can produce

1686
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,360
can produce
 

1687
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,750
can produce
more or less today if we wanted is 20

1688
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
more or less today if we wanted is 20
 

1689
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,870
more or less today if we wanted is 20
million a day

1690
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
million a day
 

1691
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,950
million a day
right now one company that i don't have

1692
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:20,960
right now one company that i don't have
 

1693
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,549
right now one company that i don't have
their test here but one company is

1694
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:22,559
their test here but one company is
 

1695
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,230
their test here but one company is
already producing five million

1696
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
already producing five million
 

1697
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,549
already producing five million
tests themselves and shipping them

1698
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
tests themselves and shipping them
 

1699
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,510
tests themselves and shipping them
overseas

1700
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:27,520
overseas
 

1701
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,870
overseas
it's an american company based in

1702
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,880
it's an american company based in
 

1703
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,789
it's an american company based in
california called inova

1704
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:30,799
california called inova
 

1705
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,510
california called inova
and they are giving 5 million tests to

1706
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
and they are giving 5 million tests to
 

1707
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,149
and they are giving 5 million tests to
the uk

1708
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,159
the uk
 

1709
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,510
the uk
every day not to the you know

1710
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:37,520
every day not to the you know
 

1711
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,669
every day not to the you know
and this is just because there's no the

1712
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
and this is just because there's no the
 

1713
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,190
and this is just because there's no the
federal government hasn't authorized

1714
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
federal government hasn't authorized
 

1715
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,230
federal government hasn't authorized
these tests

1716
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,240
these tests
 

1717
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,750
these tests
without the support of the the

1718
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:43,760
without the support of the the
 

1719
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,430
without the support of the the
government so yeah so

1720
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:45,440
government so yeah so
 

1721
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,269
government so yeah so
essentially if the government just puts

1722
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
essentially if the government just puts
 

1723
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,190
essentially if the government just puts
some support behind it

1724
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
some support behind it
 

1725
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,710
some support behind it
then uh then yeah you can get 20 million

1726
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:52,720
then uh then yeah you can get 20 million
 

1727
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,950
then uh then yeah you can get 20 million
probably easy oh yeah this i mean just

1728
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
probably easy oh yeah this i mean just
 

1729
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,149
probably easy oh yeah this i mean just
here i have

1730
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:56,159
here i have
 

1731
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,830
here i have
three different companies these they all

1732
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:57,840
three different companies these they all
 

1733
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,830
three different companies these they all
look similar well this one's closed but

1734
00:28:59,830 --> 00:28:59,840
look similar well this one's closed but
 

1735
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,110
look similar well this one's closed but
these are three different companies

1736
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
these are three different companies
 

1737
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,029
these are three different companies
right here this is a fourth

1738
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
right here this is a fourth
 

1739
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,750
right here this is a fourth
abbott you know this is a fifth this is

1740
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
abbott you know this is a fifth this is
 

1741
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,950
abbott you know this is a fifth this is
a sixth

1742
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
a sixth
 

1743
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,549
a sixth
these two are a little bit different do

1744
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
these two are a little bit different do
 

1745
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,230
these two are a little bit different do
you mind if in a little bit would you

1746
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
you mind if in a little bit would you
 

1747
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,029
you mind if in a little bit would you
take some of these

1748
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
take some of these
 

1749
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,510
take some of these
or yeah let's let's do it we can we can

1750
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
or yeah let's let's do it we can we can
 

1751
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,950
or yeah let's let's do it we can we can
uh we can absolutely

1752
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
uh we can absolutely
 

1753
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,389
uh we can absolutely
do that so you have a lot of tests in

1754
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
do that so you have a lot of tests in
 

1755
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,630
do that so you have a lot of tests in
front of you uh could you maybe explain

1756
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,640
front of you uh could you maybe explain
 

1757
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,990
front of you uh could you maybe explain
some of them

1758
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
some of them
 

1759
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,630
some of them
absolutely so there's a few different

1760
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
absolutely so there's a few different
 

1761
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,310
absolutely so there's a few different
classes of tests

1762
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,320
classes of tests
 

1763
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,590
classes of tests
that i just have here and there's more

1764
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,600
that i just have here and there's more
 

1765
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,350
that i just have here and there's more
tests there's many more different tests

1766
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
tests there's many more different tests
 

1767
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,710
tests there's many more different tests
out in the world too

1768
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
out in the world too
 

1769
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,269
out in the world too
these are these are one class of tests

1770
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
these are these are one class of tests
 

1771
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:31,830
these are these are one class of tests
these are

1772
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:31,840
these are
 

1773
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,549
these are
uh rapid antigen tests that are just the

1774
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:34,559
uh rapid antigen tests that are just the
 

1775
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,669
uh rapid antigen tests that are just the
most bare bones paper strip tests these

1776
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:37,679
most bare bones paper strip tests these
 

1777
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,350
most bare bones paper strip tests these
uh this is the type that i want to see

1778
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
uh this is the type that i want to see
 

1779
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,110
uh this is the type that i want to see
produced in the tens of millions every

1780
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
produced in the tens of millions every
 

1781
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,269
produced in the tens of millions every
day it's so simple

1782
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
day it's so simple
 

1783
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,870
day it's so simple
you know you don't even need the plastic

1784
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
you know you don't even need the plastic
 

1785
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,830
you know you don't even need the plastic
cartridge you can just you can just make

1786
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:49,840
cartridge you can just you can just make
 

1787
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,029
cartridge you can just you can just make
uh make the paper strip and you could

1788
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:53,039
uh make the paper strip and you could
 

1789
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,190
uh make the paper strip and you could
have a little a little tube like this

1790
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:55,200
have a little a little tube like this
 

1791
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,669
have a little a little tube like this
that

1792
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:55,679
that
 

1793
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,269
that
you know you just dunk the paper strip

1794
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:57,279
you know you just dunk the paper strip
 

1795
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,110
you know you just dunk the paper strip
into you don't actually need

1796
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,120
into you don't actually need
 

1797
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,190
into you don't actually need
the plastic which i'd actually prefer

1798
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
the plastic which i'd actually prefer
 

1799
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,549
the plastic which i'd actually prefer
because if we start making tens of

1800
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
because if we start making tens of
 

1801
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,310
because if we start making tens of
millions of these this becomes a lot of

1802
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,320
millions of these this becomes a lot of
 

1803
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,549
millions of these this becomes a lot of
waste so i'd rather not see this kind of

1804
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
waste so i'd rather not see this kind of
 

1805
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,590
waste so i'd rather not see this kind of
waste be out there and

1806
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:07,600
waste be out there and
 

1807
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,149
waste be out there and
there's a few companies quadel is making

1808
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:10,159
there's a few companies quadel is making
 

1809
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,750
there's a few companies quadel is making
a test called the quick view which is

1810
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:11,760
a test called the quick view which is
 

1811
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,230
a test called the quick view which is
just

1812
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
just
 

1813
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,110
just
just this it's uh they've gotten rid of

1814
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,120
just this it's uh they've gotten rid of
 

1815
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,590
just this it's uh they've gotten rid of
all the

1816
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
all the
 

1817
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,269
all the
all the plastic and for people who are

1818
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
all the plastic and for people who are
 

1819
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,870
all the plastic and for people who are
just listening to this we're looking at

1820
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
just listening to this we're looking at
 

1821
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,990
just listening to this we're looking at
some very small

1822
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
some very small
 

1823
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,070
some very small
tests that fit in the palm of your hand

1824
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
tests that fit in the palm of your hand
 

1825
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,230
tests that fit in the palm of your hand
and they're basically paper strips

1826
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
and they're basically paper strips
 

1827
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,110
and they're basically paper strips
fit into different containers and that's

1828
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
fit into different containers and that's
 

1829
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,710
fit into different containers and that's
hence the comment about the plastic

1830
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
hence the comment about the plastic
 

1831
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,510
hence the comment about the plastic
containers

1832
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,520
containers
 

1833
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,990
containers
these are just injection molded i think

1834
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
these are just injection molded i think
 

1835
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,549
these are just injection molded i think
and uh

1836
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:32,559
and uh
 

1837
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,710
and uh
you got it they're um you know they can

1838
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:34,720
you got it they're um you know they can
 

1839
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,110
you got it they're um you know they can
build them at high numbers but then they

1840
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,120
build them at high numbers but then they
 

1841
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,230
build them at high numbers but then they
have to like place them in there

1842
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,240
have to like place them in there
 

1843
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,750
have to like place them in there
appropriately and all this stuff so it

1844
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760
appropriately and all this stuff so it
 

1845
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,149
appropriately and all this stuff so it
is a

1846
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:40,159
is a
 

1847
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,389
is a
it is a bottleneck or some somewhat of a

1848
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:42,399
it is a bottleneck or some somewhat of a
 

1849
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,149
it is a bottleneck or some somewhat of a
bottleneck in manufacturing

1850
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
bottleneck in manufacturing
 

1851
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,230
bottleneck in manufacturing
the actual bottleneck uh which the

1852
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
the actual bottleneck uh which the
 

1853
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,510
the actual bottleneck uh which the
government i think should use the

1854
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
government i think should use the
 

1855
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,750
government i think should use the
defense productions act to build up

1856
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
defense productions act to build up
 

1857
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,710
defense productions act to build up
is the there's a nitrocellulose membrane

1858
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:52,720
is the there's a nitrocellulose membrane
 

1859
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,310
is the there's a nitrocellulose membrane
laminated membrane on this

1860
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,320
laminated membrane on this
 

1861
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,310
laminated membrane on this
that allows uh the the material the the

1862
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
that allows uh the the material the the
 

1863
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,710
that allows uh the the material the the
the buffer and with the swab mixture to

1864
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
the buffer and with the swab mixture to
 

1865
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,149
the buffer and with the swab mixture to
flow across it

1866
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
flow across it
 

1867
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,509
flow across it
so the way these work they're called

1868
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519
so the way these work they're called
 

1869
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,830
so the way these work they're called
lateral flow tests and

1870
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
lateral flow tests and
 

1871
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,710
lateral flow tests and
you take a swab you swab the the front

1872
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:08,720
you take a swab you swab the the front
 

1873
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,909
you take a swab you swab the the front
of your nose

1874
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
of your nose
 

1875
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,870
of your nose
you dunk that swab into some buffer and

1876
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
you dunk that swab into some buffer and
 

1877
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,669
you dunk that swab into some buffer and
then you

1878
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:13,679
then you
 

1879
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,470
then you
put a couple drops of that buffer onto

1880
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
put a couple drops of that buffer onto
 

1881
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,549
put a couple drops of that buffer onto
the lateral flow and just like

1882
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:18,559
the lateral flow and just like
 

1883
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,549
the lateral flow and just like
paper if you dip a piece of paper into a

1884
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
paper if you dip a piece of paper into a
 

1885
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,669
paper if you dip a piece of paper into a
cup of water

1886
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:21,679
cup of water
 

1887
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,990
cup of water
though the paper will pull the water up

1888
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
though the paper will pull the water up
 

1889
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,269
though the paper will pull the water up
through capillary action this actually

1890
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:25,279
through capillary action this actually
 

1891
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,750
through capillary action this actually
works very similarly it flows

1892
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
works very similarly it flows
 

1893
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,590
works very similarly it flows
through somewhat a capillary action

1894
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:29,600
through somewhat a capillary action
 

1895
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,070
through somewhat a capillary action
through this nitrocellulose membrane

1896
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
through this nitrocellulose membrane
 

1897
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,750
through this nitrocellulose membrane
and there's little antibodies on there

1898
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
and there's little antibodies on there
 

1899
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,350
and there's little antibodies on there
these little proteins that are very

1900
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,360
these little proteins that are very
 

1901
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,590
these little proteins that are very
specific in this case for antigens or

1902
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:37,600
specific in this case for antigens or
 

1903
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,269
specific in this case for antigens or
proteins of the virus

1904
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
proteins of the virus
 

1905
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,830
proteins of the virus
so these are antibodies similar to how

1906
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:41,840
so these are antibodies similar to how
 

1907
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,310
so these are antibodies similar to how
to the antibodies that our body makes

1908
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
to the antibodies that our body makes
 

1909
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,070
to the antibodies that our body makes
from our immune system but they're just

1910
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
from our immune system but they're just
 

1911
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,230
from our immune system but they're just
printed on these um lateral flow tests

1912
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
printed on these um lateral flow tests
 

1913
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,830
printed on these um lateral flow tests
and they're printed just like a little

1914
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
and they're printed just like a little
 

1915
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,389
and they're printed just like a little
a line so then you you slice these all

1916
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:52,399
a line so then you you slice these all
 

1917
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,029
a line so then you you slice these all
up into

1918
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
up into
 

1919
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,909
up into
individual ones and if there's any virus

1920
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
individual ones and if there's any virus
 

1921
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,669
individual ones and if there's any virus
on that buffer as it flows across

1922
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:57,679
on that buffer as it flows across
 

1923
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,310
on that buffer as it flows across
the antibodies grab that virus and it

1924
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,320
the antibodies grab that virus and it
 

1925
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,149
the antibodies grab that virus and it
creates a little reaction with some

1926
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:02,159
creates a little reaction with some
 

1927
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,990
creates a little reaction with some
colloids in here that cause it to turn

1928
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
colloids in here that cause it to turn
 

1929
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,230
colloids in here that cause it to turn
dark just like a pregnancy test

1930
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,240
dark just like a pregnancy test
 

1931
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,190
dark just like a pregnancy test
um one line means negative it means a

1932
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,200
um one line means negative it means a
 

1933
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,990
um one line means negative it means a
control

1934
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
control
 

1935
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,950
control
strip worked and two lines mean positive

1936
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
strip worked and two lines mean positive
 

1937
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,389
strip worked and two lines mean positive
means uh

1938
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
means uh
 

1939
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,990
means uh
you know but if you get two lines it

1940
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,000
you know but if you get two lines it
 

1941
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,190
you know but if you get two lines it
just means you have virus there you're

1942
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,200
just means you have virus there you're
 

1943
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,630
just means you have virus there you're
very very likely to have virus there and

1944
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:18,640
very very likely to have virus there and
 

1945
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,350
very very likely to have virus there and
so

1946
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:19,360
so
 

1947
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,669
so
uh so they're super simple this is it is

1948
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:21,679
uh so they're super simple this is it is
 

1949
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,350
uh so they're super simple this is it is
the exact same technology as pregnancy

1950
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,360
the exact same technology as pregnancy
 

1951
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,830
the exact same technology as pregnancy
tests

1952
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,840
tests
 

1953
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,549
tests
it's uh the technology this particular

1954
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
it's uh the technology this particular
 

1955
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,750
it's uh the technology this particular
one from abbott

1956
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:27,760
one from abbott
 

1957
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,310
one from abbott
this has been used for other infectious

1958
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,320
this has been used for other infectious
 

1959
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,950
this has been used for other infectious
diseases

1960
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
diseases
 

1961
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,509
diseases
like malaria and and actually a number

1962
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:33,519
like malaria and and actually a number
 

1963
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,110
like malaria and and actually a number
of these companies have made malaria

1964
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,120
of these companies have made malaria
 

1965
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,509
of these companies have made malaria
tests that do the exact same thing so

1966
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:37,519
tests that do the exact same thing so
 

1967
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,269
tests that do the exact same thing so
they just co-opted their

1968
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:39,279
they just co-opted their
 

1969
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,149
they just co-opted their
the same form factor and uh and just

1970
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:42,159
the same form factor and uh and just
 

1971
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,230
the same form factor and uh and just
change the antibodies so it picks up

1972
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
change the antibodies so it picks up
 

1973
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,549
change the antibodies so it picks up
sars cof2 instead of other infections is

1974
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:46,559
sars cof2 instead of other infections is
 

1975
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,630
sars cof2 instead of other infections is
it also the abbott one is it also strip

1976
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:48,640
it also the abbott one is it also strip
 

1977
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,870
it also the abbott one is it also strip
yep yeah this abbott one here is uh

1978
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
yep yeah this abbott one here is uh
 

1979
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,310
yep yeah this abbott one here is uh
there's the in this case instead of

1980
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
there's the in this case instead of
 

1981
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,830
there's the in this case instead of
being put in a plastic sheath it's just

1982
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:53,840
being put in a plastic sheath it's just
 

1983
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,110
being put in a plastic sheath it's just
put in a cardboard thing and

1984
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120
put in a cardboard thing and
 

1985
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,750
put in a cardboard thing and
literally glued on i mean it's it looks

1986
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:57,760
literally glued on i mean it's it looks
 

1987
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,669
literally glued on i mean it's it looks
like nothing you know it's just

1988
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
like nothing you know it's just
 

1989
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,029
like nothing you know it's just
it looks like a like i mean it's just

1990
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:03,039
it looks like a like i mean it's just
 

1991
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,149
it looks like a like i mean it's just
the simplest thing you could

1992
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:04,159
the simplest thing you could
 

1993
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,750
the simplest thing you could
you could imagine the exterior packaging

1994
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
you could imagine the exterior packaging
 

1995
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,430
you could imagine the exterior packaging
looks very apple like this nice

1996
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
looks very apple like this nice
 

1997
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,149
looks very apple like this nice
it does yeah yeah yeah so it's nice and

1998
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159
it does yeah yeah yeah so it's nice and
 

1999
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,669
it does yeah yeah yeah so it's nice and
it comes in

2000
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:11,679
it comes in
 

2001
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,389
it comes in
this is the this is how they're packaged

2002
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
this is the this is how they're packaged
 

2003
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,470
this is the this is how they're packaged
you know so

2004
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,480
you know so
 

2005
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,830
you know so
and they don't have to you know this

2006
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,840
and they don't have to you know this
 

2007
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,830
and they don't have to you know this
these are coming in individual packages

2008
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:19,840
these are coming in individual packages
 

2009
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,230
these are coming in individual packages
against

2010
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,240
against
 

2011
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,830
against
again because they're really considered

2012
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:21,840
again because they're really considered
 

2013
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,990
again because they're really considered
individual medical devices

2014
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
individual medical devices
 

2015
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,669
individual medical devices
but you could package them in you know

2016
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:25,679
but you could package them in you know
 

2017
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,430
but you could package them in you know
bigger packets and stuff you you want to

2018
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,440
bigger packets and stuff you you want to
 

2019
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,950
bigger packets and stuff you you want to
be careful with humidity so they all

2020
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:28,960
be careful with humidity so they all
 

2021
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,990
be careful with humidity so they all
have a little

2022
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000
have a little
 

2023
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,350
have a little
um one of those humidity removing things

2024
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
um one of those humidity removing things
 

2025
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,870
um one of those humidity removing things
and oxygen removing things

2026
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
and oxygen removing things
 

2027
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,990
and oxygen removing things
um so that's that this is one class

2028
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
um so that's that this is one class
 

2029
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,710
um so that's that this is one class
these antigen tests if we could just

2030
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:40,720
these antigen tests if we could just
 

2031
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,470
these antigen tests if we could just
pause for a second if it's okay

2032
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,480
pause for a second if it's okay
 

2033
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,230
pause for a second if it's okay
and uh could you just briefly say

2034
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,240
and uh could you just briefly say
 

2035
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,310
and uh could you just briefly say
what is an antigen test and what other

2036
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,320
what is an antigen test and what other
 

2037
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,590
what is an antigen test and what other
tests there are out there like

2038
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:49,600
tests there are out there like
 

2039
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,870
tests there are out there like
categories of tests

2040
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
categories of tests
 

2041
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,350
categories of tests
sure just really quick so the testing

2042
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:53,360
sure just really quick so the testing
 

2043
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,029
sure just really quick so the testing
landscape is a little bit complicated

2044
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
landscape is a little bit complicated
 

2045
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:55,990
landscape is a little bit complicated
but it's

2046
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,000
but it's
 

2047
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,269
but it's
but i'll break it down there's really

2048
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:57,279
but i'll break it down there's really
 

2049
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,470
but i'll break it down there's really
just three major classes of tests

2050
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:00,480
just three major classes of tests
 

2051
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,630
just three major classes of tests
uh we'll start with the first two the

2052
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
uh we'll start with the first two the
 

2053
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,029
uh we'll start with the first two the
the first two tests are just

2054
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
the first two tests are just
 

2055
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,750
the first two tests are just
looking for the virus or looking for

2056
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:07,760
looking for the virus or looking for
 

2057
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,909
looking for the virus or looking for
antibodies against the virus

2058
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:09,919
antibodies against the virus
 

2059
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,470
antibodies against the virus
so we've heard about serology tests or

2060
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:12,480
so we've heard about serology tests or
 

2061
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,389
so we've heard about serology tests or
maybe some people have heard about it

2062
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:14,399
maybe some people have heard about it
 

2063
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,750
maybe some people have heard about it
those are a different kind of test

2064
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
those are a different kind of test
 

2065
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,510
those are a different kind of test
they're looking to

2066
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:17,520
they're looking to
 

2067
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,270
they're looking to
see has somebody in the past does

2068
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
see has somebody in the past does
 

2069
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,869
see has somebody in the past does
somebody have an immune response against

2070
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
somebody have an immune response against
 

2071
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,310
somebody have an immune response against
the virus which would indicate that they

2072
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,320
the virus which would indicate that they
 

2073
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,550
the virus which would indicate that they
were infected or exposed to it

2074
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
were infected or exposed to it
 

2075
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,310
were infected or exposed to it
so we're not talking about the antibody

2076
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,320
so we're not talking about the antibody
 

2077
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,790
so we're not talking about the antibody
test so i'll just leave it at that those

2078
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
test so i'll just leave it at that those
 

2079
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,270
test so i'll just leave it at that those
uh they actually can look very similar

2080
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,280
uh they actually can look very similar
 

2081
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,990
uh they actually can look very similar
to this or they can be done

2082
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,000
to this or they can be done
 

2083
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,149
to this or they can be done
in a laboratory those are usually done

2084
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:36,159
in a laboratory those are usually done
 

2085
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,430
in a laboratory those are usually done
from blood

2086
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:37,440
from blood
 

2087
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,109
from blood
and they're looking for an immune

2088
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119
and they're looking for an immune
 

2089
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,669
and they're looking for an immune
response to the virus so that's one

2090
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:41,679
response to the virus so that's one
 

2091
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,030
response to the virus so that's one
everything i'm talking about here is

2092
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,040
everything i'm talking about here is
 

2093
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,869
everything i'm talking about here is
looking for the virus itself not the

2094
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:44,879
looking for the virus itself not the
 

2095
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,790
looking for the virus itself not the
immune response to the virus

2096
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
immune response to the virus
 

2097
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,550
immune response to the virus
and so you there's two ways to look for

2098
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:48,560
and so you there's two ways to look for
 

2099
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,909
and so you there's two ways to look for
the virus you can either look for the

2100
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
the virus you can either look for the
 

2101
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,230
the virus you can either look for the
genetic code of the virus like the rna

2102
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,240
genetic code of the virus like the rna
 

2103
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,389
genetic code of the virus like the rna
just like the dna of somebody's human

2104
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:54,399
just like the dna of somebody's human
 

2105
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,270
just like the dna of somebody's human
cells

2106
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,280
cells
 

2107
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,790
cells
or you can look for the proteins

2108
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:56,800
or you can look for the proteins
 

2109
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,109
or you can look for the proteins
themselves the antigens of the prot of

2110
00:34:59,109 --> 00:34:59,119
themselves the antigens of the prot of
 

2111
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,790
themselves the antigens of the prot of
the virus so

2112
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:00,800
the virus so
 

2113
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,510
the virus so
i like to differentiate them if you were

2114
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,520
i like to differentiate them if you were
 

2115
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,470
i like to differentiate them if you were
a

2116
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:04,480
a
 

2117
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,750
a
a pcr test that looks for rna

2118
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:07,760
a pcr test that looks for rna
 

2119
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,069
a pcr test that looks for rna
in let's say let's say if we made it

2120
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:10,079
in let's say let's say if we made it
 

2121
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,510
in let's say let's say if we made it
against humans it would be looking for

2122
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:11,520
against humans it would be looking for
 

2123
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,190
against humans it would be looking for
the dna inside of our cells that would

2124
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,200
the dna inside of our cells that would
 

2125
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,069
the dna inside of our cells that would
be actually looking for our genetic code

2126
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:16,079
be actually looking for our genetic code
 

2127
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,109
be actually looking for our genetic code
uh the equivalent to an antigen test is

2128
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:19,119
uh the equivalent to an antigen test is
 

2129
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,390
uh the equivalent to an antigen test is
sort of a

2130
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
sort of a
 

2131
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,069
sort of a
a test that like actually is looking for

2132
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:22,079
a test that like actually is looking for
 

2133
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,069
a test that like actually is looking for
our eyes or our nose or physical

2134
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:24,079
our eyes or our nose or physical
 

2135
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,069
our eyes or our nose or physical
features of our body that would

2136
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079
features of our body that would
 

2137
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,109
features of our body that would
uh delineate okay this is this is uh

2138
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
uh delineate okay this is this is uh
 

2139
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,150
uh delineate okay this is this is uh
michael for example

2140
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,160
michael for example
 

2141
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,630
michael for example
in and so so you're either looking for

2142
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
in and so so you're either looking for
 

2143
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,230
in and so so you're either looking for
this a sequence or you're looking for a

2144
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240
this a sequence or you're looking for a
 

2145
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,349
this a sequence or you're looking for a
structure

2146
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:35,359
structure
 

2147
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,430
structure
uh the pcr test that a lot of people

2148
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
uh the pcr test that a lot of people
 

2149
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,589
uh the pcr test that a lot of people
have gotten now and they're done in labs

2150
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
have gotten now and they're done in labs
 

2151
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,470
have gotten now and they're done in labs
usually

2152
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
usually
 

2153
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,910
usually
are looking for the sequence of the

2154
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:41,920
are looking for the sequence of the
 

2155
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,510
are looking for the sequence of the
virus which is rna

2156
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520
virus which is rna
 

2157
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,150
virus which is rna
this test here by a company called

2158
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,160
this test here by a company called
 

2159
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,790
this test here by a company called
detect

2160
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800
detect
 

2161
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,390
detect
this is one of jonathan rothberg's

2162
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:48,400
this is one of jonathan rothberg's
 

2163
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,310
this is one of jonathan rothberg's
companies um

2164
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,320
companies um
 

2165
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,030
companies um
he's the guy who helped create modern

2166
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,040
he's the guy who helped create modern
 

2167
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,069
he's the guy who helped create modern
day sequencing

2168
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,079
day sequencing
 

2169
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,310
day sequencing
and all kinds of other things so this

2170
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:56,320
and all kinds of other things so this
 

2171
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,589
and all kinds of other things so this
detect device

2172
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:57,599
detect device
 

2173
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,030
detect device
that's the name of the company this is

2174
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
that's the name of the company this is
 

2175
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,990
that's the name of the company this is
actually a rapid rna detection device so

2176
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
actually a rapid rna detection device so
 

2177
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,670
actually a rapid rna detection device so
it's almost it's like a pcr-like

2178
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:03,680
it's almost it's like a pcr-like
 

2179
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,150
it's almost it's like a pcr-like
test and we could even do it here it's

2180
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,160
test and we could even do it here it's
 

2181
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,950
test and we could even do it here it's
really it's

2182
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
really it's
 

2183
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,950
really it's
it's a beautiful test in my opinion it

2184
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
it's a beautiful test in my opinion it
 

2185
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,710
it's a beautiful test in my opinion it
works exceedingly well

2186
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:10,720
works exceedingly well
 

2187
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,670
works exceedingly well
it's going to be a little bit more

2188
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
it's going to be a little bit more
 

2189
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,990
it's going to be a little bit more
expensive so i think it could confirm

2190
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,000
expensive so i think it could confirm
 

2191
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,829
expensive so i think it could confirm
could be used as a confirmatory test for

2192
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839
could be used as a confirmatory test for
 

2193
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,390
could be used as a confirmatory test for
these is there a greater accuracy to it

2194
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:18,400
these is there a greater accuracy to it
 

2195
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,870
these is there a greater accuracy to it
um yes i would say that there is a

2196
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:20,880
um yes i would say that there is a
 

2197
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,790
um yes i would say that there is a
greater accuracy there's also a downfall

2198
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
greater accuracy there's also a downfall
 

2199
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,829
greater accuracy there's also a downfall
though of pcr

2200
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:23,839
though of pcr
 

2201
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,510
though of pcr
and tests that look for rna they

2202
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,520
and tests that look for rna they
 

2203
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,550
and tests that look for rna they
can sometimes detect somebody uh who is

2204
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:30,560
can sometimes detect somebody uh who is
 

2205
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,230
can sometimes detect somebody uh who is
no longer infectious

2206
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
no longer infectious
 

2207
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,990
no longer infectious
so you have the the rna test then you

2208
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,000
so you have the the rna test then you
 

2209
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,589
so you have the the rna test then you
have these antigen tests

2210
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:35,599
have these antigen tests
 

2211
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,670
have these antigen tests
the antigen tests look for structures

2212
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:37,680
the antigen tests look for structures
 

2213
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,430
the antigen tests look for structures
but they're generally only going to turn

2214
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,440
but they're generally only going to turn
 

2215
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,589
but they're generally only going to turn
positive if people have actively

2216
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:41,599
positive if people have actively
 

2217
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,550
positive if people have actively
replicating virus in them

2218
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:44,560
replicating virus in them
 

2219
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,270
replicating virus in them
and so what happens after an infection

2220
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
and so what happens after an infection
 

2221
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,790
and so what happens after an infection
dissipates

2222
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:48,800
dissipates
 

2223
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,950
dissipates
you have you've just gone from having

2224
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
you have you've just gone from having
 

2225
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,230
you have you've just gone from having
sort of a spike so

2226
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,240
sort of a spike so
 

2227
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,750
sort of a spike so
if you get infected maybe three days

2228
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:53,760
if you get infected maybe three days
 

2229
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,589
if you get infected maybe three days
later the virus gets into exponential

2230
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:55,599
later the virus gets into exponential
 

2231
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,790
later the virus gets into exponential
growth

2232
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:56,800
growth
 

2233
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,030
growth
and it can replicate to trillions of

2234
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
and it can replicate to trillions of
 

2235
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,270
and it can replicate to trillions of
viruses inside the body

2236
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:01,280
viruses inside the body
 

2237
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,270
viruses inside the body
your immune system then kind of tackles

2238
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:03,280
your immune system then kind of tackles
 

2239
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,430
your immune system then kind of tackles
it and beats it down to nothing

2240
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,440
it and beats it down to nothing
 

2241
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,829
it and beats it down to nothing
but what ends up in the wake of that you

2242
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:07,839
but what ends up in the wake of that you
 

2243
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,589
but what ends up in the wake of that you
just had a battle you had this massive

2244
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:09,599
just had a battle you had this massive
 

2245
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,270
just had a battle you had this massive
battle that just took place inside your

2246
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,280
battle that just took place inside your
 

2247
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,510
battle that just took place inside your
upper respiratory tract

2248
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:13,520
upper respiratory tract
 

2249
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,589
upper respiratory tract
and because of that you've had trillions

2250
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:15,599
and because of that you've had trillions
 

2251
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,430
and because of that you've had trillions
and trillions of viruses

2252
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
and trillions of viruses
 

2253
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,630
and trillions of viruses
go to zero essentially but the rna

2254
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
go to zero essentially but the rna
 

2255
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,950
go to zero essentially but the rna
is still there it's just these remnants

2256
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:22,960
is still there it's just these remnants
 

2257
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,069
is still there it's just these remnants
in the same way that if you go to a

2258
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:24,079
in the same way that if you go to a
 

2259
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,670
in the same way that if you go to a
crime scene and blood was

2260
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
crime scene and blood was
 

2261
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,750
crime scene and blood was
was was sort of spread all over the

2262
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:27,760
was was sort of spread all over the
 

2263
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,710
was was sort of spread all over the
crime scene

2264
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:28,720
crime scene
 

2265
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,550
crime scene
you're going to find a lot of dna

2266
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:30,560
you're going to find a lot of dna
 

2267
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,150
you're going to find a lot of dna
there's tons of dna there's no people

2268
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
there's tons of dna there's no people
 

2269
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,349
there's tons of dna there's no people
anymore

2270
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:33,359
anymore
 

2271
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,430
anymore
but there's a lot of dna there same

2272
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,440
but there's a lot of dna there same
 

2273
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,710
but there's a lot of dna there same
thing happens here and so what's

2274
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
thing happens here and so what's
 

2275
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,470
thing happens here and so what's
happening with pcr testing

2276
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:38,480
happening with pcr testing
 

2277
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,750
happening with pcr testing
is when people go and use these

2278
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
is when people go and use these
 

2279
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,670
is when people go and use these
exceedingly high

2280
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
exceedingly high
 

2281
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,630
exceedingly high
sensitivity pcr tests people will stay

2282
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
sensitivity pcr tests people will stay
 

2283
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,829
sensitivity pcr tests people will stay
positive for

2284
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:45,839
positive for
 

2285
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,750
positive for
weeks or months after their infection

2286
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:47,760
weeks or months after their infection
 

2287
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,589
weeks or months after their infection
has subsided

2288
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:49,599
has subsided
 

2289
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,109
has subsided
which has caused a lot of problems in my

2290
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:51,119
which has caused a lot of problems in my
 

2291
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,430
which has caused a lot of problems in my
opinion it's problems that the cdc and

2292
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
opinion it's problems that the cdc and
 

2293
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,510
opinion it's problems that the cdc and
the fda and doctors don't want to deal

2294
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
the fda and doctors don't want to deal
 

2295
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,630
the fda and doctors don't want to deal
with

2296
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:56,640
with
 

2297
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,150
with
but i've tried to publish on it i've

2298
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,160
but i've tried to publish on it i've
 

2299
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,990
but i've tried to publish on it i've
tried to you know

2300
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,000
tried to you know
 

2301
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,910
tried to you know
suggest that this is an issue both to

2302
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:01,920
suggest that this is an issue both to
 

2303
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,270
suggest that this is an issue both to
new york times and others and now it's

2304
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,280
new york times and others and now it's
 

2305
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,990
new york times and others and now it's
unfortunately

2306
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,000
unfortunately
 

2307
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,510
unfortunately
kind of taken on a life of its own of

2308
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
kind of taken on a life of its own of
 

2309
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,750
kind of taken on a life of its own of
conspiracy theorists thinking no

2310
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:07,760
conspiracy theorists thinking no
 

2311
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,230
conspiracy theorists thinking no
um they call it a case stomach they say

2312
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,240
um they call it a case stomach they say
 

2313
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,069
um they call it a case stomach they say
oh you know pcr is

2314
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:12,079
oh you know pcr is
 

2315
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,069
oh you know pcr is
it's detecting people who are no longer

2316
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:14,079
it's detecting people who are no longer
 

2317
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,990
it's detecting people who are no longer
who are right false positive but they're

2318
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:16,000
who are right false positive but they're
 

2319
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,390
who are right false positive but they're
not false positives they're

2320
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:18,400
not false positives they're
 

2321
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,990
not false positives they're
they're late positives no longer

2322
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,000
they're late positives no longer
 

2323
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,510
they're late positives no longer
transmissible i think the way you

2324
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,520
transmissible i think the way you
 

2325
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,030
transmissible i think the way you
uh like what i saw on rapid tests.org

2326
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,040
uh like what i saw on rapid tests.org
 

2327
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,390
uh like what i saw on rapid tests.org
i really like the distinction between

2328
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
i really like the distinction between
 

2329
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,910
i really like the distinction between
diagnostic sensitivity and

2330
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:27,920
diagnostic sensitivity and
 

2331
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,990
diagnostic sensitivity and
contagiousness sensitivity

2332
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
contagiousness sensitivity
 

2333
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,109
contagiousness sensitivity
that's it's so

2334
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,119
that's it's so
 

2335
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,230
that's it's so
that website is so obvious uh

2336
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:36,240
that website is so obvious uh
 

2337
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,150
that website is so obvious uh
that it's painful because it's like yeah

2338
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
that it's painful because it's like yeah
 

2339
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,910
that it's painful because it's like yeah
that's what we should be talking about

2340
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:39,920
that's what we should be talking about
 

2341
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,030
that's what we should be talking about
is

2342
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040
is
 

2343
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,950
is
how accurately is the test able to

2344
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:42,960
how accurately is the test able to
 

2345
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,069
how accurately is the test able to
detect

2346
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:44,079
detect
 

2347
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,550
detect
your contagiousness and you have

2348
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,560
your contagiousness and you have
 

2349
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,990
your contagiousness and you have
different plots that show that

2350
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,000
different plots that show that
 

2351
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,510
different plots that show that
actually there's you know um

2352
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:51,520
actually there's you know um
 

2353
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,430
actually there's you know um
that antigen test the tests we're

2354
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,440
that antigen test the tests we're
 

2355
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,510
that antigen test the tests we're
looking at today like rapid tests

2356
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:55,520
looking at today like rapid tests
 

2357
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,950
looking at today like rapid tests
actually really good at detecting

2358
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:56,960
actually really good at detecting
 

2359
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,190
actually really good at detecting
contagiousness absolutely

2360
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,200
contagiousness absolutely
 

2361
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,510
contagiousness absolutely
it all mixes back with this whole idea

2362
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:01,520
it all mixes back with this whole idea
 

2363
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,310
it all mixes back with this whole idea
that

2364
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
that
 

2365
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,470
that
of the medical industrial complex you

2366
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,480
of the medical industrial complex you
 

2367
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,670
of the medical industrial complex you
know in this country

2368
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:05,680
know in this country
 

2369
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,550
know in this country
and in most countries we have almost

2370
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:08,560
and in most countries we have almost
 

2371
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,870
and in most countries we have almost
entirely defunded

2372
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:10,880
entirely defunded
 

2373
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,829
entirely defunded
and devalued public health period you

2374
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:13,839
and devalued public health period you
 

2375
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,589
and devalued public health period you
know we just we just have

2376
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:15,599
know we just we just have
 

2377
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,190
know we just we just have
and uh and what that means is that

2378
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,200
and uh and what that means is that
 

2379
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,670
and uh and what that means is that
we don't even we don't have a language

2380
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:21,680
we don't even we don't have a language
 

2381
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,349
we don't even we don't have a language
for it we don't have a lexicon for it we

2382
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:23,359
for it we don't have a lexicon for it we
 

2383
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,750
for it we don't have a lexicon for it we
don't have a regulatory landscape for it

2384
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
don't have a regulatory landscape for it
 

2385
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,069
don't have a regulatory landscape for it
and so the only window we have to look

2386
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:28,079
and so the only window we have to look
 

2387
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:28,950
and so the only window we have to look
at a test

2388
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:28,960
at a test
 

2389
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,710
at a test
today is as a medical diagnostic test

2390
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
today is as a medical diagnostic test
 

2391
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,230
today is as a medical diagnostic test
and and that becomes very problematic

2392
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,240
and and that becomes very problematic
 

2393
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,310
and and that becomes very problematic
when we're trying to tackle

2394
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,320
when we're trying to tackle
 

2395
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,630
when we're trying to tackle
a public health threat in a public

2396
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:40,640
a public health threat in a public
 

2397
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,990
a public health threat in a public
health emergency

2398
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,000
health emergency
 

2399
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,829
health emergency
by definition and this is a public

2400
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
by definition and this is a public
 

2401
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,750
by definition and this is a public
health emergency that we're in

2402
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:45,760
health emergency that we're in
 

2403
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,790
health emergency that we're in
and yet we keep evaluating tests

2404
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,800
and yet we keep evaluating tests
 

2405
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,829
and yet we keep evaluating tests
as though the diagnostic benchmark is

2406
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:51,839
as though the diagnostic benchmark is
 

2407
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,589
as though the diagnostic benchmark is
the gold standard where if i'm a

2408
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:53,599
the gold standard where if i'm a
 

2409
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,310
the gold standard where if i'm a
physician

2410
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:54,320
physician
 

2411
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,270
physician
i am a physician so i'll put on that

2412
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,280
i am a physician so i'll put on that
 

2413
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,109
i am a physician so i'll put on that
physician hat for a moment

2414
00:39:59,109 --> 00:39:59,119
physician hat for a moment
 

2415
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,950
physician hat for a moment
and if i have a doc if i have a patient

2416
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:00,960
and if i have a doc if i have a patient
 

2417
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,950
and if i have a doc if i have a patient
who comes to me and wants to

2418
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:02,960
who comes to me and wants to
 

2419
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,670
who comes to me and wants to
uh know if their symptoms are a result

2420
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,680
uh know if their symptoms are a result
 

2421
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,790
uh know if their symptoms are a result
of them

2422
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
of them
 

2423
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,589
of them
having covid then i want every shred of

2424
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:09,599
having covid then i want every shred of
 

2425
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,069
having covid then i want every shred of
evidence

2426
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:10,079
evidence
 

2427
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,309
evidence
that i can get to see does this person

2428
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:12,319
that i can get to see does this person
 

2429
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,950
that i can get to see does this person
currently or did they recently have

2430
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:14,960
currently or did they recently have
 

2431
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,230
currently or did they recently have
this infection inside of them and so in

2432
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,240
this infection inside of them and so in
 

2433
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,109
this infection inside of them and so in
that sense

2434
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
that sense
 

2435
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,430
that sense
the pcr test is the perfect test it's

2436
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,440
the pcr test is the perfect test it's
 

2437
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,950
the pcr test is the perfect test it's
really sensitive

2438
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
really sensitive
 

2439
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,870
really sensitive
it will find the rna if it's there at

2440
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:24,880
it will find the rna if it's there at
 

2441
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,710
it will find the rna if it's there at
all so that i could say you know

2442
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:26,720
all so that i could say you know
 

2443
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,870
all so that i could say you know
yeah you have a low amount of rna left

2444
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:28,880
yeah you have a low amount of rna left
 

2445
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,990
yeah you have a low amount of rna left
you might have been

2446
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,000
you might have been
 

2447
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,589
you might have been
you said your symptoms started two weeks

2448
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
you said your symptoms started two weeks
 

2449
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,069
you said your symptoms started two weeks
ago you probably

2450
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079
ago you probably
 

2451
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,470
ago you probably
were infectious two weeks ago and and

2452
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
were infectious two weeks ago and and
 

2453
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,950
were infectious two weeks ago and and
you have lingering symptoms from it

2454
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:38,960
you have lingering symptoms from it
 

2455
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,589
you have lingering symptoms from it
but that's a that's a medical diagnosis

2456
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
but that's a that's a medical diagnosis
 

2457
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,589
but that's a that's a medical diagnosis
it's kind of like a detective recreating

2458
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:43,599
it's kind of like a detective recreating
 

2459
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,630
it's kind of like a detective recreating
a crime scene

2460
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
a crime scene
 

2461
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,510
a crime scene
they want to go back there and re re

they want to go back there and re re

00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:49,359
create the pieces so that they can
 

2465
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,790
create the pieces so that they can
um assign blame or whatever it might be

2466
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:52,800
um assign blame or whatever it might be
 

2467
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,150
um assign blame or whatever it might be
but that's not public health in public

2468
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,160
but that's not public health in public
 

2469
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,990
but that's not public health in public
health we need to only look forward

we don't want to go back and say well

00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
we don't want to go back and say well
 

2473
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,589
we don't want to go back and say well
was this person are there symptoms

2474
00:40:59,589 --> 00:40:59,599
was this person are there symptoms
 

2475
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,030
was this person are there symptoms
because they had an infection two weeks

2476
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040
because they had an infection two weeks
 

2477
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,829
because they had an infection two weeks
ago

2478
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:01,839
ago
 

2479
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,230

in public health we just want to stop

2480
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,240
in public health we just want to stop
 

2481
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,829
in public health we just want to stop
the virus from spreading to the next

2482
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:05,839
the virus from spreading to the next
 

2483
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,990
the virus from spreading to the next
person and so that's where

2484
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,000
person and so that's where
 

2485
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,390
person and so that's where
we don't care if somebody was infected

2486
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,400
we don't care if somebody was infected
 

2487
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,670
we don't care if somebody was infected
two weeks ago

00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:11,680
two weeks ago
 

2489
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,589
two weeks ago
we only care about finding the people

2490
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
we only care about finding the people
 

2491
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,990
we only care about finding the people
who are infectious today

2492
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,000
who are infectious today
 

2493
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,950
who are infectious today
and unfortunately our regulatory

fails to apply that knowledge

fails to apply that knowledge
 

2499
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,829
fails to apply that knowledge
to evaluate these tests as public health

2500
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:25,839
to evaluate these tests as public health
 

2501
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,910
to evaluate these tests as public health
tools they're only evaluating the tests

2502
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
tools they're only evaluating the tests
 

2503
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,030
tools they're only evaluating the tests
as medical tools and therefore we get

2504
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,040
as medical tools and therefore we get
 

2505
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,150
as medical tools and therefore we get
all kinds of

2506
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,160
all kinds of
 

2507
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,109
all kinds of
complaints that say this test which

2508
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:35,119
complaints that say this test which
 

2509
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,030
complaints that say this test which
detects 99

2510
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,040
detects 99
 

2511
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,230
detects 99
plus you know 99.8 percent of of current

2512
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,240
plus you know 99.8 percent of of current
 

2513
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,150
plus you know 99.8 percent of of current
infectious people

2514
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,160
infectious people
 

2515
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,589
infectious people
uh on by the fda's rubric they'll say no

2516
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:45,599
uh on by the fda's rubric they'll say no
 

2517
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,230
uh on by the fda's rubric they'll say no
no that's

2518
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,240
no that's
 

2519
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,630
no that's
it's only 50 percent sensitive and

2520
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
it's only 50 percent sensitive and
 

2521
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,230
it's only 50 percent sensitive and
that's because when you go out into the

2522
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
that's because when you go out into the
 

2523
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,990
that's because when you go out into the
world and you just compare this against

2524
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,000
world and you just compare this against
 

2525
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,829
world and you just compare this against
pcr positivity

2526
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:53,839
pcr positivity
 

2527
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,150
pcr positivity
most people who are pc are positive in

2528
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,160
most people who are pc are positive in
 

2529
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,309
most people who are pc are positive in
the world right now at any given time

2530
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,319
the world right now at any given time
 

2531
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,190
the world right now at any given time
are post infectious they're no longer

2532
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,200
are post infectious they're no longer
 

2533
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,069
are post infectious they're no longer
infectious because

2534
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:02,079
infectious because
 

2535
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,990
infectious because
you you might only be infectious for

2536
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
you you might only be infectious for
 

2537
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,230
you you might only be infectious for
five days but then you'll remain pcr

2538
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,240
five days but then you'll remain pcr
 

2539
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,349
five days but then you'll remain pcr
positive for

2540
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:07,359
positive for
 

2541
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,670
positive for
three or four or five weeks and so when

2542
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:09,680
three or four or five weeks and so when
 

2543
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,510
three or four or five weeks and so when
you go and just evaluate these tests and

2544
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:11,520
you go and just evaluate these tests and
 

2545
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,069
you go and just evaluate these tests and
you say okay this person's pcr positive

2546
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079
you say okay this person's pcr positive
 

2547
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,190
you say okay this person's pcr positive
does the rapid antigen test detect that

2548
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,200
does the rapid antigen test detect that
 

2549
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,750
does the rapid antigen test detect that
more often than not it's no but that's

2550
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
more often than not it's no but that's
 

2551
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,270
more often than not it's no but that's
because those people

2552
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
because those people
 

2553
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,030
because those people
don't need isolation you know they

2554
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
don't need isolation you know they
 

2555
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,510
don't need isolation you know they
they're post infectious and this is a

2556
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:25,520
they're post infectious and this is a
 

2557
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,150
they're post infectious and this is a
it's become much more of a problem than

2558
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160
it's become much more of a problem than
 

2559
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,790
it's become much more of a problem than
i think

2560
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:28,800
i think
 

2561
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,630
i think
uh even the fda themselves is

2562
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,640
uh even the fda themselves is
 

2563
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,950
uh even the fda themselves is
recognizing because they are unwilling

2564
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
recognizing because they are unwilling
 

2565
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,309
recognizing because they are unwilling
at this point to to look at this as a

2566
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:36,319
at this point to to look at this as a
 

2567
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,910
at this point to to look at this as a
public health problem requiring public

2568
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:37,920
public health problem requiring public
 

2569
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,870
public health problem requiring public
health tools

2570
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:38,880
health tools
 

2571
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,910
health tools
we'll definitely talk about this a

2572
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
we'll definitely talk about this a
 

2573
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,390
we'll definitely talk about this a
little bit more because the concern i

2574
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
little bit more because the concern i
 

2575
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,150
little bit more because the concern i
have is that like a bigger

2576
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
have is that like a bigger
 

2577
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,910
have is that like a bigger
pandemic comes along what are the

2578
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
pandemic comes along what are the
 

2579
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,670
pandemic comes along what are the
lessons we draw from this and how we

2580
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:47,680
lessons we draw from this and how we
 

2581
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,589
lessons we draw from this and how we
move forward let's talk about that in a

2582
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:49,599
move forward let's talk about that in a
 

2583
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,150
move forward let's talk about that in a
bit

2584
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,160
bit
 

2585
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,670
bit
but sort of can we can we discuss

2586
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:53,680
but sort of can we can we discuss
 

2587
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,589
but sort of can we can we discuss
further delay of the land here of the

2588
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:55,599
further delay of the land here of the
 

2589
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,069
further delay of the land here of the
different

2590
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
different
 

2591
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,390
different
tests before us absolutely so i talked

2592
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400
tests before us absolutely so i talked
 

2593
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,390
tests before us absolutely so i talked
about pcr tests and those are done in

2594
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
about pcr tests and those are done in
 

2595
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,030
about pcr tests and those are done in
the lab

2596
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,040
the lab
 

2597
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,230
the lab
or they're done essentially with with a

2598
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:04,240
or they're done essentially with with a
 

2599
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,150
or they're done essentially with with a
rapid test like this the detect and we

2600
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,160
rapid test like this the detect and we
 

2601
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,910
rapid test like this the detect and we
can even try this in a moment

2602
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
can even try this in a moment
 

2603
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,829
can even try this in a moment
it goes into a little heater so you

2604
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:09,839
it goes into a little heater so you
 

2605
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,430
it goes into a little heater so you
might have one of these in a household

2606
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:11,440
might have one of these in a household
 

2607
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,230
might have one of these in a household
or

2608
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,240
or
 

2609
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,589
or
one of these in a nursing home or

2610
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:13,599
one of these in a nursing home or
 

2611
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,470
one of these in a nursing home or
something like that or in an airport

2612
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,480
something like that or in an airport
 

2613
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,470
something like that or in an airport
or you could have one that has 100

2614
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:18,480
or you could have one that has 100
 

2615
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,230
or you could have one that has 100
different outlets this is just to heat

2616
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:20,240
different outlets this is just to heat
 

2617
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,430
different outlets this is just to heat
the tube up

2618
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440
the tube up
 

2619
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,589
the tube up
these are the rapid tests they are super

2620
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:23,599
these are the rapid tests they are super
 

2621
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,950
these are the rapid tests they are super
simple

2622
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:24,960
simple
 

2623
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,710
simple
no frills you just swab your nose and uh

2624
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
no frills you just swab your nose and uh
 

2625
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,109
no frills you just swab your nose and uh
you put the swab into a buffer and you

2626
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
you put the swab into a buffer and you
 

2627
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,790
you put the swab into a buffer and you
put the buffer on the test so we can use

2628
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:32,800
put the buffer on the test so we can use
 

2629
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,470
put the buffer on the test so we can use
these right now if you want yeah and we

2630
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:34,480
these right now if you want yeah and we
 

2631
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,910
these right now if you want yeah and we
can try it out and all the tests we're

2632
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:35,920
can try it out and all the tests we're
 

2633
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,870
can try it out and all the tests we're
talking about

2634
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:36,880
talking about
 

2635
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,990
talking about
they're usually swabbing the nose

2636
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,000
they're usually swabbing the nose
 

2637
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,630
they're usually swabbing the nose
like that's the that's still that i mean

2638
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:42,640
like that's the that's still that i mean
 

2639
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,430
like that's the that's still that i mean
yeah

2640
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,440
yeah
 

2641
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,990
yeah
there are some saliva tests coming about

2642
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,000
there are some saliva tests coming about
 

2643
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,670
there are some saliva tests coming about
and they these can all work potentially

2644
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:47,680
and they these can all work potentially
 

2645
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,870
and they these can all work potentially
with saliva they just have to be

2646
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:48,880
with saliva they just have to be
 

2647
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,150
with saliva they just have to be
recalibrated

2648
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
recalibrated
 

2649
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,230
recalibrated
uh but these these swabs are really not

2650
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,240
uh but these these swabs are really not
 

2651
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,550
uh but these these swabs are really not
bad this isn't the

bad this isn't the
 

2653
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,270
bad this isn't the
the deep swab that goes like way back uh

2654
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:57,280
the deep swab that goes like way back uh
 

2655
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,109
the deep swab that goes like way back uh
into your nose or anything this is just

2656
00:43:59,109 --> 00:43:59,119
into your nose or anything this is just
 

2657
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,069
into your nose or anything this is just
the

2658
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079

00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:06,800
mind if i sure yeah
 

2667
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,150
mind if i sure yeah
yeah why don't we start with this one

2668
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
yeah why don't we start with this one
 

2669
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,670
yeah why don't we start with this one
because this is uh this is abbott's

2670
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:09,680
because this is uh this is abbott's
 

2671
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,670
because this is uh this is abbott's
binex now test and it's really it's

2672
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:11,680
binex now test and it's really it's
 

2673
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,030
binex now test and it's really it's
pretty simple

2674
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,040
pretty simple
 

2675
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,829
pretty simple
this is this the swab from the abba test

2676
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
this is this the swab from the abba test
 

2677
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,270
this is this the swab from the abba test
that's correct that's the swab from the

2678
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
that's correct that's the swab from the
 

2679
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,550
that's correct that's the swab from the
abba test

2680
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,560
abba test
 

2681
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,990
abba test
so what i'm going to do to start is i'm

2682
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,000
so what i'm going to do to start is i'm
 

2683
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,030
so what i'm going to do to start is i'm
going to take this buffer here which is

2684
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,040
going to take this buffer here which is
 

2685
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,950
going to take this buffer here which is
uh this is just the buffer that goes on

2686
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
uh this is just the buffer that goes on
 

2687
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,870
uh this is just the buffer that goes on
to this test so this is a brand new one

2688
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:28,880
to this test so this is a brand new one
 

2689
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,750
to this test so this is a brand new one
i just opened this

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,870
this test out i'm going to just take six
drops of this buffer

2694
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
drops of this buffer
 

2695
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,069
drops of this buffer
and put it right onto this test here

2696
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,079

 

2697
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,510

two three four five six
okay and now you're going to take that

2700
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:45,839
okay and now you're going to take that
 

2701
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,069
okay and now you're going to take that
swab open it up

2702
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:48,079
swab open it up
 

2703
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,710
swab open it up
yep and now just wipe it around inside

2704
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:50,720
yep and now just wipe it around inside

i'm getting emotional hold it parallel
 

2719
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,990
i'm getting emotional hold it parallel
to the test so put the test down on the

2720
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,000
to the test so put the test down on the
 

2721
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,829
to the test so put the test down on the
table yep and then go into that bottom

2722
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:17,839
table yep and then go into that bottom
 

2723
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,030
table yep and then go into that bottom
hole

2724
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,040
hole
 

2725
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,030
hole
yep and push forward so you can start to

2726
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
yep and push forward so you can start to
 

2727
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,790
yep and push forward so you can start to
see it in the other hole

2728
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:22,800
see it in the other hole
 

2729
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,870
see it in the other hole
there you go now turn if it's once it

2730
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:24,880
there you go now turn if it's once it
 

2731
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,550
there you go now turn if it's once it
hits up against the top

2732
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:26,560
hits up against the top
 

2733
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,870
hits up against the top
just turn it uh three times one two

2734
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:28,880
just turn it uh three times one two
 

2735
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,630
just turn it uh three times one two
three and sort of

2736

now what we will see uh
 

2749
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,270
now what we will see uh
is we will see a line form

2750
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,280
is we will see a line form
 

2751
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,670
is we will see a line form
what's happening now is the the buffer

2752
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:53,680
what's happening now is the the buffer
 

2753
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,349
what's happening now is the the buffer
that you put in there

2754
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
that you put in there
 

2755
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,349
that you put in there
is uh now uh moving up onto the paper

2756
00:45:59,349 --> 00:45:59,359
is uh now uh moving up onto the paper
 

2757
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,430
is uh now uh moving up onto the paper
strip test and it has the material from

2758
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:03,440
strip test and it has the material from
 

2759
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,790
strip test and it has the material from
the swab in there

2760
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:04,800
the swab in there
 

2761
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,309
the swab in there
and so what we'll see is a line will

2762
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,319
and so what we'll see is a line will
 

2763
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,710
and so what we'll see is a line will
form and that's going to be the control

2764
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:08,720
form and that's going to be the control
 

2765
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,150
form and that's going to be the control
line

2766
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,160
line
 

2767
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,069
line
and then we'll also see the the

2768
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:14,079
and then we'll also see the the
 

2769
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,230
and then we'll also see the the
ideally we'll see no line for the actual

2770
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:16,240
ideally we'll see no line for the actual
 

2771
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,430
ideally we'll see no line for the actual
test line

2772
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:17,440
test line
 

2773
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,589
test line
and that's because you should be

2774
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:19,599
and that's because you should be
 

2775
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,430
and that's because you should be
negative so one line will be positive

2776
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,440
negative so one line will be positive
 

2777
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:21,750
negative so one line will be positive
and

2778
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:21,760
and
 

2779
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,390
and
two lines will be negative it's very

2780
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:24,400
two lines will be negative it's very
 

2781
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,309
two lines will be negative it's very
cool there's this uh purple thing

2782
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:26,319
cool there's this uh purple thing
 

2783
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,630
cool there's this uh purple thing
creeping up

2784
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:28,640
creeping up
 

2785
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,230
creeping up
onto the control line that's perfect

2786
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
onto the control line that's perfect
 

2787
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,030
onto the control line that's perfect
that's what you want to be seeing

2788
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
that's what you want to be seeing
 

2789
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,790
that's what you want to be seeing
so you want to see that so right now you

2790
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:38,800
so you want to see that so right now you
 

2791
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,950
so you want to see that so right now you
essentially want to see

2792
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:40,960
essentially want to see
 

2793
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,829
essentially want to see
that that blue line turns pink or

2794
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:43,839
that that blue line turns pink or
 

2795
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,109
that that blue line turns pink or
purpley

2796
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:45,119

2801
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,270

it should turn sort of a purple pink

2802
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:51,280
it should turn sort of a purple pink
 

2803
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,550
it should turn sort of a purple pink

00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:47,359
positive
 

2915
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,030
positive
so if one's falsely positive and the

2916
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,040
so if one's falsely positive and the
 

2917
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,390
so if one's falsely positive and the
other one is negative

2918
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,400
other one is negative
 

2919
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,829
other one is negative
especially because this one's more

2920
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:51,839
especially because this one's more
 

2921
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,589
especially because this one's more
sensitive uh

2922
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:53,599
sensitive uh
 

2923
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,829
sensitive uh
then i would trust this as a

2924
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:55,839
then i would trust this as a
 

2925
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,670
then i would trust this as a
confirmatory test if this one's negative

2926
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:57,680
confirmatory test if this one's negative
 

2927
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,790
confirmatory test if this one's negative
then

2928
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:58,800
then
 

2929
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,549
then
the antigen test you know would be

2930
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:00,559
the antigen test you know would be
 

2931
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,069
the antigen test you know would be
considered falsely positive

2932
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:02,079
considered falsely positive
 

2933
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,670
considered falsely positive
it does look like there's only a single

2934
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:03,680
it does look like there's only a single
 

2935
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,430
it does look like there's only a single
line so this is very exciting news

2936
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
line so this is very exciting news
 

2937
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,950
line so this is very exciting news
that's right yep it says wait 15 minutes

2938
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:08,960
that's right yep it says wait 15 minutes
 

2939
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,430
that's right yep it says wait 15 minutes
to see

2940
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,440
to see
 

2941
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,910
to see
both lines but in general if somebody's

2942
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:11,920
both lines but in general if somebody's
 

2943
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,910
both lines but in general if somebody's
really going to be positive

2944
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:13,920
really going to be positive
 

2945
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,510
really going to be positive
that line starts showing up within a

2946
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:15,520
that line starts showing up within a
 

2947
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,950
that line starts showing up within a
minute or two um

2948
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:16,960
minute or two um
 

2949
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,710
minute or two um
so you want to keep the whole we'll keep

2950
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:18,720
so you want to keep the whole we'll keep
 

2951
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,390
so you want to keep the whole we'll keep
watching it for the whole 15 minutes as

2952
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:20,400
watching it for the whole 15 minutes as
 

2953
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,670
watching it for the whole 15 minutes as
it's sitting there but

2954
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
it's sitting there but
 

2955
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,829
it's sitting there but
uh i would say you're knowing that

2956
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:23,839
uh i would say you're knowing that
 

2957
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,750
uh i would say you're knowing that
you've had pcr tests recently

2958
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:25,760
you've had pcr tests recently
 

2959
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,349
you've had pcr tests recently
and all that you know the odds are

2960
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,359
and all that you know the odds are
 

2961
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,829
and all that you know the odds are
pretty good odds are very packaging very

2962
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:29,839
pretty good odds are very packaging very
 

2963
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:30,950
pretty good odds are very packaging very
iphone like i'm

2964
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
iphone like i'm
 

2965
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,670
iphone like i'm
i'm i'm digging this sexy packaging i'm

2966
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:33,680
i'm i'm digging this sexy packaging i'm
 

2967
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,829
i'm i'm digging this sexy packaging i'm
a sucker for good packaging okay

2968
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:35,839
a sucker for good packaging okay
 

2969
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,349
a sucker for good packaging okay
so then there's this there's this test

2970
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:37,359
so then there's this there's this test
 

2971
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,030
so then there's this there's this test
here which is you know

2972
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040
here which is you know
 

2973
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,349
here which is you know
this is another you know it's funny this

2974
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
this is another you know it's funny this
 

2975
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,030
this is another you know it's funny this
let me open this up and show you this is

2976
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,040
let me open this up and show you this is
 

2977
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,190
let me open this up and show you this is
a really nice test it's another antigen

2978
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,200
a really nice test it's another antigen
 

2979
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,950
a really nice test it's another antigen
test works the exact same way as this

2980
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
test works the exact same way as this
 

2981
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,030
test works the exact same way as this
essentially but what you can see is it's

2982
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,040
essentially but what you can see is it's
 

2983
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,309
essentially but what you can see is it's
got like

2984
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
got like
 

2985
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,829
got like
lights in it and a power button and

2986
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:51,839
lights in it and a power button and
 

2987
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,309
lights in it and a power button and
stuff this is called an alum test

2988
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,319
stuff this is called an alum test
 

2989
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,470
stuff this is called an alum test
which is you know fine and it's a really

2990
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:58,480
which is you know fine and it's a really
 

2991
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,150
which is you know fine and it's a really
nice test to be honest but

2992
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:00,160
nice test to be honest but
 

2993
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,910
nice test to be honest but
it um but it has to pair with an iphone

2994
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
it um but it has to pair with an iphone
 

2995
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,990
it um but it has to pair with an iphone
and and so it's good as i think that

2996
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
and and so it's good as i think that
 

2997
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,069
and and so it's good as i think that
this is going to become

2998
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:08,079
this is going to become
 

2999
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,990
this is going to become
this is there's a lot of use for this

3000
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,000
this is there's a lot of use for this
 

3001
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,510
this is there's a lot of use for this
from a medical perspective you know

3002
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:11,520
from a medical perspective you know
 

3003
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,270
from a medical perspective you know
where you want good reporting this can

3004
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,280
where you want good reporting this can
 

3005
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,349
where you want good reporting this can
because it pairs with an iphone

3006
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:15,359
because it pairs with an iphone
 

3007
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,470
because it pairs with an iphone
uh it can immediately send uh

3008
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:18,480
uh it can immediately send uh
 

3009
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,910
uh it can immediately send uh
send the report to a department of

3010
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:19,920
send the report to a department of
 

3011
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,589
send the report to a department of
health whereas these paper strip tests

3012
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:21,599
health whereas these paper strip tests
 

3013
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:21,990
health whereas these paper strip tests
that

3014
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,000
that
 

3015
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,309
that
they're just paper they don't report

3016
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
they're just paper they don't report
 

3017
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,230
they're just paper they don't report
anything unless you want to report it

3018
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
anything unless you want to report it
 

3019
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,670
anything unless you want to report it
okay so i'm going to just pick it up and

3020
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:27,680
okay so i'm going to just pick it up and
 

3021
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,150
okay so i'm going to just pick it up and
pick it apart and so you can see

3022
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:30,160
pick it apart and so you can see
 

3023
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,150
pick it apart and so you can see
is there's like fluorescent readers and

3024
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,160
is there's like fluorescent readers and
 

3025
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,910
is there's like fluorescent readers and
little lasers and leds and stuff in

3026
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
little lasers and leds and stuff in
 

3027
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,470
little lasers and leds and stuff in
there

3028
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:34,480
there
 

3029
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,910
there
you can actually see the lights going

3030
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:35,920
you can actually see the lights going
 

3031
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,390
you can actually see the lights going
off wow and there's a paper strip test

3032
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:38,400
off wow and there's a paper strip test
 

3033
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,829
off wow and there's a paper strip test
right inside there but you can see that

3034
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:39,839
right inside there but you can see that
 

3035
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,910
right inside there but you can see that
there's like a whole circuit board and

3036
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:41,920
there's like a whole circuit board and
 

3037
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,710
there's like a whole circuit board and
and all this stuff right and so

3038
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:46,720
and all this stuff right and so
 

3039
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,630
and all this stuff right and so
this is the kind of thing that you know

3040
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:48,640
this is the kind of thing that you know
 

3041
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,109
this is the kind of thing that you know
the fda is looking for

3042
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:51,119
the fda is looking for
 

3043
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,390
the fda is looking for
um for like home use and and things like

3044
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,400
um for like home use and and things like
 

3045
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,069
um for like home use and and things like
that because it's kind of foolproof

3046
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:56,079
that because it's kind of foolproof
 

3047
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,390
that because it's kind of foolproof
like you you can't go wrong with it it

3048
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:58,400
like you you can't go wrong with it it
 

3049
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,910
like you you can't go wrong with it it
pairs with an iphone so you need

3050
00:50:59,910 --> 00:50:59,920
pairs with an iphone so you need
 

3051
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,190
pairs with an iphone so you need
bluetooth so it's going to be more

3052
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:01,200
bluetooth so it's going to be more
 

3053
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,870
bluetooth so it's going to be more
limited it's a great test don't get me

3054
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880
limited it's a great test don't get me
 

3055
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,030
limited it's a great test don't get me
wrong it's as good as any of these

3056
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,040
wrong it's as good as any of these
 

3057
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,870
wrong it's as good as any of these
but you know when you compare this thing

3058
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:06,880
but you know when you compare this thing
 

3059
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,309
but you know when you compare this thing
with a battery

3060
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
with a battery
 

3061
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,790
with a battery
and a circuit board and all this stuff

3062
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:10,800
and a circuit board and all this stuff
 

3063
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,549
and a circuit board and all this stuff
it's got its purpose but you know it's

3064
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:12,559
it's got its purpose but you know it's
 

3065
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:13,910
it's got its purpose but you know it's
not a public health tool

3066
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:13,920
not a public health tool
 

3067
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,349
not a public health tool
i don't want to see this made in the

3068
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:15,359
i don't want to see this made in the
 

3069
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,270
i don't want to see this made in the

3071
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,150
tens of millions a day yeah and thrown
away

3072

um ga likes that kind of stuff fba loves

3074
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:20,960
um ga likes that kind of stuff fba loves
 

3075

um ga likes that kind of stuff fba loves
this stuff you know because they can't

3076
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
this stuff you know because they can't
 

3077
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:22,950
this stuff you know because they can't
get

3078
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:22,960
get
 

3079
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,630
get
it out of their mind that this is a

3080
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:24,640
it out of their mind that this is a
 

3081
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,030
it out of their mind that this is a
public health crisis you know we need

3082
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
public health crisis you know we need
 

3083
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,630
public health crisis you know we need
we need i mean just look at the

3084
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:28,640
we need i mean just look at the
 

3085
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,069
we need i mean just look at the
difference here something like flashing

3086
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
difference here something like flashing
 

3087
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,710
difference here something like flashing
lights is essential got batteries it's

3088
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:32,720
lights is essential got batteries it's
 

3089
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,829
lights is essential got batteries it's
got a bluetooth thing

3090
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
got a bluetooth thing
 

3091
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,990
got a bluetooth thing
it's a great test but you know it's to

3092
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,000
it's a great test but you know it's to
 

3093
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,270
it's a great test but you know it's to
be honest it's not

3094
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:37,280
be honest it's not
 

3095
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,549
be honest it's not
any better than this one yeah and so

3096
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:40,559
any better than this one yeah and so
 

3097
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,750
any better than this one yeah and so
you know i i want this one um it's nice

3098
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:43,760
you know i i want this one um it's nice
 

3099
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,230
you know i i want this one um it's nice
and all

3100
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:44,240
and all
 

3101
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,549
and all
the form factor is nice but and it's

3102
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:46,559
the form factor is nice but and it's
 

3103
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,870
the form factor is nice but and it's
really nice that it goes to bluetooth

3104
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:48,880
really nice that it goes to bluetooth
 

3105
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,470
really nice that it goes to bluetooth
but it goes against the principle of

3106
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:50,480
but it goes against the principle of
 

3107
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,470
but it goes against the principle of
just uh 20 million a day

3108
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:52,480
just uh 20 million a day
 

3109
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,549

it you can manufacture
 

3113
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,150
it you can manufacture
and probably you could have probably

00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:58,160
and probably you could have probably
 

3115
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,910
and probably you could have probably
scaled this up in a couple of weeks

3116
00:51:59,910 --> 00:51:59,920
scaled this up in a couple of weeks

rapid test seems like a very elon musk

3154
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:36,319
rapid test seems like a very elon musk
 

3155
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,150
rapid test seems like a very elon musk
thing to do i don't know if you saw but

3156
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:38,160
thing to do i don't know if you saw but
 

3157
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,990
thing to do i don't know if you saw but
i i had a little twitter conversation

3158
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,000
i i had a little twitter conversation
 

3159
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,670
i i had a little twitter conversation
with elon musk

3160
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:41,680
with elon musk
 

3161
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,670
with elon musk
does he not like what was he do you know

3162
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:43,680
does he not like what was he do you know
 

3163
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,349
does he not like what was he do you know
what his thoughts are on rapid testing

3164
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:45,359
what his thoughts are on rapid testing
 

3165
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,790
what his thoughts are on rapid testing
well he was using a slightly different

3166
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
well he was using a slightly different
 

3167
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,549
well he was using a slightly different
one one of these but that requires an

3168
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:48,559
one one of these but that requires an
 

3169
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,630
one one of these but that requires an
instrument called the bd veritar

3170
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:50,640
instrument called the bd veritar
 

3171
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,390
instrument called the bd veritar
and he got a false positive or no i

3172
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400
and he got a false positive or no i
 

3173
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,750
and he got a false positive or no i
shouldn't say he didn't necessarily get

3174
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:53,760
shouldn't say he didn't necessarily get
 

3175
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,349
shouldn't say he didn't necessarily get
a false positive he got discrepant

3176
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
a false positive he got discrepant
 

3177
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,390
a false positive he got discrepant
results he did this

3178
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
results he did this
 

3179
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,870
results he did this
test four times he got two positives two

3180
00:52:58,870 --> 00:52:58,880
test four times he got two positives two
 

3181
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,309
test four times he got two positives two
negatives

3182
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:00,319
negatives
 

3183
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,470
negatives
um but then he got a pcr test and it was

3184
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
um but then he got a pcr test and it was
 

3185
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,069
um but then he got a pcr test and it was
a very low positive

3186
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
a very low positive
 

3187
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,710
a very low positive
result so i think what happened is he

3188
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:06,720
result so i think what happened is he
 

3189
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,829
result so i think what happened is he
just tested himself

3190
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:07,839
just tested himself
 

3191
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,589
just tested himself
at the tail end of and this was actually

3192
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:09,599
at the tail end of and this was actually
 

3193
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:10,950
at the tail end of and this was actually
right before he was about to send those

3194
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:10,960
right before he was about to send those
 

3195
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,230
right before he was about to send those
it was the day of essentially that he

3196
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,240
it was the day of essentially that he
 

3197
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,589
it was the day of essentially that he
was sending the astronauts up to the

3198
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:13,599
was sending the astronauts up to the
 

3199
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,950
was sending the astronauts up to the
space station the other day

3200
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:14,960
space station the other day
 

3201
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,349
space station the other day
so he used uh he was using these rapid

3202
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:17,359
so he used uh he was using these rapid
 

3203
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,710
so he used uh he was using these rapid
tests because he wanted to make sure

3204
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720
tests because he wanted to make sure
 

3205
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,790
tests because he wanted to make sure
that he was good to go in and

3206
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:20,800
that he was good to go in and
 

3207
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,589
that he was good to go in and
um he got discrepant results ultimately

3208
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
um he got discrepant results ultimately
 

3209
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:24,950
um he got discrepant results ultimately
they were correct

3210
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:24,960
they were correct
 

3211
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,309
they were correct
but you know two or negative two are

3212
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:26,319
but you know two or negative two are
 

3213
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,309
but you know two or negative two are
positive but what what really happened

3214
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
positive but what what really happened
 

3215
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,069
positive but what what really happened
once he got his he shared his pcr

3216
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:30,079
once he got his he shared his pcr
 

3217
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,589
once he got his he shared his pcr
results and they were very low

3218
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:31,599
results and they were very low
 

3219
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,470
results and they were very low
positive so really what was happening is

3220
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:34,480
positive so really what was happening is
 

3221
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,069
positive so really what was happening is
my guess is he found himself

3222
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:36,079
my guess is he found himself
 

3223
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,710
my guess is he found himself
right at the edge of his positivity of

3224
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:38,720
right at the edge of his positivity of
 

3225
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,470
right at the edge of his positivity of
his infectiousness and so

3226
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:40,480
his infectiousness and so
 

3227
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,589
his infectiousness and so
you know the test worked out was

3228
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:41,599
you know the test worked out was
 

3229
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,510
you know the test worked out was
supposed to work it

3230
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,520
supposed to work it
 

3231
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,670

probably had he used it two days earlier

it would have been screaming positive

it would have been screaming positive
 

3235
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:47,990

you know he wouldn't have gotten

discrepant results
 

3239
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,950

but he found himself right at the edge

00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:50,960
but he found himself right at the edge
 

3241
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,630

by the time he used the test
 

3243
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,870
by the time he used the test

particularly infectious and so it was
 

3259
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,309
particularly infectious and so it was
kind of when it gets to be a very low

it's fascinating there's this duality so

if it comes up positive then

that's exactly right you don't have to

that's exactly right you don't have to

that's exactly right you don't have to

that's the cdc's more conservative

stance to say
 

3361
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,990
stance to say
if you're positive on any test stay home

3362

if you're positive on any test stay home

if you're positive on any test stay home

for 10 days and isolate but
 

3365
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,589
for 10 days and isolate but
here people would just have more tests

here people would just have more tests
 

3367
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,750
here people would just have more tests
so the recommendation should be

so the recommendation should be
 

3369
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,829
so the recommendation should be
test daily if you turn positive test

3370

right now people just aren't testing

here with these tests
 

3409
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,150
here with these tests
uh but what does he actually think about

his first experience with these rapid
 

3487
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,430
his first experience with these rapid
tests was confusing

3488
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:01,440
tests was confusing
 

3489
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,670

which is um how i ended up having this

3490
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:03,680
which is um how i ended up having this
 

3491
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,270
which is um how i ended up having this
twitter kind of conversation with him

3492
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,280
twitter kind of conversation with him
 

3493
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,870
twitter kind of conversation with him
very briefly

3494
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:06,880
very briefly
 

3495
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,270
very briefly
but i think that if if he understood

3496
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:09,280
but i think that if if he understood
 

3497
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,630
but i think that if if he understood
sort of a little bit more and i think he

3498
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:10,640
sort of a little bit more and i think he
 

3499
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,349
sort of a little bit more and i think he
does i really

3500
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:11,359
does i really
 

3501
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,109
does i really
really love to talk to him about it

3502
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:13,119
really love to talk to him about it
 

3503
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,870
really love to talk to him about it
because i think he could totally change

3504
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:14,880
because i think he could totally change
 

3505
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,069

00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,280
single-handedly you know he loves grand
 

3511
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,309
single-handedly you know he loves grand
things yeah

3512
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:20,319
things yeah
 

3513
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,990
things yeah
i think out of all the solutions i've

3514
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:24,000
i think out of all the solutions i've
 

3515
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,750
i think out of all the solutions i've
seen this is uh this is the obvious

3516
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:27,760
seen this is uh this is the obvious
 

3517
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,030
seen this is uh this is the obvious
like engineering solution to uh

3518
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:31,040
like engineering solution to uh
 

3519
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,670
like engineering solution to uh
at least a pandemic of this scale i i

3520
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,680
at least a pandemic of this scale i i
 

3521
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,349
at least a pandemic of this scale i i
love that you say the engineering

3522
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:35,359
love that you say the engineering
 

3523
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,789
love that you say the engineering
solution so this is something i've been

3524
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:36,799
solution so this is something i've been
 

3525
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,470
solution so this is something i've been
really trying to

3526
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:38,480
really trying to
 

3527
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,270
really trying to
i'm an engineer uh you know my previous

3528
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
i'm an engineer uh you know my previous
 

3529
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,309
i'm an engineer uh you know my previous
history was

3530
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:42,319
history was
 

3531
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,910
history was
all engineering and that's really how i

3532
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:43,920
all engineering and that's really how i
 

3533
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,309
all engineering and that's really how i
think um i then went into medicine and

3534
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:46,319
think um i then went into medicine and
 

3535
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,069
think um i then went into medicine and
phd world but

3536
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:48,079
phd world but
 

3537
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,430
phd world but
um but but i

3538
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:51,440
um but but i
 

3539
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,109
um but but i
i think that the world like one of the

3540
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:53,119
i think that the world like one of the
 

3541
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,270
i think that the world like one of the
major catastrophes or one of the major

3542
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:55,280
major catastrophes or one of the major
 

3543
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,349
major catastrophes or one of the major
problems is that we have physicians

3544
00:58:57,349 --> 00:58:57,359
problems is that we have physicians
 

3545
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,990
problems is that we have physicians
making the decisions about public health

3546
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:00,000
making the decisions about public health
 

3547
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,990
making the decisions about public health
and a pandemic when really we need

3548
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:02,000
and a pandemic when really we need
 

3549
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,109
and a pandemic when really we need
engineers

3550
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:03,119
engineers
 

3551
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,510
engineers
this is an engineering problem and so

3552
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:05,520
this is an engineering problem and so
 

3553
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,270
this is an engineering problem and so
what i've been trying to do i actually

3554
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280
what i've been trying to do i actually
 

3555
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,270
what i've been trying to do i actually
really want to you know start a whole

3556
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:09,280
really want to you know start a whole
 

3557
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,270
really want to you know start a whole
new new field called public health

3558
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280
new new field called public health
 

3559
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,390
new new field called public health
engineering

3560
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:12,400
engineering
 

3561
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,230
engineering
you know and so i've been i'm loving it

3562
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:14,240
you know and so i've been i'm loving it
 

3563
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,589
you know and so i've been i'm loving it
eventually i want to try to bring it to

3564
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:15,599
eventually i want to try to bring it to
 

3565
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,510
eventually i want to try to bring it to
mit and get mit to want to start a new

you're talking about now a lot of people

3578
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:30,480
you're talking about now a lot of people
 

3579
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,430
you're talking about now a lot of people
believe because

3580
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
believe because
 

3581
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,109
believe because
vaccines started being deployed

3582
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:33,119
vaccines started being deployed
 

3583
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,470
vaccines started being deployed
currently

3584
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:34,480
currently
 

3585
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,030
currently
that you know we are no longer in need

3586
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,040
that you know we are no longer in need
 

3587
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,430
that you know we are no longer in need
of a solution

3588
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:39,440
of a solution
 

3589
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,789
of a solution
we're no longer in need of

3590
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:42,799
we're no longer in need of
 

3591
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,750
we're no longer in need of
slowing the spread of the virus to me as

3592
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:45,760
slowing the spread of the virus to me as
 

3593
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,510
slowing the spread of the virus to me as
i understand it seems like this is

3594
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
i understand it seems like this is
 

3595
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,309
i understand it seems like this is
the most important time to have

3596
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:50,319
the most important time to have
 

3597
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:50,950
the most important time to have
something

3598
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:50,960
something
 

3599
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,710
something
like a rapid testing solution can you

3600
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:52,720
like a rapid testing solution can you
 

3601
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,549
like a rapid testing solution can you
kind of break that apart

3602
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:54,559
kind of break that apart
 

3603
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,630
kind of break that apart
uh what's the role of rapid testing

3604
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:56,640
uh what's the role of rapid testing
 

3605
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,230
uh what's the role of rapid testing
current in the next

3606
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,240
current in the next
 

3607
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,789
current in the next
you know what is it three four months

3608
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
you know what is it three four months
 

3609
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:01,270
you know what is it three four months
maybe

3610
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:01,280
maybe
 

3611
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,910
maybe
is even more this the vaccine rollout

3612
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:03,920
is even more this the vaccine rollout
 

3613
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,710
is even more this the vaccine rollout
isn't going to be

3614
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:04,720
isn't going to be
 

3615
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,750
isn't going to be
as peachy as everyone is hoping you know

3616
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:07,760
as peachy as everyone is hoping you know
 

3617
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,349
as peachy as everyone is hoping you know
and i hate to be the deputy downer here

3618
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:09,359
and i hate to be the deputy downer here
 

3619
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,230
and i hate to be the deputy downer here
but

3620
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,240
but
 

3621
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,309
but
um there's a lot of unknowns with this

3622
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:12,319
um there's a lot of unknowns with this
 

3623
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,430
um there's a lot of unknowns with this
vaccine

3624
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
vaccine
 

3625
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,109
vaccine
you've already mentioned one which is

3626
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
you've already mentioned one which is
 

3627
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,470
you've already mentioned one which is
there's a lot of people who just don't

3628
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:16,480
there's a lot of people who just don't
 

3629
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,470
there's a lot of people who just don't
want to get the vaccine

3630
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:18,480
want to get the vaccine
 

3631
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,910
want to get the vaccine
uh you know i hope that that might

3632
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:19,920
uh you know i hope that that might
 

3633
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,670
uh you know i hope that that might
change as things move forward and people

3634
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:21,680
change as things move forward and people
 

3635
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,190
change as things move forward and people
see their neighbors getting it and their

3636
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:23,200
see their neighbors getting it and their
 

3637
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,710
see their neighbors getting it and their
family getting in there and it's safe

3638
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:24,720
family getting in there and it's safe
 

3639
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,510
family getting in there and it's safe
and all

3640
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:25,520
and all
 

3641
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,109
and all
we don't know how effective the vaccine

3642
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:27,119
we don't know how effective the vaccine
 

3643
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,549
we don't know how effective the vaccine
is going to be after two or three months

3644
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:28,559
is going to be after two or three months
 

3645
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,670
is going to be after two or three months
we've only measured it

3646
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:29,680
we've only measured it
 

3647
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,030
we've only measured it
in the first two or three months which

3648
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:31,040
in the first two or three months which
 

3649
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,270
in the first two or three months which
is a massive problem

3650
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,280
is a massive problem
 

3651
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,950
is a massive problem
which we can go into biologically

3652
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:34,960
which we can go into biologically
 

3653
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,789
which we can go into biologically
because there's reasons to

3654
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:36,799
because there's reasons to
 

3655
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,390
because there's reasons to
very good reasons to believe that the

3656
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:38,400
very good reasons to believe that the
 

3657
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,549
very good reasons to believe that the
efficacy could fall way down after two

3658
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
efficacy could fall way down after two
 

3659
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,390
efficacy could fall way down after two
or three months

3660
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,400
or three months
 

3661
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,589
or three months
we don't know if it's going to stop

3662
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:43,599
we don't know if it's going to stop
 

3663
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,190
we don't know if it's going to stop
transmission and if it doesn't stop

3664
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,200
transmission and if it doesn't stop
 

3665
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,789
transmission and if it doesn't stop
transmission

3666
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:46,799
transmission
 

3667
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,230
transmission
then we're not then there's you know

3668
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
then we're not then there's you know
 

3669
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,750
then we're not then there's you know
herd immunity is much much more

3670
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:49,760
herd immunity is much much more
 

3671
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,789
herd immunity is much much more
difficult to get

3672
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:50,799
difficult to get
 

3673
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,789
difficult to get
because that's all based on transmission

3674
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:52,799
because that's all based on transmission
 

3675
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,549
because that's all based on transmission
blockade

3676
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:54,559
blockade
 

3677
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,870
blockade
and uh and frankly we don't know how

3678
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
and uh and frankly we don't know how
 

3679
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,549
and uh and frankly we don't know how
easily we're going to be able to roll it

3680
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:58,559
easily we're going to be able to roll it
 

3681
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,069
easily we're going to be able to roll it
out some of the vaccines need

3682
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:00,079
out some of the vaccines need
 

3683
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,309
out some of the vaccines need
really significant cold chains have very

3684
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:02,319
really significant cold chains have very
 

3685
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,990
really significant cold chains have very
short half-lives outside of that cold

3686
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,000
short half-lives outside of that cold
 

3687
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,190
short half-lives outside of that cold
chain

3688

chain
 

3689
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,470
chain
uh we need to organize massive

3690
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:08,480
uh we need to organize massive
 

3691
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,710
uh we need to organize massive
uh uh numbers of people to be able to

3692
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
uh uh numbers of people to be able to
 

3693
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,470
uh uh numbers of people to be able to
distribute these most hospitals today

3694
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:12,480
distribute these most hospitals today
 

3695
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,990
distribute these most hospitals today
are saying that they're not

3696
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,000
are saying that they're not
 

3697
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,150
are saying that they're not
uh equipped to hire the right people to

3698
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,160
uh equipped to hire the right people to
 

3699
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,670
uh equipped to hire the right people to
be even administering

3700
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:17,680
be even administering
 

3701
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,349
be even administering
uh enough of these vaccines and then a

3702
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,359
uh enough of these vaccines and then a
 

3703
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,710
uh enough of these vaccines and then a
lot of the hospitals are frustrated

3704
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:20,720
lot of the hospitals are frustrated
 

3705
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,069
lot of the hospitals are frustrated
because they're getting much lower

3706
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079
because they're getting much lower
 

3707
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,150
because they're getting much lower
smaller allocations than they were

3708
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:24,160
smaller allocations than they were
 

3709
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,510
smaller allocations than they were
expecting so i think right now like you

um from my perspective
 

3993
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,390
um from my perspective
like kind of half-assed lockdowns which

3994
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:58,400
like kind of half-assed lockdowns which
 

3995
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,349
like kind of half-assed lockdowns which
is not

01:05:59,349 --> 01:05:59,359
is not
 

3997
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,990
is not
so i have seen good evidence that like a

3998
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000
so i have seen good evidence that like a
 

3999
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,549
so i have seen good evidence that like a
complete lockdown can work

4000
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:04,559
complete lockdown can work
 

4001
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,549
complete lockdown can work
but that's in in theory it's like

4002
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:06,559
but that's in in theory it's like
 

4003
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,430
but that's in in theory it's like
communism in theory can work

4004
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
communism in theory can work
 

4005
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,670
communism in theory can work
like theoretically speaking but it just

4006

01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
to say look
 

4193
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,430
to say look
okay the fda is evaluating these for

4194
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:19,440
okay the fda is evaluating these for
 

4195
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,269
okay the fda is evaluating these for
doctors to use and all that

4196
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
doctors to use and all that
 

4197
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,590
doctors to use and all that
uh but you know we're the cdc and we're

4198
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:23,600
uh but you know we're the cdc and we're
 

4199
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,269
uh but you know we're the cdc and we're
the public health agency of this country

4200
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
the public health agency of this country
 

4201
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:26,709
the public health agency of this country
and we recognize that

4202
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:26,719
and we recognize that
 

4203
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,789
and we recognize that
these tools uh require a different

4204
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:28,799
these tools uh require a different
 

4205
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,390
these tools uh require a different
authorization pathway and a different

4206
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:30,400
authorization pathway and a different
 

4207
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,189
authorization pathway and a different
use

4208
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:31,199
use
 

4209
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,590
use
this is a difference to medical devices

4210
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:33,600
this is a difference to medical devices
 

4211
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,349
this is a difference to medical devices
and public health

4212
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:35,359
and public health
 

4213
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,829
and public health
and i guess fda is not designed for this

4214
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
and i guess fda is not designed for this
 

4215
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,349
and i guess fda is not designed for this
public health especially in emergency

4216
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359
public health especially in emergency
 

4217
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:40,550

tim
 

4225
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,709
tim
you know he's a very reasonable guy but

4226
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:48,719
you know he's a very reasonable guy but
 

4227

uh evaluate a public health tool if

4232
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:55,920
uh evaluate a public health tool if
 

4233
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,950
uh evaluate a public health tool if
you're telling me this is a public

4234
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
you're telling me this is a public
 

4235
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,189
you're telling me this is a public
health tool great go and use it

4236
01:09:59,189 --> 01:09:59,199
health tool great go and use it
 

4237
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,310
health tool great go and use it
and uh and so i say okay

4238
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:02,320
and uh and so i say okay
 

4239
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,470
and uh and so i say okay
great we'll go and use it and then uh

4240
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:04,480
great we'll go and use it and then uh
 

4241
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,990
great we'll go and use it and then uh
the comment is but

the comment is but
 

4243
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,669
the comment is but
you know does it give a result back to

4244
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
you know does it give a result back to
 

4245
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,350
you know does it give a result back to
somebody i say well

4246
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
somebody i say well
 

4247
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,189
somebody i say well
yes of course it gives a result back to

01:10:11,189 --> 01:10:11,199
yes of course it gives a result back to

you know okay can these be authorized as

you know okay can these be authorized as
 

4279
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,750
you know okay can these be authorized as
uh as public health tools and not fall

uh as public health tools and not fall

so then the fda doesn't have to be the

4286
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840
so then the fda doesn't have to be the
 

4287
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,510
so then the fda doesn't have to be the
ones authorizing it as a public health

4288
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:53,520
ones authorizing it as a public health
 

4289
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,550
ones authorizing it as a public health
tool

4290
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,560
tool
 

4291
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,669
tool
and sema verma says oh well we don't we

4292
01:10:57,669 --> 01:10:57,679
and sema verma says oh well we don't we
 

4293
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:59,830
and sema verma says oh well we don't we
don't have any jurisdiction over

4294
01:10:59,830 --> 01:10:59,840
don't have any jurisdiction over
 

4295
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,189
don't have any jurisdiction over
over uh point of care and uh and sort of

4296
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:03,199
over uh point of care and uh and sort of
 

4297
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,950
over uh point of care and uh and sort of
rapid devices like this we only have

4298
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
rapid devices like this we only have
 

4299
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,350
rapid devices like this we only have
jurisdiction over lab devices

4300
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:07,360
jurisdiction over lab devices
 

4301
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,830
jurisdiction over lab devices
so it's like nobody has ownership over

4302
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:09,840
so it's like nobody has ownership over
 

4303
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,669
so it's like nobody has ownership over
it which means that they just keep they

4304
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679
it which means that they just keep they
 

4305
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,669
it which means that they just keep they
stay in this purgatory of

4306
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:13,679
stay in this purgatory of
 

4307
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,910
stay in this purgatory of
of not being approved and so this is

4308
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:15,920
of not being approved and so this is
 

4309
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,870
of not being approved and so this is
where i think

4310
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:16,880
where i think
 

4311
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,030
where i think
frankly it needs a president it needs a

4312
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:19,040
frankly it needs a president it needs a
 

4313
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,950
frankly it needs a president it needs a
presidential order to just unlock them

4314
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:20,960
presidential order to just unlock them
 

4315
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:21,669
presidential order to just unlock them
to say

4316
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:21,679
to say
 

4317
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:24,709
to say
this is more important than you know

4318
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:24,719
this is more important than you know
 

4319
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,149
this is more important than you know
having a prescription and

4320
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
having a prescription and
 

4321
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:27,830
having a prescription and
in fact i mean really what's happening

4322
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
in fact i mean really what's happening
 

4323
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,149
in fact i mean really what's happening
now because there is this

4324
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:30,159
now because there is this
 

4325
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,630
now because there is this
sense that tests are public health tools

4326
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:32,640
sense that tests are public health tools
 

4327
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,070
sense that tests are public health tools
even if they're not being defined as

4328
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,080
even if they're not being defined as
 

4329
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,950
even if they're not being defined as
such

4330
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:34,960
such
 

4331
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,590
such
the fda now is pretty much not only are

4332
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
the fda now is pretty much not only are
 

4333
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,070
the fda now is pretty much not only are
they not

4334
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:38,080
they not
 

4335
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,950
they not
authorizing these as public health tools

01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:40,960
authorizing these as public health tools
 

4337
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,590
authorizing these as public health tools
what they're doing by by authorizing

4338
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:43,600
what they're doing by by authorizing
 

4339
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,430
what they're doing by by authorizing
what are effectively public health tools

4340
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:45,440
what are effectively public health tools
 

4341
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,350
what are effectively public health tools
as medical devices

4342
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:47,360
as medical devices
 

4343
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,110
as medical devices
they're just diluting down the practice

4344
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:49,120
they're just diluting down the practice
 

4345
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,630
they're just diluting down the practice
of medicine right

01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:50,640
of medicine right

01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,149
of medicine right
i mean his answer right now

01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:52,159
i mean his answer right now
 

4349
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,070
i mean his answer right now
unfortunately is

4350
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,080
unfortunately is
 

4351
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,310
unfortunately is
well i don't know why you you want these

4352
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
well i don't know why you you want these
 

4353
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,910
well i don't know why you you want these
to be sort of available to everyone

4354
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:57,920
to be sort of available to everyone
 

4355
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,750
to be sort of available to everyone
without a prescription we've already

4356
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
without a prescription we've already
 

4357
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,270
without a prescription we've already
said that a doctor can write a whole

college campus it's like well if you're

4362
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:05,360
college campus it's like well if you're
 

4363
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,870
college campus it's like well if you're
going in that direction then that's no

4364
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:06,880
going in that direction then that's no
 

4365
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,550
going in that direction then that's no
longer medicine

4366
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:08,560
longer medicine
 

4367
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,310
longer medicine
having a doctor write a prescription for

4368
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:10,320
having a doctor write a prescription for
 

4369
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,070
having a doctor write a prescription for
a college campus for everyone on the

01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:12,080
a college campus for everyone on the
 

4371
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,229
a college campus for everyone on the
campus to have repeat testing

4372

01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,709
campus to have repeat testing
now now we're just in the territory of

4374
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:16,719
now now we're just in the territory of
 

4375
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:18,550
now now we're just in the territory of
of eroding medicine

4376
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:18,560
of eroding medicine
 

4377
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,790
of eroding medicine
and eroding all of the legal rules and

4378
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:20,800
and eroding all of the legal rules and
 

4379
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,310
and eroding all of the legal rules and
reasons that we have prescriptions in

4380
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:22,320
reasons that we have prescriptions in
 

4381
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,669
reasons that we have prescriptions in
the first place

4382
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:23,679
the first place
 

4383
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,750
the first place
so it's just everything about it is just

4384
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:25,760
so it's just everything about it is just
 

4385
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,030
so it's just everything about it is just
destructive

4386
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:27,040
destructive
 

4387
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,270
destructive
instead of just making a simple solute

4388
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:29,280
instead of just making a simple solute
 

4389
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,270
instead of just making a simple solute

scientists start entering the space of
 

4413
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,270
scientists start entering the space of

activities that i want to do so what i

4442
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:20,800
activities that i want to do so what i
 

4443
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,149
activities that i want to do so what i
normally do in my research lab is

4444
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:22,159
normally do in my research lab is
 

4445
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,470
normally do in my research lab is
develop technologies that

4446
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:24,480
develop technologies that
 

4447
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,870
develop technologies that
uh can take a drop of somebody's blood

4448
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
uh can take a drop of somebody's blood
 

4449
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,910
uh can take a drop of somebody's blood
or some saliva

4450
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:27,920
or some saliva
 

4451
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,550
or some saliva
and profile for hundreds of thousands of

4452
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:30,560
and profile for hundreds of thousands of
 

4453
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,990
and profile for hundreds of thousands of
different antibodies against

4454
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,000
different antibodies against
 

4455
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,669
different antibodies against
every single pathogen that somebody

4456
01:13:33,669 --> 01:13:33,679
every single pathogen that somebody
 

4457
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,229
every single pathogen that somebody
could be possibly exposed to

4458
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:36,239
could be possibly exposed to
 

4459
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,470
could be possibly exposed to
so this is all new technology that we've

4460
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480
so this is all new technology that we've
 

4461
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,229
so this is all new technology that we've
been developing more from a

4462
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:40,239
been developing more from a
 

4463
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:43,270
been developing more from a
from a bioengineering perspective but

4464
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:43,280
from a bioengineering perspective but
 

4465
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:43,990
from a bioengineering perspective but
then i

4466
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,000
then i
 

4467
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,189
then i
use a lot of the mathematics uh

4468
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:47,199
use a lot of the mathematics uh
 

4469
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,510
use a lot of the mathematics uh
tools to a interpret that but what i

4470
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:49,520
tools to a interpret that but what i
 

4471
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,270
tools to a interpret that but what i
really want to do for example to kind of

4472
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
really want to do for example to kind of
 

4473
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,110
really want to do for example to kind of
kick off this new field of

you know we don't uh for example we
don't just use our umbrellas

day in cases of hurricane we
 

4599
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,470
day in cases of hurricane we
wait and if we know that there's one

4600
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:58,480
wait and if we know that there's one
 

4601
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,790
wait and if we know that there's one
coming then we act for a

then
we go back and we've prepared ourselves

4608
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:05,600
we go back and we've prepared ourselves
 

4609

that vision of the future is uh i think
 

4617
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:13,910
that vision of the future is uh i think
that's

4618
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
that's
 

4619
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,669
that's
incredible and it seems like it should

4620
01:16:15,669 --> 01:16:15,679
incredible and it seems like it should
 

4621
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,270
incredible and it seems like it should
be within our reach

4622
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,280
be within our reach
 

4623
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,950
be within our reach
the just these like weather maps of

4624
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:20,960
the just these like weather maps of
 

4625
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,149
the just these like weather maps of
viruses

4626
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
viruses
 

4627
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,870
viruses
floating about the earth and and it

4628
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:24,880
floating about the earth and and it
 

4629
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,790
floating about the earth and and it
seems obvious it's one of those things

4630
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:26,800
seems obvious it's one of those things
 

4631
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,910
seems obvious it's one of those things
where

4632
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:27,920
where
 

4633
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,149
where
right now it seems like maybe impossible

4634
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:32,159
right now it seems like maybe impossible
 

4635
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,310
right now it seems like maybe impossible
and then looking back like 20 years from

4636
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
and then looking back like 20 years from
 

4637
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,270
and then looking back like 20 years from
now will

4638
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,280
now will
 

4639
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,830
now will
wonder like why the hell this hasn't

4640
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:37,840
wonder like why the hell this hasn't
 

4641
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,189
wonder like why the hell this hasn't
been done away earlier

4642
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:39,199
been done away earlier
 

4643
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,750
been done away earlier

potentially and that means
 

4659
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,270
potentially and that means
that there is some as with the contact

01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:14,239
for basically misusing people's data or
 

4677
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:16,709
for basically misusing people's data or
you know just whether it's perception or

4678
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:16,719
you know just whether it's perception or
 

4679
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,149
you know just whether it's perception or
reality there's certainly a lot of

4680
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:18,159
reality there's certainly a lot of
 

4681
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:19,750
reality there's certainly a lot of
reality to it too

4682
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,760
reality to it too

4685
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,870
where they're not good stewards of our
private data so there's this weird

4686

private data so there's this weird
 

4687
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,070
private data so there's this weird
place where it's like obvious that if

4688
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:30,080
place where it's like obvious that if
 

4689
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,270
place where it's like obvious that if
we do if we collect a lot of data about

4690
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:33,280
we do if we collect a lot of data about
 

4691
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,030
we do if we collect a lot of data about
human beings

4692

01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:40,960
like basic respect for that data just
 

4697
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,950
like basic respect for that data just
like honestly common sense respect for

for the world like
a weather map for viruses is there a way

4706
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:50,000
a weather map for viruses is there a way
 

4707
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,790
a weather map for viruses is there a way
forward to

4708
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,800
forward to
 

4709
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,790
forward to
gain trust of people um or to do this

4710
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:54,800
gain trust of people um or to do this
 

4711
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,630
gain trust of people um or to do this
to do this well do you have ideas here

4712
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
to do this well do you have ideas here
 

4713
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,390
to do this well do you have ideas here
how big is this problem

4714
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:58,400
how big is this problem
 

4715
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,550
how big is this problem
i think it's it's a central problem

4716
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:00,560
i think it's it's a central problem
 

4717
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,910
i think it's it's a central problem
there's a couple central problems that

4718
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
there's a couple central problems that
 

4719
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,270
there's a couple central problems that
need to be solved one

4720
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:03,280
need to be solved one
 

4721
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,750
need to be solved one
how do you get all the samples that's

4722
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:05,760
how do you get all the samples that's
 

4723
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,350
how do you get all the samples that's
not actually too difficult i'm actually

4724
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:07,360
not actually too difficult i'm actually

uh tens of thousands of samples every

4734
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:15,760
uh tens of thousands of samples every
 

4735
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,669
uh tens of thousands of samples every
week are flowing into my lab

4736
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
week are flowing into my lab
 

4737
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,149
week are flowing into my lab
and we process them so it's taking the

4738
01:18:20,149 --> 01:18:20,159
and we process them so it's taking the
 

4739
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,030
and we process them so it's taking the
so it's

4740

so it's
 

4741
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,669
so it's
taking like one of the basically uh the

numbers that's exactly right so what
 

4749
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,390
numbers that's exactly right so what
we're doing for example there's a lot of

we're doing for example there's a lot of
 

4751
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,790
we're doing for example there's a lot of

through december we're able to
 

4837
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,270
through december we're able to
uh watch how the virus uh entered into

4838
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280
uh watch how the virus uh entered into
 

4839
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,709
uh watch how the virus uh entered into
the united states and how it

4840
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:54,719
the united states and how it
 

4841
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,630
the united states and how it
how it's transmitting every day you know

4842
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
how it's transmitting every day you know
 

4843
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,390
how it's transmitting every day you know
across the u.s

4844
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,400
across the u.s
 

4845
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,110
across the u.s
uh so we're we're getting those results

4846
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,120
uh so we're we're getting those results
 

4847
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:01,669
uh so we're we're getting those results
uh

4848
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:01,679
uh
 

4849
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:02,709
uh
organized now and we're gonna start

4850
01:20:02,709 --> 01:20:02,719
organized now and we're gonna start
 

4851
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:05,189
organized now and we're gonna start
start putting them publicly on

4852
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:05,199
start putting them publicly on
 

4853
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,270
start putting them publicly on
online soon to start making at least a

4854
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,280
online soon to start making at least a
 

4855
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,629
online soon to start making at least a
very rough map of covid

4856
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:10,639
very rough map of covid
 

4857
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,390
very rough map of covid
but that's the type of thinking that i

4858
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
but that's the type of thinking that i
 

4859
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,590
but that's the type of thinking that i
have in terms of like how do you

4860
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:13,600
have in terms of like how do you
 

4861
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,550
have in terms of like how do you
actually capture

4862
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:14,560
actually capture
 

4863
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,590
actually capture
huge numbers of specimens you can't

4864
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:17,600
huge numbers of specimens you can't
 

4865
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,990
huge numbers of specimens you can't
ask everyone to participate on sort of a

4866
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:20,000
ask everyone to participate on sort of a
 

4867
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,709
ask everyone to participate on sort of a
i mean you

4868
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:20,719
i mean you
 

4869
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,070
i mean you
may maybe could if you have the right

4870
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
may maybe could if you have the right
 

4871
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,390
may maybe could if you have the right
tools and you can offer individuals

4872
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:24,400
tools and you can offer individuals
 

4873
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,510
tools and you can offer individuals
something in return like 23andme does

4874
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,520
something in return like 23andme does
 

4875
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,629
something in return like 23andme does
you know that's a great way to get

4876
01:20:28,629 --> 01:20:28,639
you know that's a great way to get
 

4877
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,229
you know that's a great way to get
people to give specimens and they get

4878
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239
people to give specimens and they get
 

4879
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,750
people to give specimens and they get
results back so

4880
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:31,760
results back so
 

4881
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,270
results back so
with these technologies that i've been

4882
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:33,280
with these technologies that i've been
 

4883
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,510
with these technologies that i've been
building along with some collaborators

4884
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:35,520
building along with some collaborators
 

4885
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,590
building along with some collaborators
at harvard we can

4886
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,600
at harvard we can
 

4887
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,189
at harvard we can
come up with tools that people might

4888
01:20:39,189 --> 01:20:39,199
come up with tools that people might
 

4889
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,430
come up with tools that people might
actually want so i can offer you

4890
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:41,440
actually want so i can offer you
 

4891
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,629
actually want so i can offer you
your immunological history i can say

4892
01:20:44,629 --> 01:20:44,639
your immunological history i can say
 

4893
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,470
your immunological history i can say
give me a drop of your blood on a filter

4894
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:46,480
give me a drop of your blood on a filter
 

4895
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,310
give me a drop of your blood on a filter
paper mail it in

4896
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
paper mail it in
 

4897
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,990
paper mail it in
and i will be able to tell you every

4898
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:50,000
and i will be able to tell you every
 

4899
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,270
and i will be able to tell you every
infectious disease you've ever

4900
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:51,280
infectious disease you've ever
 

4901
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,110
infectious disease you've ever
encountered and maybe even when you

4902
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:53,120
encountered and maybe even when you
 

4903
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,430
encountered and maybe even when you
encountered it roughly

4904
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:55,440
encountered it roughly
 

4905
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,750
encountered it roughly
i could tell you do you have covet

4906
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:57,760
i could tell you do you have covet
 

4907
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,270
i could tell you do you have covet
antibodies right now do you have lyme

4908
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,280
antibodies right now do you have lyme
 

4909
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,030

tripoli and all these different viruses
 

4913
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,350
tripoli and all these different viruses
also peanut allergies

4914
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,360
also peanut allergies
 

4915
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,950
also peanut allergies
you know milk allergies anything you

4916
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:06,960
you know milk allergies anything you
 

4917
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,510
you know milk allergies anything you
know if it if your immune system makes

4918
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:09,520
know if it if your immune system makes
 

4919
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,390
know if it if your immune system makes
a response to it we can detect that

4920
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,400
a response to it we can detect that
 

4921
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,870
a response to it we can detect that
response

response
 

4923
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,390
response
so all of a sudden we have this very

4924
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
so all of a sudden we have this very
 

4925
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,390
so all of a sudden we have this very
valuable technology that on the one hand

4926
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:18,400
valuable technology that on the one hand
 

4927
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,990
valuable technology that on the one hand
gives people maybe information they

4928
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,000
gives people maybe information they
 

4929
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,750
gives people maybe information they
might want to know about themselves

4930
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
might want to know about themselves
 

4931
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,189
might want to know about themselves
but on the other hand becomes this

4932
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:23,199
but on the other hand becomes this
 

4933
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:24,950
but on the other hand becomes this
amazingly rich

4934
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:24,960
amazingly rich

these epidemiological tools but you

4944
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
these epidemiological tools but you
 

4945
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,709
these epidemiological tools but you
asked about privacy

4946
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:36,719
asked about privacy
 

4947
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,270
asked about privacy
and absolutely that's essential to keep

4948

4975
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,030
approval and with the people's consent
we could maybe collect more data but

4976
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,040
we could maybe collect more data but
 

4977
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,070
we could maybe collect more data but
that would require

4978
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:06,080
that would require
 

4979
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,870
that would require
consent but then there's this other

4980
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:08,880
consent but then there's this other
 

4981
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,070
consent but then there's this other
approach which i'm really

4982
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,080
approach which i'm really
 

4983
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,910
approach which i'm really
excited about which is certainly going

4984
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920
excited about which is certainly going
 

4985
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,229
excited about which is certainly going
to gain some scrutiny i think

4986
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:14,239
to gain some scrutiny i think
 

4987
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,950
to gain some scrutiny i think
but we'll have to figure out where where

4988
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:16,960
but we'll have to figure out where where
 

4989
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,790
but we'll have to figure out where where
it comes into play but i've been

4990
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:18,800
it comes into play but i've been
 

4991
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,550
it comes into play but i've been
recognizing that we can take somebody's

immunological profile
 

4995
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,550
immunological profile
and we can make a biological fingerprint

4996
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:24,560
and we can make a biological fingerprint

out of it and it's actually stable

4998
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:26,960
out of it and it's actually stable
 

4999
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,390
out of it and it's actually stable
enough so that i could take your blood

5000
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:28,400
enough so that i could take your blood
 

5001
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,310
enough so that i could take your blood
let's say i don't know who you are

5002
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:30,320
let's say i don't know who you are
 

5003
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,350
let's say i don't know who you are
but um you sent me a drop of blood

5004
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:33,360
but um you sent me a drop of blood
 

5005
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,110
but um you sent me a drop of blood
a year ago and then you send me a drop

5006
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:35,120
a year ago and then you send me a drop
 

5007
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,390
a year ago and then you send me a drop
of blood today

5008
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:36,400
of blood today
 

5009
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,149
of blood today
i don't know that those two blood spots

5010
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
i don't know that those two blood spots
 

5011
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:39,669
i don't know that those two blood spots
are coming from the same person

5012
01:22:39,669 --> 01:22:39,679
are coming from the same person
 

5013
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:42,629
are coming from the same person
they're just showing up in my lab uh but

5014
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:42,639
they're just showing up in my lab uh but
 

5015
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:43,510
they're just showing up in my lab uh but
i can

5016
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:43,520
i can
 

5017
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,709
i can
run the our technology over the and

5018
01:22:46,709 --> 01:22:46,719
run the our technology over the and
 

5019
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:48,870
run the our technology over the and
it just gives me your immunological

5020
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:48,880
it just gives me your immunological
 

5021
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,189
it just gives me your immunological
history but your immunological history

5022
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:51,199
history but your immunological history
 

5023
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,629
history but your immunological history
is so unique to you and the way that

5024
01:22:52,629 --> 01:22:52,639
is so unique to you and the way that
 

5025
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,270
is so unique to you and the way that
your body responds to these pathogens

5026
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,280
your body responds to these pathogens
 

5027
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,070
your body responds to these pathogens
is so unique to you that i can use that

5028
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:58,080
is so unique to you that i can use that
 

5029
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,750
is so unique to you that i can use that
to tether your two samples i don't know

5030
01:22:59,750 --> 01:22:59,760
to tether your two samples i don't know
 

5031
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,390
to tether your two samples i don't know
who you are

5032
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:00,400
who you are
 

5033
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,430
who you are
i know nothing about you i only know

5034
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:03,440
i know nothing about you i only know
 

5035
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,030
i know nothing about you i only know
when those samples were

5036
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:05,040
when those samples were
 

5037
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,350
when those samples were
came out of a person but i can say oh

5038
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:07,360
came out of a person but i can say oh
 

5039
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,030
came out of a person but i can say oh
these two samples a year apart

5040
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
these two samples a year apart
 

5041
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,870
these two samples a year apart
actually belong to the same person yeah

5042
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:10,880
actually belong to the same person yeah
 

5043
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,390
actually belong to the same person yeah
so there's sufficient information that

5044
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:12,400
so there's sufficient information that
 

5045
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,229
so there's sufficient information that
immunological history to

5046
01:23:14,229 --> 01:23:14,239
immunological history to
 

5047
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,550
immunological history to
to match the samples that's well for

5048
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:16,560
to match the samples that's well for
 

5049
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,070
to match the samples that's well for
from a privacy perspective that's really

5050
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,080
from a privacy perspective that's really
 

5051
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,590
from a privacy perspective that's really
exciting does that generally hold for

5052
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:19,600
exciting does that generally hold for
 

5053
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,149
exciting does that generally hold for
humans

5054
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:20,159
humans
 

5055
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:21,510
humans
so you're saying there's enough

5056
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,520
so you're saying there's enough
 

5057
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,590
so you're saying there's enough
uniqueness yep to match

5058
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:23,600
uniqueness yep to match
 

5059
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,430
uniqueness yep to match
yeah because it's very stochastic even

5060
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:25,440
yeah because it's very stochastic even
 

5061
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,030
yeah because it's very stochastic even
twins so this i believe you know we

5062
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:27,040
twins so this i believe you know we
 

5063
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,270
twins so this i believe you know we
haven't published this yet we will soon

5064
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:29,280
haven't published this yet we will soon
 

5065
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,790
haven't published this yet we will soon
you have a twin too right i do have a

5066
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:30,800
you have a twin too right i do have a
 

5067
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,229
you have a twin too right i do have a
twin i have an identical twin brother

5068
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:32,239
twin i have an identical twin brother
 

5069
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,070
twin i have an identical twin brother
which makes me interested in this

5070
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
which makes me interested in this
 

5071
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,300
which makes me interested in this
uh he looks very much like me that works

5072
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:37,310
uh he looks very much like me that works
 

5073
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:38,870
uh he looks very much like me that works
[Laughter]

5074
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:38,880
[Laughter]
 

5075
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,270
[Laughter]
and you know dna can't really tell us

5076
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,280
and you know dna can't really tell us
 

5077
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,629
and you know dna can't really tell us
apart

5078
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:42,639
apart
 

5079
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,950
apart
but this tool is one of the only tools

5080
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:44,960
but this tool is one of the only tools
 

5081
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,790
but this tool is one of the only tools
in the world that can tell twins apart

5082
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:46,800
in the world that can tell twins apart
 

5083
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,030
in the world that can tell twins apart
from each other could still be

5084
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,040
from each other could still be
 

5085
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,189
from each other could still be
accurate enough to say this blood you

5086
01:23:51,189 --> 01:23:51,199
accurate enough to say this blood you
 

5087
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,830
accurate enough to say this blood you
know it's like 99.999 percent

5088
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:53,840
know it's like 99.999 percent
 

5089
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,110
know it's like 99.999 percent
uh uh accurate to to to say that these

5090
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,120
uh uh accurate to to to say that these
 

5091
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,709
uh uh accurate to to to say that these
two blood samples came from the same

5092
01:23:58,709 --> 01:23:58,719
two blood samples came from the same
 

5093
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,229
two blood samples came from the same
individual

5094
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:00,239
individual
 

5095
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:02,070
individual
and it's because it's a combination both

5096
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:02,080
and it's because it's a combination both
 

5097
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,990
and it's because it's a combination both
of your immunological history

5098
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,000
of your immunological history
 

5099
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,669
of your immunological history
but also how your unique body uh

5100
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:07,679
but also how your unique body uh
 

5101
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,470
but also how your unique body uh
responds to a pathogen which is random

5102
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:10,480
responds to a pathogen which is random
 

5103
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,790
responds to a pathogen which is random
uh the way that we make antibodies is

5104
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:12,800
uh the way that we make antibodies is
 

5105
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,350
uh the way that we make antibodies is
is uh by and large it's got an element

5106
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:15,360
is uh by and large it's got an element
 

5107
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,430
is uh by and large it's got an element
of randomness to it

5108
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:17,440
of randomness to it
 

5109
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,350
of randomness to it
how the cells when they make an antibody

5110
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
how the cells when they make an antibody
 

5111
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,790
how the cells when they make an antibody
they chop up

5112
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:20,800
they chop up
 

5113
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,030
they chop up
the genetic code to say okay this is the

5114
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
the genetic code to say okay this is the
 

5115
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,110
the genetic code to say okay this is the
antibody that i'm going to form for this

5116
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,120
antibody that i'm going to form for this
 

5117
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,590
antibody that i'm going to form for this
pathogen and you might form if you get a

5118
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:27,600
pathogen and you might form if you get a
 

5119
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,590
pathogen and you might form if you get a
coronavirus for example

5120
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:29,600
coronavirus for example
 

5121
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,110
coronavirus for example
you might form hundreds of different

5122
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,120
you might form hundreds of different
 

5123
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,030
you might form hundreds of different
antibodies not just one antibody against

5124
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,040
antibodies not just one antibody against
 

5125
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,390
antibodies not just one antibody against
the spike protein but hundreds of

5126
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:34,400
the spike protein but hundreds of
 

5127
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,590
the spike protein but hundreds of
different antibodies

5128
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:35,600
different antibodies
 

5129
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,229
different antibodies
against all different parts of the virus

5130
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:38,239
against all different parts of the virus
 

5131
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,750
against all different parts of the virus
so that gives this really

5132
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:39,760
so that gives this really
 

5133
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,390
so that gives this really
rich resolution of information that when

5134
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:42,400
rich resolution of information that when
 

5135
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,229
rich resolution of information that when
i then do the same thing across hundreds

5136
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:44,239
i then do the same thing across hundreds
 

5137
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:45,669
i then do the same thing across hundreds
of different pathogens some of which

5138
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:45,679
of different pathogens some of which
 

5139
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,669
of different pathogens some of which
you've seen some of which you haven't

5140
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
you've seen some of which you haven't
 

5141
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,830
you've seen some of which you haven't
um it gives you an exceedingly unique

5142
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:49,840
um it gives you an exceedingly unique
 

5143
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,669
um it gives you an exceedingly unique
fingerprint that uh

5144
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:51,679
fingerprint that uh
 

5145
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,910
fingerprint that uh
that is sufficiently stable over years

5146
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
that is sufficiently stable over years
 

5147
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,669
that is sufficiently stable over years
and years and years to

5148
01:24:55,669 --> 01:24:55,679
and years and years to
 

5149
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,430
and years and years to
essentially give you a barcode you know

5150
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:57,440
essentially give you a barcode you know
 

5151
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,430
essentially give you a barcode you know
and and i don't have to know who you are

5152
01:24:59,430 --> 01:24:59,440
and and i don't have to know who you are
 

5153
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,270
and and i don't have to know who you are
but i can know that these two specimens

5154
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,280
but i can know that these two specimens
 

5155
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,950
but i can know that these two specimens
came from the same person somewhere out

5156
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:02,960
came from the same person somewhere out
 

5157
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,229
came from the same person somewhere out
in the world

5158
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:04,239
in the world
 

5159
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,830
in the world
that's so fascinating that there's this

5160
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:05,840
that's so fascinating that there's this
 

5161
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,510
that's so fascinating that there's this
trace your

5162
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:07,520
trace your
 

5163
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,030
trace your
life story in the space of viruses

5164
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:11,040
life story in the space of viruses
 

5165
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,110
life story in the space of viruses
in the space of uh pathogen like

5166
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:15,120
in the space of uh pathogen like
 

5167
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,950
in the space of uh pathogen like
like these or you know because there's

5168
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:16,960
like these or you know because there's
 

5169
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,189
like these or you know because there's
this entire universe of these

5170
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:19,199
this entire universe of these
 

5171
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,590
this entire universe of these
organisms that are trying to destroy

5172
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:21,600
organisms that are trying to destroy
 

5173
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,110
organisms that are trying to destroy
each other

5174
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:23,120
each other
 

5175
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,030
each other
and then your little trajectory through

5176
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:25,040
and then your little trajectory through
 

5177
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,110
and then your little trajectory through
that space leaves a trace

5178
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:27,120
that space leaves a trace
 

5179
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,270
that space leaves a trace
yep and then you can look at that trace

5180
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:29,280
yep and then you can look at that trace
 

5181
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,669
yep and then you can look at that trace
that's fascinating and that

5182
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:31,679
that's fascinating and that
 

5183
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,470
that's fascinating and that
i mean there's okay that data period is

5184
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
i mean there's okay that data period is
 

5185
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,669
i mean there's okay that data period is
just fascinating and

5186
01:25:35,669 --> 01:25:35,679
just fascinating and
 

5187
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,470
just fascinating and
the vision of making that data

5188
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:38,480
the vision of making that data
 

5189
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,990
the vision of making that data
universally connected

5190
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:40,000
universally connected
 

5191
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,510
universally connected
to where you can make like infer things

5192
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:43,520
to where you can make like infer things
 

5193
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,550
to where you can make like infer things
and uh and just like with the weather is

5194
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:46,560
and uh and just like with the weather is
 

5195
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,629
and uh and just like with the weather is
really fascinating there's probably

5196
01:25:48,629 --> 01:25:48,639
really fascinating there's probably
 

5197
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,310
really fascinating there's probably
artificial intelligence applications

5198
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:50,320
artificial intelligence applications
 

5199
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,990
artificial intelligence applications
there start making predictions start

5200
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:52,000
there start making predictions start
 

5201
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,390
there start making predictions start
finding

5202
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:52,400
finding
 

5203
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,229
finding
patterns exactly we're doing a lot of

5204
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:54,239
patterns exactly we're doing a lot of
 

5205
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,390
patterns exactly we're doing a lot of
that already and and that's how had we

5206
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:56,400
that already and and that's how had we
 

5207
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,669
that already and and that's how had we
had this going you know i've been trying

5208
01:25:57,669 --> 01:25:57,679
had this going you know i've been trying
 

5209
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:00,229
had this going you know i've been trying
to get this funded for years now

5210
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:00,239
to get this funded for years now
 

5211
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,550
to get this funded for years now
and i've spoken to governments you know

5212
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:02,560
and i've spoken to governments you know
 

5213
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,470
and i've spoken to governments you know
everyone says cool idea

5214
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:04,480
everyone says cool idea
 

5215
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,910
everyone says cool idea
not going to do it you know why do we

5216
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:05,920
not going to do it you know why do we
 

5217
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:10,149
not going to do it you know why do we
need it

5218
01:26:10,149 --> 01:26:10,159

 

5219
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:12,390

and of course now you know i mean i

01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:12,400
and of course now you know i mean i

just say

01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,709
just say
you know that could have we didn't run

5244
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:36,719
you know that could have we didn't run
 

5245
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:37,910
you know that could have we didn't run
the first pcr

5246
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:37,920
the first pcr
 

5247
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,350
the first pcr
test for coronavirus until

5248
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
test for coronavirus until
 

5249
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,950
test for coronavirus until
probably a month and a half or two

5250
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:42,960
probably a month and a half or two
 

5251
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,950
probably a month and a half or two
months after the virus started

5252
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:44,960
months after the virus started
 

5253
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,709
months after the virus started
transmitting in new york city

5254
01:26:46,709 --> 01:26:46,719
transmitting in new york city
 

5255
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,229
transmitting in new york city
so it's like with the rain we didn't

5256
01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:48,239
so it's like with the rain we didn't
 

5257
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,229
so it's like with the rain we didn't
start wearing umbrella or

5258
01:26:50,229 --> 01:26:50,239
start wearing umbrella or
 

5259
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,870
start wearing umbrella or
taking out umbrellas exactly for two

5260
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:52,880
taking out umbrellas exactly for two
 

5261
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,830
taking out umbrellas exactly for two
months getting wet

5262
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:53,840
months getting wet
 

5263
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,430
months getting wet
but different than the rain we couldn't

5264
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:55,440
but different than the rain we couldn't
 

5265
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,950
but different than the rain we couldn't
actually see that it was spreading

5266
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:56,960
actually see that it was spreading
 

5267
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,070
actually see that it was spreading
right now and so andrew cuomo had no

5268
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,080
right now and so andrew cuomo had no
 

5269
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,990
right now and so andrew cuomo had no
choice but to leave the city open

5270
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:02,000
choice but to leave the city open
 

5271
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,350
choice but to leave the city open
you know there were hints that maybe the

5272
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,360
you know there were hints that maybe the
 

5273
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,110
you know there were hints that maybe the
virus was spreading in new york city

5274
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:05,120
virus was spreading in new york city
 

5275
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,550
virus was spreading in new york city
but you know he didn't have any data to

5276
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:06,560
but you know he didn't have any data to
 

5277
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,470
but you know he didn't have any data to
back it up no data

5278
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:08,480
back it up no data
 

5279
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,550
back it up no data
and so it was just week on week and week

5280
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:12,560
and so it was just week on week and week
 

5281
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,590
and so it was just week on week and week
and he didn't have any information to

5282
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:15,600
and he didn't have any information to
 

5283
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,470
and he didn't have any information to
really

5284
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:16,480
really
 

5285
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,709
really
go by to allow him to have the firepower

5286
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
go by to allow him to have the firepower
 

5287
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,310
go by to allow him to have the firepower
to say we're closing down the city

5288
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:20,320
to say we're closing down the city
 

5289
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,750
to say we're closing down the city
this is an emergency we have to stop

5290
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:21,760
this is an emergency we have to stop
 

5291
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,910
this is an emergency we have to stop
spread before it starts

5292
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:23,920
spread before it starts
 

5293
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,030
spread before it starts
uh and so they waited until the first

5294
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,040
uh and so they waited until the first
 

5295
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,149
uh and so they waited until the first
pcr tests

5296
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:28,159
pcr tests
 

5297
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,350
pcr tests
were coming about and then the moment

5298
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:29,360
were coming about and then the moment
 

5299
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,550
were coming about and then the moment
they started running a pcr test they

5300
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:30,560
they started running a pcr test they
 

5301
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,070
they started running a pcr test they
find out it's everywhere

5302
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:32,080
find out it's everywhere
 

5303
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,750
find out it's everywhere
you know and so that was a disaster

5304
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:33,760
you know and so that was a disaster
 

5305
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,990
you know and so that was a disaster
because of course new york city

5306
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,000
because of course new york city
 

5307
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,550
because of course new york city
you know it was just hit so bad because

5308
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:38,560
you know it was just hit so bad because
 

5309
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,590
you know it was just hit so bad because
nobody was

5310
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,600
nobody was
 

5311
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,910
nobody was
you know we were blind to it we didn't

5312
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:41,920
you know we were blind to it we didn't
 

5313
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,430
you know we were blind to it we didn't
have to be blind to it the nice thing

5314
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:43,440
have to be blind to it the nice thing
 

5315
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,590
have to be blind to it the nice thing

coronavirus is spreading in new york but

coronavirus is spreading in new york but
 

5349
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,350
coronavirus is spreading in new york but
there's gaps you know there's for some

there's gaps you know there's for some
 

5351
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,870
there's gaps you know there's for some
reason people aren't developing an

reason people aren't developing an
immune response to this coronavirus that

immune response to this coronavirus that
 

5355
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,149
immune response to this coronavirus that
seems to be spreading to these normal

seems to be spreading to these normal
 

5357
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:25,189
seems to be spreading to these normal
things that

5358
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:25,199
things that
 

5359
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,189
things that
you know and it just looks the profile

5360
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:27,199
you know and it just looks the profile
 

5361
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:29,110
you know and it just looks the profile
looks different

5362
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:29,120
looks different
 

5363
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,950
looks different
and we could have seen that and

5364
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:30,960
and we could have seen that and
 

5365
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,709
and we could have seen that and
immediately especially since we had an

5366
01:28:32,709 --> 01:28:32,719
immediately especially since we had an
 

5367
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:33,510
immediately especially since we had an
idea that

5368
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:33,520
idea that
 

5369
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,510
idea that
there was a novel coronavirus

5370
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:35,520
there was a novel coronavirus
 

5371
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,870
there was a novel coronavirus
circulating

01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:36,880
circulating
 

5373
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,870
circulating
in the world we could have very quickly

5374
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:38,880
in the world we could have very quickly
 

5375
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,790
in the world we could have very quickly
and easily seen hey

5376
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:40,800
and easily seen hey
 

5377
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,310
and easily seen hey
clearly we're seeing a spike of

5378
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:42,320
clearly we're seeing a spike of
 

5379
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,590
clearly we're seeing a spike of
something that looks like a known

5380
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:43,600
something that looks like a known
 

5381
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,189
something that looks like a known
coronavirus but people are responding

5382
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:45,199
coronavirus but people are responding
 

5383
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:46,870
coronavirus but people are responding
weirdly to it

5384
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:46,880
weirdly to it
 

5385
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,790
weirdly to it
our ai algorithms would have picked it

5386
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:48,800
our ai algorithms would have picked it
 

5387
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,229
our ai algorithms would have picked it
up and

5388
01:28:50,229 --> 01:28:50,239
up and
 

5389
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,070
up and
just our basic heck you could put you

5390
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:52,080
just our basic heck you could put you
 

5391
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,189
just our basic heck you could put you
could have put it in an excel

5392
01:28:53,189 --> 01:28:53,199
could have put it in an excel
 

5393
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:54,629
could have put it in an excel
spreadsheet we would have seen it

5394
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:54,639
spreadsheet we would have seen it
 

5395
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,830
spreadsheet we would have seen it
yeah so some basic visualization would

5396
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:57,840
yeah so some basic visualization would
 

5397
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:58,229
yeah so some basic visualization would
have shown

5398
01:28:58,229 --> 01:28:58,239
have shown
 

5399
01:28:58,239 --> 01:28:59,830
have shown
exactly we would have seen spikes and

5400
01:28:59,830 --> 01:28:59,840
exactly we would have seen spikes and
 

5401
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,430
exactly we would have seen spikes and
they would have been kind of like

5402
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:01,440
they would have been kind of like
 

5403
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,830
they would have been kind of like
off you know immune responses that the

5404
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:03,840
off you know immune responses that the
 

5405
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,189
off you know immune responses that the
shape of them just looked a little bit

5406
01:29:05,189 --> 01:29:05,199
shape of them just looked a little bit
 

5407
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:06,149
shape of them just looked a little bit
different

5408
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:06,159
different
 

5409
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,669
different
but they would have been growing and we

5410
01:29:07,669 --> 01:29:07,679
but they would have been growing and we
 

5411
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,350
but they would have been growing and we
would have seen it and it could have

5412
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
would have seen it and it could have
 

5413
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,030
would have seen it and it could have
saved tens of thousands of lives in new

5414
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:11,040
saved tens of thousands of lives in new
 

5415
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,709
saved tens of thousands of lives in new
york city so

5416
01:29:12,709 --> 01:29:12,719
york city so
 

5417
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:13,990
york city so
to me the fascinating question

5418
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,000
to me the fascinating question
 

5419
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,350
to me the fascinating question
everything we've talked about so both

5420
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:15,360
everything we've talked about so both
 

5421
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,990
everything we've talked about so both
the huge collection of data at scale

5422
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,000
the huge collection of data at scale
 

5423
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,510
the huge collection of data at scale
just super exciting and then the kind of

5424
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:21,520
just super exciting and then the kind of
 

5425
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,030
just super exciting and then the kind of
obvious at scale solution

5426
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:25,040
obvious at scale solution
 

5427
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,270
obvious at scale solution
to the current virus and future ones is

5428
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:27,280
to the current virus and future ones is
 

5429
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,229
to the current virus and future ones is
the

5430
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:28,239
the
 

5431
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:31,430
the
rapid testing can we talk about

5432
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:31,440
rapid testing can we talk about
 

5433
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:35,189
rapid testing can we talk about
the future of viruses that might be

5434
01:29:35,189 --> 01:29:35,199
the future of viruses that might be
 

5435
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:39,270
the future of viruses that might be
threatening the uh our very existence

5436
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:39,280
threatening the uh our very existence
 

5437
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,310
threatening the uh our very existence
sure so do you think like a future

5438
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:42,320
sure so do you think like a future
 

5439
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,350
sure so do you think like a future
natural virus can um

5440
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
natural virus can um
 

5441
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:49,030
natural virus can um
have an order of magnitude greater

5442
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:49,040
have an order of magnitude greater
 

5443
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,709
have an order of magnitude greater
effect on human civilization than

5444
01:29:50,709 --> 01:29:50,719
effect on human civilization than
 

5445
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,149
effect on human civilization than
anything we've ever seen

5446
01:29:52,149 --> 01:29:52,159
anything we've ever seen
 

5447
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:55,110
anything we've ever seen
so something that either kills all

5448
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,120
so something that either kills all
 

5449
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,070
so something that either kills all
humans

5450
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:56,080
humans
 

5451
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,430
humans
or kills i don't know

5452
01:29:59,430 --> 01:29:59,440
or kills i don't know
 

5453
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,390
or kills i don't know
60 70 percent of humans so some like

5454
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
60 70 percent of humans so some like
 

5455
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,510
60 70 percent of humans so some like
something

5456
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
something
 

5457
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,629
something
something um we can't even imagine is

5458
01:30:06,629 --> 01:30:06,639
something um we can't even imagine is
 

5459
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:07,030
something um we can't even imagine is
that

5460
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:07,040
that
 

5461
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,470
that
is that something that you think is

5462
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:08,480
is that something that you think is
 

5463
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,310
is that something that you think is
possible because it seems to have not

5464
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:10,320
possible because it seems to have not
 

5465
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,669
possible because it seems to have not
have happened yet

5466
01:30:11,669 --> 01:30:11,679
have happened yet
 

5467
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,709
have happened yet
so maybe like the entirety

5468
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:14,719
so maybe like the entirety
 

5469
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:17,189
so maybe like the entirety
whoever whoever the programmer is of the

5470
01:30:17,189 --> 01:30:17,199
whoever whoever the programmer is of the
 

5471
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:18,310
whoever whoever the programmer is of the
simulation that

5472
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:18,320
simulation that
 

5473
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,229
simulation that
sort of launched the evolution for the

5474
01:30:20,229 --> 01:30:20,239
sort of launched the evolution for the
 

5475
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,350
sort of launched the evolution for the
big bang

5476
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:21,360
big bang
 

5477
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,470
big bang
seems to not want to destroy us humans

5478
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:24,480
seems to not want to destroy us humans
 

5479
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,149
seems to not want to destroy us humans
or maybe that's the natural side effect

5480
01:30:26,149 --> 01:30:26,159
or maybe that's the natural side effect
 

5481
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,709
or maybe that's the natural side effect
of the evolutionary process that uh

5482
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:28,719
of the evolutionary process that uh
 

5483
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,790
of the evolutionary process that uh
humans are useful but do you think it's

5484
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:30,800
humans are useful but do you think it's
 

5485
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,470
humans are useful but do you think it's
possible that the evolutionary process

5486
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:32,480
possible that the evolutionary process
 

5487
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,430
possible that the evolutionary process
will produce

5488
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:33,440
will produce
 

5489
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,669
will produce
a virus that will kill all humans i

5490
01:30:35,669 --> 01:30:35,679
a virus that will kill all humans i
 

5491
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:36,870
a virus that will kill all humans i
think it could

5492
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:36,880
think it could
 

5493
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,470
think it could
i don't think it's likely and the reason

5494
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:38,480
i don't think it's likely and the reason
 

5495
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,189
i don't think it's likely and the reason
i don't think it's likely is um

5496
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:41,199
i don't think it's likely is um
 

5497
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:42,870
i don't think it's likely is um
well on the one hand it hasn't happened

01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:42,880
well on the one hand it hasn't happened

01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:53,510

people weren't particularly mobile uh

5506
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:53,520
people weren't particularly mobile uh
 

5507
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,950
people weren't particularly mobile uh
until

5509
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,830

01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:57,840
uh fairly recently uh now of course now
 

5511
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,350
uh fairly recently uh now of course now
that we have people flying back and

5512
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,360
that we have people flying back and
 

5513
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,030
that we have people flying back and
forth across the globe all the time

5514
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,040
forth across the globe all the time
 

5515
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,470

the chances of global pandemics has

5516
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:06,480
the chances of global pandemics has
 

5517
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,070
the chances of global pandemics has
escalated exponentially of course and so

5518
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:10,080
escalated exponentially of course and so
 

5519
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,350
escalated exponentially of course and so
on the one hand that's part of why it

5520
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:11,360
on the one hand that's part of why it
 

5521
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,110
on the one hand that's part of why it
hasn't happened yet we can look at

5522
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:13,120
hasn't happened yet we can look at
 

5523
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,790
hasn't happened yet we can look at
things like ebola

5524
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:14,800
things like ebola
 

5525
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,870
things like ebola
you know ebola we don't we haven't

5526
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:16,880
you know ebola we don't we haven't
 

5527
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,229
you know ebola we don't we haven't
generally had major

uh ebola epidemics in the past not

5530
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:21,440
uh ebola epidemics in the past not
 

5531
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,110
uh ebola epidemics in the past not
because ebola wasn't transmitting and

5532
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:23,120
because ebola wasn't transmitting and
 

5533
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,470
because ebola wasn't transmitting and
infecting humans

5534
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:24,480
infecting humans
 

5535
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,390
infecting humans
but because they were it was largely

5536
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:26,400
but because they were it was largely
 

5537
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,470

5539
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,350

01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360
in disconnected communities so you see
 

5541
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:31,990

out in
 

5543
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,430
out in
uh in rural parts of africa for example

01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:35,440
uh in rural parts of africa for example
 

5545
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,270
uh in rural parts of africa for example
uh in western africa you might end up

5546
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280
uh in western africa you might end up
 

5547
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,470
uh in western africa you might end up
having isolated ebola outbreaks

5548
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:40,480
having isolated ebola outbreaks
 

5549
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,950
having isolated ebola outbreaks
but there weren't connections that were

5550
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:42,960
but there weren't connections that were
 

5551
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,550
but there weren't connections that were
fast enough that would allow people to

fast enough that would allow people to
 

5553
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,590
fast enough that would allow people to
then spread it

5554
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:45,600
then spread it
 

5555
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,629
then spread it
into the cities of course we saw back in

5556
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:49,639
into the cities of course we saw back in
 

5557
01:31:49,639 --> 01:31:52,070
into the cities of course we saw back in
2014-15

01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:52,080
2014-15
 

5559
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:56,629
2014-15
a massive ebola outbreak that

5560
01:31:56,629 --> 01:31:56,639
a massive ebola outbreak that
 

5561
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:58,790
a massive ebola outbreak that
wasn't because it was a new strain of

5562
01:31:58,790 --> 01:31:58,800
wasn't because it was a new strain of
 

5563
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,310
wasn't because it was a new strain of
ebola but it was because there's

5564
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:00,320
ebola but it was because there's
 

5565
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,629
ebola but it was because there's
uh new inroads and connections between

5566
01:32:02,629 --> 01:32:02,639
uh new inroads and connections between
 

5567
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,070
uh new inroads and connections between
the communities and people

5568
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,080
the communities and people
 

5569
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,550
the communities and people
got it to the city and so we saw it

5570
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:06,560
got it to the city and so we saw it
 

5571
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,229
got it to the city and so we saw it
start to spread

5572
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,239
start to spread
 

5573
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,790
start to spread
so that should be a little bit for you

5574
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:10,800
so that should be a little bit for you
 

5575
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,270
so that should be a little bit for you
know

5576
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:11,280
know

5579
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:14,709
foreshadowing of what's to come and now
we have this

5580
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:14,719
we have this
 

5581
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:17,750
we have this
pandemic we had 2009 we have this

5582
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:17,760
pandemic we had 2009 we have this
 

5583
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,350
pandemic we had 2009 we have this
uh there is a benefit um

5584
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:21,360
uh there is a benefit um
 

5585
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,750
uh there is a benefit um
or there is sort of a natural check and

5586
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:23,760
or there is sort of a natural check and
 

5587
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,229
or there is sort of a natural check and
this is a kind of latka voltaire

this is a kind of latka voltaire

ecological systems and mathematics that
 

5593
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,350
ecological systems and mathematics that
uh if you have something that's so

01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,360
uh if you have something that's so
 

5595
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,470
uh if you have something that's so
deadly

5596

deadly
 

5597
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:38,390

people will respond uh more

5598
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:38,400
people will respond uh more
 

5599
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,149
people will respond uh more
maybe with a greater panic a greater

5600
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:40,159
maybe with a greater panic a greater
 

5601
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:41,830
maybe with a greater panic a greater
sense of panic which alone could

you know destroy humanity but at the

5604
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:44,080
you know destroy humanity but at the
 

5605
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:44,950
you know destroy humanity but at the
same time like

5606
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:44,960
same time like
 

5607
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,830
same time like
we now know that we can lock down we

5608
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:47,840
we now know that we can lock down we
 

5609
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,669
we now know that we can lock down we
know that that's possible and so if this

5610
01:32:49,669 --> 01:32:49,679
know that that's possible and so if this
 

5611
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,270
know that that's possible and so if this
was a worse virus that was actually

5612
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:51,280
was a worse virus that was actually
 

5613
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,310
was a worse virus that was actually
killing 60

5614
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:52,320
killing 60
 

5615
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,229
killing 60
of people as infecting we would lock

5616
01:32:54,229 --> 01:32:54,239
of people as infecting we would lock
 

5617
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:55,830
of people as infecting we would lock
down very quickly

5618
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:55,840
down very quickly
 

5619
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,430
down very quickly
my biggest fear though is let's say that

5620
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:57,440
my biggest fear though is let's say that
 

5621
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,350
my biggest fear though is let's say that
was happening

5622
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
was happening
 

5623
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,189
was happening
you need serious lockdowns if you're

5624
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:01,199
you need serious lockdowns if you're
 

5625
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:02,870
you need serious lockdowns if you're
going to keep things going

5626
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:02,880
going to keep things going
 

5627
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,470
going to keep things going
so the only reason we were able to keep

5628
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:04,480
so the only reason we were able to keep
 

5629
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,870
so the only reason we were able to keep
things going during our lockdowns

5630
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:06,880
things going during our lockdowns
 

5631
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,709
things going during our lockdowns
is because it wasn't so bad that we were

5632
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:08,719
is because it wasn't so bad that we were
 

5633
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:10,070
is because it wasn't so bad that we were
still able to have people work

5634
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:10,080
still able to have people work
 

5635
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,270
still able to have people work
in the in the in the grocery stores

5636

in the in the in the grocery stores
 

5637
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,790
in the in the in the grocery stores
still people working the shipping to get

the food onto the shelves
 

5641
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,390
the food onto the shelves
so on the one hand we could probably

5642
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:18,400
so on the one hand we could probably
 

5643
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,110
so on the one hand we could probably
figure how to stop the virus

5644
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:21,120
figure how to stop the virus
 

5645
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,590
figure how to stop the virus
but can we stop the virus without

5646
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:23,600
but can we stop the virus without
 

5647
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,950
but can we stop the virus without
starving

5648
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:24,960
starving
 

5649
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,629
starving
you know and i'm not sure that that if

5650
01:33:26,629 --> 01:33:26,639
you know and i'm not sure that that if
 

5651
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:28,070
you know and i'm not sure that that if
this was uh

5652
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:28,080
this was uh
 

5653
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,470
this was uh
another acute respiratory virus that say

5654
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:30,480
another acute respiratory virus that say
 

5655
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,830
another acute respiratory virus that say
had a slightly

5656
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
had a slightly
 

5657
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,310
had a slightly
say it transmitted the same way but say

5658
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:34,320
say it transmitted the same way but say
 

5659
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,910
say it transmitted the same way but say
it actually did worst damage to your

5660
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:35,920
it actually did worst damage to your
 

5661
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:36,310
it actually did worst damage to your
heart

5662
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:36,320
heart
 

5663
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,229
heart
but it was like a month later that

5664
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:38,239
but it was like a month later that
 

5665
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,550
but it was like a month later that
people start having heart attacks

5666
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:40,560
people start having heart attacks
 

5667
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,709
people start having heart attacks
uh in mass you know it's like not not

5668
01:33:42,709 --> 01:33:42,719
uh in mass you know it's like not not
 

5669
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:45,510
uh in mass you know it's like not not
just one-offs but but really severe

5670
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:45,520
just one-offs but but really severe
 

5671
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,149
just one-offs but but really severe
well that could be a serious problem for

5672
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
well that could be a serious problem for
 

5673
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:49,030
well that could be a serious problem for
humanity

5674
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:49,040
humanity
 

5675
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,629
humanity
um so so in some ways i think that there

5676
01:33:52,629 --> 01:33:52,639
um so so in some ways i think that there
 

5677
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,709
um so so in some ways i think that there
are lots of ways that we could end up

5678
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:54,719
are lots of ways that we could end up
 

5679
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,870
are lots of ways that we could end up
dying at the hand of a virus i mean

5680
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:56,880
dying at the hand of a virus i mean
 

5681
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,470
dying at the hand of a virus i mean
we're already seeing it just i mean my

5682
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:58,480
we're already seeing it just i mean my
 

5683
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,910
we're already seeing it just i mean my
fear is still

5684
01:33:59,910 --> 01:33:59,920
fear is still
 

5685
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,310
fear is still
i think coronaviruses have demonstrated

5686
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:02,320
i think coronaviruses have demonstrated
 

5687
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,550
i think coronaviruses have demonstrated
a keen ability to destroy

5688
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:04,560
a keen ability to destroy
 

5689
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,030
a keen ability to destroy
uh or to to create outbreaks that can

5690
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040
uh or to to create outbreaks that can
 

5691
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,470
uh or to to create outbreaks that can
potentially be deadly

5692
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:08,480
potentially be deadly
 

5693
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,950
potentially be deadly
to large numbers of people flu strains

5694
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:10,960
to large numbers of people flu strains
 

5695
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,950
to large numbers of people flu strains
though are still

5696
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:12,960
though are still
 

5697
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,110
though are still
by and large my concern so you think the

5698
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:15,120
by and large my concern so you think the
 

5699
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,750
by and large my concern so you think the
bad one might come from the the flu the

5700
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:17,760
bad one might come from the the flu the
 

5701
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:18,629
bad one might come from the the flu the
influenza

5702
01:34:18,629 --> 01:34:18,639
influenza
 

5703
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,629
influenza
yeah they the the replication cycle

5704
01:34:20,629 --> 01:34:20,639
yeah they the the replication cycle
 

5705
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,390
yeah they the the replication cycle
they're able to genetically recombine in

5706
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:22,400
they're able to genetically recombine in
 

5707
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,669
they're able to genetically recombine in
a way that coronal viruses

5708
01:34:23,669 --> 01:34:23,679
a way that coronal viruses
 

5709
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,910
a way that coronal viruses
aren't they have segmented genomes which

5710
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
aren't they have segmented genomes which
 

5711
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,669
aren't they have segmented genomes which
means that they can just swap out whole

5712
01:34:27,669 --> 01:34:27,679
means that they can just swap out whole
 

5713
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:29,510
means that they can just swap out whole
parts of their genomes no problem

5714
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:29,520
parts of their genomes no problem
 

5715
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,229
parts of their genomes no problem
repackage them and and then boom you

5716
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:32,239
repackage them and and then boom you
 

5717
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:35,350
repackage them and and then boom you
have a whole antigenic shift not a drift

5718
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:35,360
have a whole antigenic shift not a drift
 

5719
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,510
have a whole antigenic shift not a drift
what that means is that any on any

5720
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:37,520
what that means is that any on any
 

5721
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,870
what that means is that any on any
occasion any day of the

5722
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:38,880
occasion any day of the
 

5723
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,990
occasion any day of the
year you can have boom a new whole new

5724
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:42,000
year you can have boom a new whole new
 

5725
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,310
year you can have boom a new whole new
virus that didn't exist yesterday

5726
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:44,320
virus that didn't exist yesterday
 

5727
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,550
virus that didn't exist yesterday
and now with uh farming and and

5728
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:46,560
and now with uh farming and and
 

5729
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,470
and now with uh farming and and
industrial livestock

5730
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:48,480
industrial livestock
 

5731
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,430
industrial livestock
uh we're seeing animals and humans come

5732
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:51,440
uh we're seeing animals and humans come
 

5733
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,350
uh we're seeing animals and humans come
into contact much more

5734
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:53,360
into contact much more
 

5735
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,950
into contact much more
just the the uh the opportunities for an

5736
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:56,960
just the the uh the opportunities for an
 

5737
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,709
just the the uh the opportunities for an
influenza strain

5738
01:34:58,709 --> 01:34:58,719
influenza strain
 

5739
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,950
influenza strain
that is unique and deadly to humans uh

5740
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:00,960
that is unique and deadly to humans uh
 

5741
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:01,750
that is unique and deadly to humans uh
increases

5742
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:01,760
increases
 

5743
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,149
increases
all the while tren transmission and

5744
01:35:04,149 --> 01:35:04,159
all the while tren transmission and
 

5745
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,550
all the while tren transmission and
mobility has increased

5746
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:06,560
mobility has increased
 

5747
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,830
mobility has increased
it's just a matter of time in my opinion

5748
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:09,840
it's just a matter of time in my opinion
 

5749
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,709
it's just a matter of time in my opinion
what about from immunology perspective

5750
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:12,719
what about from immunology perspective
 

5751
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,229
what about from immunology perspective
of the idea of

5752
01:35:14,229 --> 01:35:14,239
of the idea of
 

5753
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:16,870
of the idea of
engineering a virus so not just the

5754
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:16,880
engineering a virus so not just the
 

5755
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,629
engineering a virus so not just the
virus leaking from a lab or something

5756
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:18,639
virus leaking from a lab or something
 

5757
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:22,149
virus leaking from a lab or something
but actually being able to understand

5758
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:22,159
but actually being able to understand
 

5759
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:25,109
but actually being able to understand
the protein like the everything about

5760
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:25,119
the protein like the everything about
 

5761
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:28,149
the protein like the everything about
what makes a virus enough to be able to

5762
01:35:28,149 --> 01:35:28,159
what makes a virus enough to be able to
 

5763
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:31,430
what makes a virus enough to be able to
figure out ways to uh

5764
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:31,440
figure out ways to uh
 

5765
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,790
figure out ways to uh
um maybe targeted or untargeted

5766
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:34,800
um maybe targeted or untargeted
 

5767
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,990
um maybe targeted or untargeted
attack by a first community

5768
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:38,000
attack by a first community
 

5769
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,350
attack by a first community
yeah yeah is there is that something

5770
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:41,360
yeah yeah is there is that something
 

5771
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,189
yeah yeah is there is that something
uh obviously that's somewhere on the

5772
01:35:43,189 --> 01:35:43,199
uh obviously that's somewhere on the
 

5773
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:44,790
uh obviously that's somewhere on the
list

5774
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,800
list
 

5775
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,750
list
of concerns but is that anywhere close

5776
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:47,760
of concerns but is that anywhere close
 

5777
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,149
of concerns but is that anywhere close
uh

5778
01:35:48,149 --> 01:35:48,159
uh
 

5779
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,070
uh
of the like the top 10 highlights along

5780
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:50,080
of the like the top 10 highlights along
 

5781
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,669
of the like the top 10 highlights along
with nuclear weapons and so on that we

5782
01:35:51,669 --> 01:35:51,679
with nuclear weapons and so on that we
 

5783
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:52,950
with nuclear weapons and so on that we
should be worried about

5784
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:52,960
should be worried about
 

5785
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,109
should be worried about
or is the natural pandemic the really

5786
01:35:55,109 --> 01:35:55,119
or is the natural pandemic the really
 

5787
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:55,990
or is the natural pandemic the really
the one that's

5788
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:56,000
the one that's
 

5789
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,030
the one that's
much greater concern i would say that

5790
01:35:59,030 --> 01:35:59,040
much greater concern i would say that
 

5791
01:35:59,040 --> 01:35:59,910
much greater concern i would say that
the former

5792
01:35:59,910 --> 01:35:59,920
the former
 

5793
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,950
the former
that man-made viruses and

5794
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:02,960
that man-made viruses and
 

5795
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,470
that man-made viruses and
genetically engineered viruses

5796
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:06,480
genetically engineered viruses
 

5797
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,310
genetically engineered viruses
should be right up there with the

5798
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,320
should be right up there with the
 

5799
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,990
should be right up there with the
greatest concerns for humanity

5800
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:10,000
greatest concerns for humanity
 

5801
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,709
greatest concerns for humanity
right now uh you know we know that the

5802
01:36:12,709 --> 01:36:12,719
right now uh you know we know that the
 

5803
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:13,510
right now uh you know we know that the
tools

5804
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:13,520
tools
 

5805
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,470
tools
for better or worse the tools for

5806
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:16,480
for better or worse the tools for
 

5807
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,070
for better or worse the tools for
creating a virus

5808
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,080
creating a virus
 

5809
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,590
creating a virus
are there you know yeah we can do it um

5810
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:21,600
are there you know yeah we can do it um
 

5811
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,109
are there you know yeah we can do it um
i mean heck you know the human the human

5812
01:36:25,109 --> 01:36:25,119
i mean heck you know the human the human
 

5813
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,270
i mean heck you know the human the human
species is no longer vaccinated against

5814
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,280
species is no longer vaccinated against
 

5815
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,430
species is no longer vaccinated against
smallpox i didn't get a smallpox vaccine

5816
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:29,440
smallpox i didn't get a smallpox vaccine
 

5817
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,109
smallpox i didn't get a smallpox vaccine
you didn't get a smallpox vaccine at

5818
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:31,119
you didn't get a smallpox vaccine at
 

5819
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,070
you didn't get a smallpox vaccine at
least i don't think

5820
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:32,080
least i don't think
 

5821
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:35,510
least i don't think
and uh you know so if somebody wanted to

5822
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
and uh you know so if somebody wanted to
 

5823
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,950
and uh you know so if somebody wanted to
make smallpox

5824
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:36,960
make smallpox
 

5825
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,990
make smallpox
and and uh distribute it to the world in

5826
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:40,000
and and uh distribute it to the world in
 

5827
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,629
and and uh distribute it to the world in
some way

5828
01:36:40,629 --> 01:36:40,639
some way
 

5829
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,390
some way
uh it could be exceedingly deadly

5830
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:44,400
uh it could be exceedingly deadly
 

5831
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,109
uh it could be exceedingly deadly
and uh and and detrimental to humans and

5832
01:36:47,109 --> 01:36:47,119
and uh and and detrimental to humans and
 

5833
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:48,149
and uh and and detrimental to humans and
that's not even

5834
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:48,159
that's not even
 

5835
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:51,430
that's not even
um that's not even sort of using your

5836
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:51,440
um that's not even sort of using your
 

5837
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,070
um that's not even sort of using your
imagination

5838
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:52,080
imagination
 

5839
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,669
imagination
to create a new virus that's one that we

5840
01:36:53,669 --> 01:36:53,679
to create a new virus that's one that we
 

5841
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:55,189
to create a new virus that's one that we
already have

5842
01:36:55,189 --> 01:36:55,199
already have
 

5843
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,430
already have
unlike the past when smallpox would

5844
01:36:57,430 --> 01:36:57,440
unlike the past when smallpox would
 

5845
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,189
unlike the past when smallpox would
circulate you had

5846
01:36:59,189 --> 01:36:59,199
circulate you had
 

5847
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:01,189
circulate you had
large fractions of the community that

5848
01:37:01,189 --> 01:37:01,199
large fractions of the community that
 

5849
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,430
large fractions of the community that
was already immune to it

5850
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:03,440
was already immune to it
 

5851
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,950
was already immune to it
and so it wouldn't spread or it would

5852
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:04,960
and so it wouldn't spread or it would
 

5853
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,390
and so it wouldn't spread or it would
spread a little bit slower but now we

5854
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:06,400
spread a little bit slower but now we
 

5855
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:06,709
spread a little bit slower but now we
have

5856
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
have
 

5857
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,149
have
essentially in a few years we'll have a

5858
01:37:08,149 --> 01:37:08,159
essentially in a few years we'll have a
 

5859
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:10,470
essentially in a few years we'll have a
whole global population that is

5860
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:10,480
whole global population that is
 

5861
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,390
whole global population that is
susceptible

5862
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:12,400

let's look at measles we have an entire

5864
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:14,719
let's look at measles we have an entire
 

5865
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:15,830
let's look at measles we have an entire
i mean measles

5866
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:15,840
i mean measles
 

5867
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,430
i mean measles
um i have uh you know there are some

5868
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:19,440
um i have uh you know there are some
 

5869
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,350
um i have uh you know there are some
researchers in the world right now which

5870
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:21,360
researchers in the world right now which
 

5871
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,189
researchers in the world right now which
for various reasons are working on

5872
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:23,199
for various reasons are working on
 

5873
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:24,390
for various reasons are working on
creating

5874
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:24,400
creating
 

5875
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,270
creating
a measles strain that evades immunity

5876
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:27,280
a measles strain that evades immunity
 

5877
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,030
a measles strain that evades immunity
it's not for bioterrorism at least

5878
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:29,040
it's not for bioterrorism at least
 

5879
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,950
it's not for bioterrorism at least
that's not the expectation it's for

5880
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:30,960
that's not the expectation it's for
 

5881
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,270
that's not the expectation it's for
using measles as an oncolytic virus to

5882
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:33,280
using measles as an oncolytic virus to
 

5883
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,189
using measles as an oncolytic virus to
kill cancer

5884
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:35,199
kill cancer
 

5885
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:37,350
kill cancer
and the only way you can really do that

5886
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:37,360
and the only way you can really do that
 

5887
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,270
and the only way you can really do that
is if your immune system doesn't

5888
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:39,280
is if your immune system doesn't
 

5889
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:40,709
is if your immune system doesn't
you know if you if you take a measles

5890
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:40,719
you know if you if you take a measles
 

5891
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,390
you know if you if you take a measles
virus and there's you know we don't have

5892
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
virus and there's you know we don't have
 

5893
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,430
virus and there's you know we don't have
to go into the details of why it would

5894
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,440
to go into the details of why it would
 

5895
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,790
to go into the details of why it would
work but it could work

5896
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:44,800
work but it could work
 

5897
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,030
work but it could work
measles likes to target um potentially

5898
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,040
measles likes to target um potentially
 

5899
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,950
measles likes to target um potentially
cancer cells

5900
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960
cancer cells
 

5901
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,629
cancer cells
but to get your immune system not to

5902
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:50,639
but to get your immune system not to
 

5903
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,149
but to get your immune system not to
kill off the virus if you're trying to

5904
01:37:52,149 --> 01:37:52,159
kill off the virus if you're trying to
 

5905
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:53,669
kill off the virus if you're trying to
use the virus to target it you maybe

5906
01:37:53,669 --> 01:37:53,679
use the virus to target it you maybe
 

5907
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,430
use the virus to target it you maybe
want to make it

5908
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:55,440
want to make it
 

5909
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,830
want to make it
blind to the immune system but now

5910
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:57,840
blind to the immune system but now
 

5911
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:58,709
blind to the immune system but now
imagine we took

5912
01:37:58,709 --> 01:37:58,719
imagine we took
 

5913
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:00,790
imagine we took
some virus like measles which has an r

5914
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:00,800
some virus like measles which has an r
 

5915
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,070
some virus like measles which has an r
out of 18 transmits extremely quickly

5916
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:04,080
out of 18 transmits extremely quickly
 

5917
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,070
out of 18 transmits extremely quickly
and now we have essentially let's say we

5918
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:06,080
and now we have essentially let's say we
 

5919
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,629
and now we have essentially let's say we
had a whole human race that is

5920
01:38:08,629 --> 01:38:08,639
had a whole human race that is
 

5921
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,709
had a whole human race that is
susceptible to measles and this is a

5922
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:10,719
susceptible to measles and this is a
 

5923
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:13,109
susceptible to measles and this is a
virus that spreads

5924
01:38:13,109 --> 01:38:13,119
virus that spreads
 

5925
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:14,790
virus that spreads
orders of magnitude easier than this

5926
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:14,800
orders of magnitude easier than this
 

5927
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,790
orders of magnitude easier than this
current virus

5928
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:16,800
current virus
 

5929
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,149
current virus
uh imagine if you were to plug something

5930
01:38:20,149 --> 01:38:20,159
uh imagine if you were to plug something
 

5931
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:22,950
uh imagine if you were to plug something
toxic or detrimental into that virus and

5932
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:22,960
toxic or detrimental into that virus and
 

5933
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,870
toxic or detrimental into that virus and
release it to the world

5934
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:24,880
release it to the world
 

5935
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:27,510
release it to the world
so it's possible to be both accidental

5936
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:27,520
so it's possible to be both accidental
 

5937
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,470
so it's possible to be both accidental
and

5938
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:28,480
and
 

5939
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,470
and
intentional absolutely yeah an accident

5940
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:30,480
intentional absolutely yeah an accident
 

5941
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,070
intentional absolutely yeah an accident

the concern though is okay that that's

the concern though is okay that that's
 

5983
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,470
the concern though is okay that that's
one thing but what if

one thing but what if
 

5985
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,790
one thing but what if
that virus got out on somebody's shoe

5986
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:20,800
that virus got out on somebody's shoe
 

5987
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:21,910
that virus got out on somebody's shoe
just what if

01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:21,920
just what if

01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:40,080
uh it's a serious ethical quandary we're
 

6007
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,750
uh it's a serious ethical quandary we're
in how to

01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:41,760
in how to
 

6009
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:46,390
in how to
both be prepared but also not uh

and then i thought
 

6027
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:09,030
and then i thought
proteins have a lot to do with viruses

6028

proteins have a lot to do with viruses
 

6029

01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,270
enough in this case i mean
machine learning and ai is just one way

01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:41,440
rules uh it's an empirical way to learn
 

6121
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,390
rules uh it's an empirical way to learn
rules and it's

01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,400
rules and it's
 

6123
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:47,350
rules and it's
but it's a profoundly powerful way

6124
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:47,360
but it's a profoundly powerful way
 

6125
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:50,310
but it's a profoundly powerful way
and certainly now now that we are

6126
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:50,320
and certainly now now that we are
 

6127
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,709
and certainly now now that we are
getting to a point where we can

6128
01:41:52,709 --> 01:41:52,719
getting to a point where we can
 

6129
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:55,750
getting to a point where we can
take a protein and know how it folds

6130
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:55,760
take a protein and know how it folds
 

6131
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,790
take a protein and know how it folds
uh given its sequence we can

6132
01:41:58,790 --> 01:41:58,800
uh given its sequence we can
 

6133
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,910
uh given its sequence we can
reverse engineer then we can say okay

6134
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:01,920
reverse engineer then we can say okay
 

6135
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,070
reverse engineer then we can say okay
we want a protein to fold this way what

6136
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:04,080
we want a protein to fold this way what
 

6137
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,830
we want a protein to fold this way what
does the sequence need to be

6138
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:05,840
does the sequence need to be
 

6139
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,790
does the sequence need to be
we haven't done that yet so much but

6140
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:08,800
we haven't done that yet so much but
 

6141
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:09,669
we haven't done that yet so much but
it's just the next

6142
01:42:09,669 --> 01:42:09,679
it's just the next
 

6143
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:12,550
it's just the next
iteration of all of this so let's say

6144
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:12,560
iteration of all of this so let's say
 

6145
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,870
iteration of all of this so let's say
somebody wants to develop a virus

6146
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:14,880
somebody wants to develop a virus
 

6147
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,070
somebody wants to develop a virus
it's going to start with somebody

6148
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:16,080
it's going to start with somebody
 

6149
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:18,310
it's going to start with somebody
wanting to develop a virus to to defeat

6150
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:18,320
wanting to develop a virus to to defeat
 

6151
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,189
wanting to develop a virus to to defeat
cancer

6152
01:42:19,189 --> 01:42:19,199
cancer
 

6153
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,270
cancer
something good you know and so it would

6154
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:21,280
something good you know and so it would
 

6155
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,870
something good you know and so it would
start with a lot of money

6156
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:22,880
start with a lot of money
 

6157
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,070
start with a lot of money
from the federal government you know for

6158
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:26,080
from the federal government you know for
 

6159
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,990
from the federal government you know for
all the positives that will come out of

6160
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:28,000
all the positives that will come out of
 

6161
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,430
all the positives that will come out of
it

6162
01:42:29,430 --> 01:42:29,440
it
 

6163
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:33,350
it
but we have to be really careful because

6164
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:33,360
but we have to be really careful because
 

6165
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,030
but we have to be really careful because
that will come about there's no doubt in

6166
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,040
that will come about there's no doubt in
 

6167
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,189
that will come about there's no doubt in
my mind that we will develop

6168
01:42:37,189 --> 01:42:37,199
my mind that we will develop
 

6169
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:38,470
my mind that we will develop
we're already doing it we engineer

6170
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
we're already doing it we engineer
 

6171
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,470
we're already doing it we engineer
molecules all the time for

6172
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:40,480
molecules all the time for
 

6173
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,629
molecules all the time for
specific uses oftentimes we take them

6174
01:42:42,629 --> 01:42:42,639
specific uses oftentimes we take them
 

6175
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,669
specific uses oftentimes we take them
from nature and then tweak them

6176
01:42:45,669 --> 01:42:45,679
from nature and then tweak them
 

6177
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:47,669
from nature and then tweak them
but now we can supercharge it we can

6178
01:42:47,669 --> 01:42:47,679
but now we can supercharge it we can
 

6179
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:49,270
but now we can supercharge it we can
accelerate that the pace of

6180
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:49,280
accelerate that the pace of
 

6181
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,669
accelerate that the pace of
discovery to not have it just be

01:42:51,669 --> 01:42:51,679
discovery to not have it just be
 

6183
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:54,229
discovery to not have it just be
discovery we have it be true

6184
01:42:54,229 --> 01:42:54,239

ground-up engineering let's say you're

6186
01:42:56,310 --> 01:42:56,320
ground-up engineering let's say you're
 

6187
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,990
ground-up engineering let's say you're
trying to

6188
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,000
trying to
 

6189
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,030
trying to
make a new molecule to stabilize

6190
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:01,040
make a new molecule to stabilize
 

6191
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,070
make a new molecule to stabilize
somebody with

6192
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:02,080
somebody with
 

6193
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:05,109
somebody with
some retinal disease right so we

6194
01:43:05,109 --> 01:43:05,119
some retinal disease right so we
 

6195
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:07,990
some retinal disease right so we
come up with some molecule that can

6196
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:08,000
come up with some molecule that can
 

6197
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:08,629
come up with some molecule that can
improve

6198
01:43:08,629 --> 01:43:08,639
improve
 

6199
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:10,870
improve
the stability of somebody with retinal

6200
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:10,880
the stability of somebody with retinal
 

6201
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,950

6202
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:12,960
degeneration
 

6203
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,070
degeneration
uh you know just a small tweak to that

6204
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:16,080
uh you know just a small tweak to that
 

6205
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,830
uh you know just a small tweak to that
to say make a virus that causes the

6206
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:17,840
to say make a virus that causes the
 

6207
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,189
to say make a virus that causes the
human race to become blind

6208
01:43:19,189 --> 01:43:19,199
human race to become blind
 

6209
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:20,870
human race to become blind
you know i mean it sounds really

6210
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:20,880
you know i mean it sounds really
 

6211
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,030
you know i mean it sounds really
conspiracy theoryish but

6212
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:23,040
conspiracy theoryish but
 

6213
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,830
conspiracy theoryish but
uh but it's not you know it's we're

6214
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:25,840
uh but it's not you know it's we're
 

6215
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,350
uh but it's not you know it's we're
learning so much about biology and

6216
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:27,360
learning so much about biology and
 

6217
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,870
learning so much about biology and
there's always nefarious reasons i mean

6218
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:28,880
there's always nefarious reasons i mean
 

6219
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,229
there's always nefarious reasons i mean
heck look at

6220
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:30,239
heck look at
 

6221
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:33,669
heck look at
how ai and you know just google searches

6222
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:33,679
how ai and you know just google searches
 

6223
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:36,470
how ai and you know just google searches
those can be um you know they are every

6224
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:36,480
those can be um you know they are every
 

6225
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,590
those can be um you know they are every
single day

6226
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:37,600
single day
 

6227
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,470
single day
being leveraged by nefarious actors to

6228
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,480
being leveraged by nefarious actors to
 

6229
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,750
being leveraged by nefarious actors to
take advantage of people

6230
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
take advantage of people
 

6231
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,229
take advantage of people
to steal money to do whatever it might

6232
01:43:44,229 --> 01:43:44,239
to steal money to do whatever it might
 

6233
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:45,510
to steal money to do whatever it might
be

6234
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:45,520
be
 

6235
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,870
be
eventually probably to create wars or

6236
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:48,880
eventually probably to create wars or
 

6237
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,189
eventually probably to create wars or
already to create wars and i mean i

6238
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:51,199
already to create wars and i mean i
 

6239
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:52,550
already to create wars and i mean i
don't think there's any question at this

6240
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,560
don't think there's any question at this
 

6241
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,510
don't think there's any question at this
point

6242
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:53,520
point
 

6243
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,750
point
behind disinformation campaigns and so

6244
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:55,760
behind disinformation campaigns and so
 

6245
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,510
behind disinformation campaigns and so
it's being leveraged this thing that

6246
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:57,520
it's being leveraged this thing that
 

6247
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,470
it's being leveraged this thing that
could

6248
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:58,480
could
 

6249
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,870
could
be wholly good you know it's always

6250
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:00,880
be wholly good you know it's always
 

6251
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,550
be wholly good you know it's always
going to be leveraged for bad and so how

6252
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:02,560
going to be leveraged for bad and so how
 

6253
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,910
going to be leveraged for bad and so how
do you balance that as a

6254
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:03,920
do you balance that as a
 

6255
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,550
do you balance that as a
species i'm not quite sure well the hope

6256
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:06,560
species i'm not quite sure well the hope
 

6257
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,310
species i'm not quite sure well the hope
is as you mentioned previously that

6258
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:08,320
is as you mentioned previously that
 

6259
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,590
is as you mentioned previously that
there's some

6260
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:09,600
there's some
 

6261
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,430
there's some
that we're able to also develop defense

6262
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
that we're able to also develop defense
 

6263
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,950
that we're able to also develop defense
mechanisms and there's something about

6264
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:12,960
mechanisms and there's something about
 

6265
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,790
mechanisms and there's something about
the human species that seems to keep

6266
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:14,800
the human species that seems to keep
 

6267
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,470
the human species that seems to keep
coming up with

6268
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:16,480
coming up with
 

6269
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,229
coming up with
like ways to just just like on the

6270
01:44:20,229 --> 01:44:20,239
like ways to just just like on the
 

6271
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:21,430
like ways to just just like on the
deadline

6272
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,440
deadline
 

6273
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,430
deadline
just at the last moment of figuring out

6274
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:23,440
just at the last moment of figuring out
 

6275
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,270
just at the last moment of figuring out
how to avoid

6276
01:44:25,270 --> 01:44:25,280
how to avoid
 

6277
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,390
how to avoid
destruction i think i'm

6278
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:28,400
destruction i think i'm
 

6279
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,229
destruction i think i'm
like eternally optimistic about the

6280
01:44:30,229 --> 01:44:30,239
like eternally optimistic about the
 

6281
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,629
like eternally optimistic about the
human race not destroying ourselves

6282
01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:32,639
human race not destroying ourselves
 

6283
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:34,390
human race not destroying ourselves
but you could do a lot of things that

6284
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:34,400
but you could do a lot of things that
 

6285
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,910
but you could do a lot of things that
would be very painful

6286
01:44:35,910 --> 01:44:35,920
would be very painful
 

6287
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:38,070
would be very painful
yes well we're doing it already you know

6288
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:38,080
yes well we're doing it already you know
 

6289
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:40,149
yes well we're doing it already you know
just i mean we are seeing

6290
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:40,159
just i mean we are seeing
 

6291
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:43,189
just i mean we are seeing
how our regulation today right we did

6292
01:44:43,189 --> 01:44:43,199
how our regulation today right we did
 

6293
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:43,830
how our regulation today right we did
this thing

6294
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:43,840
this thing
 

6295
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:46,470
this thing
it started as a good thing regulation of

6296
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:46,480
it started as a good thing regulation of
 

6297
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,470
it started as a good thing regulation of
medical products but now

6298
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:48,480
medical products but now
 

6299
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:52,310
medical products but now
it is uh you know unwillingly

6300
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:52,320
it is uh you know unwillingly
 

6301
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:55,189
it is uh you know unwillingly
and unintentionally harming us our

6302
01:44:55,189 --> 01:44:55,199
and unintentionally harming us our
 

6303
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,030
and unintentionally harming us our
regulatory landscape

6304
01:44:57,030 --> 01:44:57,040
regulatory landscape
 

6305
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,590
regulatory landscape
which was developed wholly for good in

6306
01:44:59,590 --> 01:44:59,600
which was developed wholly for good in
 

6307
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,470
which was developed wholly for good in
our country

6308
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480
our country
 

6309
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,950
our country
is getting in the way of us deploying a

6310
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:02,960
is getting in the way of us deploying a
 

6311
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:03,910
is getting in the way of us deploying a
tool

6312
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:03,920
tool
 

6313
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,870
tool
that could stop uh our economies from

6314
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:06,880
that could stop uh our economies from
 

6315
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,229
that could stop uh our economies from
having to be

6316
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:08,239
having to be
 

6317
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:11,270
having to be
sort of sputteringly closed that could

6318
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:11,280
sort of sputteringly closed that could
 

6319
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:11,750
sort of sputteringly closed that could
stop

6320
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:11,760
stop
 

6321
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,350
stop
deaths from happening at the rate that

6322
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:13,360
deaths from happening at the rate that
 

6323
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:14,950
deaths from happening at the rate that
they are and

6324
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:14,960
they are and
 

6325
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:18,550
they are and
it's um you know i think we will come to

6326
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:18,560
it's um you know i think we will come to
 

6327
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,149
it's um you know i think we will come to
a solution of course now we're going to

6328
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:20,159
a solution of course now we're going to
 

6329
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:21,430
a solution of course now we're going to
get the vaccine and it's going to make

6330
01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:21,440
get the vaccine and it's going to make
 

6331
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:21,910
get the vaccine and it's going to make
people

6332
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:21,920
people
 

6333
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,310
people
lose track of like why we even bother

6334
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:24,320
lose track of like why we even bother
 

6335
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,550
lose track of like why we even bother
testing which is a bad idea but

6336
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:26,560
testing which is a bad idea but
 

6337
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,310
testing which is a bad idea but
um but we're already seeing that we have

6338
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:28,320
um but we're already seeing that we have
 

6339
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,870
um but we're already seeing that we have
this amazing capacity to

6340
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:30,880
this amazing capacity to
 

6341
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,430
this amazing capacity to
um to both do damage when we don't

6342
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:33,440
um to both do damage when we don't
 

6343
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,189
um to both do damage when we don't
intend to do damage

6344
01:45:35,189 --> 01:45:35,199
intend to do damage
 

6345
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:38,229
intend to do damage
uh and and then also to pull up when we

6346
01:45:38,229 --> 01:45:38,239
uh and and then also to pull up when we
 

6347
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:39,750
uh and and then also to pull up when we
need to pull up and you know

6348
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:39,760
need to pull up and you know
 

6349
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,229
need to pull up and you know
stop complete catastrophe and so uh it's

6350
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:44,239
stop complete catastrophe and so uh it's
 

6351
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:45,750
stop complete catastrophe and so uh it's
we are an interesting species in that

6352
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:45,760
we are an interesting species in that
 

6353
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,350
we are an interesting species in that
way that's for sure

6354
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:47,360
way that's for sure
 

6355
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,270
way that's for sure
so there's a lot of young folks

6356
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:49,280
so there's a lot of young folks
 

6357
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,629
so there's a lot of young folks
undergrads

6358
01:45:50,629 --> 01:45:50,639
undergrads
 

6359
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:53,750
undergrads
grads uh they're also young uh listen to

6360
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:53,760
grads uh they're also young uh listen to
 

6361
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,629
grads uh they're also young uh listen to
this so

6362
01:45:54,629 --> 01:45:54,639
this so
 

6363
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:56,470
this so
is there you've talked about a lot of

6364
01:45:56,470 --> 01:45:56,480
is there you've talked about a lot of
 

6365
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,550
is there you've talked about a lot of
fascinating stuff that's like

6366
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:58,560
fascinating stuff that's like
 

6367
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,750
fascinating stuff that's like
there's ways that things are done

6368
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:01,760
there's ways that things are done
 

6369
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,750
there's ways that things are done
and there's actual solutions and they're

6370
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:03,760
and there's actual solutions and they're
 

6371
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,669
and there's actual solutions and they're
not always like intersecting

6372
01:46:05,669 --> 01:46:05,679
not always like intersecting
 

6373
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:08,629
not always like intersecting
do you have advice for undergraduate

6374
01:46:08,629 --> 01:46:08,639
do you have advice for undergraduate
 

6375
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,470
do you have advice for undergraduate
students or graduate students

6376
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:10,480
students or graduate students
 

6377
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:14,149
students or graduate students
or even people in high school now about

6378
01:46:14,149 --> 01:46:14,159
or even people in high school now about
 

6379
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:17,430
or even people in high school now about
a life about career of how they might be

6380
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:17,440
a life about career of how they might be
 

6381
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,390
a life about career of how they might be
able to solve

6382
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:18,400
able to solve
 

6383
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,310
able to solve
real big problems in the world how they

6384
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:20,320
real big problems in the world how they
 

6385
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,910
real big problems in the world how they
should live their life

6386

should live their life
 

6387
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,750
should live their life
in order to have a chance to solve big

6388

sometimes to give advice

6394
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:28,480
sometimes to give advice
 

6395
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,229
sometimes to give advice
because the advice that i give from my

just little things like uh when this
 

6417
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:51,510
just little things like uh when this
virus started

6418
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:51,520
virus started
 

6419
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,350

diagnostics
 

6427
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:00,870
diagnostics
so when this virus started wearing my

6428
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:00,880
so when this virus started wearing my
 

6429
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,870
so when this virus started wearing my
epidemiology hat and wearing my sort of

6430
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:02,880
epidemiology hat and wearing my sort of
 

6431

viral
outbreak hat i recognized that this was

6434
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:05,600
outbreak hat i recognized that this was
 

6435
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,950
outbreak hat i recognized that this was
going to be a big virus that was

6436
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:06,960
going to be a big virus that was
 

6437
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,430
going to be a big virus that was
important

6438
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:07,440
important
 

6439
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,590
important
at a global level even if the cdc and

6440
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:09,600
at a global level even if the cdc and
 

6441
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,270
at a global level even if the cdc and
who weren't ready to admit that it was a

6442
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:11,280
who weren't ready to admit that it was a
 

6443
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,790
who weren't ready to admit that it was a
pandemic it was obvious in

6444
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:12,800
pandemic it was obvious in
 

6445
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,109
pandemic it was obvious in
january that it was a pandemic so i

6446
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:15,119
january that it was a pandemic so i
 

6447
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,830
january that it was a pandemic so i
started trying to get a test built

6448
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:17,840
started trying to get a test built
 

6449
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,070
started trying to get a test built
at the brigham which is one of harvard's

6450
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,080
at the brigham which is one of harvard's
 

6451
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,750
at the brigham which is one of harvard's
teaching hospitals

6452
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:21,760
teaching hospitals
 

6453
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,790
teaching hospitals
i you know the the first uh

6454
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:24,800
i you know the the first uh
 

6455
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,149
i you know the the first uh
encounters i had with the upper

6456
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:26,159
encounters i had with the upper
 

6457
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:27,590
encounters i had with the upper
administration of the hospital were

6458
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:27,600
administration of the hospital were
 

6459
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:28,149
administration of the hospital were
pretty much

6460
01:47:28,149 --> 01:47:28,159
pretty much
 

6461
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,550
pretty much
no why would we do that that's silly who

6462
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:30,560
no why would we do that that's silly who
 

6463
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,430
no why would we do that that's silly who
are you

6464
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:31,440
are you
 

6465
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,590
are you
you know and i said well okay don't

6466
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:33,600
you know and i said well okay don't
 

6467
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,709
you know and i said well okay don't
believe me sure

6468
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:34,719
believe me sure
 

6469
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:37,350
believe me sure
um but i kept pushing on it uh and then

6470
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:37,360
um but i kept pushing on it uh and then
 

6471
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:37,750
um but i kept pushing on it uh and then
uh

6472
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:37,760
uh
 

6473
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,990
uh
eventually i got them to agree it was

6474
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,000
eventually i got them to agree it was
 

6475
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:40,790
eventually i got them to agree it was
really um

6476
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:40,800
really um
 

6477
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,629
really um
only a couple of weeks before the biogen

6478
01:47:42,629 --> 01:47:42,639
only a couple of weeks before the biogen
 

6479
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:43,990
only a couple of weeks before the biogen
conference happened

6480
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:44,000
conference happened
 

6481
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,750
conference happened
we started building the test i think

6482
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:45,760
we started building the test i think
 

6483
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,189
we started building the test i think
they started looking abroad and saying

6484
01:47:47,189 --> 01:47:47,199
they started looking abroad and saying
 

6485
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:48,870
they started looking abroad and saying
okay this is happening sure

6486
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:48,880
okay this is happening sure
 

6487
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,990
okay this is happening sure
like maybe he was right but

6488
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:52,000
like maybe he was right but
 

6489
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,790
like maybe he was right but
then i went a step further and i said um

6490
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:54,800
then i went a step further and i said um
 

6491
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,310
then i went a step further and i said um
we're not going to have enough tests

6492
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:56,320
we're not going to have enough tests
 

6493
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:59,750
we're not going to have enough tests
at the hospital and so uh so my ambition

6494
01:47:59,750 --> 01:47:59,760
at the hospital and so uh so my ambition
 

6495
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,669
at the hospital and so uh so my ambition
was to get a better testing program

6496
01:48:01,669 --> 01:48:01,679
was to get a better testing program
 

6497
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:02,790
was to get a better testing program
started

6498
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:02,800
started
 

6499
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,109
started
and um and so i figured what better

6500
01:48:05,109 --> 01:48:05,119
and um and so i figured what better
 

6501
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,030
and um and so i figured what better
place to scale up testing than the broad

6502
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:07,040
place to scale up testing than the broad
 

6503
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,990
place to scale up testing than the broad
institute

6504
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:08,000
institute
 

6505
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,510
institute
broad institutes is amazing you know

6506
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:09,520
broad institutes is amazing you know
 

6507
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,830
broad institutes is amazing you know
very high throughput high efficiency

6508
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:11,840
very high throughput high efficiency
 

6509
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,189
very high throughput high efficiency
research institute that does a lot of

6510
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:13,199
research institute that does a lot of
 

6511
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:15,510
research institute that does a lot of
genomic sequencing things like that

6512
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:15,520
genomic sequencing things like that
 

6513
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,430
genomic sequencing things like that
so i went to the broad and i said hey

6514
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:17,440
so i went to the broad and i said hey
 

6515
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,430
so i went to the broad and i said hey
you know there's this coronavirus

6516
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:19,440
you know there's this coronavirus
 

6517
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,189
you know there's this coronavirus
that's obviously going to impact our

6518
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:21,199
that's obviously going to impact our
 

6519
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,950
that's obviously going to impact our
society greatly

6520
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:22,960
society greatly
 

6521
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:26,149
society greatly
can we start modifying your high

6522
01:48:26,149 --> 01:48:26,159
can we start modifying your high
 

6523
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:28,310
can we start modifying your high
efficiency instruments and robots for

6524
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:28,320
efficiency instruments and robots for
 

6525
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:31,590
efficiency instruments and robots for
coronavirus testing everyone in my

6526
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:31,600
coronavirus testing everyone in my
 

6527
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,669
coronavirus testing everyone in my
in my uh orbit in the hospital world

6528
01:48:35,669 --> 01:48:35,679
in my uh orbit in the hospital world
 

6529
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:37,750
in my uh orbit in the hospital world
just said that's ridiculous you know how

6530
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:37,760
just said that's ridiculous you know how
 

6531
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,709
just said that's ridiculous you know how
could you possibly

6532
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:38,719
could you possibly
 

6533
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:41,750
could you possibly
plan to do that it's impossible you know

6534
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:41,760
plan to do that it's impossible you know
 

6535
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:42,550
plan to do that it's impossible you know
and and

6536
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:42,560
and and
 

6537
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,790
and and
to me it was like the most dead simple

6538
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:44,800
to me it was like the most dead simple
 

6539
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:45,590
to me it was like the most dead simple
thing to do

6540
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:45,600
thing to do
 

6541
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,910
thing to do
right it didn't it but the the higher

6542
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:47,920
right it didn't it but the the higher
 

6543
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,430
right it didn't it but the the higher
ups and the people who think about you

6544
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:49,440
ups and the people who think about you
 

6545
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:49,990
ups and the people who think about you
know the

6546
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:50,000
know the
 

6547
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,430
know the
i think one of the most important things

6548
01:48:51,430 --> 01:48:51,440
i think one of the most important things
 

6549
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:52,950
i think one of the most important things
is to recognize that most people in the

6550
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:52,960
is to recognize that most people in the
 

6551
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,910
is to recognize that most people in the
world

6552
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:53,920
world
 

6553
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,430
world
don't see solutions they just see

6554
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:55,440
don't see solutions they just see
 

6555
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,950
don't see solutions they just see
problems and it's because it's an easy

6556
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:56,960
problems and it's because it's an easy
 

6557
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,229
problems and it's because it's an easy
thing to do

6558
01:48:58,229 --> 01:48:58,239
thing to do
 

6559
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:01,030
thing to do
thinking of problems and how things will

6560
01:49:01,030 --> 01:49:01,040
thinking of problems and how things will
 

6561
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,470
thinking of problems and how things will
go wrong

6562
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,480
go wrong
 

6563
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,270
go wrong
is really easy because you're not coming

6564
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:05,280
is really easy because you're not coming
 

6565
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,030
is really easy because you're not coming
up with a brand new solution

6566
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:07,040
up with a brand new solution
 

6567
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,790
up with a brand new solution
and this to me was just a super simple

6568
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:08,800
and this to me was just a super simple
 

6569
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,109
and this to me was just a super simple
solution hey let's get the broad to help

6570
01:49:11,109 --> 01:49:11,119
solution hey let's get the broad to help
 

6571
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:12,830
solution hey let's get the broad to help
build tests every single hospital

6572
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:12,840
build tests every single hospital
 

6573
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,189
build tests every single hospital
director you know told me no like it's

6574

said you know mike you know you're a new

6580
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:20,800
said you know mike you know you're a new
 

6581

faculty member
your ideas you know probably will would

6584
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:25,040
your ideas you know probably will would
 

6585
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,030
your ideas you know probably will would
be right but you're too naive and young

6586
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,040
be right but you're too naive and young
 

6587
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:27,510
be right but you're too naive and young
to

6588
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:27,520
to
 

6589
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,510
to
to know that it's impossible right you

6590
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:29,520
to know that it's impossible right you
 

6591
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,950
to know that it's impossible right you
know obviously now the broad

6592
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:30,960
know obviously now the broad
 

6593
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,430
know obviously now the broad
is the highest uh throughput laboratory

6594
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:33,440
is the highest uh throughput laboratory
 

6595
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,390
is the highest uh throughput laboratory
in the country and

6596
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,400
in the country and
 

6597
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,270
in the country and
yes you know and so i think my

6598
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:37,280
yes you know and so i think my
 

6599
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,109
yes you know and so i think my
recommendation to people

6600
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:39,119
recommendation to people
 

6601
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,910
recommendation to people
is as much as possible get out of the

6602
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:41,920
is as much as possible get out of the
 

6603
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:43,510
is as much as possible get out of the
mode of thinking about things as

6604
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:43,520
mode of thinking about things as
 

6605
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,950
mode of thinking about things as
problems

6606
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:44,960
problems
 

6607
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,750
problems
sometimes you piss people off i could

6608
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:47,760
sometimes you piss people off i could
 

6609
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,430
sometimes you piss people off i could
probably use a better filter sometimes

6610
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:49,440
probably use a better filter sometimes
 

6611
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,270
probably use a better filter sometimes
to try to like be

6612
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:51,280
to try to like be
 

6613
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,070
to try to like be
not so upfront with certain things but

6614
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:54,080
not so upfront with certain things but
 

6615
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,990
not so upfront with certain things but
but it's just so crucial to always

6616
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:56,000
but it's just so crucial to always
 

6617
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,629
but it's just so crucial to always
just see to just bring like think think

6618
01:49:58,629 --> 01:49:58,639
just see to just bring like think think
 

6619
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:00,390
just see to just bring like think think
about things in new ways that that other

6620
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:00,400
about things in new ways that that other
 

6621
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,589
about things in new ways that that other
people haven't

6622
01:50:01,589 --> 01:50:01,599
people haven't
 

6623
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:02,950
people haven't
because usually there's something else

6624
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:02,960
because usually there's something else
 

6625
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,950
because usually there's something else
out there and and one of the things that

6626
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:04,960
out there and and one of the things that
 

6627
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,669
out there and and one of the things that
has been most beneficial to me which

6628
01:50:07,669 --> 01:50:07,679
has been most beneficial to me which
 

6629
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:09,990
has been most beneficial to me which
is that my my education was really broad

6630
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:10,000
is that my my education was really broad
 

6631
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,629
is that my my education was really broad
it was engineering and physics

6632
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:12,639
it was engineering and physics
 

6633
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:14,950
it was engineering and physics
and uh well and then i became a buddhist

6634
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:14,960
and uh well and then i became a buddhist
 

6635
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:16,550
and uh well and then i became a buddhist
monk for a while and so that gave me a

6636
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:16,560
monk for a while and so that gave me a
 

6637
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,310
monk for a while and so that gave me a
different perspective

6638
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:18,320
different perspective
 

6639
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,709
different perspective
but then it was medicine and immunology

6640
01:50:20,709 --> 01:50:20,719
but then it was medicine and immunology
 

6641
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:21,589
but then it was medicine and immunology
and

6642
01:50:21,589 --> 01:50:21,599
and
 

6643
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:22,950
and
and now i've brought all of it together

6644
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:22,960
and now i've brought all of it together
 

6645
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,430
and now i've brought all of it together
from a mathematics and biology and

6646
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:25,440
from a mathematics and biology and
 

6647
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,310
from a mathematics and biology and
medicine perspective and policy and

6648
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:28,320
medicine perspective and policy and
 

6649
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,070
medicine perspective and policy and
public health and i think that you know

6650
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:30,080
public health and i think that you know
 

6651
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,510
public health and i think that you know
i'm not the best in any one of these

6652
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:31,520
i'm not the best in any one of these
 

6653
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:32,790
i'm not the best in any one of these
things

6654
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:32,800
things
 

6655
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,950
things
i i recognize that there are going to be

6656
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:34,960
i i recognize that there are going to be
 

6657
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,629
i i recognize that there are going to be
geniuses out there who are just

6658
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:36,639
geniuses out there who are just
 

6659
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,310
geniuses out there who are just
worlds better than me at any one of

6660
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:38,320
worlds better than me at any one of
 

6661
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,669
worlds better than me at any one of
these things that i

6662
01:50:39,669 --> 01:50:39,679
these things that i
 

6663
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:42,629
these things that i
try to work on but my superpower is

6664
01:50:42,629 --> 01:50:42,639
try to work on but my superpower is
 

6665
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:43,830
try to work on but my superpower is
bringing them all together

6666
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:43,840
bringing them all together
 

6667
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,510
bringing them all together
you know and just thinking and that's i

6668
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,520
you know and just thinking and that's i
 

6669
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,669
you know and just thinking and that's i
think how you can really change

6670
01:50:47,669 --> 01:50:47,679
think how you can really change
 

6671
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:50,310
think how you can really change
the world um you know i don't know that

6672
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:50,320
the world um you know i don't know that
 

6673
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:51,430
the world um you know i don't know that
i'll ever change the world

6674
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:51,440
i'll ever change the world
 

6675
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:54,149
i'll ever change the world
in the way that i hope um but that's how

6676
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:54,159
in the way that i hope um but that's how
 

6677
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,189
in the way that i hope um but that's how
you can have a chance

6678
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:55,199
you can have a chance
 

6679
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:56,470
you can have a chance
yeah that's how you can have a chance

6680
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:56,480
yeah that's how you can have a chance
 

6681
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,390
yeah that's how you can have a chance
exactly and um

6682
01:50:58,390 --> 01:50:58,400
exactly and um
 

6683
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,629
exactly and um
and i think it's also what uh you know

6684
01:51:00,629 --> 01:51:00,639
and i think it's also what uh you know
 

6685
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:02,550
and i think it's also what uh you know
this to me this rapid testing program

6686
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:02,560
this to me this rapid testing program
 

6687
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:03,669
this to me this rapid testing program
like

6688
01:51:03,669 --> 01:51:03,679
like
 

6689
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:05,589
like
this is the most dead simple solution in

6690
01:51:05,589 --> 01:51:05,599
this is the most dead simple solution in
 

6691
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:06,790
this is the most dead simple solution in
the world and this literally could

6692
01:51:06,790 --> 01:51:06,800
the world and this literally could
 

6693
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:07,510
the world and this literally could
change the world

6694
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:07,520
change the world
 

6695
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,550
change the world
it could change the world it could

6696
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:08,560
it could change the world it could
 

6697
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,669
it could change the world it could
change and it is you know there's

6698
01:51:09,669 --> 01:51:09,679
change and it is you know there's
 

6699
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:11,510
change and it is you know there's
countries that are doing it now the us

6700
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:11,520
countries that are doing it now the us
 

6701
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,030
countries that are doing it now the us
isn't but i've been advising many

6702
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:13,040
isn't but i've been advising many
 

6703
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,790
isn't but i've been advising many
countries on it and

6704
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:14,800
countries on it and
 

6705
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,109
countries on it and
and i would say that you know some of

6706
01:51:17,109 --> 01:51:17,119
and i would say that you know some of
 

6707
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,270
and i would say that you know some of
the early papers that we put out

6708
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:19,280
the early papers that we put out
 

6709
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:20,790
the early papers that we put out
earlier on a lot of the things actually

6710
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:20,800
earlier on a lot of the things actually
 

6711
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,870
earlier on a lot of the things actually
are changing you don't always

6712
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:22,880
are changing you don't always
 

6713
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,310
are changing you don't always
unless you really look hard you don't

6714
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:24,320
unless you really look hard you don't
 

6715
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,669
unless you really look hard you don't
know where you're actually having an

6716
01:51:25,669 --> 01:51:25,679
know where you're actually having an
 

6717
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:26,229
know where you're actually having an
effect

6718
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:26,239
effect
 

6719
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:28,709
effect
um sometimes it's more overt than than

6720
01:51:28,709 --> 01:51:28,719
um sometimes it's more overt than than
 

6721
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:30,709
um sometimes it's more overt than than
other times

6722
01:51:30,709 --> 01:51:30,719
other times
 

6723
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:32,870
other times
in april i published a paper that was

6724
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:32,880
in april i published a paper that was
 

6725
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,790
in april i published a paper that was
saying hey with the pcr values from

6726
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:34,800
saying hey with the pcr values from
 

6727
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,149
saying hey with the pcr values from
these

6728
01:51:36,149 --> 01:51:36,159
these
 

6729
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:38,070
these
tests we need to really focus on the ct

6730
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:38,080
tests we need to really focus on the ct
 

6731
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,830
tests we need to really focus on the ct
values the actual quantitative values of

6732
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:39,840
values the actual quantitative values of
 

6733
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,470
values the actual quantitative values of
these lab-based pcr tests

6734
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:42,480
these lab-based pcr tests
 

6735
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,950
these lab-based pcr tests
at the time that all the physicians and

6736
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:44,960
at the time that all the physicians and
 

6737
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,470
at the time that all the physicians and
laboratory directors told me that was

6738
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:46,480
laboratory directors told me that was
 

6739
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,070
laboratory directors told me that was
stupid you know why would you do that

6740
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,080
stupid you know why would you do that
 

6741
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,070
stupid you know why would you do that
they're not accurate enough and and of

6742
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:50,080
they're not accurate enough and and of
 

6743
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,109
they're not accurate enough and and of
course now it's

6744
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:51,119
course now it's
 

6745
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:53,430
course now it's
headline news that you know florida they

6746
01:51:53,430 --> 01:51:53,440
headline news that you know florida they
 

6747
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:54,629
headline news that you know florida they
just mandated

6748
01:51:54,629 --> 01:51:54,639
just mandated
 

6749
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:56,470
just mandated
reporting out the ct values of these

6750
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:56,480
reporting out the ct values of these
 

6751
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,229
reporting out the ct values of these
tests because there's a real utility of

6752
01:51:58,229 --> 01:51:58,239
tests because there's a real utility of
 

6753
01:51:58,239 --> 01:51:58,790
tests because there's a real utility of
them

6754
01:51:58,790 --> 01:51:58,800
them
 

6755
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,390
them
you can understand public health from it

6756
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:00,400
you can understand public health from it
 

6757
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,669
you can understand public health from it
you can understand better clinical

6758
01:52:01,669 --> 01:52:01,679
you can understand better clinical
 

6759
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:03,109
you can understand better clinical
management

6760
01:52:03,109 --> 01:52:03,119
management
 

6761
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,030
management
uh you know that was a simple solution

6762
01:52:05,030 --> 01:52:05,040
uh you know that was a simple solution
 

6763
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,149
uh you know that was a simple solution
to a pretty

6764
01:52:06,149 --> 01:52:06,159
to a pretty
 

6765
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:09,830
to a pretty
difficult problem uh and it is changing

6766
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:09,840
difficult problem uh and it is changing
 

6767
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,030
difficult problem uh and it is changing
the way that we approach

6768
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,040
the way that we approach
 

6769
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,470
the way that we approach
all of the lab testing in this country

6770
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:12,480
all of the lab testing in this country
 

6771
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,470
all of the lab testing in this country
is starting to it's taken a few months

6772
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:14,480
is starting to it's taken a few months
 

6773
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:15,990
is starting to it's taken a few months
but it's starting to change because

6774

01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:18,800
of that and you know that was just me
 

6777
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,390
of that and you know that was just me
saying hey this is something we should

6778
01:52:20,390 --> 01:52:20,400
saying hey this is something we should
 

6779
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,430
saying hey this is something we should
be focusing on

6780
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:21,440
be focusing on
 

6781
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:22,950
be focusing on
got some other people involved and other

6782
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:22,960
got some other people involved and other
 

6783
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,430
got some other people involved and other
people and and now people recognize hey

6784
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:25,440
people and and now people recognize hey
 

6785
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,109
people and and now people recognize hey
there's actual value

6786
01:52:27,109 --> 01:52:27,119
there's actual value
 

6787
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:28,709
there's actual value
in this number that comes out of these

6788
01:52:28,709 --> 01:52:28,719
in this number that comes out of these
 

6789
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:31,109
in this number that comes out of these
lab-based pcr tests so sometimes it does

6790
01:52:31,109 --> 01:52:31,119
lab-based pcr tests so sometimes it does
 

6791
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:31,910
lab-based pcr tests so sometimes it does
grow

6792
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920
grow
 

6793
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,950
grow
fairly quickly um but

6794
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:34,960
fairly quickly um but
 

6795
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,189
fairly quickly um but
i think the real answer if my only my

6796
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:37,199
i think the real answer if my only my
 

6797
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,709
i think the real answer if my only my
only answer i don't know

6798
01:52:38,709 --> 01:52:38,719
only answer i don't know
 

6799
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:40,229
only answer i don't know
what you know i recognize that everyone

6800
01:52:40,229 --> 01:52:40,239
what you know i recognize that everyone
 

6801
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:41,350
what you know i recognize that everyone
some people are going to be really

6802
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,360
some people are going to be really
 

6803
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,390
some people are going to be really
focused on

6804
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:42,400
focused on
 

6805
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:45,910
focused on
and have one small but deep skill set

6806
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:45,920
and have one small but deep skill set
 

6807
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,669
and have one small but deep skill set
i go the opposite direction i try to

6808
01:52:47,669 --> 01:52:47,679
i go the opposite direction i try to
 

6809
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:50,790
i go the opposite direction i try to
bring bring things together and

6810
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:50,800
bring bring things together and
 

6811
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,950
bring bring things together and
um but the biggest thing i think is just

6812
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:52,960
um but the biggest thing i think is just
 

6813
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,310
um but the biggest thing i think is just
don't see problem don't

6814
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:54,320
don't see problem don't
 

6815
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:57,109
don't see problem don't
don't see barriers like just see like

6816
01:52:57,109 --> 01:52:57,119
don't see barriers like just see like
 

6817
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:59,030
don't see barriers like just see like
there's always a solution to a barrier

6818
01:52:59,030 --> 01:52:59,040
there's always a solution to a barrier
 

6819
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,310
there's always a solution to a barrier
if there's a barrier that literally

6820
01:53:00,310 --> 01:53:00,320
if there's a barrier that literally
 

6821
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,149
if there's a barrier that literally
means a solution to it

6822
01:53:02,149 --> 01:53:02,159
means a solution to it
 

6823
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:03,510
means a solution to it
that's why it's called a barrier and

6824
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:03,520
that's why it's called a barrier and
 

6825
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,910
that's why it's called a barrier and
just like you said most people will just

6826
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:05,920
just like you said most people will just
 

6827
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:08,390
just like you said most people will just
present to you only be thinking about it

6828
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,400
present to you only be thinking about it
 

6829
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,229
present to you only be thinking about it
and present to you with barriers

6830
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:10,239
and present to you with barriers
 

6831
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:11,750
and present to you with barriers
and so it's easy to start thinking

6832
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:11,760
and so it's easy to start thinking
 

6833
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,669
and so it's easy to start thinking
that's all there is in this world yeah

6834
01:53:13,669 --> 01:53:13,679
that's all there is in this world yeah
 

6835
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:16,310
that's all there is in this world yeah
and just think big i mean god you know

6836
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:16,320
and just think big i mean god you know

you you get a billion dollars
 

6847
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,109
you you get a billion dollars
from one big idea and then that allows

6848
01:53:27,109 --> 01:53:27,119
from one big idea and then that allows
 

6849
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:28,790
from one big idea and then that allows
you to make three new big ideas and

you to make three new big ideas and
 

6851
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,870
you to make three new big ideas and
there's a hunger for it if you think big

there was never enough time it's kind of
 

7417
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:46,149
there was never enough time it's kind of
like learning a new computer language

7418
02:02:46,149 --> 02:02:46,159
like learning a new computer language
 

7419
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:47,510
like learning a new computer language
like it gets really exciting when you

7420
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:47,520
like it gets really exciting when you
 

7421
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:48,390
like it gets really exciting when you
start coding and

7422
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:48,400
start coding and
 

7423
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:51,270
start coding and
all these new things you can do you you

7424
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:51,280
all these new things you can do you you
 

7425
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:52,310
all these new things you can do you you
learn how to

7426
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:52,320
learn how to
 

7427
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,629

much to experience life in a much richer

7428
02:02:54,629 --> 02:02:54,639
much to experience life in a much richer
 

7429

much to experience life in a much richer
way and so you never run out of ways to

7430
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:57,360
way and so you never run out of ways to
 

7431
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:58,870
way and so you never run out of ways to
go deeper and deeper and deeper in the

7432
02:02:58,870 --> 02:02:58,880
go deeper and deeper and deeper in the
 

7433
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,390
go deeper and deeper and deeper in the
way you experience even just the

7434
02:03:00,390 --> 02:03:00,400
way you experience even just the
 

7435
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,830
way you experience even just the
the drinking of the glass of water

7436
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:01,840
the drinking of the glass of water
 

7437
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,430
the drinking of the glass of water
that's that's exactly right and what

7438
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:03,440
that's that's exactly right and what
 

7439
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,430
that's that's exactly right and what
becomes kind of exhilarating is

7440
02:03:05,430 --> 02:03:05,440
becomes kind of exhilarating is
 

7441
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:07,189
becomes kind of exhilarating is
um you start to be able to predict

7442
02:03:07,189 --> 02:03:07,199
um you start to be able to predict
 

7443
02:03:07,199 --> 02:03:08,870
um you start to be able to predict
things that you never

7444
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:08,880
things that you never
 

7445
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,149
things that you never
or i don't even know if prediction's

7446
02:03:10,149 --> 02:03:10,159
or i don't even know if prediction's
 

7447
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:11,830
or i don't even know if prediction's
right word but i always think of the

7448
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:11,840
right word but i always think of the
 

7449
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,870
right word but i always think of the
matrix you know or

7450
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:12,880
matrix you know or
 

7451
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:15,350
matrix you know or
where um i forget who it was somebody

7452
02:03:15,350 --> 02:03:15,360
where um i forget who it was somebody
 

7453
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:16,550
where um i forget who it was somebody
was shooting at

7454
02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:16,560
was shooting at
 

7455
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:19,750
was shooting at
neo and he like leans backwards and he

7456
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:19,760
neo and he like leans backwards and he
 

7457
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,350
neo and he like leans backwards and he
dodges the bullets

7458
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:21,360
dodges the bullets
 

7459
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,910
dodges the bullets
um you know in some ways when you start

7460
02:03:23,910 --> 02:03:23,920
um you know in some ways when you start
 

7461
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:25,589
um you know in some ways when you start
breaking every little action that your

7462
02:03:25,589 --> 02:03:25,599
breaking every little action that your
 

7463
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:27,030
breaking every little action that your
hands do or that your feet do or

7464
02:03:27,030 --> 02:03:27,040
hands do or that your feet do or
 

7465
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:28,629
hands do or that your feet do or
your body does down into all these

7466
02:03:28,629 --> 02:03:28,639
your body does down into all these
 

7467
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:30,550
your body does down into all these
little actions that make up one what we

7468
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:30,560
little actions that make up one what we
 

7469
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:33,189
little actions that make up one what we
normally think of as an action

7470
02:03:33,189 --> 02:03:33,199
normally think of as an action
 

7471
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:34,950
normally think of as an action
all of a sudden you can start to see

7472
02:03:34,950 --> 02:03:34,960
all of a sudden you can start to see
 

7473
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:36,950
all of a sudden you can start to see
things almost in slow motion

7474
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:36,960
things almost in slow motion
 

7475
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,790
things almost in slow motion
i like to think of it very much like a

7476
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:38,800
i like to think of it very much like a
 

7477
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,149
i like to think of it very much like a
language

7478
02:03:40,149 --> 02:03:40,159
language
 

7479
02:03:40,159 --> 02:03:41,830
language
the first time somebody hears a foreign

7480
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:41,840
the first time somebody hears a foreign
 

7481
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:43,350
the first time somebody hears a foreign
language

7482
02:03:43,350 --> 02:03:43,360
language
 

7483
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:45,990
language
uh it sounds really fast usually you

7484
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,000
uh it sounds really fast usually you
 

7485
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,950
uh it sounds really fast usually you
don't hear the spaces between words

7486
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:48,960
don't hear the spaces between words
 

7487
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,069
don't hear the spaces between words
and um and it just sounds like

7488
02:03:52,069 --> 02:03:52,079
and um and it just sounds like
 

7489
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:54,069
and um and it just sounds like
just like a stream of consciousness it

7490
02:03:54,069 --> 02:03:54,079
just like a stream of consciousness it
 

7491
02:03:54,079 --> 02:03:55,669
just like a stream of consciousness it
just sounds like a stream of noises if

7492
02:03:55,669 --> 02:03:55,679
just sounds like a stream of noises if
 

7493
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:56,950
just sounds like a stream of noises if
you've never heard the language before

7494
02:03:56,950 --> 02:03:56,960
you've never heard the language before
 

7495
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:58,550
you've never heard the language before
and as you learn the language

7496
02:03:58,550 --> 02:03:58,560
and as you learn the language
 

7497
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:01,189
and as you learn the language
you hear clear breaks between words and

7498
02:04:01,189 --> 02:04:01,199
you hear clear breaks between words and
 

7499
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:02,950
you hear clear breaks between words and
it starts to gain context and

7500
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:02,960
it starts to gain context and
 

7501
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:04,790
it starts to gain context and
and all of a sudden like that what once

7502
02:04:04,790 --> 02:04:04,800
and all of a sudden like that what once
 

7503
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,709
and all of a sudden like that what once
sounded very fast

7504
02:04:06,709 --> 02:04:06,719
sounded very fast
 

7505
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:10,069
sounded very fast
slows down and it has meaning

7506
02:04:10,069 --> 02:04:10,079
slows down and it has meaning
 

7507
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:12,149
slows down and it has meaning
that's our whole life there's this whole

7508
02:04:12,149 --> 02:04:12,159
that's our whole life there's this whole
 

7509

that's our whole life there's this whole
language happening that we don't speak

7510
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:13,920
language happening that we don't speak
 

7511
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:17,030
language happening that we don't speak
generally but if you start to speak it

7512
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:17,040
generally but if you start to speak it
 

7513
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,390
generally but if you start to speak it
and if you start to learn it and you

7514

glass is actually 18 little movements
 

7519
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:25,109

02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:35,109
way the air pushes in and out of your
nose becomes

7532
02:04:35,109 --> 02:04:35,119
nose becomes
 

7533
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:38,149
nose becomes
almost interesting and what's really

7534
02:04:38,149 --> 02:04:38,159
almost interesting and what's really
 

7535
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:38,870

is the world just starts slowing down
 

7539
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:42,149
is the world just starts slowing down
and

7540
02:04:42,149 --> 02:04:42,159

it's the if there was one

7544
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:45,280
it's the if there was one
 

7545
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,350
it's the if there was one
euphoric feeling from meditation i want

7546
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:47,360
euphoric feeling from meditation i want
 

7547
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:48,790
euphoric feeling from meditation i want
to gain back

7548
02:04:48,790 --> 02:04:48,800
to gain back
 

7549
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:50,870
to gain back
but i don't think i could without really

7550
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:50,880
but i don't think i could without really
 

7551
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:51,990
but i don't think i could without really
meditating like that again

7552
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:52,000
meditating like that again
 

7553
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,790
meditating like that again
and i don't think i will um was this

7554
02:04:54,790 --> 02:04:54,800
and i don't think i will um was this
 

7555
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,870
and i don't think i will um was this
like slow motion of the world

7556
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:56,880
like slow motion of the world
 

7557
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,629
like slow motion of the world
it was finding the spaces between all

7558
02:05:00,629 --> 02:05:00,639
it was finding the spaces between all
 

7559
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:01,990
it was finding the spaces between all
the movements the same way that the

7560
02:05:01,990 --> 02:05:02,000
the movements the same way that the
 

7561
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,470
the movements the same way that the
spaces between all the words happen

7562
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:04,480
spaces between all the words happen
 

7563
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:06,149
spaces between all the words happen
and then it almost gives you this new

7564
02:05:06,149 --> 02:05:06,159
and then it almost gives you this new
 

7565
02:05:06,159 --> 02:05:07,750
and then it almost gives you this new
appreciation for everything

7566
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:07,760
appreciation for everything
 

7567
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,990
appreciation for everything

and so i think

7570
02:05:10,870 --> 02:05:10,880
and so i think
 

7571
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:14,069
and so i think
um uh it came to an abrupt end though

7572
02:05:14,069 --> 02:05:14,079
um uh it came to an abrupt end though
 

7573
02:05:14,079 --> 02:05:15,270
um uh it came to an abrupt end though
when the tsunami hit

7574
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,280
when the tsunami hit
 

7575
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:17,189
when the tsunami hit

02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:14,560
to process all of this
 

7687
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:17,030
to process all of this
since then but uh i would say it's what

7688
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:17,040
since then but uh i would say it's what

7699
02:07:28,159 --> 02:07:30,149
being in this devastating environment
just really changed my whole view of

7700
02:07:30,149 --> 02:07:30,159
just really changed my whole view of
 

7701
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:31,750
just really changed my whole view of
what sort of

7702
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:31,760
what sort of
 

7703
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:36,069
what sort of
why i was existing i suppose well

7704
02:07:36,069 --> 02:07:36,079
why i was existing i suppose well
 

7705
02:07:36,079 --> 02:07:40,470
why i was existing i suppose well
so there's this richness of life in a in

7706
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:40,480
so there's this richness of life in a in
 

7707
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:41,830
so there's this richness of life in a in
a single drink of water that you

7708
02:07:41,830 --> 02:07:41,840
a single drink of water that you
 

7709
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:42,550
a single drink of water that you
experience

7710
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:42,560
experience
 

7711
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:45,990
experience
and then there's this power of nature

7712
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:46,000
and then there's this power of nature
 

7713
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:46,390
and then there's this power of nature
that's

7714
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:46,400
that's
 

7715
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:49,189
that's
it capable to take lives of thousands of

7716
02:07:49,189 --> 02:07:49,199
it capable to take lives of thousands of
 

7717
02:07:49,199 --> 02:07:49,910
it capable to take lives of thousands of
people

7718
02:07:49,910 --> 02:07:49,920
people
 

7719
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:53,750
people
so given all that the absurdity of that

7720
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:53,760
so given all that the absurdity of that
 

7721
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:55,510
so given all that the absurdity of that
let me ask you

7722

let me ask you
 

7723
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:58,149
let me ask you
and the fact that you study things that

7724
02:07:58,149 --> 02:07:58,159
and the fact that you study things that
 

7725
02:07:58,159 --> 02:07:58,790
and the fact that you study things that
could kill

7726
02:07:58,790 --> 02:07:58,800
could kill
 

7727
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:01,270
could kill
the entirety of human civilization what

7728
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:01,280
the entirety of human civilization what
 

7729
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,589
the entirety of human civilization what
do you think is the meaning of this all

7730
02:08:03,589 --> 02:08:03,599
do you think is the meaning of this all
 

7731
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:05,350

this whole orchestra we got going on
 

7735
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,109
this whole orchestra we got going on
does it have a meaning and maybe from

7736
02:08:11,109 --> 02:08:11,119
does it have a meaning and maybe from
 

7737
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:12,470
does it have a meaning and maybe from
another perspective

7738
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:12,480
another perspective
 

7739
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:17,510
another perspective
as how does one live a meaningful life

7740
02:08:17,510 --> 02:08:17,520
as how does one live a meaningful life
 

7741
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:22,390
as how does one live a meaningful life
if such is possible

7742
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:22,400
if such is possible
 

7743
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:25,910
if such is possible
well you know from what i've seen uh

7744
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:25,920
well you know from what i've seen uh
 

7745
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:27,589
well you know from what i've seen uh
i don't think there's a single answer to

7746
02:08:27,589 --> 02:08:27,599
i don't think there's a single answer to
 

7747
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:29,589
i don't think there's a single answer to
that by any stretch one of the most

7748
02:08:29,589 --> 02:08:29,599
that by any stretch one of the most
 

7749
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:32,310
that by any stretch one of the most
interesting things about buddhism to me

7750
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:32,320
interesting things about buddhism to me
 

7751
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,350
interesting things about buddhism to me
is that

7752
02:08:33,350 --> 02:08:33,360
is that
 

7753
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:36,709
is that
the human existence is part of suffering

7754
02:08:36,709 --> 02:08:36,719
the human existence is part of suffering
 

7755
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:39,270
the human existence is part of suffering
which is very different from

7756
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:39,280
which is very different from
 

7757
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,669
which is very different from
judeo-christian existence which is that

7758
02:08:41,669 --> 02:08:41,679
judeo-christian existence which is that
 

7759
02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:45,109
judeo-christian existence which is that
human existence is

7760
02:08:45,109 --> 02:08:45,119
human existence is
 

7761
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:48,470
human existence is
something to be is a very different

7762
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:48,480
something to be is a very different
 

7763
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:50,069
something to be is a very different
you know it's something to it's a

7764
02:08:50,069 --> 02:08:50,079
you know it's something to it's a
 

7765
02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:51,510
you know it's something to it's a
there's a richness to it

7766
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:51,520
there's a richness to it
 

7767
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:54,149
there's a richness to it
in buddhism it's just another one of

7768
02:08:54,149 --> 02:08:54,159
in buddhism it's just another one of
 

7769
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:54,950
in buddhism it's just another one of
your lives

7770
02:08:54,950 --> 02:08:54,960
your lives
 

7771
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:58,069
your lives
and it but it's your opportunity to

7772
02:08:58,069 --> 02:08:58,079
and it but it's your opportunity to
 

7773
02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:01,109
and it but it's your opportunity to
attain nirvana and uh become a monk for

7774
02:09:01,109 --> 02:09:01,119
attain nirvana and uh become a monk for
 

7775
02:09:01,119 --> 02:09:03,990
attain nirvana and uh become a monk for
example and meditate to attain nirvana

7776
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:04,000
example and meditate to attain nirvana
 

7777
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,990
example and meditate to attain nirvana
uh else you kind of just go back into

7778
02:09:05,990 --> 02:09:06,000
uh else you kind of just go back into
 

7779
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,510
uh else you kind of just go back into
this i'm sorry the cycle of

7780
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
this i'm sorry the cycle of
 

7781
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:11,589
this i'm sorry the cycle of
of suffering and so you know

7782
02:09:11,589 --> 02:09:11,599
of suffering and so you know
 

7783
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:14,149
of suffering and so you know
when i look at i mean in some ways the

7784
02:09:14,149 --> 02:09:14,159
when i look at i mean in some ways the
 

7785
02:09:14,159 --> 02:09:15,350
when i look at i mean in some ways the
notion of

7786
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:15,360
notion of
 

7787
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:18,390
notion of
life and what the purpose of life is

7788
02:09:18,390 --> 02:09:18,400
life and what the purpose of life is
 

7789
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:19,990
life and what the purpose of life is
you know they're kind of completely

7790
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:20,000
you know they're kind of completely
 

7791
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,470
you know they're kind of completely
distinct this sort of western view of

7792
02:09:22,470 --> 02:09:22,480
distinct this sort of western view of
 

7793
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,550
distinct this sort of western view of
life which is that this

7794
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:24,560
life which is that this
 

7795
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:27,270
life which is that this
life is the most precious thing in the

7796
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:27,280
life is the most precious thing in the
 

7797
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:28,470
life is the most precious thing in the
world versus

7798
02:09:28,470 --> 02:09:28,480
world versus
 

7799
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:30,870
world versus
this is just another opportunity to try

7800
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:30,880
this is just another opportunity to try
 

7801
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,990
this is just another opportunity to try
to

7802
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:32,000
to
 

7803
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,990
to
get out of life i mean the whole notion

7804
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:34,000
get out of life i mean the whole notion
 

7805
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,470
get out of life i mean the whole notion
of nirvana and in buddhism it getting

7806
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:36,480
of nirvana and in buddhism it getting
 

7807
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:39,990
of nirvana and in buddhism it getting
out of this sort of cycle of suffering

7808
02:09:39,990 --> 02:09:40,000
out of this sort of cycle of suffering
 

7809
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,910
out of this sort of cycle of suffering
is to vanish you know what if you could

7810
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:41,920
is to vanish you know what if you could
 

7811
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:44,470
is to vanish you know what if you could
if you could attain nirvana

7812
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:44,480
if you could attain nirvana
 

7813
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:45,990
if you could attain nirvana
you know throughout this life the idea

7814
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:46,000
you know throughout this life the idea
 

7815
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,470
you know throughout this life the idea
is that you don't get reborn

7816
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:48,480
is that you don't get reborn
 

7817
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:51,189
is that you don't get reborn
and so when i look at these two you know

7818
02:09:51,189 --> 02:09:51,199
and so when i look at these two you know
 

7819
02:09:51,199 --> 02:09:53,350
and so when i look at these two you know
on the one hand you have

7820
02:09:53,350 --> 02:09:53,360
on the one hand you have
 

7821
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,030
on the one hand you have
christian you know christian faith and

7822
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:55,040
christian you know christian faith and
 

7823
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:56,950
christian you know christian faith and
other things that want to go to heaven

7824
02:09:56,950 --> 02:09:56,960
other things that want to go to heaven
 

7825
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:58,709
other things that want to go to heaven
and like live forever in heaven

7826
02:09:58,709 --> 02:09:58,719
and like live forever in heaven
 

7827
02:09:58,719 --> 02:10:00,709
and like live forever in heaven
then you have this other whole half of

7828
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:00,719
then you have this other whole half of
 

7829
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:01,910
then you have this other whole half of
humans who

7830
02:10:01,910 --> 02:10:01,920
humans who
 

7831
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:05,030
humans who
uh want nothing more than to get out of

7832
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:05,040
uh want nothing more than to get out of
 

7833
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:06,870
uh want nothing more than to get out of
the cycle of rebirth and just

7834
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:06,880
the cycle of rebirth and just
 

7835
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,030
the cycle of rebirth and just
poof you know not exist anymore the

7836
02:10:09,030 --> 02:10:09,040
poof you know not exist anymore the
 

7837
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:10,149
poof you know not exist anymore the
cycle of suffering

7838
02:10:10,149 --> 02:10:10,159
cycle of suffering
 

7839
02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:12,149
cycle of suffering
yeah and so how do you reconcile those

7840
02:10:12,149 --> 02:10:12,159
yeah and so how do you reconcile those
 

7841
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:13,430
yeah and so how do you reconcile those
two and i guess

7842
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:13,440
two and i guess
 

7843
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:15,830
two and i guess
do you have both of them in you do you

7844
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:15,840
do you have both of them in you do you
 

7845
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,830
do you have both of them in you do you
basically oscillate back and forth

7846
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:17,840
basically oscillate back and forth
 

7847
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:20,229
basically oscillate back and forth
i don't think i i think i just i look at

7848
02:10:20,229 --> 02:10:20,239
i don't think i i think i just i look at
 

7849
02:10:20,239 --> 02:10:20,950
i don't think i i think i just i look at
us in a

7850
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:20,960
us in a
 

7851
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:23,669
us in a
i think we're just a bunch of proteins

7852
02:10:23,669 --> 02:10:23,679
i think we're just a bunch of proteins
 

7853
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:24,870
i think we're just a bunch of proteins
um

7854
02:10:24,870 --> 02:10:24,880
um
 

7855
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:27,750
um
that you know we form and we they work

7856
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:27,760
that you know we form and we they work
 

7857
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:28,709
that you know we form and we they work
in this really

7858
02:10:28,709 --> 02:10:28,719
in this really
 

7859
02:10:28,719 --> 02:10:30,310
in this really
amazing way and they might work in a

7860
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:30,320
amazing way and they might work in a
 

7861
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:33,109
amazing way and they might work in a
bigger scale like there might be some

7862
02:10:33,109 --> 02:10:33,119
bigger scale like there might be some
 

7863
02:10:33,119 --> 02:10:34,790
bigger scale like there might be some
connections that we're not really clear

7864
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:34,800
connections that we're not really clear
 

7865
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,550
connections that we're not really clear
about but they're still biological i

7866
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:36,560
about but they're still biological i
 

7867
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:38,229
about but they're still biological i
believe that they're biological

7868
02:10:38,229 --> 02:10:38,239
believe that they're biological
 

7869
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:40,470
believe that they're biological
how do these proteins become conscious

7870
02:10:40,470 --> 02:10:40,480
how do these proteins become conscious
 

7871
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,069
how do these proteins become conscious
and why do they want to

7872
02:10:42,069 --> 02:10:42,079
and why do they want to
 

7873
02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:45,189
and why do they want to
help civilization by having at home

7874
02:10:45,189 --> 02:10:45,199
help civilization by having at home
 

7875
02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:49,189
help civilization by having at home
rapid tests at scale well i think um

7876
02:10:49,189 --> 02:10:49,199
rapid tests at scale well i think um
 

7877
02:10:49,199 --> 02:10:51,030
rapid tests at scale well i think um
i i don't have an answer to that one but

7878
02:10:51,030 --> 02:10:51,040
i i don't have an answer to that one but
 

7879
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:52,550
i i don't have an answer to that one but
i i really do believe

7880
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:52,560
i i really do believe
 

7881
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:55,350
i i really do believe
i would it's just you know this is just

7882
02:10:55,350 --> 02:10:55,360
i would it's just you know this is just
 

7883
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,229
i would it's just you know this is just
an evolution

7884
02:10:56,229 --> 02:10:56,239
an evolution
 

7885
02:10:56,239 --> 02:10:59,589
an evolution
of uh consciousness i don't

7886
02:10:59,589 --> 02:10:59,599
of uh consciousness i don't
 

7887
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:03,109
of uh consciousness i don't
i don't personally think is my feeling

7888
02:11:03,109 --> 02:11:03,119
i don't personally think is my feeling
 

7889
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:04,709
i don't personally think is my feeling
is that we're a bunch of pluses and

7890
02:11:04,709 --> 02:11:04,719
is that we're a bunch of pluses and
 

7891
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:07,030
is that we're a bunch of pluses and
minuses that have just gotten so complex

7892
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:07,040
minuses that have just gotten so complex
 

7893
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:07,589
minuses that have just gotten so complex
that

7894
02:11:07,589 --> 02:11:07,599
that
 

7895
02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:10,149
that
they're able to make rich feelings rich
