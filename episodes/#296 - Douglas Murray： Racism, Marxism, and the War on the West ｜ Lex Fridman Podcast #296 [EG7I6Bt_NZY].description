NOTE: At the 50 minute mark Douglas briefly mentions historian Niall Ferguson, and we use an incorrect overlay of Niall's photo. This is a good opportunity to mention two things. First, we have amazing folks helping with this podcast, and they might make mistakes sometimes, as do all of us. Thanks for your understanding on that. Second, Niall Ferguson is a great historian, please check out his work and his conversation with me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF6x1ftN-H4
