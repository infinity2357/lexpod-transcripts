00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,850
sometimes the terms are used in order to
tag someone with a certain ideology

128
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:34,860

they can be used positively or
 

135
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,570
they can be used positively or
negatively to just kind of say here is

136
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:44,580
negatively to just kind of say here is
 

137
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,729
negatively to just kind of say here is
the image of this individual that I have

138
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:46,739
the image of this individual that I have
 

139
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,490
the image of this individual that I have
in my mind so like Marxist is right now

140
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:49,500
in my mind so like Marxist is right now
 

141
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,949
in my mind so like Marxist is right now
very popularly being used by some on the

142
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:51,959
very popularly being used by some on the
 

143
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,390
very popularly being used by some on the
right

144
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400
right
 

145
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,809
right
um to attack Democrats there's very few

146
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:56,819
um to attack Democrats there's very few
 

147
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,790
um to attack Democrats there's very few
actual marxists certainly not in

148
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
actual marxists certainly not in
 

149
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,350
actual marxists certainly not in
positions of power in the United States

150
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,360
positions of power in the United States
 

151
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,009
positions of power in the United States
but even among the general population

152
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:03,019
but even among the general population
 

153
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,089
but even among the general population
so I think it's important to distinguish

154
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:05,099
so I think it's important to distinguish
 

155
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,890
so I think it's important to distinguish
are we defining these terms because we

the discussion or are we using them as
 

163
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,170
the discussion or are we using them as

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,650
um but the reason I stepped away was
sort of the aftermath but I did find him

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,410
sort of the aftermath but I did find him
to be someone who was abundantly clear

558
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:54,420

611

is it's so incredible that I've between
chance and timing and so different

612
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:53,700
chance and timing and so different
 

613
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,370
chance and timing and so different
things falling into a position where

614
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:55,380
things falling into a position where
 

615
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,530
things falling into a position where
this is what I do professionally and

616
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:57,540
this is what I do professionally and
 

617
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,930
this is what I do professionally and
it's a career and it's financially

618
00:11:59,930 --> 00:11:59,940
it's a career and it's financially
 

619
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,190
it's a career and it's financially
sustainable and all these different

620
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
sustainable and all these different
 

621
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,350
sustainable and all these different
things I don't want to end up taking

622
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
things I don't want to end up taking
 

623
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,009
things I don't want to end up taking
myself too seriously because I recognize

624
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:06,019
myself too seriously because I recognize
 

625
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,389
myself too seriously because I recognize
the timing and luck and all of these

626
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
the timing and luck and all of these
 

627
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,710
the timing and luck and all of these
other things and this could have gone a

628
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:09,720
other things and this could have gone a
 

629
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,810
other things and this could have gone a
completely different way so my approach

630
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:11,820
completely different way so my approach
 

631
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,150
completely different way so my approach
to a lot of this is let's not take

632
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
to a lot of this is let's not take
 

633
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,829
to a lot of this is let's not take
ourselves too seriously and in

634
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
ourselves too seriously and in
 

635
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,750
ourselves too seriously and in
particular on Twitter a platform that

636
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
particular on Twitter a platform that
 

637
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,730
particular on Twitter a platform that
you know the degree to which it should

638
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:19,740
you know the degree to which it should
 

639
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,430
you know the degree to which it should
be taken very seriously maybe has

640
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:22,440
be taken very seriously maybe has
 

641
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,190
be taken very seriously maybe has
changed over time I'm always sort of

642
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
changed over time I'm always sort of
 

643
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,750
changed over time I'm always sort of

why well first of all I believe he won
 

1397

last time
 

1399
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,630
last time
and if I start with the results from

1400
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
and if I start with the results from
 

1401
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,350
and if I start with the results from
2020 and I think to myself what has

1402
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,360
2020 and I think to myself what has
 

1403
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,110
2020 and I think to myself what has
happened since then that would push or

1404
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
happened since then that would push or
 

1405
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,269
happened since then that would push or
pull voters one way or the other

1406
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
pull voters one way or the other
 

1407
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,510
pull voters one way or the other
I have a hard time making a case that

1408
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:14,520
I have a hard time making a case that
 

1409
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,789
I have a hard time making a case that
Trump is in a better position today than

1410
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
Trump is in a better position today than
 

1411
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,310
Trump is in a better position today than
he was in November of 2020.

1412
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:19,320
he was in November of 2020.
 

1413
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,110
he was in November of 2020.
so that's kind of my starting point

1414
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
so that's kind of my starting point
 

1415
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,330
so that's kind of my starting point
which is it's a rematch of an election

1416
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:23,340
which is it's a rematch of an election
 

1417
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,250
which is it's a rematch of an election
with a known outcome

1418
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,260
with a known outcome
 

1419
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,930
with a known outcome
what has changed

1420
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:26,940
what has changed
 

1421
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,649
what has changed
and I can't make a case for

1422
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:30,659
and I can't make a case for
 

1423
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,510
and I can't make a case for
circumstances having changed in Trump's

1424
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:32,520
circumstances having changed in Trump's
 

1425
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,250
circumstances having changed in Trump's
favor to give a couple of state level

1426
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,260
favor to give a couple of state level
 

1427
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,890
favor to give a couple of state level
examples Florida seems to be kind of

1428
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:36,900
examples Florida seems to be kind of
 

1429
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,350
examples Florida seems to be kind of
moving more to the Republican side since

1430
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
moving more to the Republican side since
 

1431
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,610
moving more to the Republican side since
2020 but Trump won that state already in

1432
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:43,620
2020 but Trump won that state already in
 

1433
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,890
2020 but Trump won that state already in
2020 so it wouldn't really change the

1434
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:45,900
2020 so it wouldn't really change the
 

1435
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,830
2020 so it wouldn't really change the
outcome Arizona was close I think

1436
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:48,840
outcome Arizona was close I think
 

1437
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,930
outcome Arizona was close I think
Arizona has moved to the left since 2020

1438
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:50,940
Arizona has moved to the left since 2020
 

1439
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,230
Arizona has moved to the left since 2020
so I don't see Trump taking that one

1440
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:53,240
so I don't see Trump taking that one
 

1441
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,850
so I don't see Trump taking that one
Wisconsin I think the same sort of thing

1442
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:55,860
Wisconsin I think the same sort of thing
 

1443
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,970
Wisconsin I think the same sort of thing
applies so being very like practical

1444
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:58,980
applies so being very like practical
 

1445
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,730
applies so being very like practical
that would be kind of the start of my

1446
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:01,740
that would be kind of the start of my
 

1447
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,409
that would be kind of the start of my
reasoning

1448
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:03,419
reasoning
 

1449
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,870
reasoning
do you think Joe Biden is a better

1450
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:05,880
do you think Joe Biden is a better
 

1451
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,149
do you think Joe Biden is a better
candidate now than he was

1452
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
candidate now than he was
 

1453
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,190
candidate now than he was
in 2020.

1454
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,200
in 2020.
 

1455
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,630
in 2020.
I think

1456
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:11,640
I think
 

1457
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,850
I think
he's a worse candidate

1458
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:13,860
he's a worse candidate
 

1459
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,070
he's a worse candidate
this is going to sound ageist but I

1460
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,080
this is going to sound ageist but I
 

1461
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,110
this is going to sound ageist but I
think he's a worse candidate in that

1462
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,120
think he's a worse candidate in that
 

1463
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,590
think he's a worse candidate in that
he's even older and there already seems

1464
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600
he's even older and there already seems
 

1465
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,149
he's even older and there already seems
to be an appetite for younger candidates

1466
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:25,159
to be an appetite for younger candidates
 

1467
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,430
to be an appetite for younger candidates
particularly on the Democratic voting

1468
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:28,440
particularly on the Democratic voting
 

1469
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,010
particularly on the Democratic voting
side so he's going to be four years

1470
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,020
side so he's going to be four years
 

1471
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,409
side so he's going to be four years
older and in a sense that could be a

1472
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:33,419
older and in a sense that could be a
 

1473
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:34,549
older and in a sense that could be a
liability

1474
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
liability
 

1475
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,830
liability
however he also is going to have four

1476
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:36,840
however he also is going to have four
 

1477
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,590
however he also is going to have four
years of accomplishments now you might

1478
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
years of accomplishments now you might
 

1479
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,029
years of accomplishments now you might
not like the things he's done in which

1480
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,039
not like the things he's done in which
 

1481
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,490
not like the things he's done in which
case that would hurt him but he has

1482
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:43,500
case that would hurt him but he has
 

1483
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,409
case that would hurt him but he has
started to accumulate

1484
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:45,419
started to accumulate
 

1485
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,330
started to accumulate
um not insignificant number of

1486
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:47,340
um not insignificant number of
 

1487
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,250
um not insignificant number of
accomplishments some of the big things

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,260
accomplishments some of the big things
 

1489
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,169
accomplishments some of the big things
that are known inflation reduction act

been a lot of little things
 

1501

think Joe Biden has that much to do with

started to come down significantly the

it's a pretty okay environment for Joe
 

1519
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,350
it's a pretty okay environment for Joe
Biden with the exception that he was

1520
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,360
Biden with the exception that he was
 

1521
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,789
Biden with the exception that he was
already the oldest president to be

1522
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:25,799
already the oldest president to be
 

1523
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,789
already the oldest president to be
inaugurated in 2021 and he would beat

1524
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
inaugurated in 2021 and he would beat
 

1525
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,430
inaugurated in 2021 and he would beat
his own record in January of 2025 and I

1526
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
his own record in January of 2025 and I
 

1527
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,570
his own record in January of 2025 and I
just don't know how voters are going to

1528
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:32,580
just don't know how voters are going to
 

1529
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,649
just don't know how voters are going to
see that

see that
 

1531
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,789
see that
so in terms of just a public human being

1532
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
so in terms of just a public human being
 

1533
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,470
so in terms of just a public human being
how would you compare Trump and Biden so

1534
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:39,480
how would you compare Trump and Biden so
 

1535
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,630
how would you compare Trump and Biden so
if I were to give criticism towards

if I were to give criticism towards
 

1537
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,230
if I were to give criticism towards
trump it would be that he's chaotic

1538
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,240
trump it would be that he's chaotic
 

1539

all that kind of stuff and then the
 

1549
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,049
all that kind of stuff and then the
criticism towards Biden would be that

representative of a Nation to the world
 

1571
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:22,250
representative of a Nation to the world
and to the people of that Nation so

and to the people of that Nation so
 

1573
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,070
and to the people of that Nation so
which uh in the competition of

which uh in the competition of
 

1575
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,870
which uh in the competition of
Personality flaws which do you think is

1576
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:26,880
Personality flaws which do you think is
 

1577
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,810
Personality flaws which do you think is
more powerful you've laid out

1578
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:29,820
more powerful you've laid out
 

1579
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,110
more powerful you've laid out
fair and I believe accurate assessments

1580
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,120
fair and I believe accurate assessments
 

1581
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,889
fair and I believe accurate assessments
of elements of both of those uh men yeah

1582
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:35,899
of elements of both of those uh men yeah
 

1583
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:39,169
of elements of both of those uh men yeah
you haven't weighed in on to what degree

1584
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:39,179
you haven't weighed in on to what degree
 

1585
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,570
you haven't weighed in on to what degree
you value each of those assessments

1586
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:41,580
you value each of those assessments
 

1587
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,730
you value each of those assessments
which is where I think the the kind of

1588
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:43,740
which is where I think the the kind of
 

1589
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,029
which is where I think the the kind of
meat of this question really is

1590

of it I think it's also understanding

1778
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,440
of it I think it's also understanding
 

1779
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,089
of it I think it's also understanding
how to communicate policy ideas

1780
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:35,099
how to communicate policy ideas
 

1781
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,129
how to communicate policy ideas

1787
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,290
that segment at some point you let me
know when that is but I I do think that

1788
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:42,300
know when that is but I I do think that
 

1789
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,970
know when that is but I I do think that
there are some things Trump is very good

1790
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:43,980
there are some things Trump is very good
 

1791
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,010
there are some things Trump is very good
at and this is why it's very hard for me

1792
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,020
at and this is why it's very hard for me
 

1793
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,869
at and this is why it's very hard for me
to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it

1794
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:47,879
to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it
 

1795
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,050
to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it
takes to actually fight Trump in a

1796
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,060
takes to actually fight Trump in a
 

1797
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,869
takes to actually fight Trump in a
national primary and

1798
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:53,879
national primary and
 

1799
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:57,230
national primary and
um one of those things is Trump has a

1800
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,240
um one of those things is Trump has a
 

1801
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,089
um one of those things is Trump has a
even though he often says very strange

1802
00:34:59,089 --> 00:34:59,099
even though he often says very strange
 

1803
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,130
even though he often says very strange
things that if you transcribe them you

1804
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,140
things that if you transcribe them you
 

1805
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,810
things that if you transcribe them you
go that's what language is that that

1806
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:02,820
go that's what language is that that
 

1807
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,790
go that's what language is that that
doesn't make any sense whatsoever in the

1808
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
doesn't make any sense whatsoever in the
 

1809
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,250
doesn't make any sense whatsoever in the
moment the way he relates to

1810
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:07,260
moment the way he relates to
 

1811
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,730
moment the way he relates to
um adversaries on stage Etc is very good

1812
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:10,740
um adversaries on stage Etc is very good
 

1813
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,190
um adversaries on stage Etc is very good
in that he is very much aware of how it

1814
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,200
in that he is very much aware of how it
 

1815
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,990
in that he is very much aware of how it
is going to be seen by the audience and

1816
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,000
is going to be seen by the audience and
 

1817
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,430
is going to be seen by the audience and
so that's why a lot of times it's more

1818
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:16,440
so that's why a lot of times it's more
 

1819
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,990
so that's why a lot of times it's more
about doesn't matter that a word salad

1820
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,000
about doesn't matter that a word salad
 

1821
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,550
about doesn't matter that a word salad
came out of his mouth how he immediately

1822
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:19,560
came out of his mouth how he immediately
 

1823
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,290
came out of his mouth how he immediately
responded and related to the person

1824
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:21,300
responded and related to the person
 

1825
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,589
responded and related to the person
who's very good so I think that knowing

1826
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:24,599
who's very good so I think that knowing
 

1827
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,710
who's very good so I think that knowing
how to be good when Clips are shared all

00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:27,720
how to be good when Clips are shared all
 

1829

how to be good when Clips are shared all
the time often out of context is

1830
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:29,940
the time often out of context is
 

1831
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,210
the time often out of context is
extraordinarily important knowing how to

1832
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:32,220
extraordinarily important knowing how to
 

1833
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,250
extraordinarily important knowing how to
use social media which every election

1834
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:34,260
use social media which every election
 

1835
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,290
use social media which every election
cycle that means some nothing different

1836
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:36,300
cycle that means some nothing different
 

1837
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,970
cycle that means some nothing different
but understanding how to use social

1838
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:37,980
but understanding how to use social
 

1839
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,310
but understanding how to use social
media very important those things are

1840
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,320
media very important those things are
 

1841
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,870
media very important those things are
absolutely

1842
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:41,880
absolutely
 

1843
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,630
absolutely
so important and whether you're able to

1844
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:44,640
so important and whether you're able to
 

1845
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,870
so important and whether you're able to
do a deep dive on the deficit it's

1846
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:47,880
do a deep dive on the deficit it's
 

1847
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,150
do a deep dive on the deficit it's
certainly useful but I would say it's a

1848
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,160
certainly useful but I would say it's a
 

1849
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,770
certainly useful but I would say it's a
bad thing it's becoming less important

1850
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:51,780
bad thing it's becoming less important
 

1851
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,210
bad thing it's becoming less important
in terms of figuring out who we want to

that's it's it's interesting there's a
 

2899
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,710
that's it's it's interesting there's a
few different approaches uh to dealing

2900
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
few different approaches uh to dealing
 

2901
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,030
few different approaches uh to dealing
with that

2902
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:32,040
with that
 

2903
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,130

right and to somehow give Trump credit
 

2935
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,329
right and to somehow give Trump credit

side or the other it's not my area
expertise but it's not the open shut

2950
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
expertise but it's not the open shut

slam dunk that you know Trump likes to

2952

slam dunk that you know Trump likes to
say it is Putin didn't invade because he

00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:30,780
say it is Putin didn't invade because he
 

2955
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,190
say it is Putin didn't invade because he
knew I would crush him and okay so it's

knew I would crush him and okay so it's
 

2957
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,890
knew I would crush him and okay so it's
not obvious to me that there were

not obvious to me that there were
 

2959
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,510
not obvious to me that there were
imminently Wars that would have started

have Maga masks and you could have kept
 

3047
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:15,650

50 cents on the dollar to pay off stormy

I think he wins re-election because the

3052
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:21,540
I think he wins re-election because the
 

3053
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,950
I think he wins re-election because the
perception was and reality is aversion

3054
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:24,960
perception was and reality is aversion
 

3055
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,589
perception was and reality is aversion
of that the perception was that he was

3056
00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:27,599
of that the perception was that he was
 

3057
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,130
of that the perception was that he was
way too Cavalier about it early on uh

3058
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:31,140
way too Cavalier about it early on uh
 

3059
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,410
way too Cavalier about it early on uh
people died who didn't need to die

3060
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:33,420
people died who didn't need to die
 

3061
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,789
people died who didn't need to die
and

3062
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:34,799
and
 

3063
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,549
and
I think that it was arguably

3064
00:59:37,549 --> 00:59:37,559
I think that it was arguably
 

3065
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:40,730
I think that it was arguably
the one area where he could have all but

3066
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:40,740
the one area where he could have all but
 

3067
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,710
the one area where he could have all but
guaranteed that he was going to get

3068
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:42,720
guaranteed that he was going to get
 

3069
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,569
guaranteed that he was going to get
himself reelected well to push back on

3070
00:59:44,569 --> 00:59:44,579
himself reelected well to push back on
 

3071
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:46,010
himself reelected well to push back on
that I mean because you mentioned sort

3072
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:46,020
that I mean because you mentioned sort
 

3073
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,230
that I mean because you mentioned sort
of masks and lockdowns kind of a

3074
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:48,240
of masks and lockdowns kind of a
 

3075
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,030
of masks and lockdowns kind of a
solution to covid I didn't mention

3076
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:50,040
solution to covid I didn't mention
 

3077
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,710
solution to covid I didn't mention
lockdowns but I'm glad to talk about

3078
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:51,720
lockdowns but I'm glad to talk about
 

3079
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,789
lockdowns but I'm glad to talk about
politics like there's several solutions

3080
00:59:55,789 --> 00:59:55,799
politics like there's several solutions
 

3081
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:58,250
politics like there's several solutions
to a pandemic yeah broadly speaking and

3082
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:58,260
to a pandemic yeah broadly speaking and
 

3083
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,130
to a pandemic yeah broadly speaking and
one of them is a vaccine and so you

3084
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:01,140
one of them is a vaccine and so you
 

3085
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,950
one of them is a vaccine and so you
didn't mention that he'd Fast Track the

3086
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:03,960
didn't mention that he'd Fast Track the
 

3087
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,950
didn't mention that he'd Fast Track the
development he his administration fast

3088
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:06,960
development he his administration fast
 

3089
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,470
development he his administration fast
tracked the development of the vaccine

3090
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:09,480
tracked the development of the vaccine
 

3091
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,210
tracked the development of the vaccine
which surprising he didn't really take

3092
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:11,220
which surprising he didn't really take
 

3093
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,609
which surprising he didn't really take
much credit for I think he did I think

3094
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:13,619
much credit for I think he did I think
 

3095
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,109
much credit for I think he did I think
he tried there's a couple there's a lot

3096
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
he tried there's a couple there's a lot
 

3097
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,809
he tried there's a couple there's a lot
there well to me it seems like

3098
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:17,819
there well to me it seems like
 

3099
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:20,390
there well to me it seems like
you could make the case

3100
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
you could make the case
 

3101
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,410
you could make the case
with the Trump hand gestures that his

3102
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:24,420
with the Trump hand gestures that his
 

3103
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,089
with the Trump hand gestures that his
decisions for fast tracking the

3104
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:26,099
decisions for fast tracking the
 

3105
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:28,250
decisions for fast tracking the
development of the vaccine saved tens of

3106
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:28,260
development of the vaccine saved tens of
 

3107
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,650
development of the vaccine saved tens of
millions of lives you can make you he

3108
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:30,660
millions of lives you can make you he
 

3109
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,109
millions of lives you can make you he
could in the trumpian way make that case

3110
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:33,119
could in the trumpian way make that case
 

3111
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,630
could in the trumpian way make that case
so couple different things I know you

3112
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:35,640

01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:47,119
for a while
 

3123
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,329
for a while
until his audience turned against him

3124
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:50,339
until his audience turned against him
 

3125
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:53,030
until his audience turned against him
and then he had to draw this line where

3126
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,040
and then he had to draw this line where
 

3127
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,329
and then he had to draw this line where
he was going I made the vaccines which

it's fantastic and nobody else could
 

3135
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,990
it's fantastic and nobody else could
have done it but don't worry nobody's

actually got booed at a couple of his
 

3141
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:07,910
actually got booed at a couple of his
own rallies when talking about the

3142
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
own rallies when talking about the
 

3143

01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:10,490
do that not uh not powered empowered by
science somehow and the Deep expertise

3302
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:10,500
science somehow and the Deep expertise
 

3303
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,370
science somehow and the Deep expertise
is something like Anthony fauci uh

3304
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:13,380
is something like Anthony fauci uh
 

3305
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,609
is something like Anthony fauci uh
claims to have so like the the I just

3306
01:04:16,609 --> 01:04:16,619
claims to have so like the the I just
 

3307
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,430

I'm really troubled by um yeah the

3308
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
I'm really troubled by um yeah the
 

3309
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,990
I'm really troubled by um yeah the
distrust and science that resulted from

3310
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:21,000
distrust and science that resulted from
 

3311
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,430
distrust and science that resulted from
that and that you have to blame the

3312
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:22,440
that and that you have to blame the
 

3313
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,370
that and that you have to blame the
leaders I mean to the degree

3314
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:24,380
leaders I mean to the degree
 

3315
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,690
leaders I mean to the degree
leaders take responsibility and I think

3316
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:26,700
leaders take responsibility and I think
 

3317
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,549
leaders take responsibility and I think
Anthony fauci was the scientific leader

3318
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
Anthony fauci was the scientific leader
 

3319
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:29,809
Anthony fauci was the scientific leader
behind

3320
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:29,819
behind
 

3321
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:32,450
behind
um the American response to the pandemic

3322
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:32,460
um the American response to the pandemic
 

3323
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,950
um the American response to the pandemic
and I think he failed

3324
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:33,960
and I think he failed
 

3325
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,349
and I think he failed
uh as a as a scientist as a

3326

uh as a as a scientist as a
 

3327
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:37,910

representative of science
 

3329
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,069
representative of science
I'm less um

3330
01:04:40,069 --> 01:04:40,079
I'm less um
 

3331
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,049
I'm less um
I don't know if interested is the right

3333
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:45,049
I don't know if interested is the right

review is less interesting to me in

3336
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:47,940
review is less interesting to me in
 

3337
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,270
review is less interesting to me in
terms of what comes next than the first

3338
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:50,280
terms of what comes next than the first
 

3339
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,950
terms of what comes next than the first
part you mentioned which is the distrust

01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:51,960
part you mentioned which is the distrust
 

3341
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,430
part you mentioned which is the distrust
in science and sometimes I'll get

3342
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:55,440
in science and sometimes I'll get
 

3343
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,349
in science and sometimes I'll get
voicemails or emails from people in my

3351
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,789

different things and I tried to be
 

3375
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,510
different things and I tried to be
careful to say right now we don't have

01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,089
the quote truth about the vaccines did
change and the original again this is

related to the wild type strain did seem
to be very effective not only at

to be very effective not only at

01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,329
whom are my friends virologists and
biologists they have way more humility

3460
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:14,339
biologists they have way more humility
 

3461
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:16,430
biologists they have way more humility
than people like Anthony faggio were

3462
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:16,440
than people like Anthony faggio were
 

3463
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,010
than people like Anthony faggio were
speaking about this or the CEO of Pfizer

3464
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:19,020
speaking about this or the CEO of Pfizer
 

3465
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,750
speaking about this or the CEO of Pfizer
who were speaking about this this is the

3466
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:20,760
who were speaking about this this is the
 

3467
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,549
who were speaking about this this is the
fundamental problem here is the way

3468
01:07:22,549 --> 01:07:22,559
fundamental problem here is the way
 

3469
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,130
fundamental problem here is the way
science work is has the way science

3470
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:25,140
science work is has the way science
 

3471
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,410
science work is has the way science
works is there's usually a lot more

3472
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:27,420
works is there's usually a lot more
 

3473
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,410
works is there's usually a lot more
humility and a lot more transparency

3474
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:30,420
humility and a lot more transparency
 

3475
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,910
humility and a lot more transparency
about what we know what we don't know

3476
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:31,920
about what we know what we don't know
 

3477
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,589
about what we know what we don't know
and

3478
01:07:33,589 --> 01:07:33,599
and
 

3479
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:34,490
and
um

3480
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:34,500
um
 

3481
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,430
um
people like Anthony fauci thought it

3482
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:37,440
people like Anthony fauci thought it
 

3483
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,470
people like Anthony fauci thought it
would be beneficial for the world if he

3484
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:39,480
would be beneficial for the world if he
 

3485
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,690
would be beneficial for the world if he
speaks with more certainty

3486
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:41,700
speaks with more certainty
 

3487
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,549
speaks with more certainty
but because of the political division

3488
01:07:43,549 --> 01:07:43,559
but because of the political division
 

3489
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,710
but because of the political division
that formed around that that certainty

3490
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:45,720
that formed around that that certainty
 

3491
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,630
that formed around that that certainty
resulted in became completely

3492
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:47,640
resulted in became completely
 

3493
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,029
resulted in became completely
counterproductive that people didn't

3494
01:07:50,029 --> 01:07:50,039
counterproductive that people didn't
 

3495
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:51,650
counterproductive that people didn't
trust anything about the vaccine didn't

3496
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:51,660
trust anything about the vaccine didn't
 

3497
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,950
trust anything about the vaccine didn't
trust any institutions there were that

3498
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:54,960
trust any institutions there were that
 

3499
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,510
trust any institutions there were that
contained the experts that actually knew

3500
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:56,520
contained the experts that actually knew
 

3501
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,789
contained the experts that actually knew
what they were doing and it basically

3502
01:07:58,789 --> 01:07:58,799
what they were doing and it basically
 

3503
01:07:58,799 --> 01:07:59,930
what they were doing and it basically
didn't trust anything that was coming

3504
01:07:59,930 --> 01:07:59,940
didn't trust anything that was coming
 

3505
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,210
didn't trust anything that was coming
out of the mouths of scientists uh some

3506
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:02,220
out of the mouths of scientists uh some
 

3507
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,829
out of the mouths of scientists uh some
percent some large percent of the

3508
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:03,839
percent some large percent of the
 

3509
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,870
percent some large percent of the
population so you that made you

3510
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:05,880
population so you that made you
 

3511
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,170
population so you that made you
completely ineffective and uh

3512
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:09,180
completely ineffective and uh
 

3513
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,870
completely ineffective and uh
uh at scale as a society trying to

3514
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:11,880
uh at scale as a society trying to
 

3515
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,970
uh at scale as a society trying to
respond to a terrible pandemic and

3516
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:13,980
respond to a terrible pandemic and
 

3517
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,070
respond to a terrible pandemic and
that's where I put a lot of blame on

3518
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
that's where I put a lot of blame on
 

3519
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,309
that's where I put a lot of blame on
leaders so political leaders and

3520
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:19,319
leaders so political leaders and
 

3521
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,110
leaders so political leaders and
scientific leaders are the ones that

3522
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
scientific leaders are the ones that
 

3523
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,030
scientific leaders are the ones that
should Inspire us to all get together

3524
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
should Inspire us to all get together
 

3525
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,669
should Inspire us to all get together
and respond that that should be the case

3526
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:25,679
and respond that that should be the case
 

3527
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,130
and respond that that should be the case
for uh the pandemic that should be the

3528
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:28,140
for uh the pandemic that should be the
 

3529
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,590
for uh the pandemic that should be the
case in the time of War all this kind of

3530
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:30,600
case in the time of War all this kind of
 

3531
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,809
case in the time of War all this kind of
stuff I I generally agree with you and

3532
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:32,819
stuff I I generally agree with you and
 

3533
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:35,090
stuff I I generally agree with you and
for me it's really about shared blame

3534
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:35,100
for me it's really about shared blame
 

3535
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,289
for me it's really about shared blame
and there were a lot of different

3536
01:08:36,289 --> 01:08:36,299
and there were a lot of different
 

3537
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:38,150
and there were a lot of different
reasons why that the early communication

3538
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:38,160
reasons why that the early communication
 

3539
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,930
reasons why that the early communication
wasn't good uh part of it was I mean

3540
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:41,940
wasn't good uh part of it was I mean
 

3541
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:44,530
wasn't good uh part of it was I mean
for me I prefer accuracy rather than

3542
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:44,540
for me I prefer accuracy rather than
 

3543
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,930
for me I prefer accuracy rather than
overconfidence I would prefer listen we

3544
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:47,940
overconfidence I would prefer listen we
 

3545
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:50,150
overconfidence I would prefer listen we
don't really know right now whether

3546
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:50,160
don't really know right now whether
 

3547
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,090
don't really know right now whether
masks do X or Y what we do know is the

3548
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:53,100
masks do X or Y what we do know is the
 

3549
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,590
masks do X or Y what we do know is the
supply is really limited of this type of

3550
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:54,600
supply is really limited of this type of
 

3551
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,450
supply is really limited of this type of
mask we're going to try to keep them for

3552
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:56,460
mask we're going to try to keep them for
 

3553
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,669
mask we're going to try to keep them for
the Frontline workers I love that that's

3554
01:08:58,669 --> 01:08:58,679
the Frontline workers I love that that's
 

3555
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:01,430
the Frontline workers I love that that's
the way I want to be communicated to a

3556
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:01,440
the way I want to be communicated to a
 

3557
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,870
the way I want to be communicated to a
call was made to do it differently which

3558
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:02,880
call was made to do it differently which
 

3559
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,789
call was made to do it differently which
was to say The Masks don't actually help

3560
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
was to say The Masks don't actually help
 

3561
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,249
was to say The Masks don't actually help
yeah but the real reason is they want to

3562
01:09:07,249 --> 01:09:07,259
yeah but the real reason is they want to
 

3563
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:08,570
yeah but the real reason is they want to
keep them for healthcare workers and

3564
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:08,580
keep them for healthcare workers and
 

3565
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:10,910
keep them for healthcare workers and
then later The Masks are what's going to

3566
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:10,920
then later The Masks are what's going to
 

3567
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,610
then later The Masks are what's going to
solve I'm with I'm with you 100 I think

3568
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:13,620
solve I'm with I'm with you 100 I think
 

3569
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,610
solve I'm with I'm with you 100 I think
the other layer to it is you can't

3570
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:16,620
the other layer to it is you can't
 

3571
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,829
the other layer to it is you can't
ignore the political situation at the

3572
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:18,839
ignore the political situation at the
 

3573
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:22,130
ignore the political situation at the
time if Trump had won re-election and

3574
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:22,140
time if Trump had won re-election and
 

3575
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,050
time if Trump had won re-election and
the vaccine distribution had taken place

3576
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:24,060
the vaccine distribution had taken place
 

3577
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,970
the vaccine distribution had taken place
while Trump was President rather than

3578
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:25,980
while Trump was President rather than
 

3579
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:29,390
while Trump was President rather than
Biden my belief is that the same number

3580
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:29,400
Biden my belief is that the same number
 

3581
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,769
Biden my belief is that the same number
of Democrats would have gotten

3582
01:09:30,769 --> 01:09:30,779
of Democrats would have gotten
 

3583
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:33,050
of Democrats would have gotten
vaccinated but way more Republicans

3584
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:33,060
vaccinated but way more Republicans
 

3585
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:34,370
vaccinated but way more Republicans
would have as well because they were

3586
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:34,380
would have as well because they were
 

3587
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,470
would have as well because they were
following not science but political

3588
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:36,480
following not science but political
 

3589
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,090
following not science but political
leaders and when it was Biden in DC

3590
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:38,100
leaders and when it was Biden in DC
 

3591
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,070
leaders and when it was Biden in DC
instead of trump a lot of those people

3592
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,080
instead of trump a lot of those people
 

3593
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,050
instead of trump a lot of those people
said I don't trust the vaccine but wait

3594
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:42,060
said I don't trust the vaccine but wait
 

3595
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,749
said I don't trust the vaccine but wait
it's Trump's vaccine I thought yeah but

3596
01:09:44,749 --> 01:09:44,759
it's Trump's vaccine I thought yeah but
 

3597
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:46,189
it's Trump's vaccine I thought yeah but
something about the way Biden's

3598
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:46,199
something about the way Biden's
 

3599
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:47,749
something about the way Biden's
Distributing it so I do think you can't

3600
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:47,759
Distributing it so I do think you can't
 

3601
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,030
Distributing it so I do think you can't
ignore that political layer I agree with

3602
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,040
ignore that political layer I agree with
 

3603
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,030
ignore that political layer I agree with
you the communication was a disaster

3604
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
you the communication was a disaster
 

3605
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,189
you the communication was a disaster
let me ask you about Joe Biden what are

3606
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:55,199
let me ask you about Joe Biden what are
 

3607
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,630
let me ask you about Joe Biden what are
the strengths and weaknesses of Joe

3608
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,640
the strengths and weaknesses of Joe
 

3609
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,110
the strengths and weaknesses of Joe
Biden weaknesses I think are some of the

3610
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:00,120
Biden weaknesses I think are some of the
 

3611
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,630
Biden weaknesses I think are some of the
things you've identified he has not seen

3612
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:02,640
things you've identified he has not seen
 

3613
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,070
things you've identified he has not seen
as

3614
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:04,080
as
 

3615

01:12:59,570 --> 01:12:59,580
question it Kim jong-un's another one by
 

3759
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,830
question it Kim jong-un's another one by
the way you know there's videos of him

3760
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:00,840
the way you know there's videos of him
 

3761

uh examining a pottery you know a

3762

factory where they make plates and

3764
01:13:06,169 --> 01:13:06,179
factory where they make plates and
 

3765
01:13:06,179 --> 01:13:08,090

3769
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,209
the plates should be made I think that
in that case there's a lot of propaganda

3770
01:13:11,209 --> 01:13:11,219
in that case there's a lot of propaganda

01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:14,270
in that case there's a lot of propaganda
value to it with Trump uh I think you're

3989
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,910
um I think one of the things that's
really tough in my experience when

really tough in my experience when
 

3991
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,030
really tough in my experience when
talking to elected officials is they

01:21:25,729 --> 01:21:25,739
normal and then you just go back and
 

4239
01:21:25,739 --> 01:21:27,110
normal and then you just go back and
finish the me it sounds like shouting

4240
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:27,120
finish the me it sounds like shouting
 

4241
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,910
finish the me it sounds like shouting
I'm sort of exaggerating but very

4242
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:28,920
I'm sort of exaggerating but very
 

4243
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,770
I'm sort of exaggerating but very
animated what seemed like big

4244
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:30,780
animated what seemed like big
 

4245
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,330
animated what seemed like big
disagreements and then everybody's cool

4246
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:32,340
disagreements and then everybody's cool
 

4247
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:35,030
disagreements and then everybody's cool
yeah I wish it were more normal so maybe

4248
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,040
yeah I wish it were more normal so maybe
 

4249
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,189
yeah I wish it were more normal so maybe
the mechanism of going from shouting to

4250
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
the mechanism of going from shouting to
 

4251
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:40,070
the mechanism of going from shouting to
being cool again needs to improve

4252
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:40,080
being cool again needs to improve
 

4253
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,930
being cool again needs to improve
because maybe we can't solve the

4254
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:41,940
because maybe we can't solve the
 

4255
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:44,209
because maybe we can't solve the
shouting at each other maybe not so

4256
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:44,219
shouting at each other maybe not so
 

4257
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:46,010
shouting at each other maybe not so
maybe we need to somehow figure out the

4258
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:46,020
maybe we need to somehow figure out the
 

4259
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,130
maybe we need to somehow figure out the
de-escalation like making up I've had a

4260
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:49,140
de-escalation like making up I've had a
 

4261
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:51,110
de-escalation like making up I've had a
few uh recent fights with friends like

4262
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:51,120
few uh recent fights with friends like
 

4263
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,890
few uh recent fights with friends like
that yeah for politics no oh

4264
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:54,900
that yeah for politics no oh
 

4265
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,130
that yeah for politics no oh
no but political style emotionally

4266
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:58,140
no but political style emotionally
 

4267
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:01,850
no but political style emotionally
drenched stuff and it um

4268
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:01,860
drenched stuff and it um
 

4269
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,649
drenched stuff and it um
it was interesting

4270
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:03,659
it was interesting
 

4271
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:05,390
it was interesting
to go through that full process and then

4272
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:05,400
to go through that full process and then
 

4273
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,490
to go through that full process and then
make up at the end but it was it was a

4274
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:07,500
make up at the end but it was it was a
 

4275
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,290
make up at the end but it was it was a
process and it was a process that

4276
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:09,300
process and it was a process that
 

4277
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,390
process and it was a process that
required being in person right talking

4278
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:11,400
required being in person right talking
 

4279
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,630
required being in person right talking
through it and it was stressful the

4280
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:14,640
through it and it was stressful the
 

4281
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,790
through it and it was stressful the
whole the whole thing and maybe because

4282
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:16,800
whole the whole thing and maybe because
 

4283
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,490
whole the whole thing and maybe because
most of our interactions are online we

4284
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:19,500
most of our interactions are online we
 

4285
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,110
most of our interactions are online we
don't get a chance to do that in person

4286
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:21,120
don't get a chance to do that in person
 

4287
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,570
don't get a chance to do that in person
making up again I don't know but uh do

4288
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:23,580
making up again I don't know but uh do
 

4289
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,490
making up again I don't know but uh do
you think it's a feature or a bug of the

4290
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:25,500
you think it's a feature or a bug of the
 

4291
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,370
you think it's a feature or a bug of the
system that we're so we just hate each

4292
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:28,380
system that we're so we just hate each
 

4293
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,470
system that we're so we just hate each
well the powerful you mentioned the

4294
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:30,480
well the powerful you mentioned the
 

4295
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,630
well the powerful you mentioned the
online part I think it's if you

4296
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:32,640
online part I think it's if you
 

4297
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,550
online part I think it's if you
mentioned it earlier perfectly which is

4298
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:34,560
mentioned it earlier perfectly which is
 

4299
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,290
mentioned it earlier perfectly which is
you take

4300
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:36,300
you take
 

4301
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,169
you take
contentious political issues you create

4302
01:22:39,169 --> 01:22:39,179
contentious political issues you create
 

4303
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:43,430
contentious political issues you create
a platform that rewards controversy and

4304
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:43,440
a platform that rewards controversy and
 

4305
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,890
a platform that rewards controversy and
disagreement and limits the number of

4306
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:45,900
disagreement and limits the number of
 

4307
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,270
disagreement and limits the number of
characters you can use to express

4308
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:47,280
characters you can use to express
 

4309
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,970
characters you can use to express
yourself you kind of throw it into a

4310
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:49,980
yourself you kind of throw it into a
 

4311
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,950
yourself you kind of throw it into a
baking dish and and you know mix the

4312
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:51,960
baking dish and and you know mix the
 

4313
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,350
baking dish and and you know mix the
entire thing up it's complete in total

4314
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:54,360
entire thing up it's complete in total
 

4315
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,970
entire thing up it's complete in total
chaos and one of the things that you

4316
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:55,980
chaos and one of the things that you
 

4317
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,590
chaos and one of the things that you
know I've talked before about all the

4318
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:57,600
know I've talked before about all the
 

4319
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,510
know I've talked before about all the
angry emails and threats and stuff that

4320
01:22:59,510 --> 01:22:59,520
angry emails and threats and stuff that
 

4321
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,270
angry emails and threats and stuff that
I get I'm acutely aware that if I had

4322
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:02,280
I get I'm acutely aware that if I had
 

4323
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,130
I get I'm acutely aware that if I had
in-person conversations with most of

4324
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:04,140
in-person conversations with most of
 

4325
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,149
in-person conversations with most of
these people

4326
01:23:05,149 --> 01:23:05,159
these people
 

4327
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:06,830
these people
the conversations would basically be

4328
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:06,840
the conversations would basically be
 

4329
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,290
the conversations would basically be
like oh we have different views about

4330
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:09,300
like oh we have different views about
 

4331
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,790
like oh we have different views about
how to solve some of the problems we're

4332
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:10,800
how to solve some of the problems we're
 

4333
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,250
how to solve some of the problems we're
facing we probably agree about what the

4334
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:13,260
facing we probably agree about what the
 

4335
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,390
facing we probably agree about what the
problem is

4336
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
problem is
 

4337
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,510
problem is
and we probably share many values but on

4338
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,520
and we probably share many values but on
 

4339
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,310
and we probably share many values but on
these particular four issues we may have

4340
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:19,320
these particular four issues we may have
 

4341
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,169
these particular four issues we may have
very different views

4342
01:23:21,169 --> 01:23:21,179
very different views
 

4343
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:22,669
very different views
that's okay

4344
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:22,679
that's okay
 

4345
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:24,770
that's okay
online that's not the case

4346
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:24,780
online that's not the case
 

4347
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:28,729
online that's not the case
and it leads to you know the the mess

4348
01:23:28,729 --> 01:23:28,739
and it leads to you know the the mess
 

4349
01:23:28,739 --> 01:23:30,169
and it leads to you know the the mess
mess that we get ourselves in but I

4350
01:23:30,169 --> 01:23:30,179
mess that we get ourselves in but I
 

4351
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:31,910
mess that we get ourselves in but I
think that it's a feature of a lot of

4352
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:31,920
think that it's a feature of a lot of
 

4353
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,110
think that it's a feature of a lot of
the systems that are being used to

4354
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:33,120
the systems that are being used to

again let me Linger on that do you
 

4359
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:40,370
again let me Linger on that do you
regret some of the mockery

4360
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:40,380
regret some of the mockery
 

4361
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,310
regret some of the mockery
uh and the snarky use on Twitter and

4362

that division
 

4367
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,729
that division
I don't regret it in the sense that it's

4368
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:49,739
I don't regret it in the sense that it's
 

4369
01:23:49,739 --> 01:23:54,649
I don't regret it in the sense that it's
a calculated part or a tool that I use

4370
01:23:54,649 --> 01:23:54,659
a calculated part or a tool that I use
 

4371
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:57,470
a calculated part or a tool that I use
in addition to figuring out how to

about the different trajectories you
 

4403

your argument that I'm using titles that
 

4561
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:29,510
your argument that I'm using titles that
don't actually represent what's in the

I'm deliberately picking titles that

4570
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:37,860
I'm deliberately picking titles that
 

4571
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,970
I'm deliberately picking titles that
will Garner a larger audience and they

4572
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:40,980
will Garner a larger audience and they
 

4573
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,470
will Garner a larger audience and they
said yeah that's kind of what I mean and

4574
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:42,480
said yeah that's kind of what I mean and
 

4575
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,149
said yeah that's kind of what I mean and
I said isn't that kind of what we're all

4576
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:44,159
I said isn't that kind of what we're all
 

4577
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,770
I said isn't that kind of what we're all
doing the alternative would be choosing

4578
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:45,780
doing the alternative would be choosing
 

4579
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,990
doing the alternative would be choosing
titles to generate a smaller audience

4580
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:48,000
titles to generate a smaller audience
 

4581
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,090
titles to generate a smaller audience
which seems like a real kind of waste of

4582
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:50,100
which seems like a real kind of waste of
 

4583
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,530
which seems like a real kind of waste of
time so

4584
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:51,540
time so
 

4585
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:54,770

in a way that's comfortable but use the
 

4589
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,450
in a way that's comfortable but use the
metrics more as a tool than as something

it's very difficult which is why I have
 

4601
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,430
it's very difficult which is why I have
a Chrome extension that hides all the

it's difficult not to let it affect how

it's difficult not to let it affect how

that starts uh being affected by those
views and I think that's a really

4626
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,080
views and I think that's a really
 

4627
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,729

dangerous thing mostly it's it's

that's a really scary effect I'm really
 

4651
01:29:08,699 --> 01:29:10,790
that's a really scary effect I'm really
worried about my own mind and that so I

4652
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:10,800
worried about my own mind and that so I
 

4653
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,430
worried about my own mind and that so I
run from that aggressively

4654
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:13,440
run from that aggressively
 

4655
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,729
run from that aggressively
one of the things that I include in My

4656
01:29:16,729 --> 01:29:16,739
one of the things that I include in My
 

4657
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:19,010
one of the things that I include in My
overall approaches I don't think about

01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:19,020
overall approaches I don't think about
 

4659
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,950
overall approaches I don't think about
any One Clip I think about an entire

4660
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:21,960
any One Clip I think about an entire
 

4661
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,810
any One Clip I think about an entire
show or a week of shows or a month of

4662
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:23,820
show or a week of shows or a month of

01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,229
pretty clearly isn't going to organize
them I think if you did them you would

5168
01:38:45,229 --> 01:38:45,239
them I think if you did them you would
 

5169
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:47,450
them I think if you did them you would
have to say at what polling level do you

5170
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:47,460
have to say at what polling level do you
 

5171
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,470
have to say at what polling level do you
qualify

5172
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:48,480
qualify
 

5173
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,970
qualify
and I don't know exactly where you put

5174
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:49,980
and I don't know exactly where you put
 

5175
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:51,590
and I don't know exactly where you put
that number but I think it would be a

5176
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:51,600
that number but I think it would be a
 

5177
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,750
that number but I think it would be a
great thing to put Joe Biden on a stage

5178
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:53,760
great thing to put Joe Biden on a stage
 

5179
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,030
great thing to put Joe Biden on a stage
with if you can get what six percent

5180
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:56,040
with if you can get what six percent
 

5181
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,350
with if you can get what six percent
eight percent I'm not really sure what

5182
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:57,360
eight percent I'm not really sure what
 

5183
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,209
eight percent I'm not really sure what
the number would be I'm totally all for

5184
01:38:59,209 --> 01:38:59,219
the number would be I'm totally all for
 

5185
01:38:59,219 --> 01:38:59,930
the number would be I'm totally all for
that

5186
01:38:59,930 --> 01:38:59,940
that
 

5187
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:02,750
that
was a set of candidates at least from my

5188
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:02,760
was a set of candidates at least from my
 

5189
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:05,510
was a set of candidates at least from my
perspective so weak

5190
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:05,520
perspective so weak
 

5191
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,129

do you have do you have an understanding
 

5193
01:39:07,139 --> 01:39:08,450
do you have do you have an understanding
there's a lot of different answers to

5194
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:08,460
there's a lot of different answers to
 

5195
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,950
there's a lot of different answers to
this

5196
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:09,960
this
 

5197
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,350
this
one aspect to this which I think is more

5198
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:12,360
one aspect to this which I think is more
 

5199
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,030
one aspect to this which I think is more
of a socio-cultural thing which I've

5200
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:14,040
of a socio-cultural thing which I've
 

5201
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,729
of a socio-cultural thing which I've
recently read about to some degree is

5202
01:39:16,729 --> 01:39:16,739
recently read about to some degree is
 

5203
01:39:16,739 --> 01:39:19,790
recently read about to some degree is
the job actually turns off the people

5204
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:19,800
the job actually turns off the people
 

5205
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,070
the job actually turns off the people
who would be best at it because of what

5206
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:22,080
who would be best at it because of what
 

5207
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,629
who would be best at it because of what
you need to do to become president

5208
01:39:23,629 --> 01:39:23,639
you need to do to become president
 

5209
01:39:23,639 --> 01:39:25,550
you need to do to become president
and it includes

5210
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:25,560
and it includes
 

5211
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,669
and it includes
all but completely abandoning your

5212
01:39:28,669 --> 01:39:28,679
all but completely abandoning your
 

5213
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:31,669
all but completely abandoning your
existing day-to-day life job which you

5214
01:39:31,669 --> 01:39:31,679
existing day-to-day life job which you
 

5215
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,570
existing day-to-day life job which you
may depend on and family to some degree

5216
01:39:34,570 --> 01:39:34,580
may depend on and family to some degree
 

5217
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:38,149
may depend on and family to some degree
it's horribly uh negative as we already

5218
01:39:38,149 --> 01:39:38,159
it's horribly uh negative as we already
 

5219
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:39,350
it's horribly uh negative as we already
talked about

5220
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:39,360
talked about
 

5221
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,870
talked about
and at the end of all of that you either

5222
01:39:41,870 --> 01:39:41,880
and at the end of all of that you either
 

5223
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,090
and at the end of all of that you either
lose and then have to rebuild and maybe

5224
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:44,100
lose and then have to rebuild and maybe
 

5225
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,709
lose and then have to rebuild and maybe
you're not in a position to be able to

5226
01:39:45,709 --> 01:39:45,719
you're not in a position to be able to
 

5227
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:48,709
you're not in a position to be able to
do that or you win and then now you've

5228
01:39:48,709 --> 01:39:48,719
do that or you win and then now you've
 

5229
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:50,750
do that or you win and then now you've
got four years of being one of the most

5230
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:50,760
got four years of being one of the most
 

5231
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,910
got four years of being one of the most
hated people no matter how good a job

5232
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:52,920
hated people no matter how good a job
 

5233
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,250
hated people no matter how good a job
you do so I think by its nature it turns

5234
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:55,260
you do so I think by its nature it turns
 

5235
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:56,990
you do so I think by its nature it turns
off a lot of people that would otherwise

5236
01:39:56,990 --> 01:39:57,000
off a lot of people that would otherwise
 

5237
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,430
off a lot of people that would otherwise
be good

5238
01:39:58,430 --> 01:39:58,440
be good
 

5239
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:59,810
be good
um I also think that there's a lot of

5240
01:39:59,810 --> 01:39:59,820
um I also think that there's a lot of
 

5241
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,850
um I also think that there's a lot of
posturing from within the parties about

5242
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:01,860
posturing from within the parties about
 

5243
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:04,189
posturing from within the parties about
well you might be good but it's not your

5244
01:40:04,189 --> 01:40:04,199
well you might be good but it's not your
 

5245
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:05,870
well you might be good but it's not your
time yet so you should wait and then

5246
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:05,880
time yet so you should wait and then
 

5247
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,669
time yet so you should wait and then
let's talk about maybe a senate seat

5248
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:07,679
let's talk about maybe a senate seat
 

5249
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:09,169
let's talk about maybe a senate seat
here and there so it's like it's like a

5250
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:09,179
here and there so it's like it's like a
 

5251
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:10,610
here and there so it's like it's like a
company essentially and they're figuring

5252
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:10,620
company essentially and they're figuring
 

5253
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:13,129
company essentially and they're figuring
out where they want to place people uh I

5254
01:40:13,129 --> 01:40:13,139
out where they want to place people uh I
 

5255
01:40:13,139 --> 01:40:14,930
out where they want to place people uh I
think all of these things make it so we

5256
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:14,940
think all of these things make it so we
 

5257
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:16,550
think all of these things make it so we
end up with candidates most people

5258
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:16,560
end up with candidates most people
 

5259
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,290
end up with candidates most people
aren't super thrilled with so it's

5260
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:18,300
aren't super thrilled with so it's
 

5261
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:20,930
aren't super thrilled with so it's
difficult for somebody who's young or an

5262
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:20,940
difficult for somebody who's young or an
 

5263
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,610
difficult for somebody who's young or an
outsider to uh

5264
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:22,620
outsider to uh
 

5265
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:25,610
outsider to uh
to quickly become a candidate I think

5266
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:25,620
to quickly become a candidate I think
 

5267
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:28,310
to quickly become a candidate I think
that that's true and I think also in a

5268
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:28,320
that that's true and I think also in a
 

5269
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,470
that that's true and I think also in a
lot of ways it's just not I mean would

5270
01:40:30,470 --> 01:40:30,480
lot of ways it's just not I mean would
 

5271
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:33,110
lot of ways it's just not I mean would
you want to be president no I mean I

5272
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:33,120
you want to be president no I mean I
 

5273
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:34,430
you want to be president no I mean I
can't because I wasn't born in the U.S

5274
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:34,440
can't because I wasn't born in the U.S
 

5275
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,229
can't because I wasn't born in the U.S
so it's easy for me to say but

5276
01:40:36,229 --> 01:40:36,239
so it's easy for me to say but
 

5277
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,270
so it's easy for me to say but
um if everyone says no

5278
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:38,280
um if everyone says no
 

5279
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,330
um if everyone says no
then we'll get the people that we have

5280
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:41,340
then we'll get the people that we have
 

5281
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,610
then we'll get the people that we have
no I understand that so I would love to

5282
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:43,620
no I understand that so I would love to
 

5283
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:44,930
no I understand that so I would love to
help somehow

5284
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:44,940
help somehow
 

5285
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:47,090
help somehow
sure and I feel like there's not even a

5286
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:47,100
sure and I feel like there's not even a
 

5287
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:49,910
sure and I feel like there's not even a
mechanism for helping except to the

5288
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:49,920
mechanism for helping except to the
 

5289
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,410
mechanism for helping except to the
Democratic through the voting process

5290
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:51,420
Democratic through the voting process
 

5291
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:53,169
Democratic through the voting process
but I'm just

5292
01:40:53,169 --> 01:40:53,179
but I'm just
 

5293
01:40:53,179 --> 01:40:55,550
but I'm just
annoyed how little technology there is

5294
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:55,560
annoyed how little technology there is
 

5295
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,410
annoyed how little technology there is
in the whole process how little

5296
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:57,420
in the whole process how little
 

5297
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:59,570
in the whole process how little
Innovation there is in the whole process

5298
01:40:59,570 --> 01:40:59,580
Innovation there is in the whole process
 

5299
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:03,470
Innovation there is in the whole process
all of this the sad thing is this is

5300
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:03,480
all of this the sad thing is this is
 

5301
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,689
all of this the sad thing is this is
written about a lot which is

5302
01:41:05,689 --> 01:41:05,699
written about a lot which is
 

5303
01:41:05,699 --> 01:41:07,250
written about a lot which is
there's this thing called political

5304
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:07,260
there's this thing called political
 

5305
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:08,570
there's this thing called political
hobbyism

5306
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:08,580
hobbyism
 

5307
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,610
hobbyism
and I think there's a good chance that

5308
01:41:10,610 --> 01:41:10,620
and I think there's a good chance that
 

5309
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:13,729
and I think there's a good chance that
some of the people in my audience are

5310
01:41:13,729 --> 01:41:13,739
some of the people in my audience are
 

5311
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:15,890
some of the people in my audience are
political hobbyists in the sense that

5312
01:41:15,890 --> 01:41:15,900
political hobbyists in the sense that
 

5313
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:18,890
political hobbyists in the sense that
they follow this stuff as entertainment

5314
01:41:18,890 --> 01:41:18,900
they follow this stuff as entertainment
 

5315
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,649
they follow this stuff as entertainment
to some degree and I've written a lot

5316
01:41:21,649 --> 01:41:21,659
to some degree and I've written a lot
 

5317
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:24,709
to some degree and I've written a lot
about how uh I've read a lot and talked

5318
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:24,719
about how uh I've read a lot and talked
 

5319
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:27,050
about how uh I've read a lot and talked
a lot about how okay we vote every two

5320
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:27,060
a lot about how okay we vote every two
 

5321

um the to pick to jump around to some of
 

5985
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:41,030
um the to pick to jump around to some of
the things that were in there I think

5986
01:53:41,030 --> 01:53:41,040
the things that were in there I think
 

5987
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,129
the things that were in there I think
the reason that conspiracy theories are

5988

the reason that conspiracy theories are
 

5989
01:53:43,139 --> 01:53:47,330
the reason that conspiracy theories are
so compelling is that it's really tough

5990
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:47,340
so compelling is that it's really tough
 

5991
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:50,330
so compelling is that it's really tough
for a lot of people to accept

5992
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:50,340
for a lot of people to accept

01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:52,970
for a lot of people to accept
there are random events

5994
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:52,980
there are random events
 

5995
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:55,669
there are random events
not predictable specifically at a

5996
01:53:55,669 --> 01:53:55,679
not predictable specifically at a
 

5997
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:57,109
not predictable specifically at a
stochastic level we might be able to

5998
01:53:57,109 --> 01:53:57,119
stochastic level we might be able to
 

5999
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:58,370
stochastic level we might be able to
predict them but specifically

6000
01:53:58,370 --> 01:53:58,380
predict them but specifically
 

6001
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:00,109
predict them but specifically
unpredictable

6002
01:54:00,109 --> 01:54:00,119
unpredictable
 

6003
01:54:00,119 --> 01:54:02,810
unpredictable
bad events in many ways

6004
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:02,820
bad events in many ways
 

6005
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:05,270
bad events in many ways
I could be the victim of one or you

6006
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:05,280
I could be the victim of one or you
 

6007
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,250
I could be the victim of one or you
could or my family could that's really

6008
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:07,260
could or my family could that's really
 

6009
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:09,050
could or my family could that's really
scary to a lot of people understandably

6010
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:09,060
scary to a lot of people understandably
 

6011
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:11,629
scary to a lot of people understandably
so and for some people it's less scary

6012
01:54:11,629 --> 01:54:11,639
so and for some people it's less scary
 

6013
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:15,410
so and for some people it's less scary
and more soothing in a way to say there

6014
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:15,420
and more soothing in a way to say there
 

6015
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:17,270
and more soothing in a way to say there
aren't really random events like this

6016
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,280
aren't really random events like this
 

6017
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,750
aren't really random events like this
somebody planned it and if we had just

6018
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:20,760
somebody planned it and if we had just
 

6019
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,609
somebody planned it and if we had just
known who planned it it just could have

6020
01:54:22,609 --> 01:54:22,619
known who planned it it just could have
 

6021
01:54:22,619 --> 01:54:23,930
known who planned it it just could have
been stopped because we would have known

6022
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:23,940
been stopped because we would have known
 

6023
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:25,070
been stopped because we would have known
exactly when

6024
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:25,080
exactly when
 

6025
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:28,609
exactly when
that's just a psychological level easier

6026
01:54:28,609 --> 01:54:28,619
that's just a psychological level easier
 

6027
01:54:28,619 --> 01:54:31,910
that's just a psychological level easier
to accept for people and I get that to

6028
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:31,920
to accept for people and I get that to
 

6029
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,010
to accept for people and I get that to
some degree because

6030
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:34,020
some degree because
 

6031
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:36,470
some degree because
listen it's it's not the most exciting

6032
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:36,480
listen it's it's not the most exciting
 

6033
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,030
listen it's it's not the most exciting
thing that everything can just be going

6034
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:38,040
thing that everything can just be going
 

6035
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,770
thing that everything can just be going
fine and something absolutely horrible

6036
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:39,780
fine and something absolutely horrible
 

6037
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:42,350
fine and something absolutely horrible
happens and kills who knows some number

6038
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:42,360
happens and kills who knows some number
 

6039
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:45,290
happens and kills who knows some number
of people or so I think that's the the

6040
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:45,300
of people or so I think that's the the
 

6041
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:47,330
of people or so I think that's the the
biggest attractor to a lot of these

6042
01:54:47,330 --> 01:54:47,340
biggest attractor to a lot of these
 

6043
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:48,770
biggest attractor to a lot of these
conspiracy theories it doesn't apply to

6044
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:48,780
conspiracy theories it doesn't apply to
 

6045
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:50,870
conspiracy theories it doesn't apply to
all of them though but yeah but there's

6046
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:50,880
all of them though but yeah but there's
 

6047
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,970
all of them though but yeah but there's
still kind of a basic understanding of

6048
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:52,980
still kind of a basic understanding of
 

6049
01:54:52,980 --> 01:54:55,189
still kind of a basic understanding of
human nature where people

6050
01:54:55,189 --> 01:54:55,199
human nature where people
 

6051
01:54:55,199 --> 01:54:58,129
human nature where people
some people are greedy and want power

6052
01:54:58,129 --> 01:54:58,139
some people are greedy and want power
 

6053
01:54:58,139 --> 01:55:00,290
some people are greedy and want power
and are corrupted by power

6054
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:00,300
and are corrupted by power
 

6055
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:02,090
and are corrupted by power
so there's a kind of these compelling

6056
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:02,100
so there's a kind of these compelling
 

6057
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:04,370
so there's a kind of these compelling
narratives that stick

6058
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:04,380
narratives that stick
 

6059
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:07,070
narratives that stick
that um

6060
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:07,080
that um
 

6061
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:11,030
that um
I don't know the vaccine is a is a

6062
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:11,040
I don't know the vaccine is a is a
 

6063
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:14,030
I don't know the vaccine is a is a
opportunity for a powerful billionaire

6064
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:14,040
opportunity for a powerful billionaire
 

6065
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:15,950
opportunity for a powerful billionaire
to implant chips into you so you can

6066
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:15,960
to implant chips into you so you can
 

6067
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:18,350
to implant chips into you so you can
control you further right

6068
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:18,360
control you further right
 

6069
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:22,010
control you further right
it doesn't seem

6070
01:55:22,010 --> 01:55:22,020

 

6071
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,870

what do I want to say

6072
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:23,880
what do I want to say
 

6073
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,510
what do I want to say
it's like for some reason

6074
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:26,520
it's like for some reason
 

6075
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:30,109
it's like for some reason
that doesn't seem as crazy as it should

6076
01:55:30,109 --> 01:55:30,119
that doesn't seem as crazy as it should
 

6077
01:55:30,119 --> 01:55:32,090
that doesn't seem as crazy as it should
because you think like maybe Hollywood

6078
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:32,100
because you think like maybe Hollywood
 

6079
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:34,970
because you think like maybe Hollywood
contributes to that but you think yeah

6080
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:34,980
contributes to that but you think yeah
 

6081
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:37,790
contributes to that but you think yeah
you can imagine an evil person a person

6082
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:37,800
you can imagine an evil person a person
 

6083
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:41,330
you can imagine an evil person a person
that wants more control more power

6084
01:55:41,330 --> 01:55:41,340
that wants more control more power
 

6085
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:43,189
that wants more control more power
um and is also at the same time able to

6086
01:55:43,189 --> 01:55:43,199
um and is also at the same time able to
 

6087
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:45,050
um and is also at the same time able to
convince themselves as history shows

6088
01:55:45,050 --> 01:55:45,060
convince themselves as history shows
 

6089
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:46,490
convince themselves as history shows
that they actually have the best

6090
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:46,500
that they actually have the best
 

6091
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,649
that they actually have the best
interest of the populace in mind that

6092
01:55:48,649 --> 01:55:48,659
interest of the populace in mind that
 

6093
01:55:48,659 --> 01:55:50,629
interest of the populace in mind that
they're trying to do good for the world

6094

they're trying to do good for the world
 

6095
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:52,970
they're trying to do good for the world
so they do evil while trying to do good

6096
01:55:52,970 --> 01:55:52,980
so they do evil while trying to do good
 

6097
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:55,310
so they do evil while trying to do good
and you can kind of imagine it so it's

6098
01:55:55,310 --> 01:55:55,320
and you can kind of imagine it so it's
 

6099
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,990
and you can kind of imagine it so it's
like why not

6100
01:55:56,990 --> 01:55:57,000
like why not
 

6101
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,250
like why not
and uh do you listen to people in power

6102
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:00,260
and uh do you listen to people in power
 

6103
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:04,129
and uh do you listen to people in power
uh authorities they kind of look and

6104
01:56:04,129 --> 01:56:04,139
uh authorities they kind of look and
 

6105
01:56:04,139 --> 01:56:05,390
uh authorities they kind of look and
sound Shady

6106
01:56:05,390 --> 01:56:05,400
sound Shady
 

6107
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:09,129
sound Shady
you know like yeah the the transparency

6108
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:09,139
you know like yeah the the transparency
 

6109
01:56:09,139 --> 01:56:11,450
you know like yeah the the transparency
especially the older ones I think

6110
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:11,460
especially the older ones I think
 

6111
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,430
especially the older ones I think
younger folks are better at being like

6112
01:56:13,430 --> 01:56:13,440
younger folks are better at being like
 

6113
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,530
younger folks are better at being like
real and transparent and just like

6114
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:15,540
real and transparent and just like
 

6115
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:17,270
real and transparent and just like
revealing their flaws and the basic

6116
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:17,280
revealing their flaws and the basic
 

6117
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,430
revealing their flaws and the basic
Humanity but people that are a little

6118
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:19,440
Humanity but people that are a little
 

6119
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:20,870
Humanity but people that are a little
bit older in the positions of power

6120
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:20,880
bit older in the positions of power
 

6121
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,609
bit older in the positions of power
they're more polished they're more like

6122
01:56:22,609 --> 01:56:22,619
they're more polished they're more like
 

6123
01:56:22,619 --> 01:56:24,830
they're more polished they're more like
there it feels like they're presenting a

6124
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:24,840
there it feels like they're presenting a
 

6125
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,570
there it feels like they're presenting a
narrative where the truth is hidden in

6126
01:56:26,570 --> 01:56:26,580
narrative where the truth is hidden in
 

6127
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:28,430
narrative where the truth is hidden in
the shadows so I don't think there's

6128
01:56:28,430 --> 01:56:28,440
the shadows so I don't think there's
 

6129
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:31,430
the shadows so I don't think there's
anything wrong with suspecting

6130
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,440
anything wrong with suspecting
 

6131
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:34,129
anything wrong with suspecting
maybe a public figure isn't giving me

6132
01:56:34,129 --> 01:56:34,139
maybe a public figure isn't giving me
 

6133
01:56:34,139 --> 01:56:36,109
maybe a public figure isn't giving me
the full story yeah totally reasonable

6134
01:56:36,109 --> 01:56:36,119
the full story yeah totally reasonable
 

6135
01:56:36,119 --> 01:56:38,209
the full story yeah totally reasonable
thing to question

6136
01:56:38,209 --> 01:56:38,219
thing to question
 

6137
01:56:38,219 --> 01:56:39,590
thing to question
um I don't think there's anything wrong

6138
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:39,600
um I don't think there's anything wrong
 

6139
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,830
um I don't think there's anything wrong
with exploring a lot of these different

6140
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:42,840
with exploring a lot of these different
 

6141
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:46,010
with exploring a lot of these different
things I think the problem becomes and I

6142
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:46,020
things I think the problem becomes and I
 

6143
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:47,689
things I think the problem becomes and I
know you've talked about this in so many

6144
01:56:47,689 --> 01:56:47,699
know you've talked about this in so many
 

6145
01:56:47,699 --> 01:56:49,669
know you've talked about this in so many
different ways with other guests the

6146
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:49,679
different ways with other guests the
 

6147
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:52,370
different ways with other guests the
problem becomes when we lose a shared

6148
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:52,380
problem becomes when we lose a shared
 

6149
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:54,890
problem becomes when we lose a shared
understanding of how we would assess

6150
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:54,900
understanding of how we would assess
 

6151
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:57,770
understanding of how we would assess
whether any of these things are true and

6152
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:57,780
whether any of these things are true and
 

6153
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:00,890
whether any of these things are true and
then both alleged evidence and an

6154
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:00,900
then both alleged evidence and an
 

6155
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:03,109
then both alleged evidence and an
absence of evidence both become

6156
01:57:03,109 --> 01:57:03,119
absence of evidence both become
 

6157
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:05,330
absence of evidence both become
supportive of the conspiracy theory

6158
01:57:05,330 --> 01:57:05,340
supportive of the conspiracy theory
 

6159
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:08,149
supportive of the conspiracy theory
because if there's bad evidence you

6160
01:57:08,149 --> 01:57:08,159
because if there's bad evidence you
 

6161
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:09,410
because if there's bad evidence you
manipulate it and say it's good evidence

6162
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:09,420
manipulate it and say it's good evidence
 

6163
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:11,510
manipulate it and say it's good evidence
if there's no evidence you say the

01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:11,520
if there's no evidence you say the
 

6165
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:12,830
if there's no evidence you say the
evidence was obviously hidden by the

6166
01:57:12,830 --> 01:57:12,840
evidence was obviously hidden by the

01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,750
evidence was obviously hidden by the
people who carried out the thing or

I do
 

6201
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:48,830
I do
how big of a deal compared to what

6202
01:57:48,830 --> 01:57:48,840

6209
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:56,510
the Civil War okay no I mean so you well
it's a very interesting thing though

6210
01:57:56,510 --> 01:57:56,520
it's a very interesting thing though
 

6211
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:59,390
it's a very interesting thing though
right because we have not only the the

6212
01:57:59,390 --> 01:57:59,400
right because we have not only the the
 

6213
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:01,070
right because we have not only the the
event that's that's clever actually it's

6214
01:58:01,070 --> 01:58:01,080
event that's that's clever actually it's
 

6215
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:03,950
event that's that's clever actually it's
not only the event but it's what led up

6216
01:58:03,950 --> 01:58:03,960
not only the event but it's what led up
 

6217
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:07,370
not only the event but it's what led up
to it and what has happened since and

6218
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:07,380
to it and what has happened since and
 

6219
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:11,450
to it and what has happened since and
did it change what is considered on the

6220
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:11,460
did it change what is considered on the
 

6221
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:13,030
did it change what is considered on the
table

6222
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:13,040
table
 

6223
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:17,510
table
that citizens can should or might do if

6224
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:17,520
that citizens can should or might do if
 

6225
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,669
that citizens can should or might do if
they disagree with the results of an

6226
01:58:19,669 --> 01:58:19,679
they disagree with the results of an
 

6227
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:21,350
they disagree with the results of an
election so I think that there are

6228
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:21,360
election so I think that there are
 

6229
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,270
election so I think that there are
further reaching consequences than just

commenting it I see to the the financial
aspect of it like why does it even make

8198
02:36:53,570 --> 02:36:53,580
aspect of it like why does it even make
 

8199
02:36:53,580 --> 02:36:55,610
aspect of it like why does it even make
sense yeah

8200
02:36:55,610 --> 02:36:55,620

effects of AI and what it starts to ask
 

8205
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:02,630

what is the

8206
02:37:02,630 --> 02:37:02,640
what is the
 

8207
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:06,410
what is the
what is even education right what do you

8208
02:37:06,410 --> 02:37:06,420
what is even education right what do you
 

8209
02:37:06,420 --> 02:37:08,450
what is even education right what do you
suppose what is the purpose of education

8210
02:37:08,450 --> 02:37:08,460
suppose what is the purpose of education
 

8211
02:37:08,460 --> 02:37:10,309
suppose what is the purpose of education
so one is to give you a kind of a

8212

so one is to give you a kind of a
 

8213

so one is to give you a kind of a
background knowledge of on a bunch of

02:37:12,650 --> 02:37:12,660
background knowledge of on a bunch of
 

8215
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:14,450

with some internships can be a privilege
 

8267
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:07,429
with some internships can be a privilege
in some cases but again that's that path

8268
02:38:07,429 --> 02:38:07,439
in some cases but again that's that path
 

8269
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:09,770

information about people so one of the
 

8375
02:40:16,859 --> 02:40:18,170
information about people so one of the
issues is that you can manipulate

8376
02:40:18,170 --> 02:40:18,180
issues is that you can manipulate
 

8377
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:19,730
issues is that you can manipulate
markets because there's not perfect

8378
02:40:19,730 --> 02:40:19,740
markets because there's not perfect
 

8379
02:40:19,740 --> 02:40:23,270
markets because there's not perfect
information but now in a digital age we

8380
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:23,280
information but now in a digital age we
 

8381
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:25,929
information but now in a digital age we
can uh we can be

8382
02:40:25,929 --> 02:40:25,939
can uh we can be
 

8383
02:40:25,939 --> 02:40:28,610
can uh we can be
higher bandwidth participants in the

8384
02:40:28,610 --> 02:40:28,620
higher bandwidth participants in the
 

8385
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:30,590
higher bandwidth participants in the
market so if you're choosing between

8386
02:40:30,590 --> 02:40:30,600
market so if you're choosing between
 

8387
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:32,150
market so if you're choosing between
different security companies or you're

8388
02:40:32,150 --> 02:40:32,160
different security companies or you're
 

8389
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:34,490
different security companies or you're
choosing between different providers

8390
02:40:34,490 --> 02:40:34,500
choosing between different providers
 

8391
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:36,230
choosing between different providers
different Services you can do so more

8392
02:40:36,230 --> 02:40:36,240
different Services you can do so more
 

8393
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:38,870
different Services you can do so more
efficiently and more effectively

8394
02:40:38,870 --> 02:40:38,880
efficiently and more effectively
 

8395
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:41,929
efficiently and more effectively
and in the digital space so you could

8396
02:40:41,929 --> 02:40:41,939
and in the digital space so you could
 

8397
02:40:41,939 --> 02:40:44,110
and in the digital space so you could
kind of imagine it but we haven't

8398
02:40:44,110 --> 02:40:44,120
kind of imagine it but we haven't
 

8399
02:40:44,120 --> 02:40:46,790
kind of imagine it but we haven't
successfully done it

8400
02:40:46,790 --> 02:40:46,800
successfully done it
 

8401
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:49,309
successfully done it
uh without governments yeah and I think

8402
02:40:49,309 --> 02:40:49,319
uh without governments yeah and I think
 

8403
02:40:49,319 --> 02:40:52,250
uh without governments yeah and I think
there's a practical once you get Beyond

8404
02:40:52,250 --> 02:40:52,260
there's a practical once you get Beyond
 

8405
02:40:52,260 --> 02:40:56,809
there's a practical once you get Beyond
150 you also start specializing

8406
02:40:56,809 --> 02:40:56,819
150 you also start specializing
 

8407
02:40:56,819 --> 02:40:58,610
150 you also start specializing
um it just is a matter of fact you don't

8408
02:40:58,610 --> 02:40:58,620
um it just is a matter of fact you don't
 

8409
02:40:58,620 --> 02:41:00,530
um it just is a matter of fact you don't
have everybody isn't growing their own

8410
02:41:00,530 --> 02:41:00,540
have everybody isn't growing their own
 

8411
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:02,510
have everybody isn't growing their own
food some people grow the food and other

8413
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:04,190
food some people grow the food and other
people do other things and you come

8414
02:41:04,190 --> 02:41:04,200
people do other things and you come
 

8415
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:06,110
people do other things and you come
across a lot of the problems that

8416
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:06,120
across a lot of the problems that
 

8417
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:08,990
across a lot of the problems that
started at the Agricultural Revolution

8418

started at the Agricultural Revolution
 

8419
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,730
started at the Agricultural Revolution
and whether you say that it's a company

8420
02:41:10,730 --> 02:41:10,740
and whether you say that it's a company
 

8421
02:41:10,740 --> 02:41:13,309
and whether you say that it's a company
that's solving it or a government the

8422
02:41:13,309 --> 02:41:13,319
that's solving it or a government the
 

8423
02:41:13,319 --> 02:41:14,929
that's solving it or a government the
problems are going to be very similar

8424
02:41:14,929 --> 02:41:14,939
problems are going to be very similar
 

8425
02:41:14,939 --> 02:41:17,990
problems are going to be very similar
and I've not read anything that to my

8426
02:41:17,990 --> 02:41:18,000
and I've not read anything that to my
 

8427
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:19,670
and I've not read anything that to my
satisfaction explains how you deal with

02:41:19,670 --> 02:41:19,680
satisfaction explains how you deal with
 

8429
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:21,770

8430
02:41:21,770 --> 02:41:21,780
that well there's underlying principles
 

8431
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:23,450
that well there's underlying principles
of libertarianism which is putting

and that's compelling notion yeah
 

8439
02:41:30,899 --> 02:41:32,809
and that's compelling notion yeah

challenge I'm having is

9178
02:55:39,410 --> 02:55:39,420
challenge I'm having is
 

9179
02:55:39,420 --> 02:55:42,710
challenge I'm having is
someone will call in with an opinion

9180
02:55:42,710 --> 02:55:42,720
someone will call in with an opinion
 

9181
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:45,469
someone will call in with an opinion
but say they want to talk about fact

9182
02:55:45,469 --> 02:55:45,479
but say they want to talk about fact
 

9183
02:55:45,479 --> 02:55:47,929
but say they want to talk about fact
and I have to explain to them you're

9184
02:55:47,929 --> 02:55:47,939
and I have to explain to them you're
 

9185
02:55:47,939 --> 02:55:49,550
and I have to explain to them you're
talking about an opinion and not a fact

9186
02:55:49,550 --> 02:55:49,560
talking about an opinion and not a fact
 

9187
02:55:49,560 --> 02:55:51,769
talking about an opinion and not a fact
and this goes back to the lack of

9188
02:55:51,769 --> 02:55:51,779
and this goes back to the lack of
 

9189
02:55:51,779 --> 02:55:53,690
and this goes back to the lack of
critical thinking and lack of media

9190
02:55:53,690 --> 02:55:53,700
critical thinking and lack of media
 

9191
02:55:53,700 --> 02:55:56,030
critical thinking and lack of media
literacy uh but that's the bigger

9192
02:55:56,030 --> 02:55:56,040
literacy uh but that's the bigger
 

9193
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:57,950
literacy uh but that's the bigger
challenge for me right now but I mean I

9194
02:55:57,950 --> 02:55:57,960
challenge for me right now but I mean I
 

9195
02:55:57,960 --> 02:55:59,210
challenge for me right now but I mean I
think the big statements are always

9196
02:55:59,210 --> 02:55:59,220
think the big statements are always
 

9197
02:55:59,220 --> 02:56:01,849
think the big statements are always
going to be somewhat opinions

9198
02:56:01,849 --> 02:56:01,859
going to be somewhat opinions
 

9199
02:56:01,859 --> 02:56:04,190
going to be somewhat opinions
like um

9200
02:56:04,190 --> 02:56:04,200

I think any answer to that is an opinion
 

9207

I think any answer to that is an opinion
I disagree if we Define fair

02:56:20,330 --> 02:56:20,340
well yes so then I don't think it's
 

9211
02:56:20,340 --> 02:56:22,610
well yes so then I don't think it's
possible to Define fair in a way that's

9212
02:56:22,610 --> 02:56:22,620
possible to Define fair in a way that's
 

9213
02:56:22,620 --> 02:56:24,469
possible to Define fair in a way that's
not several paragraphs where each

9214
02:56:24,469 --> 02:56:24,479
not several paragraphs where each
 

9215
02:56:24,479 --> 02:56:28,070
not several paragraphs where each
sentence it now has has facts right

9216
02:56:28,070 --> 02:56:28,080
sentence it now has has facts right
 

9217
02:56:28,080 --> 02:56:30,650
sentence it now has has facts right
right so you what do you mean by fair is

9218
02:56:30,650 --> 02:56:30,660
right so you what do you mean by fair is
 

9219
02:56:30,660 --> 02:56:33,290
right so you what do you mean by fair is
it uh who can show up to vote what was

9220
02:56:33,290 --> 02:56:33,300
it uh who can show up to vote what was
 

9221
02:56:33,300 --> 02:56:35,809
it uh who can show up to vote what was
the process of how easy it is to vote uh

9222
02:56:35,809 --> 02:56:35,819
the process of how easy it is to vote uh
 

9223
02:56:35,819 --> 02:56:39,170
the process of how easy it is to vote uh
was there actual uh cheating going on in

9224
02:56:39,170 --> 02:56:39,180
was there actual uh cheating going on in
 

9225
02:56:39,180 --> 02:56:40,550
was there actual uh cheating going on in
different like what is the evidence of

9226
02:56:40,550 --> 02:56:40,560
different like what is the evidence of
 

9227
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:42,050
different like what is the evidence of
that cheating you have to actually get

9228
02:56:42,050 --> 02:56:42,060
that cheating you have to actually get
 

9229
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:44,030
that cheating you have to actually get
to the actual like details of a thing

9230
02:56:44,030 --> 02:56:44,040
to the actual like details of a thing
 

9231
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:46,070
to the actual like details of a thing
high level

9232
02:56:46,070 --> 02:56:46,080
high level
 

9233
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:48,290
high level
know uh everything is just going to be

9234
02:56:48,290 --> 02:56:48,300
know uh everything is just going to be
 

9235
02:56:48,300 --> 02:56:50,110
know uh everything is just going to be
an opinion it feels like

9236
02:56:50,110 --> 02:56:50,120
an opinion it feels like
 

9237
02:56:50,120 --> 02:56:54,410
an opinion it feels like
and you can approximate that to be like

9238
02:56:54,410 --> 02:56:54,420
and you can approximate that to be like
 

9239
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:57,170
and you can approximate that to be like
it's a well-founded opinion well most of

9240
02:56:57,170 --> 02:56:57,180
it's a well-founded opinion well most of
 

9241
02:56:57,180 --> 02:56:59,090
it's a well-founded opinion well most of
science is an opinion even physics is an

9242
02:56:59,090 --> 02:56:59,100
science is an opinion even physics is an
 

9243
02:56:59,100 --> 02:57:01,130
science is an opinion even physics is an
opinion so like I think there's a

9244
02:57:01,130 --> 02:57:01,140
opinion so like I think there's a
 

9245
02:57:01,140 --> 02:57:02,630
opinion so like I think there's a
threshold Beyond which an opinion

9246
02:57:02,630 --> 02:57:02,640
threshold Beyond which an opinion
 

9247
02:57:02,640 --> 02:57:05,630
threshold Beyond which an opinion
becomes like uh this is a pretty

9248
02:57:05,630 --> 02:57:05,640
becomes like uh this is a pretty
 

9249
02:57:05,640 --> 02:57:08,450
becomes like uh this is a pretty
reliable thing to assume for now that

9250
02:57:08,450 --> 02:57:08,460
reliable thing to assume for now that
 

9251
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:10,610
reliable thing to assume for now that
this is okay so let me revise so I think

9252
02:57:10,610 --> 02:57:10,620
this is okay so let me revise so I think
 

9253
02:57:10,620 --> 02:57:13,250
this is okay so let me revise so I think
maybe better said

9254
02:57:13,250 --> 02:57:13,260
maybe better said
 

9255
02:57:13,260 --> 02:57:17,090
maybe better said
I think that the difficulty

9256
02:57:17,090 --> 02:57:17,100
I think that the difficulty
 

9257
02:57:17,100 --> 02:57:20,150
I think that the difficulty
I mean it is the process you described

9258
02:57:20,150 --> 02:57:20,160
I mean it is the process you described
 

9259
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:21,889
I mean it is the process you described
is probably the right process and is

9260
02:57:21,889 --> 02:57:21,899
is probably the right process and is
 

9261
02:57:21,899 --> 02:57:24,230
is probably the right process and is
it's exhausting for mundane things and

9262
02:57:24,230 --> 02:57:24,240
it's exhausting for mundane things and
 

9263
02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:27,170
it's exhausting for mundane things and
that causes major problems if we were to

9264
02:57:27,170 --> 02:57:27,180
that causes major problems if we were to
 

9265
02:57:27,180 --> 02:57:28,550
that causes major problems if we were to
say

9266
02:57:28,550 --> 02:57:28,560
say
 

9267
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:32,510
say
is it better for the economy to have a

9268
02:57:32,510 --> 02:57:32,520
is it better for the economy to have a
 

9269
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:34,910
is it better for the economy to have a
tax rate on people making over a million

9270
02:57:34,910 --> 02:57:34,920
tax rate on people making over a million
 

9271
02:57:34,920 --> 02:57:39,410
tax rate on people making over a million
dollars that's 20 or 50 okay what do we

9272
02:57:39,410 --> 02:57:39,420
dollars that's 20 or 50 okay what do we
 

9273
02:57:39,420 --> 02:57:41,510
dollars that's 20 or 50 okay what do we
mean by better for the economy

9274
02:57:41,510 --> 02:57:41,520
mean by better for the economy
 

9275
02:57:41,520 --> 02:57:44,030
mean by better for the economy
it's not an overwhelming task to decide

9276
02:57:44,030 --> 02:57:44,040
it's not an overwhelming task to decide
 

9277
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:45,530
it's not an overwhelming task to decide
on that we could say well we'll say it's

9278
02:57:45,530 --> 02:57:45,540
on that we could say well we'll say it's
 

9279
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:47,330
on that we could say well we'll say it's
better for the economy by looking at

9280
02:57:47,330 --> 02:57:47,340
better for the economy by looking at
 

9281
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:49,309
better for the economy by looking at
what was the unemployment rate based on

9282
02:57:49,309 --> 02:57:49,319
what was the unemployment rate based on
 

9283
02:57:49,319 --> 02:57:50,690
what was the unemployment rate based on
the tax rate on million you know people

9284
02:57:50,690 --> 02:57:50,700
the tax rate on million you know people
 

9285
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:52,910
the tax rate on million you know people
earning a million a year and what was

9286
02:57:52,910 --> 02:57:52,920
earning a million a year and what was
 

9287
02:57:52,920 --> 02:57:56,690
earning a million a year and what was
GDP and whatever okay we've we've agreed

9288
02:57:56,690 --> 02:57:56,700
GDP and whatever okay we've we've agreed
 

9289
02:57:56,700 --> 02:57:59,210
GDP and whatever okay we've we've agreed
this is a statement we are now in the

9290
02:57:59,210 --> 02:57:59,220
this is a statement we are now in the
 

9291
02:57:59,220 --> 02:58:02,330
this is a statement we are now in the
realm of just determining what is given

9292
02:58:02,330 --> 02:58:02,340
realm of just determining what is given
 

9293
02:58:02,340 --> 02:58:04,010
realm of just determining what is given
the parameters that we've established I

9294
02:58:04,010 --> 02:58:04,020
the parameters that we've established I
 

9295
02:58:04,020 --> 02:58:05,330
the parameters that we've established I
think that that's that's relatively

9296
02:58:05,330 --> 02:58:05,340
think that that's that's relatively
 

9297
02:58:05,340 --> 02:58:07,730
think that that's that's relatively
doable the issue

9298
02:58:07,730 --> 02:58:07,740
doable the issue
 

9299
02:58:07,740 --> 02:58:10,010
doable the issue
is with the bigger ones like you're

9300
02:58:10,010 --> 02:58:10,020
is with the bigger ones like you're
 

9301
02:58:10,020 --> 02:58:12,410
is with the bigger ones like you're
talking about where what do we mean by a

9302
02:58:12,410 --> 02:58:12,420
talking about where what do we mean by a
 

9303
02:58:12,420 --> 02:58:14,990
talking about where what do we mean by a
fair election and fair in whose eyes and

9304
02:58:14,990 --> 02:58:15,000
fair election and fair in whose eyes and
 

9305
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,929
fair election and fair in whose eyes and
but I I am with you that it often

9306
02:58:17,929 --> 02:58:17,939
but I I am with you that it often
 

9307
02:58:17,939 --> 02:58:19,910
but I I am with you that it often
devolves into a conversation about

9308
02:58:19,910 --> 02:58:19,920
devolves into a conversation about
 

9309
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:22,849
devolves into a conversation about
opinions about what is fair rather than

9310
02:58:22,849 --> 02:58:22,859
opinions about what is fair rather than
 

9311
02:58:22,859 --> 02:58:26,450
opinions about what is fair rather than
an ascertainment of the facts yeah and

9312
02:58:26,450 --> 02:58:26,460
an ascertainment of the facts yeah and
 

9313
02:58:26,460 --> 02:58:28,370
an ascertainment of the facts yeah and
it feels like maybe avoiding some of

9314
02:58:28,370 --> 02:58:28,380
it feels like maybe avoiding some of
 

9315
02:58:28,380 --> 02:58:29,450
it feels like maybe avoiding some of
these big

9316
02:58:29,450 --> 02:58:29,460
these big
 

9317
02:58:29,460 --> 02:58:31,490
these big
maybe there's some trigger words too

9318
02:58:31,490 --> 02:58:31,500
maybe there's some trigger words too
 

9319
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:33,469
maybe there's some trigger words too
maybe avoiding them allows you to

9320
02:58:33,469 --> 02:58:33,479
maybe avoiding them allows you to
 

9321
02:58:33,479 --> 02:58:35,090
maybe avoiding them allows you to
actually talk about the facts and

9322
02:58:35,090 --> 02:58:35,100
actually talk about the facts and
 

9323
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:37,550
actually talk about the facts and
through that educate yourself and learn

9324
02:58:37,550 --> 02:58:37,560
through that educate yourself and learn
 

9325
02:58:37,560 --> 02:58:40,250
through that educate yourself and learn
about like uh whether the virus leaked

9326
02:58:40,250 --> 02:58:40,260
about like uh whether the virus leaked
 

9327
02:58:40,260 --> 02:58:42,889
about like uh whether the virus leaked
from a lab or not

9328
02:58:42,889 --> 02:58:42,899
from a lab or not
 

9329
02:58:42,899 --> 02:58:44,870
from a lab or not
to me it was always a super interesting

9330
02:58:44,870 --> 02:58:44,880
to me it was always a super interesting
 

9331
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:46,309
to me it was always a super interesting
question I don't know why I already got

9332
02:58:46,309 --> 02:58:46,319
question I don't know why I already got
 

9333
02:58:46,319 --> 02:58:48,290
question I don't know why I already got
super touchy about it uh most of the

9334
02:58:48,290 --> 02:58:48,300
super touchy about it uh most of the
 

9335
02:58:48,300 --> 02:58:50,630
super touchy about it uh most of the
people I know colleagues biologists

9336
02:58:50,630 --> 02:58:50,640
people I know colleagues biologists
 

9337
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:52,250
people I know colleagues biologists
thought

9338
02:58:52,250 --> 02:58:52,260
thought
 

9339
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:55,190
thought
it's pretty good likelihood that a leak

9340
02:58:55,190 --> 02:58:55,200
it's pretty good likelihood that a leak
 

9341
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:57,590
it's pretty good likelihood that a leak
from a lab given everything they just

9342
02:58:57,590 --> 02:58:57,600
from a lab given everything they just
 

9343
02:58:57,600 --> 02:58:59,809
from a lab given everything they just
didn't the evidence is not there for a

9344
02:58:59,809 --> 02:58:59,819
didn't the evidence is not there for a
 

9345
02:58:59,819 --> 02:59:01,910
didn't the evidence is not there for a
either one and so like you should be

9346
02:59:01,910 --> 02:59:01,920
either one and so like you should be
 

9347
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:04,250
either one and so like you should be
able to just openly talk about it unless

9348
02:59:04,250 --> 02:59:04,260
able to just openly talk about it unless
 

9349
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:06,349
able to just openly talk about it unless
you're in the uh High political office

9350
02:59:06,349 --> 02:59:06,359
you're in the uh High political office
 

9351
02:59:06,359 --> 02:59:08,210
you're in the uh High political office
where there could be geopolitical

9352
02:59:08,210 --> 02:59:08,220
where there could be geopolitical
 

9353
02:59:08,220 --> 02:59:10,190
where there could be geopolitical
consequences to your statements but in

9354
02:59:10,190 --> 02:59:10,200
consequences to your statements but in
 

9355
02:59:10,200 --> 02:59:11,510
consequences to your statements but in
general it's an interesting question you

9356
02:59:11,510 --> 02:59:11,520
general it's an interesting question you
 

9357
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:12,650
general it's an interesting question you
should be able to talk about it but

9358
02:59:12,650 --> 02:59:12,660
should be able to talk about it but
 

9359
02:59:12,660 --> 02:59:14,450
should be able to talk about it but
there's no first of all there's not many

9360
02:59:14,450 --> 02:59:14,460
there's no first of all there's not many
 

9361
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:17,570
there's no first of all there's not many
facts around there unfortunately

9362
02:59:17,570 --> 02:59:17,580
facts around there unfortunately
 

9363
02:59:17,580 --> 02:59:19,969
facts around there unfortunately
and a lot of the conclusive statements

9364
02:59:19,969 --> 02:59:19,979
and a lot of the conclusive statements
 

9365
02:59:19,979 --> 02:59:21,530
and a lot of the conclusive statements
about especially in the early days were

9366
02:59:21,530 --> 02:59:21,540
about especially in the early days were
 

9367
02:59:21,540 --> 02:59:25,370
about especially in the early days were
just opinions and so you have to

9368
02:59:25,370 --> 02:59:25,380
just opinions and so you have to
 

9369
02:59:25,380 --> 02:59:27,889
just opinions and so you have to
the idea of what is true and uh becomes

9370
02:59:27,889 --> 02:59:27,899
the idea of what is true and uh becomes
 

9371
02:59:27,899 --> 02:59:28,849
the idea of what is true and uh becomes
a little

9372
02:59:28,849 --> 02:59:28,859
a little
 

9373
02:59:28,859 --> 02:59:30,769
a little
even mentioning the word truth in that

9374
02:59:30,769 --> 02:59:30,779
even mentioning the word truth in that
 

9375
02:59:30,779 --> 02:59:34,010
even mentioning the word truth in that
context it feels um

9376
02:59:34,010 --> 02:59:34,020
context it feels um
 

9377
02:59:34,020 --> 02:59:36,830
context it feels um
divisive yeah I completely agree with

9378
02:59:36,830 --> 02:59:36,840
divisive yeah I completely agree with
 

9379
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:38,510
divisive yeah I completely agree with
you which is strange like it really you

9380
02:59:38,510 --> 02:59:38,520
you which is strange like it really you
 

9381
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:40,250
you which is strange like it really you
you think it shouldn't one of the really

9382
02:59:40,250 --> 02:59:40,260
you think it shouldn't one of the really
 

9383
02:59:40,260 --> 02:59:42,969
you think it shouldn't one of the really
good opening questions that I've had

9384
02:59:42,969 --> 02:59:42,979
good opening questions that I've had
 

9385
02:59:42,979 --> 02:59:45,349
good opening questions that I've had
worked to my advantage when talking with

9386
02:59:45,349 --> 02:59:45,359
worked to my advantage when talking with
 

9387
02:59:45,359 --> 02:59:47,450
worked to my advantage when talking with
people who I know disagree with me about

9388
02:59:47,450 --> 02:59:47,460
people who I know disagree with me about
 

9389
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:50,389
people who I know disagree with me about
a contentious topic is how do you think

9390
02:59:50,389 --> 02:59:50,399
a contentious topic is how do you think
 

9391
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:52,010
a contentious topic is how do you think
we would figure out X

9392
02:59:52,010 --> 02:59:52,020
we would figure out X
 

9393
02:59:52,020 --> 02:59:55,570
we would figure out X
and it often gets people thinking first

9394
02:59:55,570 --> 02:59:55,580
and it often gets people thinking first
 

9395
02:59:55,580 --> 02:59:58,610
and it often gets people thinking first
collaboratively and obviously we might

9396
02:59:58,610 --> 02:59:58,620
collaboratively and obviously we might
 

9397
02:59:58,620 --> 03:00:00,410
collaboratively and obviously we might
have very different opinions but with

9398
03:00:00,410 --> 03:00:00,420
have very different opinions but with
 

9399
03:00:00,420 --> 03:00:02,030
have very different opinions but with
something like the covet lab leak I

9400
03:00:02,030 --> 03:00:02,040
something like the covet lab leak I
 

9401
03:00:02,040 --> 03:00:03,170
something like the covet lab leak I
think it's an interesting one because if

9402
03:00:03,170 --> 03:00:03,180
think it's an interesting one because if
 

9403
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:05,570
think it's an interesting one because if
you say okay maybe at least maybe it

9404
03:00:05,570 --> 03:00:05,580
you say okay maybe at least maybe it
 

9405
03:00:05,580 --> 03:00:07,910
you say okay maybe at least maybe it
didn't how would we figure that out who

9406
03:00:07,910 --> 03:00:07,920
didn't how would we figure that out who
 

9407
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:09,950
didn't how would we figure that out who
would we trust to weigh in on that what

9408
03:00:09,950 --> 03:00:09,960
would we trust to weigh in on that what
 

9409
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:12,110
would we trust to weigh in on that what
evidence would count now we're kind of

9410
03:00:12,110 --> 03:00:12,120
evidence would count now we're kind of
 

9411
03:00:12,120 --> 03:00:14,870
evidence would count now we're kind of
on the same team and then if we can

9412
03:00:14,870 --> 03:00:14,880
on the same team and then if we can
 

9413
03:00:14,880 --> 03:00:17,030
on the same team and then if we can
establish that then we're on a search

9414
03:00:17,030 --> 03:00:17,040
establish that then we're on a search
 

9415
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:19,250
establish that then we're on a search
for capital T truth together or whatever

9416
03:00:19,250 --> 03:00:19,260
for capital T truth together or whatever
 

9417
03:00:19,260 --> 03:00:21,590
for capital T truth together or whatever
it's kind of pie in the sky but in some

9418
03:00:21,590 --> 03:00:21,600
it's kind of pie in the sky but in some
 

9419
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:23,150
it's kind of pie in the sky but in some
conversations I've actually had success

9420
03:00:23,150 --> 03:00:23,160
conversations I've actually had success
 

9421
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:24,950
conversations I've actually had success
with that and then you can kind of

9422
03:00:24,950 --> 03:00:24,960
with that and then you can kind of
 

9423
03:00:24,960 --> 03:00:26,210
with that and then you can kind of
realize

9424
03:00:26,210 --> 03:00:26,220
realize
 

9425
03:00:26,220 --> 03:00:28,490
realize
if uh if there's no amount of evidence

9426
03:00:28,490 --> 03:00:28,500
if uh if there's no amount of evidence
 

9427
03:00:28,500 --> 03:00:30,590
if uh if there's no amount of evidence
that's going to prove a show to you that

9428
03:00:30,590 --> 03:00:30,600
that's going to prove a show to you that
 

9429
03:00:30,600 --> 03:00:33,050
that's going to prove a show to you that
you're wrong in your current opinion

9430
03:00:33,050 --> 03:00:33,060
you're wrong in your current opinion
 

9431
03:00:33,060 --> 03:00:34,790
you're wrong in your current opinion
that that's probably a really bad sign

9432
03:00:34,790 --> 03:00:34,800
that that's probably a really bad sign
 

9433
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:37,070
that that's probably a really bad sign
for you it's a waste it may be a waste

9434
03:00:37,070 --> 03:00:37,080
for you it's a waste it may be a waste
 

9435
03:00:37,080 --> 03:00:38,570
for you it's a waste it may be a waste
to pursue the conversation further at

9436
03:00:38,570 --> 03:00:38,580
to pursue the conversation further at
 

9437
03:00:38,580 --> 03:00:41,450
to pursue the conversation further at
that point yeah yeah what oh so okay you

9438
03:00:41,450 --> 03:00:41,460
that point yeah yeah what oh so okay you
 

9439
03:00:41,460 --> 03:00:43,070
that point yeah yeah what oh so okay you

9442
03:00:44,990 --> 03:00:45,000
how do you determine that and what
 

9443
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,389
how do you determine that and what
evidence might exist that would change

9444
03:00:47,389 --> 03:00:47,399
evidence might exist that would change
 

9445
03:00:47,399 --> 03:00:49,130
evidence might exist that would change
your mind there is no evidence Trump was

9446
03:00:49,130 --> 03:00:49,140
your mind there is no evidence Trump was
 

9447
03:00:49,140 --> 03:00:50,750
your mind there is no evidence Trump was
the best president ever I think the

9448
03:00:50,750 --> 03:00:50,760
the best president ever I think the
 

9449
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:52,190
the best president ever I think the
conversation is probably done except

9450
03:00:52,190 --> 03:00:52,200
conversation is probably done except
 

9451
03:00:52,200 --> 03:00:54,530
conversation is probably done except

there are people on the left of my
audience who call me a Netanyahu shill

9476
03:01:23,990 --> 03:01:24,000
audience who call me a Netanyahu shill
 

9477
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:25,910
audience who call me a Netanyahu shill
even though I've never been a supporter

9478
03:01:25,910 --> 03:01:25,920
even though I've never been a supporter

03:01:31,750 --> 03:01:31,760
just don't think that some of the
 

9483
03:01:31,760 --> 03:01:34,750
just don't think that some of the
uh kind of black and white

9484
03:01:34,750 --> 03:01:34,760
uh kind of black and white
 

9485
03:01:34,760 --> 03:01:37,610
uh kind of black and white
characterizations about Israel are even

9486
03:01:37,610 --> 03:01:37,620
characterizations about Israel are even
 

9487
03:01:37,620 --> 03:01:39,530
characterizations about Israel are even
remotely accurate and I think most

9488
03:01:39,530 --> 03:01:39,540
remotely accurate and I think most
 

9489
03:01:39,540 --> 03:01:41,870
remotely accurate and I think most
people it's become a sort of litmus test

9490
03:01:41,870 --> 03:01:41,880
people it's become a sort of litmus test
 

9491
03:01:41,880 --> 03:01:44,150
people it's become a sort of litmus test
are you criticizing Israel enough are

9492
03:01:44,150 --> 03:01:44,160
are you criticizing Israel enough are
 

9493
03:01:44,160 --> 03:01:45,410
are you criticizing Israel enough are
you showing us that you're actually

you showing us that you're actually
 

9495
03:01:45,420 --> 03:01:47,210
you showing us that you're actually
left-wing I don't do any of that stuff I

9496
03:01:47,210 --> 03:01:47,220
left-wing I don't do any of that stuff I
 

9497
03:01:47,220 --> 03:01:48,830
left-wing I don't do any of that stuff I
should really look at the situation for

9498
03:01:48,830 --> 03:01:48,840
should really look at the situation for
 

9499
03:01:48,840 --> 03:01:50,570
should really look at the situation for
what it is that's become a litmus test

9500
03:01:50,570 --> 03:01:50,580
what it is that's become a litmus test
 

9501
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:53,330
what it is that's become a litmus test
in American politics uh in the spectrum

9502
03:01:53,330 --> 03:01:53,340
in American politics uh in the spectrum

03:02:01,670 --> 03:02:01,680
um my view big picture is that uh I
 

9507
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:02,450
um my view big picture is that uh I
don't

9508
03:02:02,450 --> 03:02:02,460
don't
 

9509
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:05,929
don't
think we're going to really get anywhere

9510
03:02:05,929 --> 03:02:05,939
think we're going to really get anywhere
 

9511
03:02:05,939 --> 03:02:07,330
think we're going to really get anywhere
until

9512
03:02:07,330 --> 03:02:07,340
until
 

9513
03:02:07,340 --> 03:02:09,010
until
some

9514
03:02:09,010 --> 03:02:09,020
some
 

9515
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:12,110
some
pre-negotiated terms are set and the

9516
03:02:12,110 --> 03:02:12,120
pre-negotiated terms are set and the
 

9517
03:02:12,120 --> 03:02:14,809
pre-negotiated terms are set and the
parties to do the negotiating are all

9518
03:02:14,809 --> 03:02:14,819
parties to do the negotiating are all
 

9519
03:02:14,819 --> 03:02:17,510
parties to do the negotiating are all
good faith parties for example I don't

9520
03:02:17,510 --> 03:02:17,520
good faith parties for example I don't
 

9521
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:20,750
good faith parties for example I don't
think Israel's right-wing party likud is

9522
03:02:20,750 --> 03:02:20,760
think Israel's right-wing party likud is
 

9523
03:02:20,760 --> 03:02:22,910
think Israel's right-wing party likud is
a particularly good faith Arbiter of

9524
03:02:22,910 --> 03:02:22,920

it's controversial to say that this was
a war of aggression an invasion of

9680
03:05:26,090 --> 03:05:26,100
a war of aggression an invasion of
 

9681

Vladimir Putin
um I

9686
03:05:31,510 --> 03:05:31,520
um I
 

9687
03:05:31,520 --> 03:05:34,730
um I
do believe that

9688
03:05:34,730 --> 03:05:34,740
do believe that
 

9689
03:05:34,740 --> 03:05:38,389
do believe that
if Trump had been re-elected

9690
03:05:38,389 --> 03:05:38,399
if Trump had been re-elected
 

9691
03:05:38,399 --> 03:05:40,910
if Trump had been re-elected
Putin may have seen himself as having

9692
03:05:40,910 --> 03:05:40,920
Putin may have seen himself as having
 

9693
03:05:40,920 --> 03:05:44,389
Putin may have seen himself as having
other tools with which to try to

9694
03:05:44,389 --> 03:05:44,399
other tools with which to try to
 

9695
03:05:44,399 --> 03:05:47,090
other tools with which to try to
um expand influence that may have been

9696
03:05:47,090 --> 03:05:47,100
um expand influence that may have been
 

9697
03:05:47,100 --> 03:05:49,910
um expand influence that may have been
different than geographical uh Pursuits

9698
03:05:49,910 --> 03:05:49,920
different than geographical uh Pursuits
 

9699
03:05:49,920 --> 03:05:52,849
different than geographical uh Pursuits
Geographic Pursuits uh but I we don't

9700
03:05:52,849 --> 03:05:52,859
Geographic Pursuits uh but I we don't
 

9701
03:05:52,859 --> 03:05:54,550
Geographic Pursuits uh but I we don't
know that for sure

9702
03:05:54,550 --> 03:05:54,560
know that for sure
 

9703
03:05:54,560 --> 03:05:58,250
know that for sure
I also have a really hard time imagining

9704
03:05:58,250 --> 03:05:58,260
I also have a really hard time imagining
 

9705
03:05:58,260 --> 03:06:01,309
I also have a really hard time imagining
what the end of this looks like and

9706
03:06:01,309 --> 03:06:01,319
what the end of this looks like and
 

9707
03:06:01,319 --> 03:06:04,969
what the end of this looks like and
that's very scary because

9708
03:06:04,969 --> 03:06:04,979
that's very scary because
 

9709
03:06:04,979 --> 03:06:08,570
that's very scary because
sometimes the most benign end seems to

9710
03:06:08,570 --> 03:06:08,580
sometimes the most benign end seems to
 

9711
03:06:08,580 --> 03:06:10,750
sometimes the most benign end seems to
be that Putin ends up out of power

9712
03:06:10,750 --> 03:06:10,760
be that Putin ends up out of power
 

9713
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:15,190
be that Putin ends up out of power
either through no longer being alive

9714
03:06:15,190 --> 03:06:15,200
either through no longer being alive
 

9715
03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:18,769
either through no longer being alive
or deposed in some way it doesn't feel

9716
03:06:18,769 --> 03:06:18,779
or deposed in some way it doesn't feel
 

9717
03:06:18,779 --> 03:06:20,809
or deposed in some way it doesn't feel
like that ladder is super likely the

9718
03:06:20,809 --> 03:06:20,819
like that ladder is super likely the
 

9719
03:06:20,819 --> 03:06:22,610
like that ladder is super likely the
former there's reports about his health

9720
03:06:22,610 --> 03:06:22,620
former there's reports about his health
 

9721
03:06:22,620 --> 03:06:24,710
former there's reports about his health
I don't know how accurate they are it's

9722
03:06:24,710 --> 03:06:24,720
I don't know how accurate they are it's
 

9723
03:06:24,720 --> 03:06:28,250
I don't know how accurate they are it's
just hard to imagine a face-saving exit

9724
03:06:28,250 --> 03:06:28,260
just hard to imagine a face-saving exit
 

9725
03:06:28,260 --> 03:06:30,710
just hard to imagine a face-saving exit
that is going to be

9726
03:06:30,710 --> 03:06:30,720
that is going to be
 

9727
03:06:30,720 --> 03:06:33,889
that is going to be
um even remotely uh what's the word it's

9728
03:06:33,889 --> 03:06:33,899
um even remotely uh what's the word it's
 

9729
03:06:33,899 --> 03:06:36,530
um even remotely uh what's the word it's
not even a question of acceptable just

9730
03:06:36,530 --> 03:06:36,540
not even a question of acceptable just
 

9731
03:06:36,540 --> 03:06:39,050
not even a question of acceptable just
um it's not satisfying either just just

9732
03:06:39,050 --> 03:06:39,060
um it's not satisfying either just just
 

9733
03:06:39,060 --> 03:06:41,570
um it's not satisfying either just just
not tragic I guess is what I'm looking

9734
03:06:41,570 --> 03:06:41,580
not tragic I guess is what I'm looking
 

9735
03:06:41,580 --> 03:06:44,269
not tragic I guess is what I'm looking
for in terms of uh Putin speaking to the

9736
03:06:44,269 --> 03:06:44,279
for in terms of uh Putin speaking to the

Russian people and being able to figure
out what to say what kind of narrative

mean to some degree it requires Russian
troops leaving Ukraine and that is

test
 

9789
03:07:48,540 --> 03:07:51,050
test
how you speak about it I think because

9790
03:07:51,050 --> 03:07:51,060
how you speak about it I think because
 

9791
03:07:51,060 --> 03:07:52,490
how you speak about it I think because
of the huge amount of funding that's

9792
03:07:52,490 --> 03:07:52,500
of the huge amount of funding that's
 

9793
03:07:52,500 --> 03:07:56,929
of the huge amount of funding that's
going uh from U.S to Ukraine

the the most disappointing thing is that
 

9825
03:08:26,399 --> 03:08:28,429
the the most disappointing thing is that
some of these issues become incredible

9826

some of these issues become incredible
 

9827

devices divisive but they're simple like
 

9829
03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:32,630
devices divisive but they're simple like
for example a conspiracy theory that we

for example a conspiracy theory that we
 

9831
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:34,309
for example a conspiracy theory that we
know isn't true it shouldn't be devices

9833
03:08:34,319 --> 03:08:36,590
know isn't true it shouldn't be devices

I think where I've had disagreements
with Chomsky in the past is more he

9980
03:11:30,050 --> 03:11:30,060
with Chomsky in the past is more he
 

9981
03:11:30,060 --> 03:11:32,450
with Chomsky in the past is more he
framed he seems to frame the us as a

9982
03:11:32,450 --> 03:11:32,460
framed he seems to frame the us as a
 

9983
03:11:32,460 --> 03:11:35,330
framed he seems to frame the us as a
uniquely bad actor in some of these

9984
03:11:35,330 --> 03:11:35,340
uniquely bad actor in some of these
 

9985
03:11:35,340 --> 03:11:37,910
uniquely bad actor in some of these
cases and I think it's more an

9986
03:11:37,910 --> 03:11:37,920
cases and I think it's more an
 

9987
03:11:37,920 --> 03:11:40,490
cases and I think it's more an
outcropping of the size and wealth of

9988
03:11:40,490 --> 03:11:40,500
outcropping of the size and wealth of
 

9989
03:11:40,500 --> 03:11:43,969
outcropping of the size and wealth of
the US and less about uniquely negative

9990
03:11:43,969 --> 03:11:43,979
the US and less about uniquely negative
 

9991
03:11:43,979 --> 03:11:46,429
the US and less about uniquely negative
intentions and so I think that would be

9992
03:11:46,429 --> 03:11:46,439

forced me to actually have an opinion
 

10545
03:22:19,380 --> 03:22:21,710
forced me to actually have an opinion
about the details of it and to do enough

10546
03:22:21,710 --> 03:22:21,720
about the details of it and to do enough
 

10547
03:22:21,720 --> 03:22:24,290
about the details of it and to do enough
research to think like okay what is the

10548
03:22:24,290 --> 03:22:24,300
research to think like okay what is the
 

10549
03:22:24,300 --> 03:22:25,969
research to think like okay what is the
historical context of this book I mean

rewarding to basically the old Feynman

10558
03:22:34,969 --> 03:22:34,979
rewarding to basically the old Feynman
 

10559
03:22:34,979 --> 03:22:37,309
rewarding to basically the old Feynman
thing uh one of the best ways to learn

10560

thing uh one of the best ways to learn
 

10561
03:22:37,319 --> 03:22:40,250
thing uh one of the best ways to learn
is to teach yeah I can't think of one

10753
03:26:07,979 --> 03:26:09,349
dozens of people who I felt obligated to
talk to on the phone because of a

10754

talk to on the phone because of a
 

10755

advice and I can tell
 

10759

advice and I can tell
they're not going to do it they just

10760

10764
03:26:19,070 --> 03:26:19,080
complicated and so instead they'll sort

thing that applies in so many situations

10798
03:26:53,090 --> 03:26:53,100
thing that applies in so many situations
 

10799
03:26:53,100 --> 03:26:55,969
thing that applies in so many situations
is situations is just try it right away

10800
03:26:55,969 --> 03:26:55,979
is situations is just try it right away
 

10801

and iterate from there yeah start today

10802
03:26:58,969 --> 03:26:58,979
and iterate from there yeah start today
 

10803
03:26:58,979 --> 03:27:01,550
and iterate from there yeah start today
and then do it every day

10804
03:27:01,550 --> 03:27:01,560
and then do it every day
 

10805
03:27:01,560 --> 03:27:03,530
and then do it every day
or decide hey you know what I figured

10806
03:27:03,530 --> 03:27:03,540
or decide hey you know what I figured
 

10807
03:27:03,540 --> 03:27:05,750
or decide hey you know what I figured
out I don't actually want to do it

10808
03:27:05,750 --> 03:27:05,760
out I don't actually want to do it
 

10809
03:27:05,760 --> 03:27:08,330
out I don't actually want to do it
yeah considerate yeah uh well usually

10810
03:27:08,330 --> 03:27:08,340
yeah considerate yeah uh well usually
 

10811
03:27:08,340 --> 03:27:12,229
yeah considerate yeah uh well usually
you'll discover you you do

10812
03:27:12,229 --> 03:27:12,239

 

10813
03:27:12,239 --> 03:27:13,849

you think we'll make it out of the

10814
03:27:13,849 --> 03:27:13,859
you think we'll make it out of the
 

10815
03:27:13,859 --> 03:27:16,550
you think we'll make it out of the
century Humanity human civilization out

10816
03:27:16,550 --> 03:27:16,560
century Humanity human civilization out
 

10817
03:27:16,560 --> 03:27:19,190
century Humanity human civilization out
of the so like to 2100 yeah how much we

10818
03:27:19,190 --> 03:27:19,200
of the so like to 2100 yeah how much we
 

10819
03:27:19,200 --> 03:27:20,450
of the so like to 2100 yeah how much we
got 80 years

10820
03:27:20,450 --> 03:27:20,460
got 80 years
 

10821
03:27:20,460 --> 03:27:23,889
got 80 years
yeah uh 77s

10822
03:27:23,889 --> 03:27:23,899
yeah uh 77s
 

10823
03:27:23,899 --> 03:27:26,450
yeah uh 77s
you think so yeah uh what are the

10824
03:27:26,450 --> 03:27:26,460
you think so yeah uh what are the
 

10825
03:27:26,460 --> 03:27:35,510
you think so yeah uh what are the
biggest threats facing our civilization

10826
03:27:35,510 --> 03:27:35,520

 

10827
03:27:35,520 --> 03:27:37,910

um I I actually think that uh

10828
03:27:37,910 --> 03:27:37,920
um I I actually think that uh
 

10829
03:27:37,920 --> 03:27:39,769
um I I actually think that uh
if you believe

10830
03:27:39,769 --> 03:27:39,779
if you believe
 

10831
03:27:39,779 --> 03:27:43,070
if you believe
that we are on an inflection point of

10832
03:27:43,070 --> 03:27:43,080
that we are on an inflection point of
 

10833
03:27:43,080 --> 03:27:46,250
that we are on an inflection point of
sorts in changes to society and

10834
03:27:46,250 --> 03:27:46,260
sorts in changes to society and
 

10835
03:27:46,260 --> 03:27:49,250
sorts in changes to society and
acceleration of Technology Etc I think

10836
03:27:49,250 --> 03:27:49,260
acceleration of Technology Etc I think
 

10837
03:27:49,260 --> 03:27:53,269
acceleration of Technology Etc I think
it's really tough to know in 2090 what

10838
03:27:53,269 --> 03:27:53,279
it's really tough to know in 2090 what
 

10839
03:27:53,279 --> 03:27:54,950
it's really tough to know in 2090 what
will actually be the biggest threat so I

10840
03:27:54,950 --> 03:27:54,960
will actually be the biggest threat so I
 

10841
03:27:54,960 --> 03:27:58,269
will actually be the biggest threat so I
don't know it's so cliche to say nuclear

10842
03:27:58,269 --> 03:27:58,279
don't know it's so cliche to say nuclear
 

10843
03:27:58,279 --> 03:28:01,969
don't know it's so cliche to say nuclear
and climate change and another pandemic

10844
03:28:01,969 --> 03:28:01,979
and climate change and another pandemic
 

10845
03:28:01,979 --> 03:28:04,130
and climate change and another pandemic
technologically the world might look so

10846
03:28:04,130 --> 03:28:04,140
technologically the world might look so
 

10847
03:28:04,140 --> 03:28:05,950
technologically the world might look so
different than this yes

10848
03:28:05,950 --> 03:28:05,960
different than this yes
 

10849
03:28:05,960 --> 03:28:08,090
different than this yes
unimaginable what it means to be human

10850
03:28:08,090 --> 03:28:08,100
unimaginable what it means to be human
 

10851
03:28:08,100 --> 03:28:10,849
unimaginable what it means to be human
is unimaginable and also

10852
03:28:10,849 --> 03:28:10,859
is unimaginable and also
 

10853
03:28:10,859 --> 03:28:13,250
is unimaginable and also
um the degree that we make progress out

10854
03:28:13,250 --> 03:28:13,260
um the degree that we make progress out
 

10855
03:28:13,260 --> 03:28:14,630
um the degree that we make progress out
into space

10856
03:28:14,630 --> 03:28:14,640
into space
 

10857
03:28:14,640 --> 03:28:17,210
into space
is also unimaginable I think space is

10858
03:28:17,210 --> 03:28:17,220
is also unimaginable I think space is
 

10859
03:28:17,220 --> 03:28:19,070
is also unimaginable I think space is
super interesting and there's people on

10860
03:28:19,070 --> 03:28:19,080
super interesting and there's people on
 

10861
03:28:19,080 --> 03:28:20,630
super interesting and there's people on
both the left and right who for

10862
03:28:20,630 --> 03:28:20,640
both the left and right who for
 

10863
03:28:20,640 --> 03:28:22,790
both the left and right who for
different reasons are kind of not into

10864
03:28:22,790 --> 03:28:22,800
different reasons are kind of not into
 

10865
03:28:22,800 --> 03:28:24,769
different reasons are kind of not into
the whole space exploration thing the

10866
03:28:24,769 --> 03:28:24,779
the whole space exploration thing the
 

10867
03:28:24,779 --> 03:28:26,570
the whole space exploration thing the
people I hear from the ones on the right

10868
03:28:26,570 --> 03:28:26,580
people I hear from the ones on the right
 

10869
03:28:26,580 --> 03:28:29,630
people I hear from the ones on the right
think it's just kind of dumb the ones on

10870
03:28:29,630 --> 03:28:29,640
think it's just kind of dumb the ones on
 

10871
03:28:29,640 --> 03:28:31,370
think it's just kind of dumb the ones on
the left think it's an excuse not to fix

10872
03:28:31,370 --> 03:28:31,380
the left think it's an excuse not to fix
 

10873
03:28:31,380 --> 03:28:35,030
the left think it's an excuse not to fix
problems here I think also uh they say

10874
03:28:35,030 --> 03:28:35,040
problems here I think also uh they say
 

10875
03:28:35,040 --> 03:28:37,190
problems here I think also uh they say
it's the play thing of billionaires sure

10876
03:28:37,190 --> 03:28:37,200

10877
03:28:37,200 --> 03:28:39,710
it's the play thing of billionaires sure
which is another funny kind of concept

10878
03:28:39,710 --> 03:28:39,720
which is another funny kind of concept
 

10879
03:28:39,720 --> 03:28:42,010
which is another funny kind of concept
yeah I mean someone's got to pay for it

10880
03:28:42,010 --> 03:28:42,020
yeah I mean someone's got to pay for it
 

10881
03:28:42,020 --> 03:28:45,110
yeah I mean someone's got to pay for it
uh why not be people who have a lot of

10882
03:28:45,110 --> 03:28:45,120
uh why not be people who have a lot of
 

10883
03:28:45,120 --> 03:28:47,809
uh why not be people who have a lot of
money to to either be billionaires or

10884
03:28:47,809 --> 03:28:47,819
money to to either be billionaires or
 

10885
03:28:47,819 --> 03:28:50,210
money to to either be billionaires or
governments that are trillionaires or

10886
03:28:50,210 --> 03:28:50,220
governments that are trillionaires or
 

10887
03:28:50,220 --> 03:28:52,910
governments that are trillionaires or
somebody has to pay for big ambitious

10888
03:28:52,910 --> 03:28:52,920
somebody has to pay for big ambitious
 

10889
03:28:52,920 --> 03:28:55,130
somebody has to pay for big ambitious
moonshot projects to me the most

10890
03:28:55,130 --> 03:28:55,140
moonshot projects to me the most
 

10891
03:28:55,140 --> 03:28:57,590
moonshot projects to me the most
interesting thing is that

10892
03:28:57,590 --> 03:28:57,600
interesting thing is that
 

10893
03:28:57,600 --> 03:29:00,650
interesting thing is that
in getting closer to the next step of

10894
03:29:00,650 --> 03:29:00,660
in getting closer to the next step of
 

10895
03:29:00,660 --> 03:29:03,290
in getting closer to the next step of
space exploration we may well learn

10896
03:29:03,290 --> 03:29:03,300
space exploration we may well learn
 

10897
03:29:03,300 --> 03:29:06,590
space exploration we may well learn
things that can then be used to improve

10898
03:29:06,590 --> 03:29:06,600
things that can then be used to improve
 

10899
03:29:06,600 --> 03:29:08,630
things that can then be used to improve
circumstances here for me it's not one

10900
03:29:08,630 --> 03:29:08,640
circumstances here for me it's not one
 

10901
03:29:08,640 --> 03:29:10,610
circumstances here for me it's not one
or the other and I recently read a long
