right and then the matrix movie actually

160
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
right and then the matrix movie actually
 

161
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,030
right and then the matrix movie actually
came out of these papers

162
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
came out of these papers
 

163
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,270
came out of these papers
and then these ideas made its way it

164
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
and then these ideas made its way it
 

165
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,229
and then these ideas made its way it
made their way into the public

166
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
made their way into the public
 

167

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
um i personally think that if i had the
 

171
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,830
um i personally think that if i had the
choice to be in the digital world at the

172
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
choice to be in the digital world at the
 

173
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,030
choice to be in the digital world at the
same fidelity

174
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
same fidelity
 

175
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,150
same fidelity
as the real world with immortality i

176
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
as the real world with immortality i
 

177
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,509
as the real world with immortality i
would absolutely go with the digital

178
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
would absolutely go with the digital
 

179
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,949
would absolutely go with the digital
wait wait wait wait wait how'd you add

180
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
wait wait wait wait wait how'd you add
 

181
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,309
wait wait wait wait wait how'd you add
the immortality part

182
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
the immortality part
 

183
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,869
the immortality part
that's a won't get immortality if you

184
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
that's a won't get immortality if you
 

185
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,070
that's a won't get immortality if you
think about how we would go into the

186
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
think about how we would go into the
 

187
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,830
think about how we would go into the
digital world right our our our brain

188
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
digital world right our our our brain
 

189
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,350
digital world right our our our brain
patterns would be mapped

190
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
patterns would be mapped
 

191
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,509
patterns would be mapped
onto some kind of uh probably virtual

192
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
onto some kind of uh probably virtual
 

193
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,790
onto some kind of uh probably virtual
machine right

194
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
machine right
 

195
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,710
machine right
and that would mean a multi immortality

196
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
and that would mean a multi immortality
 

197
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,390
and that would mean a multi immortality
right because the virtual machine has no

198
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
right because the virtual machine has no
 

199
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,030
right because the virtual machine has no
limit

200
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
limit
 

201
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,550
limit
to how long it can be don't you think

202
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
to how long it can be don't you think
 

203
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,390
to how long it can be don't you think
there will be like a versioning system

204
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
there will be like a versioning system
 

205
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,670
there will be like a versioning system
like uh there'll be this is a soft

206
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
like uh there'll be this is a soft
 

207
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,990
like uh there'll be this is a soft

sergey version
 

211
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,750
sergey version
2.0 would be different from sergey

212
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
2.0 would be different from sergey
 

213
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,350
2.0 would be different from sergey

version 1.0
 

215
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,869
version 1.0
there'll be an upgrade so that's

216
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
there'll be an upgrade so that's
 

217
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,350
there'll be an upgrade so that's
immortality sergey 1.0 would die in the

00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
immortality sergey 1.0 would die in the
 

219
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,630
immortality sergey 1.0 would die in the
digital world and you should get

220
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
digital world and you should get
 

221
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,190
digital world and you should get
you get like a software update and then

222
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
you get like a software update and then
 

223
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,309
you get like a software update and then
that's it

224
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
that's it
 

225
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,990
that's it
you know well yeah when people go into

00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
you know well yeah when people go into

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,589
you know well yeah when people go into
the star trek transporter are they

00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
the star trek transporter are they
 

229
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,509
the star trek transporter are they
killed or are they transported

papers on this i haven't really thought
 

235
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,710
papers on this i haven't really thought
about it too much there's no white paper

236
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
about it too much there's no white paper
 

237
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,670
about it too much there's no white paper
on the transporter

238
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
on the transporter
 

239
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,750
on the transporter
not not at this point so what what does

240
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
not not at this point so what what does

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,270
not not at this point so what what does
fidelity mean exactly

242
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
fidelity mean exactly
 

243
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,750
fidelity mean exactly
to you is it like strictly so the

244
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
to you is it like strictly so the
 

245
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,910
to you is it like strictly so the
fidelity of the physics world

246
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
fidelity of the physics world
 

247
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,550
fidelity of the physics world
the physical world is maybe now

248
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
the physical world is maybe now
 

249
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,670
the physical world is maybe now
questions of physics

250
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
questions of physics
 

251
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,070
questions of physics
quantum mechanics what is at the at the

252
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
quantum mechanics what is at the at the
 

253
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,110
quantum mechanics what is at the at the
bottom of it all

254
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
bottom of it all
 

255
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,630
bottom of it all
right or do you mean the fidelity of the

256
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
right or do you mean the fidelity of the
 

257
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,309
right or do you mean the fidelity of the
actual experience it's just it's just

00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
actual experience it's just it's just
 

259
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,270
actual experience it's just it's just
perception

260
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
perception
 

261
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,670
perception
it's just just the human but that's

262
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
it's just just the human but that's
 

263
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,149
it's just just the human but that's
limited by human cognitive capabilities

264
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
limited by human cognitive capabilities
 

265
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,670
limited by human cognitive capabilities
it is but i don't really have anything

266
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
it is but i don't really have anything
 

267
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,110
it is but i don't really have anything
else right i think all of these papers

268
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
else right i think all of these papers
 

269
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,390
else right i think all of these papers
that brought up these questions of a

270
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
that brought up these questions of a
 

271
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,590
that brought up these questions of a
simulation they were like

272
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
simulation they were like
 

273
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,509
simulation they were like
in epistemology and metaphysics right

274
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
in epistemology and metaphysics right
 

275
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,270
in epistemology and metaphysics right
and what they were trying to do

276
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
and what they were trying to do
 

277
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,710
and what they were trying to do
i think was they were trying to put

278
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
i think was they were trying to put
 

279
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,390
i think was they were trying to put
people through a thought experiment

280
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
people through a thought experiment
 

281
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,870
people through a thought experiment
where

282
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
where
 

283
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,950
where
they would come out on the other end and

284
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
they would come out on the other end and
 

285
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,230
they would come out on the other end and
say the

286
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
say the
 

287
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,990
say the
reality of life is really worth

288
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
reality of life is really worth
 

289
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,230
reality of life is really worth
something and i don't

290
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
something and i don't
 

291
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,070
something and i don't
i don't you know ignorance isn't bliss

292
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
i don't you know ignorance isn't bliss
 

293
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,749
i don't you know ignorance isn't bliss
which is that's the consistent statement

294
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
which is that's the consistent statement
 

295
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,350
which is that's the consistent statement
in the matrix right ignorance is bliss

296
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
in the matrix right ignorance is bliss
 

297
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,710
in the matrix right ignorance is bliss
is that that's what one of the guys says

298
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
is that that's what one of the guys says
 

299
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,150
is that that's what one of the guys says
when he's like you know doing something

300
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
when he's like you know doing something
 

301
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,710
when he's like you know doing something
wrong and

302
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
wrong and
 

303
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,710
wrong and
trying to get back into the matrix and

304
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
trying to get back into the matrix and
 

305
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,790
trying to get back into the matrix and
and the question is is ignorance bliss

306
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
and the question is is ignorance bliss
 

307
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,870
and the question is is ignorance bliss
um and it's like a different version of

308
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
um and it's like a different version of
 

309
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,070
um and it's like a different version of
that i

310
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
that i
 

311
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,390
that i
i think from a perceptual point of view

312
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
i think from a perceptual point of view
 

313
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,990
i think from a perceptual point of view
if my perceptions

314
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
if my perceptions
 

315
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,390
if my perceptions
aren't in any way different so fidelity

316
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
aren't in any way different so fidelity
 

317
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,830
aren't in any way different so fidelity
is very good

318
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
is very good
 

319
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,629
is very good
it doesn't matter now i i don't know

320
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
it doesn't matter now i i don't know
 

321
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,670
it doesn't matter now i i don't know
right so if i

322
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
right so if i
 

323
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,749
right so if i
that it's if i don't know something it

324
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
that it's if i don't know something it
 

325
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,350
that it's if i don't know something it
doesn't really exist and if it doesn't

326
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
doesn't really exist and if it doesn't
 

327
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,070
doesn't really exist and if it doesn't
exist

328
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
exist
 

329
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,909
exist
in in in my perception or my

330
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
in in in my perception or my
 

331
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,749
in in in my perception or my
consciousness then it doesn't exist

things
 

341
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,830

i i personally never really got into the

i i personally never really got into the
 

343
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,510
i i personally never really got into the
metaphysics stuff because i i could

metaphysics stuff because i i could
 

345
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,830

never really um
 

347
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,830
never really um
i couldn't understand what the point of

i couldn't understand what the point of
 

349
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,670
i couldn't understand what the point of
it was right it it

00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
it was right it it
 

351
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,790
it was right it it
it's one of these things where i

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,070
it's one of these things where i
couldn't really get what um

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
realm of questions right like
 

361
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,870
realm of questions right like
if there was something about the world

362
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
if there was something about the world
 

363
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,230
if there was something about the world
but you didn't have a

364
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
but you didn't have a
 

365
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,310
but you didn't have a
capacity to perceive it would it matter

366
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
capacity to perceive it would it matter
 

367
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,350
capacity to perceive it would it matter
to you

368
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
to you
 

369
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,830
to you
uh to me it wouldn't matter right to me

370
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
uh to me it wouldn't matter right to me
 

371
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,510
uh to me it wouldn't matter right to me
to me by the way the simulation thing is

372
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
to me by the way the simulation thing is
 

373
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,710
to me by the way the simulation thing is
a really interesting engineering

374
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
a really interesting engineering
 

375
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,670
a really interesting engineering
question

376
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
question
 

377
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,830
question
which is how difficult is it to engineer

378
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
which is how difficult is it to engineer
 

379
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,710
which is how difficult is it to engineer
virtual reality a digital world that is

380
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
virtual reality a digital world that is
 

381
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,230
virtual reality a digital world that is
sufficiently

382
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
sufficiently
 

383
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,230
sufficiently
of high fidelity where you would want to

384
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
of high fidelity where you would want to
 

385
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,390
of high fidelity where you would want to
live in it i think that's a really

386
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
live in it i think that's a really
 

387
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,550
live in it i think that's a really
testable and a fascinating engineering

388
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
testable and a fascinating engineering
 

389
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,390
testable and a fascinating engineering
question because my intuition says like

390
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
question because my intuition says like
 

391
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,469
question because my intuition says like
it's not as difficult as we think

392
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
it's not as difficult as we think
 

393
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,629
it's not as difficult as we think
it's not nearly as difficult as having

394
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
it's not nearly as difficult as having
 

395
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,990
it's not nearly as difficult as having
to create

396
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
to create
 

397
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,749
to create
a quantum mechanical simulation that's

398
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
a quantum mechanical simulation that's
 

399
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,510
a quantum mechanical simulation that's
large enough to capture the full human

400
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
large enough to capture the full human
 

401
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,469
large enough to capture the full human
experience like

402
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
experience like
 

403
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,110
experience like
it might be just as simple as just a

404
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
it might be just as simple as just a
 

405
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,590
it might be just as simple as just a
really nice quake game

406
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
really nice quake game
 

407
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,590
really nice quake game
like with a nice engine with you know

408
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
like with a nice engine with you know
 

409
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,749
like with a nice engine with you know
that just creating all the basic visual

410
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
that just creating all the basic visual
 

411
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,390
that just creating all the basic visual
elements

412

elements
 

413
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,350
elements
that tricked our cognitive our visual

414
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
that tricked our cognitive our visual
 

415
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,029
that tricked our cognitive our visual
cortex into believing that we're

416
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
cortex into believing that we're
 

417
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:29,510
cortex into believing that we're
actually

418
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
actually
 

419
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,309
actually
in the physical environment and i think

420
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
in the physical environment and i think
 

421
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,510
in the physical environment and i think
that

422
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
that
 

423
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,270
that
if that's true then that's quite you

424
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
if that's true then that's quite you
 

425
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,550
if that's true then that's quite you
know that

426
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
know that
 

427
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,550
know that
a high fidelity digital world is

428
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
a high fidelity digital world is
 

429
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,309
a high fidelity digital world is
actually achievable within

430
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
actually achievable within
 

431
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,590
actually achievable within
you know a century and and that changes

432
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
you know a century and and that changes
 

433
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,790
you know a century and and that changes
things

434
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
things
 

435
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,550
things
yeah yeah maybe maybe in my in our

436
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
yeah yeah maybe maybe in my in our
 

437
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,830
yeah yeah maybe maybe in my in our
lifetime i'm really hoping for that i'm

438
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
lifetime i'm really hoping for that i'm
 

439
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,749
lifetime i'm really hoping for that i'm
hoping somebody can copy my brain waves

440
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
hoping somebody can copy my brain waves
 

441
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,189
hoping somebody can copy my brain waves
onto a virtual machine

442
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
onto a virtual machine
 

443
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,350
onto a virtual machine
yeah and uh you know allow those uh

444
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
yeah and uh you know allow those uh
 

445
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,870
yeah and uh you know allow those uh
allow that consciousness to continue to

446
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
allow that consciousness to continue to
 

447
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,670
allow that consciousness to continue to
exist

448
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
exist
 

449
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,189
exist
whether that's that's death or not i

450
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
whether that's that's death or not i
 

451
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,950
whether that's that's death or not i
don't i don't know

452
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
don't i don't know
 

453
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,909
don't i don't know
but i i think it's actually um gonna

454
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
but i i think it's actually um gonna
 

455
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,670
but i i think it's actually um gonna
require some serious leaps like even

456
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
require some serious leaps like even
 

457
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,589
require some serious leaps like even
even the vr headsets right

even the vr headsets right
 

459
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,309
even the vr headsets right
they um don't work if they go below 90

00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
they um don't work if they go below 90

brain waves

500
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
brain waves
 

501
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,270
brain waves
turned into a virtual machine would you

502
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
turned into a virtual machine would you
 

503
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,230
turned into a virtual machine would you
in that context if morpheus came to you

504
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
in that context if morpheus came to you
 

505
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,710
in that context if morpheus came to you
would you take the blue pill or the red

506
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
would you take the blue pill or the red
 

507
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,430
would you take the blue pill or the red
pill

508
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
pill
 

509
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,430
pill
meaning would you be happy just living

510
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
meaning would you be happy just living
 

511
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,230
meaning would you be happy just living
in that world

512
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
in that world
 

513
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,629
in that world
and not knowing that you're living

514
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
and not knowing that you're living
 

515
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,629
and not knowing that you're living
inside that virtual world that's running

516
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
inside that virtual world that's running
 

517
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,670
inside that virtual world that's running
a computer

518
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:03,680
a computer
 

519
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,589
a computer
or would you want to know the truth of

520
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
or would you want to know the truth of
 

521
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,189
or would you want to know the truth of
it well actually

522
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
it well actually
 

523
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,469
it well actually
i think that's a very different question

524
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
i think that's a very different question
 

525
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,710
i think that's a very different question
right there's a there's a there's a

526
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
right there's a there's a there's a
 

527
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,469
right there's a there's a there's a
actually moral ethical question there

528
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
actually moral ethical question there
 

529
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,629
actually moral ethical question there
about whether you should allow a bunch

530
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
about whether you should allow a bunch
 

531
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,390
about whether you should allow a bunch
of people to get you know manipulated

532
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
of people to get you know manipulated
 

533
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,070
of people to get you know manipulated
and killed and slaved because in the

534
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
and killed and slaved because in the
 

535
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,909
and killed and slaved because in the
matrix they're all enslaved and

536
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
matrix they're all enslaved and
 

537
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,550
matrix they're all enslaved and
in as as as as like you know a triple a

538
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
in as as as as like you know a triple a
 

539
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,189
in as as as as like you know a triple a
battery

540
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
battery
 

541
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,790
battery
to turn a human being into the battery

542
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
to turn a human being into the battery
 

543
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,710
to turn a human being into the battery
right um

544
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
right um
 

545
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,909
right um
so i i think the the moral and ethical

546
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
so i i think the the moral and ethical
 

547
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,430
so i i think the the moral and ethical
question of that

548
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
question of that
 

549
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,630
question of that
fascinating enough isn't actually

550
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
fascinating enough isn't actually
 

551
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,750
fascinating enough isn't actually
different than the more unethical

552
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
different than the more unethical
 

553
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,029
different than the more unethical
questions we face today

554
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
questions we face today
 

555
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,149
questions we face today
in modern daily life but i

556
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
in modern daily life but i
 

557
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,829
in modern daily life but i
probably have given the choice of just

558
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
probably have given the choice of just
 

559
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,509
probably have given the choice of just
completely going along

560
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
completely going along
 

561
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,389
completely going along
or going against it i would probably go

562
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
or going against it i would probably go
 

563
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,269
or going against it i would probably go
against it

564
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
against it
 

565
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,949
against it
if i had to make this kind of binary

566
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
if i had to make this kind of binary
 

567
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,710
if i had to make this kind of binary
choice because going

568
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
choice because going
 

569
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,310
choice because going
going along with it

570
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320

 

571
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,030

i think at that scale of scary you know

572
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
i think at that scale of scary you know
 

573
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,790
i think at that scale of scary you know
stuff happening to people

574
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
stuff happening to people
 

575
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,710
stuff happening to people
is is probably something really um

576
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
is is probably something really um
 

577
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,829
is is probably something really um
really really difficult

578
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
really really difficult
 

579
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,430
really really difficult
but for your individual life it's way

580
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
but for your individual life it's way
 

581
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,110
but for your individual life it's way
more fun to go along with it

582
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
more fun to go along with it
 

583
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,829
more fun to go along with it
so you're saying you value

584
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
so you're saying you value
 

585
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,070
so you're saying you value
the opposing a system that includes the

586
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
the opposing a system that includes the
 

587
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,590
the opposing a system that includes the
suffering of others

588
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
suffering of others
 

589
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,790
suffering of others
versus just for yourself and enjoying

590
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
versus just for yourself and enjoying
 

591
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,670
versus just for yourself and enjoying
the ride

592
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
the ride
 

593
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,670
the ride
i mean what what's what's if there is

594
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
i mean what what's what's if there is
 

595
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,350
i mean what what's what's if there is
such a binary choice

596
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
such a binary choice
 

597
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,070
such a binary choice
why choose the opposite system i think

598
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
why choose the opposite system i think
 

599
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,670
why choose the opposite system i think
it's the nature of um kind of the

600
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
it's the nature of um kind of the
 

601
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,110
it's the nature of um kind of the
ethical dilemma that you face in that

602
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
ethical dilemma that you face in that
 

603
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,910
ethical dilemma that you face in that
situation

604
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
situation
 

605
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,750
situation
there's kind of some you know this is

606
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
there's kind of some you know this is
 

607
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,030
there's kind of some you know this is
obviously not something that's happening

608
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
obviously not something that's happening
 

609
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,829
obviously not something that's happening
now right

610
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
now right
 

611
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,269
now right
we don't know this right

612
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279

 

613
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,310

at the end of the day at that scale

614
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
at the end of the day at that scale
 

615
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,310
at the end of the day at that scale
of of something like that happening yeah

616
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
of of something like that happening yeah
 

617
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,430
of of something like that happening yeah
that scale

618
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
that scale
 

619
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,990
that scale
of of people being um you know

620
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
of of people being um you know
 

621
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,509
of of people being um you know
manipulated and harmed

622
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
manipulated and harmed
 

623
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,430
manipulated and harmed
then i think pretty much almost all

624
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
then i think pretty much almost all
 

625
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,030
then i think pretty much almost all
people have an obligation

626
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
people have an obligation
 

627
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,230
people have an obligation
to go to go against it uh

628
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
to go to go against it uh
 

629
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,829
to go to go against it uh
probably that's what that that looks

630
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
probably that's what that that looks
 

631
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,590
probably that's what that that looks
like in my opinion

632
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
like in my opinion
 

633
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,509
like in my opinion
so you've talked about the concept of

634
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
so you've talked about the concept of
 

635
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,590
so you've talked about the concept of
definitive truth

636
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
definitive truth
 

637
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,509
definitive truth
what is it and in general what is the

638
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
what is it and in general what is the
 

639
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,750
what is it and in general what is the
nature of truth in human civilization

640
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
nature of truth in human civilization
 

641
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,110
nature of truth in human civilization
and just talking about the digital age

642
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
and just talking about the digital age
 

643
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,590
and just talking about the digital age
uh the nature of truth in the digital

644
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
uh the nature of truth in the digital
 

645
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,190
uh the nature of truth in the digital
age

646
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
age
 

647
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,710
age
so the interesting thing about

648
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
so the interesting thing about
 

649
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,389
so the interesting thing about
definitive truth is that it actually

650
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
definitive truth is that it actually
 

651
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,509
definitive truth is that it actually
exists on um on this at least in my mind

652
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
exists on um on this at least in my mind
 

653
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,710
exists on um on this at least in my mind
on this spectrum

654
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
on this spectrum
 

655
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,509
on this spectrum
between objective truth and just you

656
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
between objective truth and just you
 

657
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,310
between objective truth and just you
know somebody

658
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
know somebody
 

659
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,670
know somebody
uh made something up and nobody else

660
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
uh made something up and nobody else
 

661
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,430
uh made something up and nobody else
agrees so what i

662
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
agrees so what i
 

663
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,110
agrees so what i
what i think definitive truth is is it's

664

what i think definitive truth is is it's
 

665
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,030
what i think definitive truth is is it's
somewhere in the middle on that spectrum

666
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
somewhere in the middle on that spectrum
 

667
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,069
somewhere in the middle on that spectrum
where if you and me define

668
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
where if you and me define
 

669
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,310
where if you and me define
uh what truth is right like if you and

670
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
uh what truth is right like if you and
 

671
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,150
uh what truth is right like if you and
me have an agreement of some kind

672
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
me have an agreement of some kind
 

673
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,430
me have an agreement of some kind
and we say as long as the weather

674
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
and we say as long as the weather
 

675
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,829
and we say as long as the weather
is sunny or the weather isn't there is

676
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
is sunny or the weather isn't there is

then there will be an insurance policy

680
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
then there will be an insurance policy
 

681
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,590
then there will be an insurance policy
that results and you and me both agree

that results and you and me both agree
 

683
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,829
that results and you and me both agree
that as long as three sensors

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
stations all say that
 

689
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,430
stations all say that
then the definitive truth for us and for

690
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
then the definitive truth for us and for
 

691
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,710
then the definitive truth for us and for
that agreement

692

that agreement
 

693
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,990
that agreement
is the result of of those systems

694
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
is the result of of those systems
 

695
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,230
is the result of of those systems

is probably what's
what's um kind of necessary and

in any case much better than you know

happens it's it's definitely an upgrade
 

777
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:18,629
happens it's it's definitely an upgrade
from that

778
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
from that
 

779
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,389
from that
do you think it's possible to define

780
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
do you think it's possible to define
 

781
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,750
do you think it's possible to define
formally in this way

782
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
formally in this way
 

783
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,430
formally in this way
a definitive truth for many things in

784
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
a definitive truth for many things in
 

785
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,230
a definitive truth for many things in
this world like you talked about whether

786
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
this world like you talked about whether
 

787
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,710
this world like you talked about whether
basically defining that if three sensors

788
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
basically defining that if three sensors
 

789
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,230
basically defining that if three sensors
of weather agree

790
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
of weather agree
 

791
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,750
of weather agree
then that we're going to agree that that

792
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
then that we're going to agree that that
 

793
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,350
then that we're going to agree that that
is a definitive

794
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
is a definitive
 

795
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,829
is a definitive
useful truth for us to operate under

796
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
useful truth for us to operate under
 

797
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,590
useful truth for us to operate under
so how many things in this world can be

798
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
so how many things in this world can be
 

799
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,670
so how many things in this world can be
formalized in this way do you think

800
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
formalized in this way do you think
 

801
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,069
formalized in this way do you think
uh a huge a huge amount so so there's

802
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
uh a huge a huge amount so so there's
 

803
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,030
uh a huge a huge amount so so there's
there's actually

804
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
there's actually
 

805
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,470
there's actually
um two two things going on here

806
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
um two two things going on here
 

807
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,310
um two two things going on here
one thing is the amount of data that

808
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
one thing is the amount of data that
 

809
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,550
one thing is the amount of data that
already exists right and the pieces of

810
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
already exists right and the pieces of
 

811
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,910
already exists right and the pieces of

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
data coming off of
 

813
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,750
data coming off of
you know markets iot shipment of goods

814
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
you know markets iot shipment of goods
 

815
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,509
you know markets iot shipment of goods
any any number of other things like even

816
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
any any number of other things like even
 

817
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,269
any any number of other things like even
even your youtube channel has a certain

amount of views and even that's
 

825
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,030
amount of views and even that's
quantifiable right so even

826
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
quantifiable right so even
 

827
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,550
quantifiable right so even
to a certain degree what we do here

is more and more accessible to everybody
 

863
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,310
is more and more accessible to everybody
and that accessibility and the fact that

864
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
and that accessibility and the fact that
 

865
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,990
and that accessibility and the fact that
there's more of it means we can form

866
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
there's more of it means we can form
 

867
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,590
there's more of it means we can form
more definitive truth

868
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
more definitive truth
 

869
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,310
more definitive truth
proofs we can form more and more proofs

870
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
proofs we can form more and more proofs
 

871
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,150
proofs we can form more and more proofs
and as we form those proofs

872
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
and as we form those proofs
 

873
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,750
and as we form those proofs
well we can provide them to these

874
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
well we can provide them to these
 

875
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,750
well we can provide them to these
blockchains and smart contract systems

876
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
blockchains and smart contract systems
 

877
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,870
blockchains and smart contract systems
that consume them

878
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
that consume them
 

879
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,710
that consume them
and then they're tamper proof right so

880
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
and then they're tamper proof right so
 

881
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,150
and then they're tamper proof right so
they can't be manipulated

882
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
they can't be manipulated
 

883
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,910
they can't be manipulated
and so now we've combined a system that

884
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
and so now we've combined a system that
 

885
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,829
and so now we've combined a system that
can prove things with a system that

886
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
can prove things with a system that
 

887
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,990
can prove things with a system that
guarantees us certain outcomes

888
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
guarantees us certain outcomes
 

889
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,389
guarantees us certain outcomes
and we have a better system of contracts

890
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
and we have a better system of contracts
 

891
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,829
and we have a better system of contracts
which is which is

892
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
which is which is
 

893
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,910
which is which is

tool that has never existed before
 

897
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,629
tool that has never existed before
can we talk about the world of commerce

898
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
can we talk about the world of commerce
 

899
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,189
can we talk about the world of commerce
and finance decentralized finance

900
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
and finance decentralized finance
 

901
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,389
and finance decentralized finance
what is it uh what's its promise

902
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
what is it uh what's its promise
 

903
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,030
what is it uh what's its promise
from both the philosophical and uh

00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
from both the philosophical and uh
 

905

hybrid smart contracts
 

921
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,110
hybrid smart contracts
which are these contracts that combine

which are these contracts that combine
 

923
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,189
which are these contracts that combine
the on-chain code together with the

they're called a hybrid because they
 

931
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,509
they're called a hybrid because they
basically use both of these systems

932
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
basically use both of these systems
 

933
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,790
basically use both of these systems

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
in the financial global financial system
 

949
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,189
in the financial global financial system
right and and that's basically the world

right and and that's basically the world
 

951
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,310

and somebody giving back them yield back
 

961
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,189
and somebody giving back them yield back
to them which is what bonds do and what

00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
to them which is what bonds do and what
 

963
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,389
to them which is what bonds do and what
treasury's doing what a lot of the

964
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
treasury's doing what a lot of the
 

965
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,470
treasury's doing what a lot of the
global financial markets do as well as

966
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
global financial markets do as well as
 

967
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,990
global financial markets do as well as
the ability to gain

968
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
the ability to gain
 

969
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,189
the ability to gain
exposure and protection from different

00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
exposure and protection from different
 

971
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,870
exposure and protection from different
types of events and risks

972
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
types of events and risks
 

973
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,470
types of events and risks
that's a lot of what derivatives do

974
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
that's a lot of what derivatives do
 

975
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,389
that's a lot of what derivatives do
right derivatives allow us to say hey

976
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
right derivatives allow us to say hey
 

977
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,430
right derivatives allow us to say hey
something's going to happen

978
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
something's going to happen
 

979
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,350
something's going to happen
and i'm either going to protect myself

980
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
and i'm either going to protect myself
 

981
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,870
and i'm either going to protect myself
by getting paid if it happens

982
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
by getting paid if it happens
 

983
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,790
by getting paid if it happens
or i'm going to benefit from it

984
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
or i'm going to benefit from it
 

985
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,550
or i'm going to benefit from it
happening by basically saying it's going

986
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
happening by basically saying it's going
 

987
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,990
happening by basically saying it's going
to happen putting money down on that

988
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
to happen putting money down on that
 

989
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,790
to happen putting money down on that
and that prediction will get me a return

990
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
and that prediction will get me a return
 

991
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,269
and that prediction will get me a return
now

992
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
now
 

993
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,749
now
that's a lot a very large part of the

994
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
that's a lot a very large part of the
 

995
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,110
that's a lot a very large part of the
global financial system

996
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
global financial system
 

997
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,949
global financial system
excluding all the stuff for global trade

998
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
excluding all the stuff for global trade
 

999
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,310
excluding all the stuff for global trade
and letters of credit and all the stuff

1000
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
and letters of credit and all the stuff
 

1001
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,350
and letters of credit and all the stuff
that facilitates

1002
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
that facilitates
 

1003
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,870
that facilitates
international trade so excluding

1004
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
international trade so excluding
 

1005
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,790
international trade so excluding
excluding that at least for now

1006
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
excluding that at least for now
 

1007
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,310
excluding that at least for now
so if we look at what decentralized

1008
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
so if we look at what decentralized
 

1009
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,990
so if we look at what decentralized
finance does it takes

1010
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
finance does it takes
 

1011
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,069
finance does it takes
all of those agreements about generating

1012
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
all of those agreements about generating
 

1013
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,350
all of those agreements about generating
yield lending

1014
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
yield lending
 

1015
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,790
yield lending
and all of these types of things you

1016
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
and all of these types of things you
 

1017
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,310
and all of these types of things you
find in global finance and the world of

1018
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
find in global finance and the world of
 

1019
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,110
find in global finance and the world of
derivatives

1020
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
derivatives
 

1021
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,030
derivatives
and a few other types of financial

1022
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
and a few other types of financial
 

1023
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,350
and a few other types of financial
products and it basically puts them

1024
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360
products and it basically puts them
 

1025
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,310
products and it basically puts them
into a different format right so the

1026
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
into a different format right so the
 

1027
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,509
into a different format right so the
format you have

1028
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
format you have
 

1029
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,910
format you have
for centralized financial agreements is

1030
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
for centralized financial agreements is
 

1031
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,189
for centralized financial agreements is

yep

1052
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
yep
 

1053
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,430
yep
and then um a number of very freaky

1054
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
and then um a number of very freaky
 

1055
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,030
and then um a number of very freaky
things start to take place

1056
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
things start to take place
 

1057
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,590
things start to take place
one one of them is people don't have

1058
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
one one of them is people don't have
 

1059
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,550
one one of them is people don't have
clarity

1060
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
clarity
 

1061
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,030
clarity
about what the agreement is right so a

1062
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
about what the agreement is right so a
 

1063
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,389
about what the agreement is right so a
lot of people don't know

1064
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
lot of people don't know
 

1065
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,430
lot of people don't know
exactly what the agreement is between

1066
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
exactly what the agreement is between
 

1067
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,269
exactly what the agreement is between
um between those parties because they

1068
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
um between those parties because they
 

1069
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,710
um between those parties because they
can't actually see it

1070
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
can't actually see it
 

1071
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,310
can't actually see it
sometimes agreements are kept very

1072
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
sometimes agreements are kept very
 

1073
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,749
sometimes agreements are kept very
private or parts of them are kept

1074
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
private or parts of them are kept
 

1075
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,310
private or parts of them are kept
private

1076
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
private
 

1077
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,310
private
and that keeps you know other

1078
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
and that keeps you know other
 

1079
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,509
and that keeps you know other
counterparties other people in the

1080
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
counterparties other people in the
 

1081
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,790
counterparties other people in the
system from understanding what's going

1082
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
system from understanding what's going
 

1083
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,350
system from understanding what's going
on

1084
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
on
 

1085
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,790
on
this is actually partly what happened

1086
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
this is actually partly what happened
 

1087
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,550
this is actually partly what happened
with the mortgage crisis the mortgage

1088
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
with the mortgage crisis the mortgage
 

1089
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,389
with the mortgage crisis the mortgage
crisis in 2008 was basically

1090
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
crisis in 2008 was basically
 

1091
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,430
crisis in 2008 was basically
there were a lot of agreements there

1092
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
there were a lot of agreements there
 

1093
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,829
there were a lot of agreements there
were a lot of assets but because the

1094
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
were a lot of assets but because the
 

1095
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,350
were a lot of assets but because the
centralized financial system worked in

1096
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
centralized financial system worked in
 

1097
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,870
centralized financial system worked in
such an opaque way

1098
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
such an opaque way
 

1099
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,630
such an opaque way
it was so unbelievably difficult to

1100
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
it was so unbelievably difficult to
 

1101
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,549
it was so unbelievably difficult to
understand what was going on

1102
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
understand what was going on
 

1103
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,470
understand what was going on
right and so that lack of understanding

1104
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
right and so that lack of understanding
 

1105
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,750
right and so that lack of understanding
for the global financial system

1106
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
for the global financial system
 

1107
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,270
for the global financial system
basically led to a big boom

1108
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
basically led to a big boom
 

1109
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,230
basically led to a big boom
and then correspondingly very very big

1110
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
and then correspondingly very very big
 

1111
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,710
and then correspondingly very very big
bust

1112
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
bust
 

1113
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,630
bust
which amazingly enough had a huge impact

1114
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
which amazingly enough had a huge impact
 

1115
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,829
which amazingly enough had a huge impact
on everybody even though they didn't

1116
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
on everybody even though they didn't
 

1117
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,590
on everybody even though they didn't
participate in the boom part of the

1118
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
participate in the boom part of the
 

1119
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,789
participate in the boom part of the
of the equation um in in any case

1120
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
of the equation um in in any case
 

1121
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,950
of the equation um in in any case
what decentralized finance does is it

1122
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
what decentralized finance does is it
 

1123
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,390
what decentralized finance does is it
takes these

1124
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,400
takes these
 

1125
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,830
takes these
financial contracts that power the

1126
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
financial contracts that power the
 

1127
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,830
financial contracts that power the
global financial system it puts them in

1128
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
global financial system it puts them in
 

1129
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,190
global financial system it puts them in
this new blockchain based

1130
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
this new blockchain based
 

1131
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,350
this new blockchain based
format that basically at this point

1132
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
format that basically at this point
 

1133
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,750
format that basically at this point
provides three very powerful things

1134
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
provides three very powerful things
 

1135
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,950
provides three very powerful things
the first thing that it provides is

1136
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
the first thing that it provides is
 

1137
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,110
the first thing that it provides is
complete transparency over what's going

1138
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
complete transparency over what's going
 

1139
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,669
complete transparency over what's going
on

1140
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
on
 

1141
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,510
on
with your financial product so this

1142
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
with your financial product so this
 

1143
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,029
with your financial product so this
means when you use a financial product

1144
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
means when you use a financial product
 

1145
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,470
means when you use a financial product
in the d5 format

1146
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
in the d5 format
 

1147
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,150
in the d5 format
you and you as a technical person

1148
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
you and you as a technical person
 

1149
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,590
you and you as a technical person
actually can drill down

1150
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
actually can drill down
 

1151
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,590
actually can drill down
very very very deeply and you can

1152
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
very very very deeply and you can
 

1153
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,870
very very very deeply and you can
understand

1154
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
understand
 

1155
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,150
understand
where the collateral is you can

1156
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
where the collateral is you can
 

1157
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,590
where the collateral is you can
understand how much collateral there is

1158
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,600
understand how much collateral there is
 

1159

such that everyone can understand what

such that everyone can understand what

the financial product does from day one

the financial product does from day one
 

1201
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,470
the financial product does from day one
and in fact escaping that property is

1202
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
and in fact escaping that property is
 

1203
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,070
and in fact escaping that property is
practically impossible or if someone

1204

practically impossible or if someone
 

1205

it becomes immediately obvious and

1208
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
it becomes immediately obvious and
 

1209
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,549
it becomes immediately obvious and
people don't use their financial product

1210

people don't use their financial product
 

1211
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,270
people don't use their financial product
so so that's number one number two is

1212
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
so so that's number one number two is
 

1213
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,470
so so that's number one number two is
control

control
 

1215
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,669
control
so if you look at what happened with

1216
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
so if you look at what happened with
 

1217
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,230
so if you look at what happened with
robin hood everybody thought the system

1218
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
robin hood everybody thought the system
 

1219
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,830
robin hood everybody thought the system
worked a certain way right everybody

1220
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
worked a certain way right everybody
 

1221
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,669
worked a certain way right everybody
thought i have a brokerage account

1222
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
thought i have a brokerage account
 

1223
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,070
thought i have a brokerage account
i can trade things under you know a

1224
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
i can trade things under you know a
 

1225
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,230
i can trade things under you know a
certain set of market conditions

1226
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
certain set of market conditions
 

1227
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,430
certain set of market conditions
and then the market conditions changed

1228
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
and then the market conditions changed
 

1229
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,110
and then the market conditions changed
within the band of what people thought

1230
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
within the band of what people thought
 

1231
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,789
within the band of what people thought
they could do and everybody was

1232
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
they could do and everybody was
 

1233
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,990
they could do and everybody was
fascinated to find out

1234
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
fascinated to find out
 

1235
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,549
fascinated to find out
that oh my god i thought my band of

1236
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
that oh my god i thought my band of
 

1237
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,390
that oh my god i thought my band of
market conditions in which i can control

1238
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
market conditions in which i can control
 

1239
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,830
market conditions in which i can control
my assets is x

1240
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,840
my assets is x
 

1241
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,230
my assets is x
but it's actually y it's actually much

1242
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
but it's actually y it's actually much
 

1243
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,390
but it's actually y it's actually much
much smaller band

1244
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
much smaller band
 

1245
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,150
much smaller band
and the the reason it is a much much

1246
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
and the the reason it is a much much
 

1247
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,390
and the the reason it is a much much
smaller group of market conditions

1248
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
smaller group of market conditions
 

1249
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,950
smaller group of market conditions
is that the system doesn't work the way

1250
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
is that the system doesn't work the way
 

1251
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,070
is that the system doesn't work the way
people think it works

1252
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
people think it works
 

1253
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,510
people think it works
the system was wrapped up in a nice

1254
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
the system was wrapped up in a nice
 

1255
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,350
the system was wrapped up in a nice
glossy wrapper and given to them to get

1256
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
glossy wrapper and given to them to get
 

1257
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,710
glossy wrapper and given to them to get
them to participate in the system

1258
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
them to participate in the system
 

1259
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,310
them to participate in the system
because their system requires and needs

1260
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
because their system requires and needs
 

1261
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,750
because their system requires and needs
their participation

1262
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
their participation
 

1263
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,590
their participation
but if you actually look at how the

1264
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
but if you actually look at how the
 

1265
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,430
but if you actually look at how the
system works underneath

1266
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
system works underneath
 

1267
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,110
system works underneath
you will see that it does not work the

1268
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
you will see that it does not work the
 

1269
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,110
you will see that it does not work the
way people think they that it works

1270
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
way people think they that it works
 

1271
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,470
way people think they that it works
and this is actually another reason that

1272
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
and this is actually another reason that
 

1273
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,710
and this is actually another reason that
defy is so powerful because defy

1274
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
defy is so powerful because defy
 

1275
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,630
defy is so powerful because defy
actually and and these blockchain

1276
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640
actually and and these blockchain
 

1277
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,470
actually and and these blockchain
contracts give people

1278
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
contracts give people
 

1279
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,789
contracts give people
the version of the world they think they

1280
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
the version of the world they think they
 

1281
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,990
the version of the world they think they
already have

1282
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
already have
 

1283
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,390
already have
which is why they don't beg for it right

1284
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
which is why they don't beg for it right
 

1285
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,990
which is why they don't beg for it right
so everybody thinks they're in a certain

1286
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
so everybody thinks they're in a certain
 

1287
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,510
so everybody thinks they're in a certain
version of the world that works in this

1288
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,520
version of the world that works in this
 

1289
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,390
version of the world that works in this
reliable way

1290
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
reliable way
 

1291
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,029
reliable way
transparent way they're not they don't

1292
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
transparent way they're not they don't
 

1293
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,830
transparent way they're not they don't
realize it

1294
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
realize it
 

1295
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,270
realize it
and so they're confused when you tell

1296
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
and so they're confused when you tell
 

1297
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,710
and so they're confused when you tell
them i'm going to make the world work

1298
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
them i'm going to make the world work
 

1299
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,669
them i'm going to make the world work
this way because they think they're

1300
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
this way because they think they're
 

1301
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,950
this way because they think they're
already in that world

1302
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
already in that world
 

1303
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,110
already in that world
but then things like robin hood make it

1304
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
but then things like robin hood make it
 

1305
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,029
but then things like robin hood make it
immediately painfully clear that that's

1306
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039
immediately painfully clear that that's
 

1307
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,390
immediately painfully clear that that's
not how the world works so that the

1308
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,400
not how the world works so that the
 

1309
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,029
not how the world works so that the
second real property of defy is control

1310

second real property of defy is control
 

1311
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,149
second real property of defy is control
which means that you control your assets

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,870
your tokens in the finance protocol
if you don't like how something's going

1322
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
if you don't like how something's going
 

1323
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,110
if you don't like how something's going
in that protocol you can remove it you

1324
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
in that protocol you can remove it you
 

1325
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,710
in that protocol you can remove it you
can send it to another protocol

1326
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720
can send it to another protocol
 

1327
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,390
can send it to another protocol
or you can use a feature of the protocol

1328
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
or you can use a feature of the protocol
 

1329
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,909
or you can use a feature of the protocol
to do something it's supposed to do

1330
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919
to do something it's supposed to do
 

1331
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,590
to do something it's supposed to do
and guess what nobody can just say oops

1332
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
and guess what nobody can just say oops
 

1333
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,669
and guess what nobody can just say oops
you know that feature that isn't so good

1334
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
you know that feature that isn't so good
 

1335
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,950
you know that feature that isn't so good
for my friends over here

1336
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
for my friends over here
 

1337
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,390
for my friends over here
you know that feature is actually you

1338
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
you know that feature is actually you
 

1339
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,350
you know that feature is actually you
know we're just going to pause that

1340
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,360
know we're just going to pause that
 

1341
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,430
know we're just going to pause that
feature in the critical moment

1342
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
feature in the critical moment
 

1343
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,390
feature in the critical moment
when you need it to to to execute your

1344
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
when you need it to to to execute your
 

1345
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,830
when you need it to to to execute your
you know your strategy which is why you

1346
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
you know your strategy which is why you
 

1347
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,149
you know your strategy which is why you
took all the risks to begin with

1348
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
took all the risks to begin with
 

1349
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,390
took all the risks to begin with
and then the final reason um you know

1350
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,400
and then the final reason um you know
 

1351
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,470
and then the final reason um you know
the final thing to know about d5

1352
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
the final thing to know about d5
 

1353
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,270
the final thing to know about d5
is that d5 is inherently global and

1354
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
is that d5 is inherently global and
 

1355
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,390
is that d5 is inherently global and
actually right now

1356
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
actually right now
 

1357
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,190
actually right now
provides better yield globally so if you

1358
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
provides better yield globally so if you
 

1359
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,870
provides better yield globally so if you
go to a bank right now with the us

1360
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
go to a bank right now with the us
 

1361
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,590
go to a bank right now with the us
dollar

1362
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
dollar
 

1363
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,310
dollar
you get one percent or less if you go to

1364
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
you get one percent or less if you go to
 

1365
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,909
you get one percent or less if you go to
d5 with the us dollar

1366

d5 with the us dollar
 

1367
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,270
d5 with the us dollar
you get seven or eight percent so

1368
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
you get seven or eight percent so
 

1369
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,230
you get seven or eight percent so
if if we think about that um in in a

if if we think about that um in in a
 

1371

and we think about well
 

1377
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,310
and we think about well
you know a lot more systems might be

1378
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
you know a lot more systems might be
 

1379
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,350
you know a lot more systems might be
failing soon

um i i think that's what defy is about

1402
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
um i i think that's what defy is about
 

1403
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,710
um i i think that's what defy is about
in a practical sense

1404
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
in a practical sense
 

1405
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,110
in a practical sense
it is this clarity about your risk it is

00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
it is this clarity about your risk it is

over your assets and amazingly at the
 

1411
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,230
over your assets and amazingly at the
same time as having those two

1412
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
same time as having those two
 

1413
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,630
same time as having those two
unbelievably useful properties

1414
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
unbelievably useful properties
 

1415
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,510
unbelievably useful properties
it is actually superior yield which

00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
it is actually superior yield which

it is actually superior yield which

very obvious conclusion that
 

1423
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,909
very obvious conclusion that
the only reason defy isn't more used is

00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:05,919
the only reason defy isn't more used is
 

1425
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,070
the only reason defy isn't more used is
because more people don't know about it

1426
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
because more people don't know about it
 

1427
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,549
because more people don't know about it
and by virtue of this long kind of you

00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
and by virtue of this long kind of you
 

1429

more people will know about it

1434
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
more people will know about it
 

1435
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,710
more people will know about it
and it's just such an obviously superior

um no no don't earn eight percent and

1442
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,280
um no no don't earn eight percent and
 

1443
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,470
um no no don't earn eight percent and
take less risk and have more

1444
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
take less risk and have more
 

1445
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,430

take more risk
 

1451
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,909
take more risk
and um give people the ability to change

1539
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,190
for your own protection i mean there's a
lot of parallels to the central bank

1540

lot of parallels to the central bank
 

1541
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,390
lot of parallels to the central bank
situation

1542
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
situation
 

1543
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,630
situation
and there's not a control element of

1544
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:02,640
and there's not a control element of
 

1545
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,549
and there's not a control element of
being able to walk away like being able

1546
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
being able to walk away like being able
 

1547
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,230
being able to walk away like being able
to delete all your data

1548

to delete all your data
 

1549

delete your account on facebook is very
 

1551
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,269
delete your account on facebook is very
difficult

1552
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:09,279
difficult
 

1553
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,750
difficult
it doesn't take a single click which i

1554
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
it doesn't take a single click which i
 

1555
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,870
it doesn't take a single click which i
think is what it should take there

1556
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
think is what it should take there
 

1557
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,870
think is what it should take there
should be a big red button that says

1558
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
should be a big red button that says
 

1559
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,549
should be a big red button that says
delete everything you've ever known

1560
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
delete everything you've ever known
 

1561
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,190
delete everything you've ever known
about me or like forget me

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
about me or like forget me
 

1563
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,269
about me or like forget me
so i think that couple together can

1564
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
so i think that couple together can
 

1565
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,630
so i think that couple together can
create a very

1566
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:22,640
create a very
 

1567
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,310
create a very
different kind of world and create a an

1568
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,320
different kind of world and create a an
 

1569
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,870
different kind of world and create a an
incentivization

1570
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:26,880
incentivization
 

1571
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,909
incentivization
that will uh lead to like progress and

that will uh lead to like progress and
 

1573
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,750
that will uh lead to like progress and
innovation and just like a much better

1574
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,760

the future social networks but so i tend
 

1581
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,630
the future social networks but so i tend
to see like control

1582
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
to see like control
 

1583
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,909
to see like control
as naturally uh being

1584
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
as naturally uh being
 

1585
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,710
as naturally uh being
a sort of an outgrowth from the

1586
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:46,720
a sort of an outgrowth from the
 

1587
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,549
a sort of an outgrowth from the
transparency it should all start the

1588
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
transparency it should all start the
 

1589
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,390
transparency it should all start the
transparency which is why the smart

1590
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
transparency which is why the smart
 

1591
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,070
transparency which is why the smart
contract formulation

1592
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
contract formulation
 

1593
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,630
contract formulation
is fascinating because like you're

1594
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
is fascinating because like you're
 

1595
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,789
is fascinating because like you're
you're formalizing

1596
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
you're formalizing
 

1597
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,750
you're formalizing
in a simple clear way any agreements

1598
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
in a simple clear way any agreements
 

1599
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,269
in a simple clear way any agreements
that you're participating in

1600
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:01,279
that you're participating in
 

1601
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,070
that you're participating in
and as a side comment also what's really

1602
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
and as a side comment also what's really
 

1603
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,510
and as a side comment also what's really
inspiring to me

1604
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520
inspiring to me
 

1605
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,750
inspiring to me
is that i think there's a greater i

1606
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
is that i think there's a greater i
 

1607
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,590
is that i think there's a greater i
don't know if this is always the case

1608
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
don't know if this is always the case
 

1609
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,430
don't know if this is always the case
but it seems like from having talked to

1610
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
but it seems like from having talked to
 

1611
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,470
but it seems like from having talked to
people on the psychological element

1612
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:14,480
people on the psychological element
 

1613
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,390
people on the psychological element

00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
for control like transparency another
 

1619
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,149
for control like transparency another
word for that is authenticity

1620
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
word for that is authenticity
 

1621
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,669
word for that is authenticity
if you look at the kind of stuff that

1622
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
if you look at the kind of stuff that
 

1623

if you look at the kind of stuff that
people hunger for now

they want to know the reality of who you
are as an individual so that means you

1628
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,400
are as an individual so that means you
 

1629
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,029
are as an individual so that means you
can create businesses you can create

1630
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
can create businesses you can create
 

1631
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,070
can create businesses you can create
tools that are built on authenticity a

1632

transparency

1634
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200
transparency
 

1635
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,870
transparency
and then the same i'm inspired by

1636
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
and then the same i'm inspired by
 

1637
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,269
and then the same i'm inspired by
the intelligence of people if you give

1638
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
the intelligence of people if you give
 

1639
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,990
the intelligence of people if you give
them control if you give them power

1640
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,000
them control if you give them power
 

1641
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,950
them control if you give them power
that they would make good choices that's

1642
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:52,960
that they would make good choices that's
 

1643
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,909
that they would make good choices that's
really exciting

1644
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
really exciting
 

1645
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,750
really exciting
of course not everybody but that means

1646
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:55,760
of course not everybody but that means
 

1647
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,230
of course not everybody but that means
that decentralized power

1648
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
that decentralized power
 

1649
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,590
that decentralized power
can create effective systems

1650
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:01,600
can create effective systems
 

1651
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,029
can create effective systems
so couple that there's a hunger for

1652
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
so couple that there's a hunger for
 

1653
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,190
so couple that there's a hunger for
transparency so we can move to a world

1654
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
transparency so we can move to a world
 

1655
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,149
transparency so we can move to a world
where everyone's being just like real

1656
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
where everyone's being just like real
 

1657
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:08,950
where everyone's being just like real
you know

1658
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960
you know

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,990
people are sufficiently intelligent that
if you're if they're given power

1664
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
if you're if they're given power
 

1665

if you're if they're given power
in a distributed mass scale sense that

in a distributed mass scale sense that
 

1667
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,710
in a distributed mass scale sense that
we're going to build a better world to

i'm i'm so those two coupled together is

comment on the stuff that you just said
which i think is super

1690
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
which i think is super
 

1691
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,029
which i think is super
super super fascinating um i i think

1692
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
super super fascinating um i i think
 

1693
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,630
super super fascinating um i i think
that's all exactly right

1694
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
that's all exactly right
 

1695
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,310
that's all exactly right
i think everything that you said is is

1696

i think everything that you said is is
 

1697
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,510
i think everything that you said is is
right and i think it's actually going to

1698
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
right and i think it's actually going to
 

1699
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,190
right and i think it's actually going to
be the same for social media and banking

1700
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,200
be the same for social media and banking
 

1701
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,950
be the same for social media and banking
and every other type of contract

and every other type of contract
 

1703
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,830
and every other type of contract
is that all of those systems that house

1704
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,840
is that all of those systems that house
 

1705
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,269
is that all of those systems that house
people's value for them

1706

them
 

1715
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,350
them
all of that is going to be made

1716
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
all of that is going to be made
 

1717
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,110
all of that is going to be made
available to people in like this

1718
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,120
available to people in like this
 

1719
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,830
available to people in like this
autonomous piece of code that does the

1720
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:05,840
autonomous piece of code that does the
 

1721
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,669
autonomous piece of code that does the
same thing that the centralized entity

1722
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
same thing that the centralized entity
 

1723
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,710
same thing that the centralized entity
used to do

1724
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
used to do
 

1725
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,870
used to do
so they get all the features but the

1726
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
so they get all the features but the
 

1727
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,549
so they get all the features but the
autonomous piece of code

1728
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
autonomous piece of code
 

1729
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,269
autonomous piece of code
gives them the ability to have control

1730
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
gives them the ability to have control
 

1731
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,950
gives them the ability to have control
while getting all the features

1732
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:16,960
while getting all the features
 

1733
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,830
while getting all the features
right so so banks give you features

1734
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
right so so banks give you features
 

1735
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,149
right so so banks give you features
social media sites give you features

1736
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:22,159
social media sites give you features
 

1737
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,830
social media sites give you features
you know whatever other system that you

1738
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:23,840
you know whatever other system that you
 

1739
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,430
you know whatever other system that you
use online gives you features

1740
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
use online gives you features
 

1741
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,669
use online gives you features
and then it takes your data and it takes

1742
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
and then it takes your data and it takes
 

1743
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,590
and then it takes your data and it takes
control of your assets from you

1744
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
control of your assets from you
 

1745
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,230
control of your assets from you
in return for those features right i

1746
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
in return for those features right i
 

1747
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,389
in return for those features right i
think the whole big difference here

1748
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
think the whole big difference here
 

1749
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,590
think the whole big difference here
partly in line with you know the

1750
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
partly in line with you know the
 

1751
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,269
partly in line with you know the
definition of smart contracts and its

1752
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:37,279
definition of smart contracts and its
 

1753
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,149
definition of smart contracts and its
evolution

1754
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
evolution
 

1755
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,149
evolution
is that there's this uh now this this

1756
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
is that there's this uh now this this
 

1757
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,830
is that there's this uh now this this
autonomous piece of code

1758
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
autonomous piece of code
 

1759
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,389
autonomous piece of code
that's giving you all those features

1760
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:44,399
that's giving you all those features
 

1761
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,110
that's giving you all those features
without

1762
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
without
 

1763
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,149
without
requiring the ownership and lock-in

1764
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:48,159
requiring the ownership and lock-in
 

1765
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,909
requiring the ownership and lock-in
and control and unilateral kind of

1766
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:51,919
and control and unilateral kind of
 

1767
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,350
and control and unilateral kind of
ownership of your data or your value

1768
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,360
ownership of your data or your value
 

1769
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,110
ownership of your data or your value
or or whatever it is that that you're

1770
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
or or whatever it is that that you're
 

1771
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,710
or or whatever it is that that you're
giving it right

1772
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:58,720
giving it right
 

1773
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,830
giving it right
and i think what this will lead to

1774
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:00,840
and i think what this will lead to
 

1775
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,990
and i think what this will lead to
fundamentally

1776
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
fundamentally
 

1777
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,710
fundamentally
is just more of a free market dynamic

1778
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
is just more of a free market dynamic
 

1779
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,510
is just more of a free market dynamic
among how

1780
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:05,520
among how
 

1781
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,149
among how
people make i i think with the social

1782
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
people make i i think with the social
 

1783
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,830
people make i i think with the social
media folks you should you should just

1784
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
media folks you should you should just
 

1785
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,830
media folks you should you should just
make some kind of law or something where

1786
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:11,840
make some kind of law or something where
 

1787
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,669
make some kind of law or something where
you can just export all your data from

1788
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
you can just export all your data from
 

1789
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,149
you can just export all your data from
them

1790
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
them
 

1791
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,990
them
everyone should be able to get their

1792
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
everyone should be able to get their
 

1793
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,549
everyone should be able to get their
data exported by another application

1794
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
data exported by another application
 

1795
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,549
data exported by another application
and then the network effect of all these

1796
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:20,559
and then the network effect of all these
 

1797
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,230
and then the network effect of all these
social media sites will kind of crumble

1798
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
social media sites will kind of crumble
 

1799
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,350
social media sites will kind of crumble
because people will just

1800
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
because people will just
 

1801
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,029
because people will just
combine your twitter data with your

1802
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,039
combine your twitter data with your
 

1803
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,870
combine your twitter data with your
facebook data with everything else

1804
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880
facebook data with everything else
 

1805
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,029
facebook data with everything else
into an application that you control and

1806
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
into an application that you control and
 

1807
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,230
into an application that you control and
there will just be

1808
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
there will just be
 

1809
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,750
there will just be
thousands of different interfaces

1810
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
thousands of different interfaces
 

1811
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,269
thousands of different interfaces
competing for how to consume all the

1812
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
competing for how to consume all the
 

1813
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,630
competing for how to consume all the
social media data

1814
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:34,640
social media data
 

1815
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,230
social media data
because it isn't locked in in one

1816
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,240
because it isn't locked in in one
 

1817
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,310
because it isn't locked in in one
centralized actors control

1818
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
centralized actors control
 

1819
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,909
centralized actors control
and so this is this is just the

1820
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:39,919
and so this is this is just the
 

1821
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,510
and so this is this is just the
recurring pattern of what i think all of

1822
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520
recurring pattern of what i think all of
 

1823
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,470
recurring pattern of what i think all of
this will do

1824
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,480
this will do
 

1825
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,710
this will do
is it'll give peach it gives it gives

1826
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:44,720
is it'll give peach it gives it gives
 

1827
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,470
is it'll give peach it gives it gives
people a better deal right it gives them

1828
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:46,480
people a better deal right it gives them
 

1829
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,430
people a better deal right it gives them
features

1830
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
features
 

1831
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,269
features
without ownership of data without

1832
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
without ownership of data without
 

1833
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,710
without ownership of data without
ownership of value

1834
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
ownership of value
 

1835
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,510
ownership of value
and and and that's really the difference

1836
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,520
and and and that's really the difference
 

1837
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,110
and and and that's really the difference
so i think this is a good place to talk

1838
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
so i think this is a good place to talk
 

1839
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,870
so i think this is a good place to talk
about smart contracts then can you tell

1840
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
about smart contracts then can you tell
 

1841
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,870
about smart contracts then can you tell
me the history of smart contracts

1842
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:58,880
me the history of smart contracts
 

1843
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,430
me the history of smart contracts
and the basic sort of definitions of

1844
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:01,440
and the basic sort of definitions of
 

1845
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,630
and the basic sort of definitions of
what is it

1846
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
what is it
 

1847
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,190
what is it
sure so i think smart contracts as a

1848
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,200
sure so i think smart contracts as a
 

1849
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,710
sure so i think smart contracts as a
definition has actually gone through

1850
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
definition has actually gone through
 

1851
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,549
definition has actually gone through
some through some kind of changes or

1852
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
some through some kind of changes or
 

1853
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,909
some through some kind of changes or
small evolution

1854
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919
small evolution
 

1855
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,430
small evolution
initially i think it was actually a

1856
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
initially i think it was actually a
 

1857
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,430
initially i think it was actually a
conception of a digital agreement

1858
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
conception of a digital agreement
 

1859
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,750
conception of a digital agreement
that was tamper-proof and could know

1860
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760
that was tamper-proof and could know
 

1861
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,430
that was tamper-proof and could know
things about the world right so it could

1862
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:17,440
things about the world right so it could
 

1863
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,149
things about the world right so it could
get proof

1864
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
get proof
 

1865
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,590
get proof
and it could define that something

1866
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
and it could define that something
 

1867
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,510
and it could define that something
happened and it could conclude

1868
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
happened and it could conclude
 

1869
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,590
happened and it could conclude
an outcome and release payment or do

1870
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,600
an outcome and release payment or do
 

1871
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,710
an outcome and release payment or do
something else that's actually the

1872
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,720
something else that's actually the
 

1873
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,230
something else that's actually the
definition of smart contracts

1874
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:26,240
definition of smart contracts
 

1875
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,909
definition of smart contracts
that i began working in this industry

1876
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
that i began working in this industry
 

1877
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,830
that i began working in this industry
with seven or eight years ago when i

1878
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
with seven or eight years ago when i
 

1879
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,430
with seven or eight years ago when i
started making smart contracts

1880
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
started making smart contracts
 

1881
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,350
started making smart contracts
that is the conception that i had of a

1882
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
that is the conception that i had of a
 

1883
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,950
that is the conception that i had of a
smart contract

1884
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
smart contract
 

1885
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,830
smart contract
then what happened was that was really

1886
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
then what happened was that was really
 

1887
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,870
then what happened was that was really
hard to do right

1888
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:38,880
hard to do right
 

1889
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,389
hard to do right
building that type of tamper-proof

1890
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
building that type of tamper-proof
 

1891
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,230
building that type of tamper-proof
digital agreement that could also know

1892
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
digital agreement that could also know
 

1893
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,590
digital agreement that could also know
things about the real world

1894
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
things about the real world
 

1895
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,149
things about the real world
and release payments back to people

1896
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
and release payments back to people
 

1897
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,070
and release payments back to people
about those events that were codified in

1898
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
about those events that were codified in
 

1899
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,510
about those events that were codified in
this tamper-proof format

1900
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:49,520
this tamper-proof format
 

1901
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,750
this tamper-proof format
was actually a very tall order turns out

1902
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
was actually a very tall order turns out
 

1903
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,110
was actually a very tall order turns out
it's consistent of three parts it's

1904
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
it's consistent of three parts it's
 

1905
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,470
it's consistent of three parts it's
consisting of the contract

1906
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,480
consisting of the contract
 

1907
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,310
consisting of the contract
the proof about what happened and you

1908
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
the proof about what happened and you
 

1909
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,310
the proof about what happened and you
know the release of value

1910
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
know the release of value
 

1911
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,630
know the release of value
the way things have evolved so far is

1912
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
the way things have evolved so far is
 

1913
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,070
the way things have evolved so far is
that

1914
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
that
 

1915
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,990
that
the definition has now come to mean

1916
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
the definition has now come to mean
 

1917
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,190
the definition has now come to mean
on-chain code

1918
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
on-chain code
 

1919
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,190
on-chain code
right so it's come to mean the

1920
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,200
right so it's come to mean the
 

1921
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,389
right so it's come to mean the
codification

1922
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
codification
 

1923
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,350
codification
of contractual agreement on a blockchain

1924
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
of contractual agreement on a blockchain
 

1925
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,870
of contractual agreement on a blockchain
right so there's some code of somewhere

1926
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
right so there's some code of somewhere
 

1927
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,990
right so there's some code of somewhere
on some blockchain

1928
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
on some blockchain
 

1929
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,510
on some blockchain
that defines what the agreement is

1930
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,520
that defines what the agreement is
 

1931
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,070
that defines what the agreement is
now that eliminates the part of the

1932
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,080
now that eliminates the part of the
 

1933
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,669
now that eliminates the part of the
definition that's related to knowing

1934
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
definition that's related to knowing
 

1935
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,029
definition that's related to knowing
things about the world

1936
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
things about the world
 

1937
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,190
things about the world
and it partly eliminates the definition

1938
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
and it partly eliminates the definition
 

1939
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,789
and it partly eliminates the definition
about payments and and stuff like that

1940
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
about payments and and stuff like that
 

1941
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,269
about payments and and stuff like that
but basically it's it's on chain code

1942
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
but basically it's it's on chain code
 

1943
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,870
but basically it's it's on chain code
right we in in our recent work on

1944
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:32,880
right we in in our recent work on
 

1945
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,870
right we in in our recent work on
on the second white paper have actually

1946
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
on the second white paper have actually
 

1947
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,990
on the second white paper have actually
put out a different definition

1948
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
put out a different definition
 

1949
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,549
put out a different definition
that we call hybrid smart contracts that

1950
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
that we call hybrid smart contracts that
 

1951
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,470
that we call hybrid smart contracts that
actually tries to go back to the initial

1952
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:40,480
actually tries to go back to the initial
 

1953
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,269
actually tries to go back to the initial
definition

1954
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
definition
 

1955
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,789
definition
that i started with seven or eight years

1956
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:42,799
that i started with seven or eight years
 

1957
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,630
that i started with seven or eight years
ago which basically says

1958
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
ago which basically says
 

1959
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,269
ago which basically says
that there's some proof somewhere that's

1960
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279
that there's some proof somewhere that's
 

1961
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,950
that there's some proof somewhere that's
proven to the contract and the contract

1962
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
proven to the contract and the contract
 

1963
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,750
proven to the contract and the contract
can know that

1964
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
can know that
 

1965
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,990
can know that
and the contract can gain proof then it

1966
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,000
and the contract can gain proof then it
 

1967
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,830
and the contract can gain proof then it
can use that proof to settle

1968
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
can use that proof to settle
 

1969
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,470
can use that proof to settle
um the agreement that's codified on a

1970
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
um the agreement that's codified on a
 

1971
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,430
um the agreement that's codified on a
blockchain

1972
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440
blockchain
 

1973
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,669
blockchain
so you you both need a mechanism to

1974
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
so you you both need a mechanism to
 

1975
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,430
so you you both need a mechanism to
provide proof you need a mechanism

1976
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
provide proof you need a mechanism
 

1977
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,509
provide proof you need a mechanism
to codify the contract in a tamper proof

1978
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519
to codify the contract in a tamper proof
 

1979
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,350
to codify the contract in a tamper proof
way on something like a blockchain

1980
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,360
way on something like a blockchain
 

1981
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,029
way on something like a blockchain
and then as with all contracts there's a

1982
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:07,039
and then as with all contracts there's a
 

1983
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,070
and then as with all contracts there's a
presumption that there's some kind of

1984
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,080
presumption that there's some kind of
 

1985
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,430
presumption that there's some kind of
release of value

1986
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
release of value
 

1987
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,830
release of value
so i think a smart contract in our

1988
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
so i think a smart contract in our
 

1989
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,190
so i think a smart contract in our
industry right now

1990
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
industry right now
 

1991
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,070
industry right now
means on chain code which limits it to

only and then in in our internal
 

1997
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,149

and for us at chain link and for me um

2000
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
and for us at chain link and for me um
 

2001
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,549
and for us at chain link and for me um
it's hybrid smart contracts

2002
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
it's hybrid smart contracts
 

2003
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,830
it's hybrid smart contracts
which is actually the original

2004
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:27,840
which is actually the original
 

2005
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,830
which is actually the original
definition it's the it's the idea that a

2006
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
definition it's the it's the idea that a
 

2007
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,630
definition it's the it's the idea that a
contract

2008
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
contract
 

2009
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,950
contract
can both know what happened and

2010
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:32,960
can both know what happened and
 

2011
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,149
can both know what happened and
automatically

2012
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
automatically
 

2013
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,950
automatically
resolve to to the proper outcome based

2014
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
resolve to to the proper outcome based
 

2015
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,909
resolve to to the proper outcome based
on what happened

2016
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
on what happened
 

2017
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,590
on what happened
so you're referring to the chain link

2018
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:39,600
so you're referring to the chain link
 

2019
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,909
so you're referring to the chain link
2.0 white paper which is

2020
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
2.0 white paper which is
 

2021
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,430
2.0 white paper which is
uh paper that i recommend people look

2022
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
uh paper that i recommend people look
 

2023
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,509
uh paper that i recommend people look
it's a very easy read and very well

2024
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
it's a very easy read and very well
 

2025
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,590
it's a very easy read and very well
structured and very thorough so i really

2026
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
structured and very thorough so i really
 

2027
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,389
structured and very thorough so i really
enjoyed it

2028
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399
enjoyed it
 

2029
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,110
enjoyed it
very recently released i guess can you

2030
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,120
very recently released i guess can you
 

2031
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,509
very recently released i guess can you
dig in deeper what is a hybrid

2032
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:55,519
dig in deeper what is a hybrid
 

2033
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,230
dig in deeper what is a hybrid
smart contract you mentioned sort of

2034
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,240
smart contract you mentioned sort of
 

2035
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,630
smart contract you mentioned sort of
this idea of data

2036
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:00,640
this idea of data
 

2037
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,389
this idea of data
or knowing about the world and on chain

2038
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399
or knowing about the world and on chain
 

2039
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,870
or knowing about the world and on chain
and off chain so what are the different

2040
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
and off chain so what are the different
 

2041
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,630
and off chain so what are the different
roles in this so hybrid by the way

2042
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:08,640
roles in this so hybrid by the way
 

2043
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,070
roles in this so hybrid by the way
refers to

2044
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
refers to
 

2045
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,070
refers to
the fact that it's on chain and off

2046
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,080
the fact that it's on chain and off
 

2047
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,710
the fact that it's on chain and off
chain contracts

2048
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
chain contracts
 

2049
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,070
chain contracts
so maybe digging deeper of what the heck

2050
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,080
so maybe digging deeper of what the heck
 

2051
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,470
so maybe digging deeper of what the heck
is it

2052
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
is it
 

2053
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,830
is it
and what does it mean to know stuff

2054
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:19,840
and what does it mean to know stuff
 

2055
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,590
and what does it mean to know stuff
about the world from

2056
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:21,600
about the world from
 

2057
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,590
about the world from
like how do you actually achieve that

2058
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
like how do you actually achieve that
 

2059
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,990
like how do you actually achieve that
yeah absolutely

2060
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
yeah absolutely
 

2061
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,950
yeah absolutely
so the on-chain part is where the

2062
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
so the on-chain part is where the
 

2063
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,470
so the on-chain part is where the
agreement itself is

2064
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:30,480
agreement itself is
 

2065
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,029
agreement itself is
that's the smart contract itself and

2066
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:33,039
that's the smart contract itself and
 

2067
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,149
that's the smart contract itself and
that's where you codify

2068
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:34,159
that's where you codify
 

2069
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,110
that's where you codify
certain conditions such as the

2070
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,120
certain conditions such as the
 

2071
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,470
certain conditions such as the
conditions under which an interest

2072
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480
conditions under which an interest
 

2073
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,070
conditions under which an interest
payment is made or the conditions under

2074
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,080
payment is made or the conditions under
 

2075
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,990
payment is made or the conditions under
which the the contract pays out the full

2076
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,000
which the the contract pays out the full
 

2077
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,269
which the the contract pays out the full
amount that it holds

2078
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
amount that it holds
 

2079
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,350
amount that it holds
to someone based on a derivative outcome

2080
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,360
to someone based on a derivative outcome
 

2081
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,029
to someone based on a derivative outcome
or something like that

2082
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,039
or something like that
 

2083
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,789
or something like that
now what the on chain code is very good

2084
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:48,799
now what the on chain code is very good
 

2085
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,190
now what the on chain code is very good
at is creating transparency about what

2086
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,200
at is creating transparency about what
 

2087
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,830
at is creating transparency about what
the core conditions of the contract are

2088
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:53,840
the core conditions of the contract are
 

2089
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,070
the core conditions of the contract are
it's very good at taking in money from

2090
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,080
it's very good at taking in money from
 

2091
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,070
it's very good at taking in money from
other private keys that send it

2092
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
other private keys that send it
 

2093
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,789
other private keys that send it
tokens and send it value to hold and

2094
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
tokens and send it value to hold and
 

2095
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,070
tokens and send it value to hold and
then it's also very good

2096
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
then it's also very good
 

2097
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,710
then it's also very good
at returning money or returning value

2098
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
at returning money or returning value
 

2099

00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:23,679
takes in value and returns value uh
 

2121
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,350
takes in value and returns value uh
based upon the conditions codified in

00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,360
based upon the conditions codified in
 

2123
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,430
based upon the conditions codified in
the agreement on a blockchain

2296
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:18,400
level of automation
 

2297
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,950
level of automation
right we can suddenly say there's this

2298
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
right we can suddenly say there's this
 

2299
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,550
right we can suddenly say there's this
piece of unchained code that's highly

2303
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,430

we can give it millions billions

2304
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:25,440
we can give it millions billions
 

2305
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,750
we can give it millions billions
eventually trillions of dollars in value

2306
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760
eventually trillions of dollars in value
 

2307
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,589
eventually trillions of dollars in value
and it is controlled by this other

2309
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,670

2339
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,950

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,510
than just a contract on chain right can
you talk about this consensus mechanism

2344
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,520
you talk about this consensus mechanism
 

2345
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,630
you talk about this consensus mechanism
which by the way is just

2346
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:06,640
which by the way is just
 

2347
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,670
which by the way is just
fascinating so there is the on-chain

2348
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:09,680
fascinating so there is the on-chain
 

2349
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,790
fascinating so there is the on-chain
consensus mechanism of proof of work and

2350
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
consensus mechanism of proof of work and

and then there is this oracle network

2354
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
and then there is this oracle network

what is true so how do you
 

2359
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,430
what is true so how do you
can you compare the two like how do you

2360
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,440
can you compare the two like how do you
 

2361
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,950
can you compare the two like how do you
achieve that kind of consensus how do

2362
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:28,960
achieve that kind of consensus how do
 

2363
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,870
achieve that kind of consensus how do
you achieve security

2364
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:30,880
you achieve security
 

2365
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,430
you achieve security
in integrating data about the world

2366
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,440

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,430
in a way that is usefully true such that
we can rely on it in making

00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:45,599
major agreements that as you said
 

2375
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,030
major agreements that as you said
involve billions of trillions of dollars

2376
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,040
involve billions of trillions of dollars
 

2377
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,630
involve billions of trillions of dollars
right so this is the challenging this is

2378
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
right so this is the challenging this is

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,390
the challenging
um problem that oracle networks

00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,400
um problem that oracle networks
 

2385
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,790

2393
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,510

and create hyper automation in this more

2394
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
and create hyper automation in this more
 

2395
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,470
and create hyper automation in this more

2396
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480

contracts the the reality i think

2400
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:11,359
contracts the the reality i think
 

2401
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,750
contracts the the reality i think
of this problem is that it is very

2402
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
of this problem is that it is very
 

2403
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,630
of this problem is that it is very
specific to

2404
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
specific to
 

2405
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,990
specific to
each use case and it and this

2406
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
each use case and it and this
 

2407
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,310
each use case and it and this
is actually how we've architected our

2408
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:20,320
is actually how we've architected our
 

2409
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,630
is actually how we've architected our
system is in a very flexible way

2410
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:22,640
system is in a very flexible way
 

2411
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,910
system is in a very flexible way
so so for example um you need an ability

2412
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:25,920
so so for example um you need an ability
 

2413
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,990
so so for example um you need an ability
for an oracle network to grow in the

2414
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
for an oracle network to grow in the
 

2415
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,230
for an oracle network to grow in the
amount of nodes that it has

2416
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:30,240
amount of nodes that it has
 

2417
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,030
amount of nodes that it has
relative to the value it secures right

2418
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,040
relative to the value it secures right
 

2419
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,790
relative to the value it secures right
so if you have an oracle network

2420
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:34,800
so if you have an oracle network
 

2421
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,109
so if you have an oracle network
that secures a hundred thousand dollars

2422
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
that secures a hundred thousand dollars
 

2423
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,990
that secures a hundred thousand dollars
in like a beta of a financial product

2424
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
in like a beta of a financial product
 

2425
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,910
in like a beta of a financial product
maybe it can be fined with owens only

2426
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:41,920
maybe it can be fined with owens only
 

2427
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,510
maybe it can be fined with owens only
seven nodes and only two or three data

2428
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:43,520
seven nodes and only two or three data
 

2429
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,069
seven nodes and only two or three data
sources

2430
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:44,079
sources
 

2431
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,390
sources
right because the risk to that to that

2432
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,400
right because the risk to that to that
 

2433
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,910
right because the risk to that to that
oracle network is relatively low based

2434
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:47,920
oracle network is relatively low based
 

2435
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,870
oracle network is relatively low based
on the value it secures

2436
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:50,880
on the value it secures
 

2437
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,069
on the value it secures
so the first question is actually how

2438
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:54,079
so the first question is actually how
 

2439
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,910
so the first question is actually how
do you scale security relative to value

2440
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:57,920
do you scale security relative to value
 

2441
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,589
do you scale security relative to value
secured by that oracle network because

2442
00:38:59,589 --> 00:38:59,599
secured by that oracle network because
 

2443
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,349
secured by that oracle network because
it wouldn't be very efficient to have

2444
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:01,359
it wouldn't be very efficient to have
 

2445
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,510
it wouldn't be very efficient to have
a thousand nodes securing a hundred

2446
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
a thousand nodes securing a hundred
 

2447
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,630
a thousand nodes securing a hundred
thousand dollars

2448
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
thousand dollars
 

2449
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,190
thousand dollars
worth worth of value so one of the first

2450
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,200
worth worth of value so one of the first
 

2451
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,990
worth worth of value so one of the first
questions is

2452
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,000
questions is
 

2453
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,670
questions is
how do we properly scale and how do we

2454
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:09,680
how do we properly scale and how do we
 

2455
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,550
how do we properly scale and how do we
compose ensembles of nodes

2456
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:12,560
compose ensembles of nodes
 

2457
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,950
compose ensembles of nodes
in a decentralized way where we can know

2458
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:14,960

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,870
so that the problem in in giving you
this straight answer is that there's

00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:20,880
this straight answer is that there's
 

2715
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,349
this straight answer is that there's
just such a wide array of services

2716
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:23,359
just such a wide array of services
 

2717
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,109
just such a wide array of services
right right if you were to say well

2718
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
right right if you were to say well
 

2719
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,870
right right if you were to say well
sergey how how do we

2720
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
sergey how how do we
 

2721
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,710
sergey how how do we
generate randomness from a data source

2722
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
generate randomness from a data source
 

2723
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,990
generate randomness from a data source
well we don't use a data source to

2724
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,000
well we don't use a data source to
 

2725
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,190
well we don't use a data source to
generate the randomness

2726
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,200
generate the randomness
 

2727
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,550
generate the randomness
that's the type of service that can be

2728
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,560
that's the type of service that can be
 

2729
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,109
that's the type of service that can be
generated in an oracle network itself

2730
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:35,119
generated in an oracle network itself
 

2731
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,230
generated in an oracle network itself
and so there will be certain

2732
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,240
and so there will be certain
 

2733
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,990
and so there will be certain
computations that oracle networks

2734
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,000
computations that oracle networks
 

2735
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,630
computations that oracle networks
themselves

2736
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:38,640
themselves
 

2737
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,190
themselves
generate themselves to augment and

2738
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:41,200
generate themselves to augment and
 

2739
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,870
generate themselves to augment and
improve blockchains

2740
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:42,880
improve blockchains
 

2741
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,550
improve blockchains
and it is actually the goal of oracle's

2742
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:44,560
and it is actually the goal of oracle's
 

2743
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,069
and it is actually the goal of oracle's
to consistently do that so if you were

2744
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
to consistently do that so if you were
 

2745
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,510
to consistently do that so if you were
to think about

2746
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
to think about
 

2747
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,069
to think about
the stack in a very generic high level

you would see

2750
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:50,800
you would see
 

2751
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,390
you would see
blockchains or databases they're

00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,400
blockchains or databases they're
 

2753
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,829
blockchains or databases they're
basically the data structures that

2754
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:53,839
basically the data structures that
 

2755
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,790
basically the data structures that
retain

2756
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:54,800

are there interesting near-term and
 

2913
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,910
are there interesting near-term and

long-term applications that excite you
 

2915
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,430

yeah there's there's a lot that excites

2916
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:27,440
yeah there's there's a lot that excites
 

2917
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,950
yeah there's there's a lot that excites
me and that is how i think about it that

2918
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:28,960
me and that is how i think about it that
 

2919
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,150
me and that is how i think about it that
it's not just about we made a

00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,160
it's not just about we made a
 

2921
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,750
it's not just about we made a
decentralized oracle network

2922
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:31,760
decentralized oracle network
 

2923
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,430
decentralized oracle network
it's about we made a decentralized

2924
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:33,440
it's about we made a decentralized
 

2925
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,510
it's about we made a decentralized
service or collection of services that's

2926
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
service or collection of services that's
 

2927
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,510
service or collection of services that's
going from hundreds to thousands

2928
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
going from hundreds to thousands
 

2929
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,030
going from hundreds to thousands
and then people are able to build the

2930
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
and then people are able to build the
 

2931
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,030
and then people are able to build the
hybrid smart contracts which i think

2932
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
hybrid smart contracts which i think
 

2933
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,109
hybrid smart contracts which i think
will redefine what our industry is about

2934
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:43,119
will redefine what our industry is about
 

2935
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,550
will redefine what our industry is about
because for example for the people that

2936
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:44,560
because for example for the people that
 

2937
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,069
because for example for the people that

00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,230
that that will continue i i think the
use cases that excite me

00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:58,240
use cases that excite me

what you will see is that transparency

2964
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:09,119
what you will see is that transparency
 

2965
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,150
what you will see is that transparency
creating

2966
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:10,160
creating
 

2967
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,950
creating
a level a new level of information for

00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960
a level a new level of information for
 

2969
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,430
a level a new level of information for
how

2970
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,440
how
 

2971
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,750
how
markets work and the risk that is in

2972
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:15,760
markets work and the risk that is in
 

2973
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,190
markets work and the risk that is in
markets and

2974
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,200
markets and
 

2975
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,910
markets and
kind of the dynamics that put the global

00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
kind of the dynamics that put the global

2978
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
financial system
 

2979
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,670
financial system
at systemic financial risk like 2008 and

2980
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
at systemic financial risk like 2008 and
 

2981
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,190
at systemic financial risk like 2008 and
my hope is that all of this

2982
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,200
my hope is that all of this
 

2983
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,150
my hope is that all of this
infrastructure will

infrastructure will
 

2985
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,829
infrastructure will
will soften the boom and bust cycles

2986
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:29,839
will soften the boom and bust cycles
 

2987
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,670
will soften the boom and bust cycles
by making information immediately

2988
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:31,680
by making information immediately
 

2989
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,829
by making information immediately
available to all market participants

available to all market participants
 

2991
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,349
available to all market participants
which is by the way what all market

2992
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:35,359
which is by the way what all market
 

2993
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,589
which is by the way what all market
participants want except for the very

because of their asymmetric access to

because of their asymmetric access to

information which really everybody
 

3007
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,549

should have and which this technically

should have and which this technically
 

3009
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:49,670
should have and which this technically
solves

solves
 

3011
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,750

i think in the process of doing that and

3012
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:51,760
i think in the process of doing that and
 

3013
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,349
i think in the process of doing that and
which is happening i think right about

3014
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:53,359
which is happening i think right about
 

3015
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,230
which is happening i think right about
now

3016
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,240
now
 

3017
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,549
now
you see a polishing of the technology

3018
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:56,559
you see a polishing of the technology
 

3019
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,150
you see a polishing of the technology
such that it can be made available to

3020
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,160
such that it can be made available to
 

3021
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,510
such that it can be made available to
emerging markets

3022
00:47:59,510 --> 00:47:59,520
emerging markets
 

3023
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,549
emerging markets
and on a personal level i feel that um

3024
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:02,559
and on a personal level i feel that um
 

3025
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,470
and on a personal level i feel that um
the emerging markets will benefit much

3026
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,480
the emerging markets will benefit much
 

3027
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,990
the emerging markets will benefit much
more from this technology

3028
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
more from this technology
 

3029
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,829
more from this technology
just like the emerging markets benefit

3030
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:07,839
just like the emerging markets benefit
 

3031
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,430
just like the emerging markets benefit
much more from the internet

3032
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:09,440
much more from the internet
 

3033
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,309
much more from the internet
or from those you know 50 android phones

3034
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:12,319
or from those you know 50 android phones
 

3035
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,670
or from those you know 50 android phones
that people can have

3036
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:13,680
that people can have
 

3037
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,829
that people can have
because it's it's such a massive shift

3038
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:15,839
because it's it's such a massive shift
 

3039
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,829
because it's it's such a massive shift
in how people's lives work right

3040
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839
in how people's lives work right
 

3041
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,750
in how people's lives work right
i have always had access to books and a

3042
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:19,760
i have always had access to books and a
 

3043
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,750
i have always had access to books and a
library which has been fantastic and

3044
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:21,760
library which has been fantastic and
 

3045
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,109
library which has been fantastic and
very important

3046
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:23,119
very important
 

3047
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,549
very important
but there are places in the world where

3048
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:24,559
but there are places in the world where
 

3049
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,309
but there are places in the world where
people don't have libraries

3050
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:26,319
people don't have libraries
 

3051
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,309
people don't have libraries
but they now they have the internet and

3052
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:28,319
but they now they have the internet and
 

3053
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,829
but they now they have the internet and
a 50 android phone

3054
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:29,839
a 50 android phone
 

3055
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,430
a 50 android phone
and they can watch the same stanford

3056
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:31,440
and they can watch the same stanford
 

3057
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,589
and they can watch the same stanford
lecture that i watch i mean that's kind

3058
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:33,599
lecture that i watch i mean that's kind
 

3059
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,790
lecture that i watch i mean that's kind
of mind-blowing

3060
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:34,800
of mind-blowing
 

3061
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,030
of mind-blowing
realistically right they they just went

3062
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,040
realistically right they they just went
 

3063
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,190
realistically right they they just went
from zero to one in a very very dramatic

3064
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:39,200
from zero to one in a very very dramatic
 

3065
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,230
from zero to one in a very very dramatic
way

3066
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:40,240
way
 

3067
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,349
way
i think all of these smart contracts

3068
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
i think all of these smart contracts
 

3069
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,589
i think all of these smart contracts
and in in my case i think the one that i

3070
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:45,599
and in in my case i think the one that i
 

3071
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,109
and in in my case i think the one that i
seem to keep coming back to is crop

3072
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:47,119
seem to keep coming back to is crop
 

3073
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,309
seem to keep coming back to is crop
insurance

3074
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:48,319
insurance
 

3075
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,829
insurance
where partly because it doesn't have a

3076
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:49,839
where partly because it doesn't have a
 

3077
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,349
where partly because it doesn't have a
tokenization component partly because

3078
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:51,359
tokenization component partly because
 

3079
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,109
tokenization component partly because
it's actually much more important than

3080
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
it's actually much more important than
 

3081
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,470
it's actually much more important than
than it might seem um what is crop

3082
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:56,480
than it might seem um what is crop
 

3083
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,829
than it might seem um what is crop
insurance

3084
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
insurance
 

3085
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,670
insurance
right so exactly so so this this this is

3086
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
right so exactly so so this this this is
 

3087
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,030
right so exactly so so this this this is
the nature of why it's sometimes

3088
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,040
the nature of why it's sometimes
 

3089
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,630
the nature of why it's sometimes
hard to see the full value of what our

3090
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,640
hard to see the full value of what our
 

3091
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,990
hard to see the full value of what our
industry does because it solves all

3092
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:06,000
industry does because it solves all
 

3093
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,670
industry does because it solves all
these kinds of back-end problems that we

3094
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:07,680
these kinds of back-end problems that we
 

3095
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,870
these kinds of back-end problems that we
don't have right so

3096
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:08,880
don't have right so
 

3097
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,829
don't have right so
crop insurance is if i own a farm and it

3098
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:11,839
crop insurance is if i own a farm and it
 

3099
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,150
crop insurance is if i own a farm and it
doesn't rain i get an insurance payout

3100
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,160
doesn't rain i get an insurance payout
 

3101
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,309
doesn't rain i get an insurance payout
so i don't need to close down my farm

3102
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:16,319
so i don't need to close down my farm
 

3103
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,430
so i don't need to close down my farm
because if it didn't rain

3104
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:17,440
because if it didn't rain
 

3105
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,309
because if it didn't rain
i don't have crops right so people in

3106
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
i don't have crops right so people in
 

3107
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,270
i don't have crops right so people in
the developed world

3108
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,280
the developed world
 

3109
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,549
the developed world
can get crop insurance and there's

3110
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:24,559
can get crop insurance and there's
 

3111
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,230
can get crop insurance and there's
all kinds of systems that basically pay

3112
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:26,240
all kinds of systems that basically pay
 

3113
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,510
all kinds of systems that basically pay
them out and then they can argue with

3114
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:27,520
them out and then they can argue with
 

3115
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,069
them out and then they can argue with
the legal

3116
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
the legal
 

3117
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,750
the legal
with the insurance company if they don't

3118
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:29,760
with the insurance company if they don't
 

3119
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,829
with the insurance company if they don't
get paid out properly and whatever

3120
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:31,839
get paid out properly and whatever
 

3121
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,030
get paid out properly and whatever
and this allows people to smooth out

3122
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,040
and this allows people to smooth out
 

3123
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,990
and this allows people to smooth out
risk

3124
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:36,000
risk
 

3125
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,829
risk
in fact a lot of the global options

3126
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:37,839
in fact a lot of the global options

00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,030
in fact a lot of the global options
markets

3128

markets
 

3129
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,630
markets
were about this right they were

3130
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:40,640
were about this right they were
 

3131
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,630
were about this right they were
initially about people selling

3132
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:42,640
initially about people selling
 

3133
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,470
initially about people selling
their produce or their crops ahead of

their produce or their crops ahead of
 

3135
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,670
their produce or their crops ahead of

00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:45,680
time so that

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,589
time so that
if there was a risk of drought they

3138
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
if there was a risk of drought they
 

3139
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,349
if there was a risk of drought they
weren't impacted by it

3140
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:49,359
weren't impacted by it
 

3141
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,030
weren't impacted by it
right and that's where a lot of options

3142
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
right and that's where a lot of options
 

3143
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,030
right and that's where a lot of options
trading and all this kind of stuff came

3144
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
trading and all this kind of stuff came
 

3145
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,670
trading and all this kind of stuff came
from

3147
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,950
from
even though it's now turned into this

00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
even though it's now turned into this
 

3149
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,030
even though it's now turned into this
kind of global casino

3150
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:57,040
kind of global casino
 

3151
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,430
kind of global casino
but in the emerging market there are

3152
00:49:59,430 --> 00:49:59,440
but in the emerging market there are
 

3153
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,270
but in the emerging market there are
there are literally people that

there are literally people that

00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,510
there are literally people that
if they don't have rain for two seasons

3157
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,950
if they don't have rain for two seasons
they need to close down their farm and

3158
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:04,960
they need to close down their farm and
 

3159
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,270
they need to close down their farm and
become a migrant worker of some kind

3160
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:07,280
become a migrant worker of some kind
 

3161
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,150
become a migrant worker of some kind
and now they have a 50 android phone

3162
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,160
and now they have a 50 android phone
 

3163
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,150
and now they have a 50 android phone
where they can read wikipedia

3164
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,160
where they can read wikipedia
 

3165
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,549
where they can read wikipedia
but they're still decades away from an

3166
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:14,559
but they're still decades away from an
 

3167
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:15,990
but they're still decades away from an
insurance company coming to their

3168
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,000
insurance company coming to their
 

3169
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,230
insurance company coming to their
geography and offering them insurance

3170
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,240
geography and offering them insurance
 

3171
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,910
geography and offering them insurance
because their local legal system simply

3172
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:19,920
because their local legal system simply
 

3173
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,349
because their local legal system simply
doesn't allow that type of thing to

3174
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,359
doesn't allow that type of thing to
 

3175
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:21,990
doesn't allow that type of thing to
exist

3176
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,000
exist
 

3177
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,430
exist
no insurance companies going to go and

3178
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:23,440
no insurance companies going to go and
 

3179
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,589
no insurance companies going to go and
create insurance entity and offer them

3180
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:25,599
create insurance entity and offer them
 

3181
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:25,990
create insurance entity and offer them
insurance

3182
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,000
insurance
 

3183
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,750
insurance
because you know the levels of fraud and

3184
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,760
because you know the levels of fraud and
 

3185
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,190
because you know the levels of fraud and
the ability to resolve that fraud

3186
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,200
the ability to resolve that fraud
 

3187
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,270
the ability to resolve that fraud
through courts would just not exist

3188
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,280
through courts would just not exist
 

3189
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,109
through courts would just not exist
so now these people have to wait for

3190
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
so now these people have to wait for
 

3191
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,910
so now these people have to wait for
decades to have this very basic form of

3192
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:35,920
decades to have this very basic form of
 

3193
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,109
decades to have this very basic form of
financial protection

3194
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:37,119
financial protection
 

3195
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,589
financial protection
or or something like a bank account even

3196
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
or or something like a bank account even
 

3197
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,750
or or something like a bank account even
and with this technology they don't

it extends to all these things that we
don't really care about right because

3276
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
don't really care about right because
 

3277
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,790
don't really care about right because
we're not farmers

3278
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:54,800
we're not farmers
 

3279
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,670
we're not farmers
but are unbelievably impactful for

3280
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
but are unbelievably impactful for
 

3281
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,430
but are unbelievably impactful for
people that don't have a bank account

3282
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,440
people that don't have a bank account
 

3283
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,230
people that don't have a bank account
and their

3284
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,240
and their
 

3285
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,670
and their
inflation rate in their country is

3286
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:01,680
inflation rate in their country is
 

3287
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,270
inflation rate in their country is
double digits

3288
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,280
double digits
 

3289
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,270
double digits
or their farm completely depends our

3290
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
or their farm completely depends our
 

3291
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,430
or their farm completely depends our
reign or their livelihood completely

3292
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440
reign or their livelihood completely
 

3293
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,069
reign or their livelihood completely
depends on their ability to sell goods

3294
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:10,079
depends on their ability to sell goods
 

3295
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,510
depends on their ability to sell goods
and they can't sell those goods because

3296
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
and they can't sell those goods because
 

3297
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,270
and they can't sell those goods because
there's a middleman who

3298
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:13,280
there's a middleman who
 

3299
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,630
there's a middleman who
essentially controls all the trust

3300
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
essentially controls all the trust
 

3301
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,270
essentially controls all the trust
relationships but now now we have the

3302
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:17,280
relationships but now now we have the
 

3303
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,990
relationships but now now we have the
internet and smart

3304
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:18,000
internet and smart
 

3305
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,910
internet and smart
contracts and that might not have to be

3306
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:19,920
contracts and that might not have to be
 

3307
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,030
contracts and that might not have to be
the case in

3308
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:21,040
the case in
 

3309
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,950
the case in
in in the next five or ten years yeah so

3310
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
in in the next five or ten years yeah so
 

3311
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,230
in in the next five or ten years yeah so
that definitely has a

3312
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,240
that definitely has a
 

3313
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,150
that definitely has a
quality of life impact on the particular

3314
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,160
quality of life impact on the particular
 

3315
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,670
quality of life impact on the particular
farmer's life but

3316
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:27,680
farmer's life but
 

3317
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,950
farmer's life but
i suspect it has a huge

3318
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:30,960
i suspect it has a huge
 

3319
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,710
i suspect it has a huge
like down the line ripple effect on the

3320
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:32,720
like down the line ripple effect on the
 

3321
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,390
like down the line ripple effect on the
whole supply chain so if

3322
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:34,400
whole supply chain so if
 

3323
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,430
whole supply chain so if
you think about farmers but any

3324
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,440
you think about farmers but any
 

3325
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,109
you think about farmers but any
other people that produce things

3326
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:41,119
other people that produce things
 

3327
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,470
other people that produce things
that are part of a large

3328
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:44,480
that are part of a large
 

3329
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,910
that are part of a large
like logistics network like supply chain

3330
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:47,920
like logistics network like supply chain
 

3331
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,870
like logistics network like supply chain
network

3332
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:48,880
network
 

3333
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,870
network
that means when you increase reliability

3334
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:52,880
that means when you increase reliability
 

3335
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,390
that means when you increase reliability
you sort of increase uh transparency and

3336
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
you sort of increase uh transparency and
 

3337
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,510
you sort of increase uh transparency and
control

3338
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,520
control
 

3339
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,750
control
but like where any one node in that

3340
00:52:59,750 --> 00:52:59,760
but like where any one node in that
 

3341
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,829
but like where any one node in that
supply chain network

3342
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:01,839
supply chain network
 

3343
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:06,230
supply chain network
can formalize the way it operates

3344
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,240
can formalize the way it operates
 

3345
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,710
can formalize the way it operates
in in its agreements with others then

3346
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,720
in in its agreements with others then
 

3347
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,430
in in its agreements with others then
you could just

3348
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,440
you could just
 

3349
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,710
you could just
have a very like at scale transformative

3350
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,720
have a very like at scale transformative
 

3351
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,270
have a very like at scale transformative
effect on how

3352
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,280
effect on how
 

3353
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,670
effect on how
people that down the line use the

3354
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
people that down the line use the
 

3355
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,349
people that down the line use the
services that you provide the products

3356
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:21,359
services that you provide the products
 

3357
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,549
services that you provide the products
that you create

3358
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:22,559
that you create
 

3359
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,910
that you create
operate so like it's almost hard to

3360
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:25,920
operate so like it's almost hard to
 

3361
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,030
operate so like it's almost hard to
imagine the the possible ways it might

3362
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
imagine the the possible ways it might
 

3363
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,470
imagine the the possible ways it might
transform the world

3364
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:30,480
transform the world
 

3365
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,630
transform the world
i i wonder how much friction there is in

3366
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
i i wonder how much friction there is in
 

3367
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,910
i i wonder how much friction there is in
the system i guess

3368
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:33,920
the system i guess
 

3369
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,390
the system i guess
currently that uh smart contracts might

3370
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
currently that uh smart contracts might
 

3371
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,430
currently that uh smart contracts might
remove

3372
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:37,440
remove
 

3373
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,630
remove
that's so that's a that's almost unknown

3374
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:40,640
that's so that's a that's almost unknown
 

3375
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,549
that's so that's a that's almost unknown
you can sort of hypothesize and stuff

3376
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559
you can sort of hypothesize and stuff
 

3377
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,309
you can sort of hypothesize and stuff
but i wonder

3378
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:44,319
but i wonder
 

3379
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,630
but i wonder
i've seen enough bureaucracy in my world

3380
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:46,640
i've seen enough bureaucracy in my world
 

3381
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,750
i've seen enough bureaucracy in my world
in my life

3382
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:47,760
in my life
 

3383
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,990
in my life
to know that smart contracts in many

3384
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,000
to know that smart contracts in many
 

3385
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,549
to know that smart contracts in many
cases would remove bureaucracy

3386
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:52,559
cases would remove bureaucracy
 

3387
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,750
cases would remove bureaucracy
and i wonder how the world will be once

3388
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:55,760
and i wonder how the world will be once
 

3389
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:55,990
and i wonder how the world will be once
you

3390
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,000
you
 

3391
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,549
you
remove much of the bureaucracy coming

3392
00:53:58,549 --> 00:53:58,559
remove much of the bureaucracy coming
 

3393
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,069
remove much of the bureaucracy coming
from the soviet union

3394
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:00,079
from the soviet union
 

3395
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,349
from the soviet union
where i just have seen the

3396
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:03,359
where i just have seen the
 

3397
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,390
where i just have seen the
life sucked out of

3398
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:06,400
life sucked out of
 

3399
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,430
life sucked out of
the innovative spirit of human nature

3400
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:09,440
the innovative spirit of human nature
 

3401
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,470
the innovative spirit of human nature
by bureaucracy i wonder

3402
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,480
by bureaucracy i wonder
 

3403
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,150
by bureaucracy i wonder
you know the kind of amazing world that

3404
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:14,160
you know the kind of amazing world that
 

3405
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,829
you know the kind of amazing world that
could be created once bureaucracy is

3406
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:15,839
could be created once bureaucracy is
 

3407
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,829
could be created once bureaucracy is
removed

3408
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:17,839
removed
 

3409
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,589
removed
yeah i i i think it's i think it's

3410
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:19,599
yeah i i i think it's i think it's
 

3411
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,270
yeah i i i think it's i think it's
fascinating how the world can

3412
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:21,280
fascinating how the world can
 

3413
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,150
fascinating how the world can
can evolve i i think this extends a lot

3414
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:24,160
can evolve i i think this extends a lot
 

3415
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,069
can evolve i i think this extends a lot

3429
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,710
we we don't know what it's going to go
to next but i think the implication

3430
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:40,720
to next but i think the implication
 

3431
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,309
to next but i think the implication
of people being in a system of contracts

3432
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:44,319
of people being in a system of contracts
 

3433
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,549
of people being in a system of contracts
that holds them accountable and

3434
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:46,559
that holds them accountable and
 

3435
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,870
that holds them accountable and
guarantees contractual outcomes

3436
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:48,880
guarantees contractual outcomes
 

3437
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,270
guarantees contractual outcomes

you know to the supply chain you can
 

3443
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,150
you know to the supply chain you can
prove that goods were sourced

prove that goods were sourced
 

3445
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,470
prove that goods were sourced
in an ethical way and you can prove that

in an ethical way and you can prove that

and how people produce goods that we all
 

3455
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,109

think that in a number of
decades we could literally be in a place

3563
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,750
oh man i that's so that's so exciting
to think that um we might

00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:53,760
to think that um we might
 

3565
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,230
to think that um we might
enforce uh accountability

3566
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:58,240
enforce uh accountability
 

3567
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,950

through the smart contract process
exactly why can't that happen

00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:02,480
exactly why can't that happen

00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,390
exactly why can't that happen
anything that we could codify into a

00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:07,440
and anything that we all agree is the
 

3577
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,030
and anything that we all agree is the
way the world should work

way the world should work
 

3579
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,950
way the world should work
and then anything that we can get proof

about right

about right

about right
anything that a system somewhere could

those are the pieces of the puzzle right

3588
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960
those are the pieces of the puzzle right
 

3589
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,589
those are the pieces of the puzzle right
we need a trusted piece of code we need

we need a trusted piece of code we need

that that's how the world should work
 

3595
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,069
that that's how the world should work
and we need a system that will tell that

00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
and we need a system that will tell that
 

3597
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,309
and we need a system that will tell that
trusted piece of code what happened

as as long as we have those three things
 

3601
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,309
as as long as we have those three things
we can theoretically codify

we can theoretically codify
 

3603
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,190
we can theoretically codify
any set of agreements about uh about

3604
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:35,200
any set of agreements about uh about
 

3605
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,309
any set of agreements about uh about
about anything

3606
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:36,319
about anything
 

3607
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,549
about anything
where those three properties uh take

3608
00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:38,559
where those three properties uh take
 

3609
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,670
where those three properties uh take
hold

3610
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:39,680
hold
 

3611
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,270
hold
i wonder if you can apply that to like

3612
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:41,280
i wonder if you can apply that to like
 

3613
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,270
i wonder if you can apply that to like
military conflict and so on

3614
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:43,280
military conflict and so on
 

3615
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,190
military conflict and so on
uh recently uh the biden announced that

3616
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,200
uh recently uh the biden announced that
 

3617
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,109
uh recently uh the biden announced that
we're going to pull off from afghanistan

3618
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:49,119
we're going to pull off from afghanistan
 

3619
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:49,990
we're going to pull off from afghanistan
after 20

3620
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,000
after 20
 

3621
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,589
after 20
20 years in the war i wonder

3622
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:53,599
20 years in the war i wonder
 

3623
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,510
20 years in the war i wonder
there's a lot of tobacco debacles around

3624
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:57,520
there's a lot of tobacco debacles around
 

3625
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,829
there's a lot of tobacco debacles around
war in afghanistan and invasion of iraq

3626
00:57:59,829 --> 00:57:59,839
war in afghanistan and invasion of iraq
 

3627
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:00,870
war in afghanistan and invasion of iraq
all those kinds of things

3628
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:00,880
all those kinds of things
 

3629
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,349
all those kinds of things
i wonder if that was instead formulated

3630
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:03,359
i wonder if that was instead formulated
 

3631
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,230
i wonder if that was instead formulated
as a smart contract

3632
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,240
as a smart contract
 

3633
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,990
as a smart contract
like uh that might have actually huge

3634
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,000
like uh that might have actually huge
 

3635
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,109
like uh that might have actually huge
impact on the way we do conflict so you

3636
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:13,119
impact on the way we do conflict so you
 

3637
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,390
impact on the way we do conflict so you
think of uh

3638
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
think of uh
 

3639
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,270
think of uh
smart contract as a as a kind of win-win

3640
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:17,280
smart contract as a as a kind of win-win
 

3641
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,630
smart contract as a as a kind of win-win
situation where you're doing

3642
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:18,640
situation where you're doing
 

3643
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,309
situation where you're doing
like financial transactions or something

3644
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:20,319
like financial transactions or something
 

3645
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,549
like financial transactions or something
like that but you could see that also

3646
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
like that but you could see that also
 

3647
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,069
like that but you could see that also
about

3648
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:24,079
about
 

3649
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,549
about
military conflict or like whenever two

3650
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:26,559
military conflict or like whenever two
 

3651
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,190
military conflict or like whenever two
nations

3652
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,200
nations
 

3653
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,390
nations
are attention with each other different

3654
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,400
are attention with each other different
 

3655
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,829
are attention with each other different
scales of conflict

3656
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:31,839
scales of conflict
 

3657
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:36,710
scales of conflict
that you can have conflict codified

3658
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
that you can have conflict codified
 

3659
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,870
that you can have conflict codified
and that would potentially resolve

3660
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:38,880
and that would potentially resolve
 

3661
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,870
and that would potentially resolve
conflict much faster

3662
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:40,880
conflict much faster
 

3663
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,789
conflict much faster
because there's honesty transparency and

3664
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:42,799
because there's honesty transparency and
 

3665
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,230
because there's honesty transparency and
control within that conflict because

3666
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:44,240
control within that conflict because
 

3667
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,069
control within that conflict because
there's conflict in this world

3668
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:46,079
there's conflict in this world
 

3669
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,510
there's conflict in this world
and i i again very very inspiring to

3670
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:49,520
and i i again very very inspiring to
 

3671
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,710
and i i again very very inspiring to
think about

3672
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:50,720
think about
 

3673
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,870
think about
the the kind of effects it might have on

3674
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
the the kind of effects it might have on
 

3675
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,470
the the kind of effects it might have on
the on

3676
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:54,480
the on
 

3677
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,390
the on
on the negative kinds of contracts and

3678
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:56,400
on the negative kinds of contracts and
 

3679
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,589
on the negative kinds of contracts and
the tense

3680
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:57,599
the tense
 

3681
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,069
the tense
painful kinds of contracts i i haven't

3682
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:00,079
painful kinds of contracts i i haven't
 

3683
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,510
painful kinds of contracts i i haven't
thought about that as much it's actually

3684
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:01,520
thought about that as much it's actually
 

3685
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,030
thought about that as much it's actually
kind of scary the stuff you're

3686
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,040
kind of scary the stuff you're
 

3687
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,150
kind of scary the stuff you're
you're thinking through now with like

3688
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:04,160
you're thinking through now with like
 

3689
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,150
you're thinking through now with like
the war contract or something you know

3690
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:06,160
the war contract or something you know
 

3691
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,510
the war contract or something you know
that's not in the white paper we don't

3692
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:07,520
that's not in the white paper we don't
 

3693
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:07,829
that's not in the white paper we don't
have

3694
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:07,839
have
 

3695
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,510
have
anything about war contracts or anything

3696
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:09,520
anything about war contracts or anything
 

3697
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,589
anything about war contracts or anything
again this is the the russian uh

3698
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:11,599
again this is the the russian uh
 

3699
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,349
again this is the the russian uh
we're both russian but i'm a little more

3700
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:13,359
we're both russian but i'm a little more
 

3701
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,190
we're both russian but i'm a little more
russian uh in the suffering side

3702
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:15,200
russian uh in the suffering side
 

3703
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,190
russian uh in the suffering side
maybe i read way too much dostoyevsky

3704
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:17,200
maybe i read way too much dostoyevsky
 

3705
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,549
maybe i read way too much dostoyevsky
and military kind of ideas but

3706
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:20,559
and military kind of ideas but
 

3707
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,589
and military kind of ideas but
anyway holding politicians accountable

3708
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:23,599
anyway holding politicians accountable
 

3709
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,069
anyway holding politicians accountable
in all forms i think is really powerful

3710
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:26,079
in all forms i think is really powerful
 

3711
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,430
in all forms i think is really powerful
is there something you could say

3712
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,440
is there something you could say
 

3713
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,109
is there something you could say
as a small side on how

3714
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
as a small side on how
 

3715
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,870
as a small side on how
smart contracts actually work if you

3716
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
smart contracts actually work if you
 

3717
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,549
smart contracts actually work if you
look at the code is there some nice way

3718
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:34,559
look at the code is there some nice way
 

3719
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:35,990
look at the code is there some nice way
to say

3720
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,000
to say
 

3721
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,870
to say
technically what is a smart contract

3722
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:38,880
technically what is a smart contract
 

3723
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,309
technically what is a smart contract
what does it mean to codify

3724
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:40,319
what does it mean to codify
 

3725
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,549
what does it mean to codify
these agreements the actual process for

3726
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:42,559
these agreements the actual process for
 

3727
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,309
these agreements the actual process for
people who might not at all be familiar

3728
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:46,319
people who might not at all be familiar
 

3729
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,549
people who might not at all be familiar
i i think you just write it into code

3730
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:48,559
i i think you just write it into code
 

3731
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,829
i i think you just write it into code
that operates

3732
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:49,839
that operates
 

3733
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,349
that operates
in this kind of decentralized

3734
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:51,359
in this kind of decentralized
 

3735
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,750
in this kind of decentralized
infrastructure you you usually write

3736
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:53,760
infrastructure you you usually write
 

3737
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,270
infrastructure you you usually write
code that runs in a central server

3738
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:55,280
code that runs in a central server
 

3739
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,069
code that runs in a central server
somewhere

3740
00:59:56,069 --> 00:59:56,079
somewhere
 

3741
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,549
somewhere
now you write code that runs um across a

3742
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:58,559
now you write code that runs um across a
 

3743
00:59:58,559 --> 00:59:59,750
now you write code that runs um across a
lot of different machines in this

3744
00:59:59,750 --> 00:59:59,760
lot of different machines in this
 

3745
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,349
lot of different machines in this
decentralized way

3746
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:01,359
decentralized way
 

3747
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,430
decentralized way
and then after you write it you need

3748
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:03,440
and then after you write it you need
 

3749
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,349
and then after you write it you need
services and that's where oracle's come

3750
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359
services and that's where oracle's come
 

3751
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,109
services and that's where oracle's come
in they provide all the services

3752
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:07,119
in they provide all the services
 

3753
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,190
in they provide all the services
so just like you would be writing code

3754
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
so just like you would be writing code
 

3755
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,109
so just like you would be writing code
in web 2.0 land running it on a server

3756
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:11,119
in web 2.0 land running it on a server
 

3757
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,710
in web 2.0 land running it on a server
somewhere and using an api

3758
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
somewhere and using an api
 

3759
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,349
somewhere and using an api
here you'd be writing code putting it on

3760
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:15,359
here you'd be writing code putting it on
 

3761
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,789
here you'd be writing code putting it on
a decentralized infrastructure like a

3762
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:16,799
a decentralized infrastructure like a
 

3763
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:17,589
a decentralized infrastructure like a

or a smart contract platform like
 

3767
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,109
or a smart contract platform like
ethereum and then you would be using

3768
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:21,119
ethereum and then you would be using
 

3769
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,549
ethereum and then you would be using
various services

various services
 

3771
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,150
various services
in the form of oracle so they'll just be

3773
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,910
in the form of oracle so they'll just be
called oracles or decentralized services

3783
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,030
except it's hyper reliable at the moment
it's a little bit less efficient because

3784
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:35,040
it's a little bit less efficient because
 

3785
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,589
it's a little bit less efficient because
you know the

3786
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:35,599
you know the

cases

3798
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,160
cases
 

3799
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,190
cases
is an absolute critical component and

3800
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:49,200
is an absolute critical component and
 

3801
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,789
is an absolute critical component and
is completely reinventing how they work

3802
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:50,799
is completely reinventing how they work
 

3803
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,630
is completely reinventing how they work
so i i think people should look at what

3804
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:52,640
so i i think people should look at what
 

3805
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,829
so i i think people should look at what
are the use cases

3806
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:53,839
are the use cases
 

3807
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:55,349
are the use cases
where that trust dynamic can be so

3808
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:55,359
where that trust dynamic can be so
 

3809
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,349
where that trust dynamic can be so
heavily improved and that's probably the

3810
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
heavily improved and that's probably the
 

3811
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,230
heavily improved and that's probably the
ones where this is

3812
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:58,240
ones where this is
 

3813
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,870
ones where this is
maybe initially useful but i mean just

3814
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:00,880
maybe initially useful but i mean just
 

3815
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,309
maybe initially useful but i mean just
to emphasize i don't think

3816
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:02,319
to emphasize i don't think
 

3817
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,390
to emphasize i don't think
people realize when you say code that

3818
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400
people realize when you say code that
 

3819
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,789
people realize when you say code that
we're talking about

3820
01:01:05,789 --> 01:01:05,799
we're talking about
 

3821
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:09,030
we're talking about
non-obfuscated actual program

3822
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:09,040
non-obfuscated actual program
 

3823
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,109
non-obfuscated actual program
like you can read it you can understand

3824
01:01:11,109 --> 01:01:11,119
like you can read it you can understand
 

3825
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:12,549
like you can read it you can understand
it yeah and it's

3826
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:12,559
it yeah and it's
 

3827
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,670
it yeah and it's
there's something about uh maybe this is

3828
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:15,680
there's something about uh maybe this is
 

3829
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,510
there's something about uh maybe this is
my computer science perspective of

3830
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:17,520
my computer science perspective of
 

3831
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,430
my computer science perspective of
like software engineering perspective

3832
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:19,440
like software engineering perspective
 

3833
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,549
like software engineering perspective
but there's something about the

3834
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:20,559
but there's something about the
 

3835
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,349
but there's something about the
formalism of programming languages

3836
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:23,359
formalism of programming languages
 

3837
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:26,950
formalism of programming languages
which enforces simplicity and clarity

3838
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:26,960
which enforces simplicity and clarity
 

3839
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,309
which enforces simplicity and clarity
and transparency and because it's

3840
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:30,319
and transparency and because it's
 

3841
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,030
and transparency and because it's
seen to everybody i mean simplicity is

3842
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:33,040
seen to everybody i mean simplicity is
 

3843
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,990
seen to everybody i mean simplicity is
enforced

3844
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,000
enforced
 

3845
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,510
enforced
there's no there's something about

3846
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:35,520
there's no there's something about
 

3847
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,670
there's no there's something about
natural language like language

3848
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
natural language like language

example
where there's so many interpretations

3854
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:44,319
where there's so many interpretations
 

3855
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,510
where there's so many interpretations
with the the nice thing about programs

3856
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:47,520
with the the nice thing about programs
 

3857
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,750
with the the nice thing about programs
there's no there's not going to be a

01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760
there's no there's not going to be a
 

3859
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,510
there's no there's not going to be a
huge number of books written about

3860
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:51,520
huge number of books written about
 

3861
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,990
huge number of books written about
what was meant by this particular line

3862
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,000
what was meant by this particular line
 

3863
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,309
what was meant by this particular line
because it's pretty clear

3864
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:56,319
because it's pretty clear
 

3865
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,829
because it's pretty clear
like programming languages have a

3866
01:01:57,829 --> 01:01:57,839
like programming languages have a
 

3867
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,309
like programming languages have a
clarity to them that natural language

3868
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
clarity to them that natural language
 

3869
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:04,309
clarity to them that natural language
does not and they don't have ambiguity

3870
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:04,319
does not and they don't have ambiguity
 

3871
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,630
does not and they don't have ambiguity
which i think it's important to pause on

3872
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,640
which i think it's important to pause on
 

3873
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,029
which i think it's important to pause on
because it's really powerful it's really

3874
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:09,039
because it's really powerful it's really
 

3875
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,309
because it's really powerful it's really
difficult to think about i think we live

3876
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:10,319
difficult to think about i think we live
 

3877
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,230
difficult to think about i think we live
in a world where all the philosophers

3878
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
in a world where all the philosophers
 

3879
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,750
in a world where all the philosophers
and legal minds

3880
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:13,760
and legal minds
 

3881
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,950
and legal minds
don't know how to program so i think not

3882
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:16,960
don't know how to program so i think not
 

3883
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,510
don't know how to program so i think not
all

all
 

3885
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,870
all
most don't and so we don't often see

3886
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:20,880
most don't and so we don't often see
 

3887
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,270
most don't and so we don't often see
the philosophical impact of this kind of

01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:23,280
the philosophical impact of this kind of

idea
 

3891
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,630
idea
that the agreements between humans can

that the agreements between humans can
be written

be written
 

3895
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,390
be written
in a programming language that's a

in a programming language that's a
 

3897
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,950
in a programming language that's a
really transformative idea

01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:32,960
really transformative idea
 

3899
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,230
really transformative idea
that i mean yeah it's it's uh it's an

3900
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
that i mean yeah it's it's uh it's an
 

3901
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,430
that i mean yeah it's it's uh it's an
idea that's not just

3902
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:37,440
idea that's not just
 

3903
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,670
idea that's not just
technical it's not just financial it's

3904
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:39,680
technical it's not just financial it's
 

3905
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,870
technical it's not just financial it's
philosophical

3906
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:40,880
philosophical
 

3907
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,109
philosophical
it's rethinking human nature from a

it's rethinking human nature from a
 

3909
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,270
it's rethinking human nature from a
digital perspective

3910
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,280
digital perspective
 

3911
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,150
digital perspective
the like what is human civilization it's

3912
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:48,160
the like what is human civilization it's
 

3913
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,029
the like what is human civilization it's
interaction between humans

3914
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:51,039
interaction between humans
 

3915
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,230
interaction between humans
and rethinking that interaction as a

3916
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
and rethinking that interaction as a
 

3917
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,750
and rethinking that interaction as a
digital interaction

3918

digital interaction
 

3919
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,990
digital interaction
that is managed by programming languages

3920
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,000
that is managed by programming languages
 

3921
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,029
that is managed by programming languages
by programs

3922
01:02:59,029 --> 01:02:59,039
by programs
 

3923
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,190
by programs
by code i mean that's that's fascinating

3924
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:03,200
by code i mean that's that's fascinating
 

3925
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,870
by code i mean that's that's fascinating
that we'll look back at this time

01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:16,000
history is
 

3937
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,910
history is
like human beings might be totally

3941
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,589
different
a century from now because we codified

3942
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:23,599
a century from now because we codified
 

3943
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,910
a century from now because we codified
the interaction between humans that

3944
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
the interaction between humans that
 

3945
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,510
the interaction between humans that
might have more of an impact than

3946
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:27,520
might have more of an impact than
 

3947
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,630
might have more of an impact than
anything else

3948
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:28,640
anything else
 

3949
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,109
anything else
we do today you think about the impact

3950
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:31,119
we do today you think about the impact
 

3951
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,710
we do today you think about the impact
of the internet one of the cool things

3952
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:32,720
of the internet one of the cool things
 

3953
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,510
of the internet one of the cool things
is the digitization of data but we have

3954
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,520
is the digitization of data but we have
 

3955
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,029
is the digitization of data but we have
not yet integrated

3956
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:37,039
not yet integrated
 

3957
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,950
not yet integrated
the the tools the mechanisms fully

3958
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:40,960
the the tools the mechanisms fully
 

3959
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,950
the the tools the mechanisms fully
that use that data and interact with

3960
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:42,960
that use that data and interact with
 

3961
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,470
that use that data and interact with
humans yet and that's what smart

3962
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:44,480
humans yet and that's what smart
 

3963
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,670
humans yet and that's what smart
contracts do

3964
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:45,680
contracts do
 

3965
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,589
contracts do
i wonder if you think about the role of

3966
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:47,599
i wonder if you think about the role of
 

3967
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:50,150
i wonder if you think about the role of
artificial intelligence in all of this

3968
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,160
artificial intelligence in all of this
 

3969
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,870
artificial intelligence in all of this
because your smart contracts are kind of

3970
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:54,880
because your smart contracts are kind of
 

3971
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,510
because your smart contracts are kind of
agreements maybe you disagree with this

3972
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:57,520
agreements maybe you disagree with this
 

3973
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,470
agreements maybe you disagree with this
but

3974
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:58,480
but
 

3975
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,829
but
at least the way i'm thinking about it

3976
01:03:59,829 --> 01:03:59,839
at least the way i'm thinking about it
 

3977
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,589
at least the way i'm thinking about it
is agreements between humans

3978
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:01,599
is agreements between humans
 

3979
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,589
is agreements between humans
or groups of humans but it seems like

3980
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:05,599
or groups of humans but it seems like
 

3981
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,349
or groups of humans but it seems like
because everything is operating in the

3982
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:07,359
because everything is operating in the
 

3983
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,630
because everything is operating in the
digital space that you can integrate

3984
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:10,640
digital space that you can integrate
 

3985
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,069
digital space that you can integrate
non-humans into this or ai

3986
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:14,079
non-humans into this or ai
 

3987
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,710

humans
 

3991
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,950
humans
like what do you think about a world

3992
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:20,960
like what do you think about a world
 

3993
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,430
like what do you think about a world
of hybrid smart contracts

3994
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440

 

3995
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,630

codifying agreements

3996
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:28,640
codifying agreements
 

3997
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,750
codifying agreements
between uh hybrid intelligent being

3998
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:31,760
between uh hybrid intelligent being

networks
 

4001
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,309
networks
of humans and ai systems yeah yeah i

4002
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:36,319
of humans and ai systems yeah yeah i
 

4003
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,109
of humans and ai systems yeah yeah i
think that makes

4004
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:37,119
think that makes
 

4005
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,349
think that makes
i think that makes perfect sense in in

4006
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:39,359
i think that makes perfect sense in in
 

4007
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:40,390
i think that makes perfect sense in in
terms of ai

4008
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,400
terms of ai
 

4009
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,029
terms of ai
um i'm not an expert right so it might

4010
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:43,039
um i'm not an expert right so it might
 

4011
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:43,670
um i'm not an expert right so it might
be a bit

4012
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:43,680
be a bit
 

4013
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,789
be a bit
simplistic or naive my my ideas in

4014
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:46,799
simplistic or naive my my ideas in
 

4015
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,270
simplistic or naive my my ideas in
in this field i i think you know

4016
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:49,280
in this field i i think you know
 

4017
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,349
in this field i i think you know
everyone saw the terminator movie

4018
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:51,359
everyone saw the terminator movie
 

4019
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,710
everyone saw the terminator movie
right everybody kind of saw the

4020
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:52,720
right everybody kind of saw the
 

4021
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,870
right everybody kind of saw the
terminator movie in the 90s

4022
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
terminator movie in the 90s
 

4023
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,349
terminator movie in the 90s
and it was like this is really scary um

4024
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,359
and it was like this is really scary um
 

4025
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,950
and it was like this is really scary um
i personally think ai is

4026
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:58,960
i personally think ai is
 

4027
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,950
i personally think ai is
is is amazing it makes makes perfect

4028
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:00,960
is is amazing it makes makes perfect
 

4029
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,990
is is amazing it makes makes perfect
sense

4030
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,000
sense
 

4031
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,470
sense
i think it will evolve to a place where

4032
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480
i think it will evolve to a place where
 

4033
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,349
i think it will evolve to a place where
people

01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:54,240
at a certain point we'd arrive at a
 

4091
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,549
at a certain point we'd arrive at a
place with ai where we would be

4092
01:05:56,549 --> 01:05:56,559
place with ai where we would be
 

4093
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,630
place with ai where we would be
a little bit worried about just how much

4094
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:58,640
a little bit worried about just how much
 

4095
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,390
a little bit worried about just how much
it could do right we might be worried

4096
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:00,400
it could do right we might be worried
 

4097
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,150
it could do right we might be worried
that ai could do things

4098
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
that ai could do things
 

4099
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,109
that ai could do things
we don't want it to do but we still want

4100
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:05,119
we don't want it to do but we still want
 

4101
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:05,510
we don't want it to do but we still want
to give

4102
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:05,520
to give
 

4103
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,230
to give
ai a level of control over our lives

4104
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,240
ai a level of control over our lives
 

4105
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,109
ai a level of control over our lives
right so

4106
01:06:09,109 --> 01:06:09,119
right so
 

4107
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,829
right so
in my world that's a trust issue and the

4108
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:11,839
in my world that's a trust issue and the
 

4109
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,349
in my world that's a trust issue and the
way that that trust issue would be

4110
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:13,359
way that that trust issue would be
 

4111
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,950
way that that trust issue would be
solved with blockchains

4112
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
solved with blockchains
 

4113
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,950
solved with blockchains
is is actually very straightforward and

4114
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
is is actually very straightforward and
 

4115
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,390
is is actually very straightforward and
i think in its simplicity quite powerful

4116
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:20,400
i think in its simplicity quite powerful
 

4117
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,549
i think in its simplicity quite powerful
you could have an ai that has an ability

01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:22,559
you could have an ai that has an ability
 

4119
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,870
you could have an ai that has an ability
to do and control

01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,029
key parts of your and our lives right
but then you could limit it with private

but then you could limit it with private
 

4125
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,430

solve the trust issue for users and make
 

4199
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,870
solve the trust issue for users and make
them comfortable with

of ai
 

4209
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,910

01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:55,920
will continue to be a concern right this
 

4211
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,029
will continue to be a concern right this
is fascinating

4212
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:57,039
is fascinating
 

4213
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,630
is fascinating
so smart contracts actually provide a

4214
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:58,640
so smart contracts actually provide a
 

4215
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,789
so smart contracts actually provide a
mechanism for human supervision of ai

4216
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
mechanism for human supervision of ai

systems
 

4219
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,470
systems
for the encryption very encryption heavy

4220
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:04,480
for the encryption very encryption heavy
 

4221
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,910
for the encryption very encryption heavy
so it's not about like

4222
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:05,920
so it's not about like
 

4223
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,390
so it's not about like
is it smarter than us it's about will

4224
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
is it smarter than us it's about will
 

4225
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,710
is it smarter than us it's about will
the encryption hold up yep

4226
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:10,720
the encryption hold up yep
 

4227
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,870
the encryption hold up yep
so we that's based on the assumption

4228
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:12,880
so we that's based on the assumption
 

4229
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,950
so we that's based on the assumption
that the encryption holds up

4230
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:14,960
that the encryption holds up
 

4231
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,470
that the encryption holds up
i think that's a safe assumption we can

4232
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:16,480
i think that's a safe assumption we can
 

4233
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,990
i think that's a safe assumption we can
get into that whole discussion

4234
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,000
get into that whole discussion
 

4235
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,550
get into that whole discussion
but from quantum computing but cracking

4236
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:20,560
but from quantum computing but cracking
 

4237
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,149
but from quantum computing but cracking
encryption is very difficult that's a

01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:22,159
encryption is very difficult that's a
 

4239
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:23,590
encryption is very difficult that's a

that's different than what you're

that's different than what you're
referring to is

4267
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,309

and that to me is kind of fascinating

4268
01:09:00,309 --> 01:09:00,319
and that to me is kind of fascinating
 

4269
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,510
and that to me is kind of fascinating
to think of especially two ai systems

4270
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:03,520
to think of especially two ai systems
 

4271
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,950
to think of especially two ai systems
between each other generating contracts

4272
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960
between each other generating contracts
 

4273
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,630
between each other generating contracts
sort of almost creating a world

01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
sort of almost creating a world
 

4275
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,110
sort of almost creating a world
where most of the contracts are between

4276
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:13,120
where most of the contracts are between

01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,269
where most of the contracts are between

i i think an ai system as i think about

4280
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:17,359
i i think an ai system as i think about
 

4281
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,189
i i think an ai system as i think about
it and once again this is not my field

4282
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,199
it and once again this is not my field
 

4283
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:20,470
it and once again this is not my field
this is something i might watch a

4284
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:20,480
this is something i might watch a
 

4285
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,070
this is something i might watch a
youtube video on or just see something

4286
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:22,080
youtube video on or just see something
 

4287
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,910
youtube video on or just see something
interesting about at some point

4288
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:23,920
interesting about at some point
 

4289
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,789
interesting about at some point
um i think if i were to just reason

4290
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:26,799
um i think if i were to just reason
 

4291
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:29,189
um i think if i were to just reason
through it even even now

4292
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:29,199
through it even even now
 

4293
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,110
through it even even now
i think the highly deterministic and

4294
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,120
i think the highly deterministic and
 

4295
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,390
i think the highly deterministic and
guaranteed nature of smart contracts

4296
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
guaranteed nature of smart contracts
 

4297
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,910
guaranteed nature of smart contracts
would probably be preferable to an ai

4298
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:37,920
would probably be preferable to an ai
 

4299
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,789
would probably be preferable to an ai
because i'm guessing an ai would have a

4300
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:40,799
because i'm guessing an ai would have a
 

4301
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,550
because i'm guessing an ai would have a
lot of problems with dealing with the

4302
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:42,560
lot of problems with dealing with the
 

4303
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,669
lot of problems with dealing with the
human element

4304
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
human element
 

4305
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,829

of how contracts work today right so an

01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:45,839
of how contracts work today right so an
 

4307
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,269
of how contracts work today right so an

couldn't pick up the phone and call you

know dave

4312
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
know dave
 

4313
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,829
know dave
at a bank to do a derivative and kind of

4314
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:53,839
at a bank to do a derivative and kind of
 

4315
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,430
at a bank to do a derivative and kind of
discuss with dave and have a call with

4316
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
discuss with dave and have a call with
 

4317
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,350
discuss with dave and have a call with
him and kind of have a conversation and

4318
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:57,360
him and kind of have a conversation and
 

4319
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,790
him and kind of have a conversation and
make him comfortable

4320
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:58,800
make him comfortable
 

4321
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,630
make him comfortable
and tell him it's going to be fine and

4322
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:00,640
and tell him it's going to be fine and
 

4323
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,550
and tell him it's going to be fine and
kind of smooth out all the weird

4324
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
kind of smooth out all the weird
 

4325
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,149
kind of smooth out all the weird
you know social cues that have to do

4326
01:10:04,149 --> 01:10:04,159
you know social cues that have to do
 

4327
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,070
you know social cues that have to do
with making certain derivatives

4328
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:06,080
with making certain derivatives
 

4329
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,870
with making certain derivatives
i'm assuming that that's a pretty

4330
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:08,880
i'm assuming that that's a pretty
 

4331
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,070
i'm assuming that that's a pretty
complicated

4332
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,080
complicated
 

4333
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,430

neural map ai kind of problem
 

4335
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,189
neural map ai kind of problem
um yeah so if i think about it

4336
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:17,199
um yeah so if i think about it
 

4337
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,030
um yeah so if i think about it
the deterministic guaranteed nature of

4338
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:19,040
the deterministic guaranteed nature of
 

4339
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,110
the deterministic guaranteed nature of
smart contracts

4340
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:21,120
smart contracts
 

4341
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,030
smart contracts
probably would and and if assuming

4342
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:23,040
probably would and and if assuming
 

4343
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,030
probably would and and if assuming
they're accessible to ais

4344
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:25,040
they're accessible to ais
 

4345
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,950
they're accessible to ais
could actually interestingly enough be

4346
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:26,960
could actually interestingly enough be
 

4347
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,470
could actually interestingly enough be
the format

4348
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:28,480
the format
 

4349
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,709
the format
that they prefer to codify their

4350
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:30,719
that they prefer to codify their
 

4351
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:32,390
that they prefer to codify their
relationship

4352
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,400
relationship
 

4353
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,430
relationship
with non-ai systems

4354
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:35,440
with non-ai systems
 

4355
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,590
with non-ai systems
and very possibly other ai systems right

4356
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:37,600
and very possibly other ai systems right
 

4357
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,790
and very possibly other ai systems right
because

4358
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:38,800
because
 

4359
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,070
because
it is very um i mean

4360
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:42,080
it is very um i mean
 

4361
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,070
it is very um i mean
it's pretty it's pretty guaranteed right

4362
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:44,080
it's pretty it's pretty guaranteed right
 

4363
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,310
it's pretty it's pretty guaranteed right
all the other types of contracts that an

4364
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:46,320
all the other types of contracts that an
 

4365
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,229
all the other types of contracts that an
ai could go out there

4366
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:48,239
ai could go out there
 

4367
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:52,630
ai could go out there
and seek to do would require

4368
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:52,640
and seek to do would require
 

4369
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,550
and seek to do would require
you know some language processing around

4370
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,560
you know some language processing around
 

4371
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,149
you know some language processing around
the law

4372
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
the law
 

4373
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,709
the law
and i think um uh i don't know if this

4374
01:10:58,709 --> 01:10:58,719
and i think um uh i don't know if this
 

4375
01:10:58,719 --> 01:10:59,350
and i think um uh i don't know if this
is a term

4376
01:10:59,350 --> 01:10:59,360
is a term
 

4377
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,590
is a term
but probably not a smart ai or a good ai

4378
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,600
but probably not a smart ai or a good ai
 

4379
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,790
but probably not a smart ai or a good ai
or whatever the term is for a high

4380
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:02,800
or whatever the term is for a high
 

4381
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,030
or whatever the term is for a high
quality ai

4382
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,040
quality ai
 

4383
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,189
quality ai
would probably realize some of the

4384
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:07,199
would probably realize some of the
 

4385
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,189
would probably realize some of the
limitations and the risks

4386
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:09,199
limitations and the risks
 

4387
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,350
limitations and the risks
yeah yeah ai definitely dislikes

4388
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:11,360
yeah yeah ai definitely dislikes
 

4389
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,030
yeah yeah ai definitely dislikes
ambiguity and would prefer the the

4390
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:13,040
ambiguity and would prefer the the
 

4391
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,390
ambiguity and would prefer the the
determinism

4392
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
determinism
 

4393
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,990

i i do wonder about this particular

4398
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
i i do wonder about this particular
 

4399
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,750
i i do wonder about this particular
problem and maybe you can speak to it of

4400
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
problem and maybe you can speak to it of
 

4401
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,950
problem and maybe you can speak to it of
how smart contracts can

4402
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:24,960
how smart contracts can
 

4403
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,910
how smart contracts can
take over certain industries in a sense

4404
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
take over certain industries in a sense
 

4405
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,470
take over certain industries in a sense
or how

4406
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:28,480
or how
 

4407
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,030
or how
certain industries can convert their

you know many of our laws many of our

4418
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:40,400
you know many of our laws many of our
 

4419
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,070
you know many of our laws many of our
agreements are

4420
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:42,080
agreements are
 

4421
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,189
agreements are
currently through natural language

4422
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:45,199
currently through natural language
 

4423
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:48,149
currently through natural language
through words and so there is a process

4424
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:48,159
through words and so there is a process
 

4425
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:48,470
through words and so there is a process
of

4426
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,480
of
 

4427
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,110
of
mapping that has to occur in order to

4428
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:51,120
mapping that has to occur in order to
 

4429
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,310
mapping that has to occur in order to
convert

4430
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
convert
 

4431
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,110
convert
the legal agreements legal contracts of

4432
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,120
the legal agreements legal contracts of
 

4433
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,229
the legal agreements legal contracts of
today

4434
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:56,239
today
 

4435
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:59,270
today
to smart contracts that by the way ai

4436
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,280
to smart contracts that by the way ai
 

4437
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,950
to smart contracts that by the way ai
may be able to help with

4438
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
may be able to help with
 

4439
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,149
may be able to help with
but as a by way of question how do you

4440
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:04,159
but as a by way of question how do you
 

4441
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,070
but as a by way of question how do you
think would convert

4442
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:06,080
think would convert
 

4443
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,110
think would convert
the legal contracts on which many

4444
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:09,120
the legal contracts on which many
 

4445
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,310
the legal contracts on which many
industries currently function today or

4446
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:12,320
industries currently function today or
 

4447
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,310
industries currently function today or
not even legal contracts but ambiguous

4448
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:14,320
not even legal contracts but ambiguous
 

4449
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,910
not even legal contracts but ambiguous
kind of agreements

4450
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:15,920
kind of agreements
 

4451
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,790
kind of agreements
maybe they're loose sometimes into more

4452
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800
maybe they're loose sometimes into more
 

4453
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,430
maybe they're loose sometimes into more
formal

4454
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:19,440
formal
 

4455
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,229
formal
deterministic agreements that are

4456
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:22,239
deterministic agreements that are
 

4457
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,950
deterministic agreements that are
represented by smart contracts

4458
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
represented by smart contracts
 

4459
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,229
represented by smart contracts
so i i think there's two um maybe two

4460
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:28,239
so i i think there's two um maybe two
 

4461
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,189
so i i think there's two um maybe two
sides to this

4462
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
sides to this
 

4463
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,070
sides to this
um i think the first one is actually not

4464
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,080
um i think the first one is actually not
 

4465
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,669
um i think the first one is actually not
a huge problem where you have things

4466
01:12:33,669 --> 01:12:33,679
a huge problem where you have things
 

4467
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,350
a huge problem where you have things
like the is the master agreement for

4468
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,360
like the is the master agreement for
 

4469
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,510
like the is the master agreement for
derivatives or you have these agreements

4470
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:37,520
derivatives or you have these agreements
 

4471
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,430
derivatives or you have these agreements
that basically already reference a

4472
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
that basically already reference a
 

4473
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,790
that basically already reference a
system somewhere

4474
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:40,800
system somewhere
 

4475
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,790
system somewhere
right like for example many legal

4476
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:42,800
right like for example many legal
 

4477
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,950
right like for example many legal
agreements already accept e-signature

4478
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:44,960
agreements already accept e-signature
 

4479
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,229
agreements already accept e-signature
and so they're saying hey i'm going to

4480
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
and so they're saying hey i'm going to
 

4481
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,990
and so they're saying hey i'm going to
use this computing system over here

4482
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:48,000
use this computing system over here
 

4483
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,189
use this computing system over here
around signatures

4484
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:49,199
around signatures
 

4485
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,390
around signatures
and i'm going to consider and there's

4486
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
and i'm going to consider and there's
 

4487
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,229
and i'm going to consider and there's
laws around that and there's clauses

4488
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:52,239
laws around that and there's clauses
 

4489
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:52,709
laws around that and there's clauses
that say

4490
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:52,719
that say
 

4491
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:53,910
that say
signatures good enough for this

4492
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:53,920
signatures good enough for this
 

4493
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,229
signatures good enough for this
agreement i i actually don't think this

4494
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
agreement i i actually don't think this
 

4495
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:57,270
agreement i i actually don't think this
is a big problem

4496
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,280
is a big problem
 

4497
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,110
is a big problem
for the vast majority of legal

4498
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,120
for the vast majority of legal
 

4499
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,550
for the vast majority of legal
agreements that use

4500
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:00,560
agreements that use
 

4501
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,630
agreements that use
systems already right so what you'll do

4502
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:02,640
systems already right so what you'll do
 

4503
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,390
systems already right so what you'll do
is you'll swap out one

4504
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
is you'll swap out one
 

4505
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,270
is you'll swap out one
uh repository or one or one set of contr

4506
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:07,280
uh repository or one or one set of contr
 

4507
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,149
uh repository or one or one set of contr
system of contract

4508
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:08,159
system of contract
 

4509
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,070
system of contract
settlement and you'll just say hey this

4510
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,080
settlement and you'll just say hey this
 

4511
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,430
settlement and you'll just say hey this
blockchain system over here

4512
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:11,440
blockchain system over here
 

4513
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,430
blockchain system over here
is my new system of contract settlement

4514
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440
is my new system of contract settlement
 

4515
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,470
is my new system of contract settlement
whatever it says

4516
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:14,480
whatever it says
 

4517
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,270
whatever it says
is the state of the agreement instead of

4518
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:17,280
is the state of the agreement instead of
 

4519
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,550
is the state of the agreement instead of
you know the centralized

4520
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:18,560
you know the centralized
 

4521
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,950
you know the centralized
system over there right and so there's

4522
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:20,960
system over there right and so there's
 

4523
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,149
system over there right and so there's
actually a huge amount of agreements

4524
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:22,159
actually a huge amount of agreements
 

4525
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:23,270
actually a huge amount of agreements
that are already

4526
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:23,280
that are already
 

4527
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,350
that are already
um able to to do that and i think we'll

4528
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:25,360
um able to to do that and i think we'll
 

4529
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,550
um able to to do that and i think we'll
we'll do that

4530
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:26,560
we'll do that
 

4531
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,390
we'll do that
i think there's another side to your

4532
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:28,400
i think there's another side to your
 

4533
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,709
i think there's another side to your
question which is the

4534
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:30,719
question which is the
 

4535
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,030
question which is the
amount of agreements that are very

4536
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:33,040
amount of agreements that are very
 

4537
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,189
amount of agreements that are very
ambiguous that can be turned into smart

4538
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:35,199
ambiguous that can be turned into smart
 

4539
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:35,990
ambiguous that can be turned into smart
contracts

4540
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:36,000
contracts
 

4541
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,229
contracts
and i think the limitation there is is

4542
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:38,239
and i think the limitation there is is
 

4543
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:39,189
and i think the limitation there is is
twofold

4544
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:39,199
twofold
 

4545
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,669
twofold
first of all like like you said earlier

4546
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:41,679
first of all like like you said earlier
 

4547
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:44,149
first of all like like you said earlier
the highly reliable smart contract and

4548
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:44,159
the highly reliable smart contract and
 

4549
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:44,390
the highly reliable smart contract and
the

4550
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:44,400
the
 

4551
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,990
the
and the lack of opaqueness and the

4552
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,000
and the lack of opaqueness and the
 

4553
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,229
and the lack of opaqueness and the
clarity of smart contracts

4554
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:48,239
clarity of smart contracts
 

4555
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:51,990
clarity of smart contracts
is is is very um high and very powerful

4556
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:52,000
is is is very um high and very powerful
 

4557
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,590
is is is very um high and very powerful
and very clear

4558
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:53,600
and very clear
 

4559
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,510
and very clear
and it's in my opinion going to be much

4560
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,520
and it's in my opinion going to be much
 

4561
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,790
and it's in my opinion going to be much
much easier to take

4562
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:56,800
much easier to take
 

4563
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,189
much easier to take
a smart contract and turn it into a set

4564
01:13:59,189 --> 01:13:59,199
a smart contract and turn it into a set
 

4565
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:00,390
a smart contract and turn it into a set
of natural language

4566
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,400
of natural language
 

4567
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,270
of natural language
explanations and just say hey um you

4568
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:03,280
explanations and just say hey um you
 

4569
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:03,510
explanations and just say hey um you
know

4570
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:03,520
know
 

4571
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,630
know
this is what this does right so i think

4572
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:06,640
this is what this does right so i think
 

4573
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,950
this is what this does right so i think
that many contracts are and even now in

4574
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:08,960
that many contracts are and even now in
 

4575
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,790
that many contracts are and even now in
decentralized finance and d5

4576
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:10,800
decentralized finance and d5
 

4577
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,070
decentralized finance and d5
and decentralized insurance they're

4578
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,080
and decentralized insurance they're
 

4579
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,790
and decentralized insurance they're
basically being rebuilt in this format

4580
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:14,800
basically being rebuilt in this format
 

4581
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,550
basically being rebuilt in this format
and and and that rebuilding will make

4582
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:16,560
and and and that rebuilding will make
 

4583
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,070
and and and that rebuilding will make
them clearer like you said

4584
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,080
them clearer like you said
 

4585
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,830
them clearer like you said
and then restating those in natural

4586
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:19,840
and then restating those in natural
 

4587
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,189
and then restating those in natural
language and explaining to people well

4588
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:21,199
language and explaining to people well
 

4589
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,709
language and explaining to people well
you know if the weather does this it'll

4590
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:22,719
you know if the weather does this it'll
 

4591
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,229
you know if the weather does this it'll
i think it'll actually be a lot simpler

4592
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
i think it'll actually be a lot simpler
 

4593
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:25,590
i think it'll actually be a lot simpler
to explain to people what the contract

4594
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:25,600
to explain to people what the contract
 

4595
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,590
to explain to people what the contract
is about

4596
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
is about
 

4597
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,110
is about
smart contracts it's a natural language

4598
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120
smart contracts it's a natural language
 

4599
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,630
smart contracts it's a natural language
i didn't even think about that so that's

4600
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:30,640
i didn't even think about that so that's
 

4601
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,430
i didn't even think about that so that's
that's

4602
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
that's
 

4603
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,709
that's
you're saying that's doable and natural

4604
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:34,719
you're saying that's doable and natural
 

4605
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:35,990
you're saying that's doable and natural
and easy to do

4606
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
and easy to do
 

4607
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,270
and easy to do
because there's so much clear right

4608
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:37,280
because there's so much clear right
 

4609
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,790
because there's so much clear right
there's there's that forced clarity that

4610
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:38,800
there's there's that forced clarity that
 

4611
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,910
there's there's that forced clarity that
you talked about

4612
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:39,920
you talked about
 

4613
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,310
you talked about
i think the second um aspect of this

4614
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:42,320
i think the second um aspect of this
 

4615
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,630
i think the second um aspect of this
problem is the nuance around

4616
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:44,640
problem is the nuance around
 

4617
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,510
problem is the nuance around
what contracts can be made unambiguous

4618
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,520
what contracts can be made unambiguous
 

4619
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,350
what contracts can be made unambiguous
and i think that comes down to

4620
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:49,360
and i think that comes down to
 

4621
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,030
and i think that comes down to
often comes down to proving what

4622
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
often comes down to proving what
 

4623
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,110
often comes down to proving what
happened which is where oracle networks

4624
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,120
happened which is where oracle networks
 

4625
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,550
happened which is where oracle networks
and decentralized oracle networks and

4626
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:54,560
and decentralized oracle networks and
 

4627
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,070
and decentralized oracle networks and
chain link would come in

4628
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:56,080
chain link would come in
 

4629
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,910
chain link would come in
and our experience there is you know

4630
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:57,920
and our experience there is you know
 

4631
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,510
and our experience there is you know
quite extensive over the many years that

4632
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
quite extensive over the many years that
 

4633
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,110
quite extensive over the many years that
we've worked on many different contract

4634
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:01,120
we've worked on many different contract
 

4635
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,229
we've worked on many different contract
types

4636
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:02,239
types
 

4637
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,790
types
i think what it fundamentally comes down

4638
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
i think what it fundamentally comes down
 

4639
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,510
i think what it fundamentally comes down
to

4640
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:05,520
to
 

4641
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,709
to
is whether there is data so we're not

4642
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:08,719
is whether there is data so we're not
 

4643
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,470
is whether there is data so we're not
going to be able to make a hybrid smart

4644
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
going to be able to make a hybrid smart
 

4645
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,350
going to be able to make a hybrid smart
contract

4646
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:11,360
contract
 

4647
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,790
contract
about whether somebody painted your

4648
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:12,800
about whether somebody painted your
 

4649
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,950
about whether somebody painted your
house the right color blue

4650
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:14,960
house the right color blue
 

4651
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,310
house the right color blue
we're just not going to be doing that

4652
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
we're just not going to be doing that
 

4653
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,229
we're just not going to be doing that
because there's no data feed that tells

4654
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:18,239
because there's no data feed that tells
 

4655
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:19,750
because there's no data feed that tells
us that your house was painted blue or

4656
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:19,760
us that your house was painted blue or
 

4657
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,070
us that your house was painted blue or
that it was the right color of blue

4658
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
that it was the right color of blue
 

4659
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,070
that it was the right color of blue
you know unless somebody sets up a drone

4660
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:24,080
you know unless somebody sets up a drone
 

4661
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,669
you know unless somebody sets up a drone
with a color analysis

4662
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:25,679
with a color analysis
 

4663
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,310
with a color analysis
tool and they generate that data which

4664
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,320
tool and they generate that data which
 

4665
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,910
tool and they generate that data which
by the way could be possible right

4666
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:29,920
by the way could be possible right
 

4667
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,270
by the way could be possible right
they could there could be if there's

4668
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:31,280
they could there could be if there's
 

4669
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,270
they could there could be if there's
enough demand then the service would be

4670
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
enough demand then the service would be
 

4671
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,430
enough demand then the service would be
created that has drones flying around

4672
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:35,440
created that has drones flying around
 

4673
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,590
created that has drones flying around
that's telling you about the colors of

4674
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:37,600
that's telling you about the colors of
 

4675
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,110
that's telling you about the colors of
you know all this kind of stuff so if

4676
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,120
you know all this kind of stuff so if
 

4677
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:39,590
you know all this kind of stuff so if
there's

4678
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
there's
 

4679
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,430
there's
actual demand that that would be created

4680
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,440
actual demand that that would be created
 

4681
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,590
actual demand that that would be created
and because because there'd be value to

4682
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:43,600
and because because there'd be value to
 

4683
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,030
and because because there'd be value to
connect that data feed to the smart

4684
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
connect that data feed to the smart
 

4685
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,229
connect that data feed to the smart
contracts and so on

4686
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:46,239
contracts and so on
 

4687
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:47,750
contracts and so on
i i think i think you have it

4688
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:47,760
i i think i think you have it
 

4689
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,430
i i think i think you have it
unbelievably right because there there

4690
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,440
unbelievably right because there there
 

4691
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,350
unbelievably right because there there
are already insurance companies that use

4692
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
are already insurance companies that use
 

4693
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,270
are already insurance companies that use
drones to monitor construction sites

4694
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
drones to monitor construction sites
 

4695
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,310
drones to monitor construction sites
from overhead

4696
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
from overhead
 

4697
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,229
from overhead
and see how many people are wearing hard

4698
01:15:56,229 --> 01:15:56,239
and see how many people are wearing hard
 

4699
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:57,990
and see how many people are wearing hard
hats yeah and if the percentage of

4700
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,000
hats yeah and if the percentage of
 

4701
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,189
hats yeah and if the percentage of
people wearing hard hats isn't

4702
01:15:59,189 --> 01:15:59,199
people wearing hard hats isn't
 

4703
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:00,550
people wearing hard hats isn't
sufficiently high

4704
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560
sufficiently high
 

4705
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,790
sufficiently high
then you know the policy is voided and

4706
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:02,800
then you know the policy is voided and
 

4707
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,990
then you know the policy is voided and
so in that case

4708
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:04,000
so in that case
 

4709
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,750
so in that case
there is a data source and that data

4710
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:05,760
there is a data source and that data
 

4711
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,350
there is a data source and that data
source can be put into a hybrid smart

4712
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:07,360
source can be put into a hybrid smart
 

4713
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,149
source can be put into a hybrid smart
contract

4714
01:16:08,149 --> 01:16:08,159
contract
 

4715
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,750
contract
so the limitation of hybrid smart

4716
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:09,760
so the limitation of hybrid smart
 

4717
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,709
so the limitation of hybrid smart
contracts is is there a data source or a

4718
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:12,719
contracts is is there a data source or a
 

4719
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,709
contracts is is there a data source or a
set of data sources to create definitive

4720
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:14,719
set of data sources to create definitive
 

4721
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,510
set of data sources to create definitive
truth

4722
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,520
truth
 

4723
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,350
truth
to settle the contract and eliminate

4724
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,360
to settle the contract and eliminate
 

4725
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,870
to settle the contract and eliminate
ambiguity

4726
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:18,880
ambiguity
 

4727
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,990
ambiguity
and then as you said i think as people

4728
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:22,000
and then as you said i think as people
 

4729
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,149
and then as you said i think as people
realize that smart contracts are a

4730
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
realize that smart contracts are a
 

4731
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,470
realize that smart contracts are a
format in which they can form agreement

4732
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:26,480
format in which they can form agreement
 

4733
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,709
format in which they can form agreement
about things like that insurance product

4734
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:28,719
about things like that insurance product
 

4735
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:29,910
about things like that insurance product
around you know how many people are

4736
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:29,920
around you know how many people are
 

4737
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,110
around you know how many people are
wearing hard hats

4738
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,120
wearing hard hats
 

4739
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,430
wearing hard hats
if i'm the construction site owner well

4740
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:33,440
if i'm the construction site owner well
 

4741
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,510
if i'm the construction site owner well
you know i would really like a guarantee

4742
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:35,520
you know i would really like a guarantee
 

4743
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,189
you know i would really like a guarantee
that your insurance policy is going to

4744
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,199
that your insurance policy is going to
 

4745
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,790
that your insurance policy is going to
pay me out

4746
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:38,800
pay me out
 

4747
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,229
pay me out
if everyone is wearing hard hats and

4748
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:42,239
if everyone is wearing hard hats and
 

4749
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:43,910
if everyone is wearing hard hats and
in that case there is demand for the

4750
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:43,920
in that case there is demand for the
 

4751
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,390
in that case there is demand for the
data and people will generate the data

4752
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
data and people will generate the data
 

4753
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,990
data and people will generate the data
and i actually think the insurance

4754
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
and i actually think the insurance
 

4755
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,750
and i actually think the insurance
industry is interestingly a precursor of

4756
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:49,760
industry is interestingly a precursor of
 

4757
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,510
industry is interestingly a precursor of
this because they're so data driven

4758
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:51,520
this because they're so data driven
 

4759
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,070
this because they're so data driven
you already see insurance companies

4760
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,080
you already see insurance companies
 

4761
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:54,870
you already see insurance companies
paying

4762
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
paying
 

4763
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,270
paying
iot companies to put data into their

4764
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:57,280
iot companies to put data into their
 

4765
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,030
iot companies to put data into their
customers infrastructure

4766
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
customers infrastructure
 

4767
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,430
customers infrastructure
at the cost of the insurance company to

4768
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:01,440
at the cost of the insurance company to
 

4769
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,950
at the cost of the insurance company to
generate the data that the insurance

4770
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
generate the data that the insurance
 

4771
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,709
generate the data that the insurance
company uses to make a policy for the

4772
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
company uses to make a policy for the
 

4773
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:05,669
company uses to make a policy for the
customer

4774
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:05,679
customer
 

4775
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,470
customer
so you basically already have people who

4776
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:08,480
so you basically already have people who
 

4777
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,110
so you basically already have people who
really

4778
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
really
 

4779
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,070
really
want to price data into their agreements

4780
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:12,080
want to price data into their agreements
 

4781
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,149
want to price data into their agreements
when they're sufficiently high value

4782
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:14,159
when they're sufficiently high value
 

4783
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:17,830
when they're sufficiently high value
paying for their own customers to get

4784
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
paying for their own customers to get
 

4785
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,470
paying for their own customers to get
data sensors into their infrastructure

4786
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:20,480
data sensors into their infrastructure
 

4787
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,270
data sensors into their infrastructure
and i think

4788
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:21,280
and i think
 

4789
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,510
and i think
as smart contracts become more of a

4790
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,520
as smart contracts become more of a
 

4791
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,550
as smart contracts become more of a

4792
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:24,560
requested
 

4793
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,950
requested
format or data-driven contracts become

4794
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:26,960
format or data-driven contracts become
 

4795
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,149
format or data-driven contracts become
more of a format

4796
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:28,159
more of a format
 

4797
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:31,510
more of a format
there will be a growing demand about

4798
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,520
there will be a growing demand about
 

4799
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,790
there will be a growing demand about
proving what happened

4800
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
proving what happened
 

4801
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,550
proving what happened
through data so it'll be motivating

4802
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:34,560
through data so it'll be motivating
 

4803
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,709
through data so it'll be motivating
totally new data fees being created

can have a smart contract
that holds the data and evaluates the

companies and the insurance company
 

4917
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,149
companies and the insurance company
knows that the smart contract will

01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:38,159
knows that the smart contract will
 

4919
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,390
knows that the smart contract will
evaluate it according to the policy

evaluate it according to the policy
they don't need the data and the and and

they don't need the data and the and and
 

4923
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,189
they don't need the data and the and and
the user can provide the data

4924
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:45,199
the user can provide the data
 

4925
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:46,709
the user can provide the data
knowing it'll never touch the insurance

4926
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
knowing it'll never touch the insurance
 

4927
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,229
knowing it'll never touch the insurance
company because it's only provided to

the smart contract
 

4931
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,750
the smart contract
and suddenly you've solved another trust

4932
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:51,760
and suddenly you've solved another trust
 

4933
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,750
and suddenly you've solved another trust
issue because an autonomous piece of

4941
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,550
the interests
of both of the counterparties and so

of both of the counterparties and so
 

4943
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,149
of both of the counterparties and so
this is the recurring theme i think

01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:02,159
this is the recurring theme i think
 

4945
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,910
this is the recurring theme i think
you're seeing this recurring theme where

4946
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:03,920
you're seeing this recurring theme where
 

4947
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,189
you're seeing this recurring theme where
there's a trust issue

there's a trust issue
people can't use the system they can't

the same pattern just recurs it's it's

the same pattern just recurs it's it's
 

4985

really the same pattern and
 

4987
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,310
really the same pattern and
and this is why i keep saying trust

4988
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,320
and this is why i keep saying trust
 

4989
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,669
and this is why i keep saying trust

where there is a piece of data to prove
 

4997
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,590
where there is a piece of data to prove
and settle the trust issue

4998
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:49,600
and settle the trust issue
 

4999
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,189
and settle the trust issue
in a way that works for both parties

5000

in a way that works for both parties

firms
 

5029
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,070
firms
where they would tell you hey i'm going

5030
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,080
where they would tell you hey i'm going
 

5031
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,070
where they would tell you hey i'm going
to raise your search engine ranking

give me the money and people wouldn't

5034
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:26,000
give me the money and people wouldn't
 

5035
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,430
give me the money and people wouldn't
want to give them the money because they

5036
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:27,440
want to give them the money because they
 

5037
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,149
want to give them the money because they
they never

5038
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:28,159
they never
 

5039
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:29,669
they never
knew if they were going to do it and

5040
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:29,679
knew if they were going to do it and
 

5041
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,030
knew if they were going to do it and
then the search engine firm doesn't want

5042
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:31,040
then the search engine firm doesn't want
 

5043
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,229
then the search engine firm doesn't want
to do any work thinking they'll never

5044
01:21:32,229 --> 01:21:32,239
to do any work thinking they'll never
 

5045
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,510
to do any work thinking they'll never
get any money

01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,750
get any money
so we just initially even came up with a

5048
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:35,760
so we just initially even came up with a
 

5049
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,270
so we just initially even came up with a
system where you could put bitcoin

5050
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:37,280
system where you could put bitcoin
 

5051
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,350
system where you could put bitcoin
into a smart contract and it would be

5052
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,360
into a smart contract and it would be
 

5053
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,390
into a smart contract and it would be
released

5054
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:40,400
released
 

5055
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,629
released
based on whether the search rank of a

5056
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
based on whether the search rank of a
 

5057
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:43,430
based on whether the search rank of a
website

5058
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:43,440
website
 

5059
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,110
website
got to a certain level on google for a

5060
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:45,120
got to a certain level on google for a
 

5061
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,950
got to a certain level on google for a
certain keyword right

5062
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:46,960
certain keyword right
 

5063
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,189
certain keyword right
and so the trust problem was solved but

5064
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:49,199
and so the trust problem was solved but
 

5065
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,950
and so the trust problem was solved but
it's just the same story right it's kind

5066
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:50,960
it's just the same story right it's kind
 

5067
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,790
it's just the same story right it's kind
of like trust issues around ai trust

5068
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800

5099
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,550

data
 

5103
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,910
data
in this interaction you talk about

5104
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:28,920
in this interaction you talk about
 

5105
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,709
in this interaction you talk about
confidentiality in the

5106
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:30,719
confidentiality in the
 

5107
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,830

5108
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:33,840

5109
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,830
in the white paper for chain link 2.0
can you talk more about how to achieve

5110
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:36,840
can you talk more about how to achieve
 

5111
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:37,990
can you talk more about how to achieve
confidentiality

5112
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:38,000
confidentiality
 

5113
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,830
confidentiality
in this process sure sure absolutely

5114
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:41,840
in this process sure sure absolutely
 

5115
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,390
in this process sure sure absolutely
um so i think you once again need to

5116
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:44,400
um so i think you once again need to
 

5117
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,310
um so i think you once again need to
think of the contract as existing in two

5118
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:46,320
think of the contract as existing in two
 

5119
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,229
think of the contract as existing in two
parts right you have the on-chain code

5120
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:48,239
parts right you have the on-chain code
 

5121
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:49,830
parts right you have the on-chain code
and then you have this off-chain system

5122
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:49,840
and then you have this off-chain system
 

5123
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,229
and then you have this off-chain system
called

5124
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:50,239
called
 

5125
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,950
called
the centralized oracle network so the

5126
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:52,960
the centralized oracle network so the
 

5127
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,709
the centralized oracle network so the
question is really

5128
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:54,719
question is really
 

5129
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,270
question is really
what portion of the contract should live

5130
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:57,280
what portion of the contract should live
 

5131
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,149
what portion of the contract should live
in what part

5132
01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:58,159
in what part
 

5133
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,270
in what part
of these two systems right so

5134
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,280
of these two systems right so
 

5135
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,910
of these two systems right so
if you want to create transparency you

5136
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:03,920
if you want to create transparency you
 

5137
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,629
if you want to create transparency you
should put

5138
01:23:04,629 --> 01:23:04,639
should put
 

5139
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:07,430
should put
more information on chain because that's

5140
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:07,440
more information on chain because that's
 

5141
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,189
more information on chain because that's
what blockchains are very good at

5142
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:09,199
what blockchains are very good at
 

5143
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:12,550
what blockchains are very good at
they're public transparent but they

5144
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:12,560
they're public transparent but they
 

5145
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,870
they're public transparent but they
don't necessarily have privacy

5146
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
don't necessarily have privacy
 

5147
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,390
don't necessarily have privacy
well those you can see how those two

5148
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:16,400
well those you can see how those two
 

5149
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,470
well those you can see how those two
things are a little bit kind of

5150
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:18,480
things are a little bit kind of
 

5151
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,470
things are a little bit kind of
completely uh diametrically opposed

5152
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:20,480
completely uh diametrically opposed
 

5153
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,470
completely uh diametrically opposed
right yes so i i do

5154
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:22,480
right yes so i i do
 

5155
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,229
right yes so i i do
i do think and i do see blockchains

5156
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:24,239
i do think and i do see blockchains
 

5157
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:25,510
i do think and i do see blockchains
working on

5158
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:25,520
working on
 

5159
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,709
working on
on-chain encrypted smart contracts

5160
01:23:28,709 --> 01:23:28,719
on-chain encrypted smart contracts
 

5161
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,629
on-chain encrypted smart contracts
that's very inefficient it has a lot of

5162
01:23:30,629 --> 01:23:30,639
that's very inefficient it has a lot of
 

5163
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,950
that's very inefficient it has a lot of
um nuances around it

5164
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:32,960
um nuances around it
 

5165
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,110
um nuances around it
that i think will appear at some point i

5166
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:35,120
that i think will appear at some point i

01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:40,239
you have an option of taking a part of
 

5171
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:41,510
you have an option of taking a part of
the computation

5172

we actually did an entire paper about

5178
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:46,800
we actually did an entire paper about
 

5179
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,110
we actually did an entire paper about
this that we presented at stanford

5180

this that we presented at stanford
 

5181
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,310
this that we presented at stanford
in february of last year uh something

5182
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
in february of last year uh something
 

5183
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,350
in february of last year uh something
called mixicles

5184
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:53,360
called mixicles
 

5185
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,270
called mixicles
which basically talks about how you can

5186
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:55,280
which basically talks about how you can
 

5187
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,790
which basically talks about how you can
take an oracle network

5188
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:56,800
take an oracle network
 

5189
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,470
take an oracle network
and you can put a portion of the

5190
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
and you can put a portion of the
 

5191
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,950

and
 

5201
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,790
and
you can actually provide additional

01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,149
that you that all those nodes are forced
to run so they won't even know what

and so at the end of the day if you look

5214
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:20,080
and so at the end of the day if you look
 

5215
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,990
and so at the end of the day if you look
at a hybrid smart contract

in the decentralized oracle network
because

5234
01:24:37,669 --> 01:24:37,679
because
 

5235
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,870
because
you can control the set of nodes you can

5236
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:40,880
you can control the set of nodes you can
 

5237
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,709
you can control the set of nodes you can
control the committee of nodes

5238
01:24:42,709 --> 01:24:42,719
control the committee of nodes
 

5239
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,790
control the committee of nodes
and you can require that they run

5240
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:44,800
and you can require that they run
 

5241
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,910
and you can require that they run
certain hardware

5242
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:45,920
certain hardware
 

5243
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,310
certain hardware
to keep the information private right so

5244
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:48,320
to keep the information private right so
 

5245
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,830
to keep the information private right so
you could basically make a derivative

5246
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:49,840
you could basically make a derivative
 

5247
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,390
you could basically make a derivative
that

5248
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,400
that
 

5249
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,149
that
um or a binary option is the example

5250
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:52,159
um or a binary option is the example
 

5251
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,990
um or a binary option is the example
used in in the mix paper

5252
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,000
used in in the mix paper
 

5253
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,110
used in in the mix paper
where the payout happened on chain

5254
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:57,120
where the payout happened on chain
 

5255
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,590
where the payout happened on chain
but it was actually impossible to tell

5256
01:24:59,590 --> 01:24:59,600
but it was actually impossible to tell
 

5257
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,310
but it was actually impossible to tell
what the outcome of the contract was

5258
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:02,320
what the outcome of the contract was
 

5259
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,229
what the outcome of the contract was
so the the outcome of the contract was

5260
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:04,239
so the the outcome of the contract was
 

5261
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,750
so the the outcome of the contract was
computed in the centralized oracle

5262
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:05,760
computed in the centralized oracle
 

5263
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,470
computed in the centralized oracle

and then there was a switch that that

5266
01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:08,159
and then there was a switch that that
 

5267
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,310
and then there was a switch that that
triggered who received the payment

5268
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:10,320
triggered who received the payment
 

5269
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,950
triggered who received the payment

01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,110
couldn't backward engineer what that was
but the users of that hybrid smart

5295
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,310

a certain outcome right determined a

01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,320
a certain outcome right determined a
 

5297
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,430
a certain outcome right determined a
certain outcome

5298
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:39,440
certain outcome
 

5299
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,990
certain outcome
that the relevant user would get paid

01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,000
that the relevant user would get paid
 

5301
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,470
that the relevant user would get paid
and

5302
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:42,480
and
 

5303
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,790
and
there was still a place to put value

5304
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:44,800
there was still a place to put value
 

5305
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,510
there was still a place to put value
right

5306
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:45,520
right
 

5307
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,750
right
so there there is this kind of

5308
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:47,760
so there there is this kind of
 

5309
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,189
so there there is this kind of
fundamental tension

5310
01:25:49,189 --> 01:25:49,199
fundamental tension
 

5311
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:52,470
fundamental tension
between confidentiality privacy which is

5312
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,480
between confidentiality privacy which is
 

5313
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,990
between confidentiality privacy which is
very important for many contracts

5314
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:54,000
very important for many contracts
 

5315
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,310
very important for many contracts
which is critical to many contracts and

5316
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:56,320
which is critical to many contracts and
 

5317
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,070
which is critical to many contracts and
the public and transparent nature of

5318
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,080
the public and transparent nature of
 

5319
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,430
the public and transparent nature of
blockchains

5320
01:25:59,430 --> 01:25:59,440
blockchains
 

5321
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,750
blockchains
which i think eventually will be solved

5322
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:01,760
which i think eventually will be solved
 

5323
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,270
which i think eventually will be solved
through encrypted on-chain smart

5324
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:03,280
through encrypted on-chain smart
 

5325
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,550
through encrypted on-chain smart
contracts

5326
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,560
contracts
 

5327
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,229
contracts
that'll take some time i think that'll

5328
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:06,239
that'll take some time i think that'll
 

5329
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,070
that'll take some time i think that'll
take years in my opinion

5330
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:08,080
take years in my opinion
 

5331
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,110
take years in my opinion
and before we arrive there i think

5332
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
and before we arrive there i think
 

5333
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,070
and before we arrive there i think
people will put

5334
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:12,080
people will put
 

5335
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,750
people will put
the private portion into the centralized

5336
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:13,760
the private portion into the centralized
 

5337
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,110
the private portion into the centralized
oracle network

5338
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,120
oracle network
 

5339
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,709
oracle network
once again going back to what the

5340
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:16,719
once again going back to what the
 

5341
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:19,030
once again going back to what the
decentralized oracle networks do

5342
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:19,040
decentralized oracle networks do
 

5343
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,270
decentralized oracle networks do
they seek to provide these services

5344
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:21,280
they seek to provide these services
 

5345
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,030
they seek to provide these services
right so the ability to do

5346
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,040
right so the ability to do
 

5347
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,350
right so the ability to do
a privacy preserving computation is

5348
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:25,360
a privacy preserving computation is
 

5349
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,950
a privacy preserving computation is
perhaps a service

5350
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:26,960
perhaps a service
 

5351
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,350
perhaps a service
without which a certain type of contract

5352
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:29,360
without which a certain type of contract
 

5353
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,350
without which a certain type of contract
might never come into existence

5354
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:31,360
might never come into existence
 

5355
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,270
might never come into existence
in the form of an on-chain hybrid smart

5356
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:33,280
in the form of an on-chain hybrid smart
 

5357
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,390
in the form of an on-chain hybrid smart
contract

5358
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:34,400
contract
 

5359
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,709
contract
and so this is once again what we see

5360
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:36,719
and so this is once again what we see
 

5361
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,149
and so this is once again what we see
the centralized oracle networks and

5362
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:38,159
the centralized oracle networks and
 

5363
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,910
the centralized oracle networks and
decentralized services doing

5364
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:39,920
decentralized services doing
 

5365
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,669
decentralized services doing
is providing people these tools and

5366
01:26:41,669 --> 01:26:41,679
is providing people these tools and
 

5367
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,030
is providing people these tools and
building blocks

01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:47,840
at making these derivatives contracts
 

5373
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,910
at making these derivatives contracts
but i can't make them until unless i can

provide that capability people create
 

5391

01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,950
is
it was really tough to do e-commerce

5400
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:10,960
it was really tough to do e-commerce
 

5401
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,030
it was really tough to do e-commerce
while everything was in http

5402
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:13,040
while everything was in http
 

5403
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,629
while everything was in http
and credit cards were transmitted

5404
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:14,639
and credit cards were transmitted
 

5405
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,790
and credit cards were transmitted
publicly and so e-commerce was kind of

5406
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:16,800
publicly and so e-commerce was kind of
 

5407
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:17,990
publicly and so e-commerce was kind of
tough because how am i going to send my

5408
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,000
tough because how am i going to send my
 

5409
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,709
tough because how am i going to send my
credit card

5410
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
credit card
 

5411
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,189
credit card
over public unencrypted channels right

5412
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:21,199
over public unencrypted channels right
 

5413
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,110
over public unencrypted channels right
but the second https appears

5414
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:23,120
but the second https appears
 

5415
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,110
but the second https appears
e-commerce becomes a lot easier because

5416
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:25,120
e-commerce becomes a lot easier because
 

5417
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,870
e-commerce becomes a lot easier because
i can put in my credit card number and

5418
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:26,880
i can put in my credit card number and
 

5419
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,030
i can put in my credit card number and
it can be sent over an encrypted channel

5420
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:29,040
it can be sent over an encrypted channel
 

5421
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,709
it can be sent over an encrypted channel
and you know it's not at risk and so i

5422
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:30,719
and you know it's not at risk and so i
 

5423
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,149
and you know it's not at risk and so i
can participate in e-commerce as long as

5424
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:32,159
can participate in e-commerce as long as
 

5425
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,510
can participate in e-commerce as long as
i have a credit card

5426
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:33,520
i have a credit card
 

5427
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,910
i have a credit card
i i think those types and i'm sure that

5428
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:35,920
i i think those types and i'm sure that
 

5429
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,510
i i think those types and i'm sure that
was unexpected right i'm sure at the

5430
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,520
was unexpected right i'm sure at the
 

5431
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,790
was unexpected right i'm sure at the
time that was an

5432
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:38,800
time that was an
 

5433
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,709
time that was an
unexpected outcome from from that

5434
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:40,719
unexpected outcome from from that
 

5435
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:41,830

and so i think this is why we sometimes

5438
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:44,560
and so i think this is why we sometimes
 

5439
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,310
and so i think this is why we sometimes
have this focus on privacy

5440
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:46,320
have this focus on privacy
 

5441
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,550
have this focus on privacy
because in our work with contracts and

5442
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:48,560
because in our work with contracts and
 

5443
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,149

01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:57,520
don't want you to analyze it for or
 

5697
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,590
don't want you to analyze it for or
you could make conditions that the data

5698
01:31:59,590 --> 01:31:59,600
you could make conditions that the data
 

5699
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,350
you could make conditions that the data

01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,080
and and once again you haven't leaked
 

5705
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,750
and and once again you haven't leaked

01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:12,550
another type of trust issue that did all
of this solve so

5714
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:12,560
of this solve so
 

5715
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,709
of this solve so
it's it's the same pattern if you work

5716
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:14,719
it's it's the same pattern if you work
 

5717
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,070
it's it's the same pattern if you work
in this industry long enough or if you

5718
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,080
in this industry long enough or if you
 

5719
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:16,870
in this industry long enough or if you
really look at

5720
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:16,880
really look at
 

5721
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,550
really look at
these use cases long enough you'll

5722
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:18,560
these use cases long enough you'll
 

5723
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,990
these use cases long enough you'll
simply come to the question

5724
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:20,000
simply come to the question
 

5725
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,470
simply come to the question
and this is the useful question um what

5726
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:22,480
and this is the useful question um what
 

5727
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,709
and this is the useful question um what
is the trust issue this is solving

5728
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:24,719
is the trust issue this is solving
 

5729
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,390
is the trust issue this is solving
and then if you can get an answer to

5730
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:26,400
and then if you can get an answer to
 

5731
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,950
and then if you can get an answer to
that question on a case-by-case basis

5732
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:28,960
that question on a case-by-case basis
 

5733
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,030
that question on a case-by-case basis
that's when you'll understand why

5734
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:31,040
that's when you'll understand why
 

5735
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,470
that's when you'll understand why
blockchains are relevant

5736
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:32,480
blockchains are relevant
 

5737
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,830
blockchains are relevant
and then once you do that with enough

5738
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
and then once you do that with enough
 

5739
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,070
and then once you do that with enough
use cases it becomes

5740
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:36,080
use cases it becomes
 

5741
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,030
use cases it becomes
you know it becomes a little bit

5742
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:37,040
you know it becomes a little bit
 

5743
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,270
you know it becomes a little bit
mind-blowing you've mentioned

5744
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:39,280
mind-blowing you've mentioned
 

5745
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:42,470
mind-blowing you've mentioned
trust quite a bit

5746
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:42,480

 

5747
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,830

uh you also mentioned trust minimization

5748
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:45,840
uh you also mentioned trust minimization
 

5749
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,430
uh you also mentioned trust minimization
in the chain link white paper can we dig

5750
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:49,440
in the chain link white paper can we dig
 

5751
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,990
in the chain link white paper can we dig
into trust a little bit more

5752
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:52,000
into trust a little bit more
 

5753
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,990
into trust a little bit more
what is the nature of trust that you

5754
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:54,000
what is the nature of trust that you
 

5755
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,070
what is the nature of trust that you
think about any smart contracts

5756
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:56,080
think about any smart contracts
 

5757
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,470
think about any smart contracts
what is trust minimization how do we

5758
01:32:58,470 --> 01:32:58,480
what is trust minimization how do we
 

5759
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,350
what is trust minimization how do we
accomplish

5760
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
accomplish
 

5761
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:02,790
accomplish
achieve trust minimization sure sure

5762
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:02,800
achieve trust minimization sure sure
 

5763
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,030
achieve trust minimization sure sure
i i think it's important maybe to have a

5764
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:05,040
i i think it's important maybe to have a
 

5765
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:05,830
i i think it's important maybe to have a
conception of

5766
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:05,840
conception of
 

5767
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,870
conception of
of what the alternative is right what is

5768
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:08,880
of what the alternative is right what is
 

5769
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,189
of what the alternative is right what is
highly reliable trust minimized off

5770
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:11,199
highly reliable trust minimized off
 

5771
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:12,790
highly reliable trust minimized off
chain and on-chain computation and

5772
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:12,800
chain and on-chain computation and

why don't i give them my my money why

5812
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:47,760
why don't i give them my my money why
 

5813
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,270
why don't i give them my my money why
don't i i interact with them on the

5814
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:49,280
don't i i interact with them on the
 

5815
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,669
don't i i interact with them on the
basis of any kind of agreement

basis of any kind of agreement
 

5817
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:53,669
basis of any kind of agreement
and that's good and that that is

5818
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:53,679
and that's good and that that is
 

5819
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:55,510
and that's good and that that is
definitely better than that not being

5820
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:55,520
definitely better than that not being
 

5821
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:55,990
definitely better than that not being
there

5822
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
there
 

5823
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,430
there
and that is definitely a huge

5824
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:57,440
and that is definitely a huge
 

5825
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,110
and that is definitely a huge
improvement for how people you know

5826
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
improvement for how people you know
 

5827
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,709
improvement for how people you know
conduct commerce you know letters of

from from branded um entities are very

5832
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:04,400
from from branded um entities are very
 

5833
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,629
from from branded um entities are very
important for global trade to take place

5834
01:34:06,629 --> 01:34:06,639
important for global trade to take place
 

5835
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,270
important for global trade to take place
in in the early stages of global trade

5836
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
in in the early stages of global trade
 

5837
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:09,910
in in the early stages of global trade
so

5838
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:09,920
so
 

5839
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,590
so
that's good but it is fundamentally just

5840
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:13,600
that's good but it is fundamentally just
 

5841
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,629
that's good but it is fundamentally just
a paper agreement

5842
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:14,639
a paper agreement
 

5843
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,830
a paper agreement
with a legal framework behind it and if

5844
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:17,840
with a legal framework behind it and if
 

5845
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:18,390
with a legal framework behind it and if
the

5846
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:18,400
the
 

5847
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,990
the
paper agreement you have would say

5848
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:20,000
paper agreement you have would say
 

5849
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,149
paper agreement you have would say
robinhood or somebody else suddenly has

to change
 

5853
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,669
to change
well it changes and you can't really do

5854
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
well it changes and you can't really do
 

5855
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,350
well it changes and you can't really do
anything about it you won't be able

5856
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
anything about it you won't be able
 

5857
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,950
anything about it you won't be able
to change anything about what happened

5858
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:28,960
to change anything about what happened
 

5859
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,709
to change anything about what happened
there there's some long term

5860

around all this stuff
 

5865
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,870
around all this stuff
at the end of the day um that's the

5866
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:36,880
at the end of the day um that's the
 

5867
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,229
at the end of the day um that's the
brand based and paper guarantee world

you're kind of hoping for the best
 

5873
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,750
you're kind of hoping for the best
because there's a nice logo it's been

01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:52,960
this is this is why banks have such nice
 

5883
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,310
this is this is why banks have such nice
buildings right it's not because they

5884
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320
buildings right it's not because they
 

5885
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,910
buildings right it's not because they
want to spend money on buildings

5886
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:55,920
want to spend money on buildings
 

5887
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,030
want to spend money on buildings
it's to create confidence in in them as

5888
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,040
it's to create confidence in in them as
 

5889
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,790
it's to create confidence in in them as
an entity in order for people to

01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,990
has one bitcoin right
so that's one degree of validation it

6048
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:32,000
so that's one degree of validation it
 

6049
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,750
so that's one degree of validation it
has certain cryptographic primitives

6050
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:33,760
has certain cryptographic primitives
 

6051
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,430
has certain cryptographic primitives
that are used certain levels of

6052
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:35,440
that are used certain levels of
 

6053
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,109
that are used certain levels of
cryptography encryption and other and

6054
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:37,119
cryptography encryption and other and
 

6055
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:38,950
cryptography encryption and other and
other methods that basically provide

01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:38,960
other methods that basically provide
 

6057
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,390
other methods that basically provide
um clarity and and those guarantees

6058
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
um clarity and and those guarantees
 

6059
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,990
um clarity and and those guarantees
but fundamentally it's this level of

6060
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:44,000
but fundamentally it's this level of
 

6061
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,430
but fundamentally it's this level of
consensus that multiple

6062
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:45,440
consensus that multiple
 

6063
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,470
consensus that multiple
independent computing systems came to

6064
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:48,480
independent computing systems came to
 

6065
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,910
independent computing systems came to
the same conclusion

6066
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:49,920
the same conclusion
 

6067
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,830
the same conclusion
verified that conclusion and created a

6068
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:51,840
verified that conclusion and created a
 

6069
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,350
verified that conclusion and created a
sense of finality

6070
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:53,360
sense of finality
 

6071
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,310
sense of finality
created a final state that is globally

6072
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:56,320
created a final state that is globally
 

6073
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,270
created a final state that is globally
considered to be

6074
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:57,280
considered to be
 

6075
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,790
considered to be
the state of a transaction

6076
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:00,800
the state of a transaction
 

6077
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,910
the state of a transaction
and that is how it's achieved right so

6078
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:03,920
and that is how it's achieved right so
 

6079
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,270
and that is how it's achieved right so
it's achieved by

6080
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:05,280
it's achieved by
 

6081
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,550
it's achieved by
users looking at these mathematical

6082
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:08,560
users looking at these mathematical
 

6083

01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,189
there's one single person who controls
that money that's the bank

6092
01:38:17,189 --> 01:38:17,199
that money that's the bank
 

6093
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:18,629
that money that's the bank
they could choose to give me my money or

6094
01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:18,639
they could choose to give me my money or
 

6095
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:20,709
they could choose to give me my money or
choose not to give me my money

choose not to give me my money
 

6097
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,470
choose not to give me my money
and that's great but maybe there's a

6098
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:22,480
and that's great but maybe there's a
 

6099

contract right because once again
 

6177
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,910

that event is what determines what

that event is what determines what
 

6179
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,270
that event is what determines what
happens with the contract

happens with the contract
 

6181
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,030
happens with the contract
and if the contract is super well

6182
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:43,040
and if the contract is super well
 

6183
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,189
and if the contract is super well
written it doesn't matter if the event

6184
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:45,199
written it doesn't matter if the event
 

6185
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:46,149

it's also settled a million of these and

it's also settled a million of these and
so

about that

01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,310
about that
and it's it's not something that's very

like i think we will i think what will
 

6347
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,030
like i think we will i think what will
happen with the banks and all the

6348
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:31,040
happen with the banks and all the
 

6349
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,390
happen with the banks and all the
insurance companies by the way

6350
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:32,400
insurance companies by the way
 

6351
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,070
insurance companies by the way
is not that they'll just die or

6352
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:34,080
is not that they'll just die or
 

6353
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,669
is not that they'll just die or
something i think it'll be just like the

6354
01:42:35,669 --> 01:42:35,679
something i think it'll be just like the
 

6355
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:36,390
something i think it'll be just like the
internet

6356
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:36,400
internet
 

6357
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,229
internet
there'll be some of them that adopt this

6358
01:42:38,229 --> 01:42:38,239
there'll be some of them that adopt this
 

6359
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:39,990
there'll be some of them that adopt this
yeah and some of them that don't

6360
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:40,000
yeah and some of them that don't
 

6361
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,430
yeah and some of them that don't
and some of them to do it faster some of

6362
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:41,440
and some of them to do it faster some of
 

6363
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,430
and some of them to do it faster some of
them to do it slower and and that's an

6364
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:43,440
them to do it slower and and that's an
 

6365
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,270
them to do it slower and and that's an
economic decision that they'll make

6366
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:45,280
economic decision that they'll make
 

6367
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,189
economic decision that they'll make
i think their whole question is is this

6368
01:42:47,189 --> 01:42:47,199
i think their whole question is is this
 

6369
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:48,790
i think their whole question is is this
a foregone conclusion

6370
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:48,800
a foregone conclusion
 

6371
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,310
a foregone conclusion

my uh industry uh but i'm seeing

6382
01:42:59,350 --> 01:42:59,360
my uh industry uh but i'm seeing
 

6383
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:02,070
my uh industry uh but i'm seeing
a definite shift in in people's

and i think that shift is gonna

6388
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:04,560
and i think that shift is gonna
 

6389
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,189
and i think that shift is gonna
accelerate rapidly as one or two of them

is questionable to me i just look at
 

6433
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,790
is questionable to me i just look at
basic uh

that hasn't
 

6559
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:07,510
that hasn't
been the case yet but my my thinking is

6644
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:22,960
um i understand that that idea
 

6645
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,910
um i understand that that idea
but um i think the the problem with that

6646
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:25,920
but um i think the the problem with that
 

6647
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,669
but um i think the the problem with that
is sometimes it requires

6648

6651
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,070
it requires this myopic focus right and
and that's what all the innovation stuff

6652

and that's what all the innovation stuff
 

6653
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,669

okay that could be worth whatever you
 

6853
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:04,870
okay that could be worth whatever you
know sixty thousand six hundred thousand

6854
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:04,880
know sixty thousand six hundred thousand
 

6855
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,589
know sixty thousand six hundred thousand
great question right there are other

6856
01:51:07,589 --> 01:51:07,599
great question right there are other
 

6857
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:09,189
great question right there are other
versions of the world right where people

6858
01:51:09,189 --> 01:51:09,199
versions of the world right where people
 

6859
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:09,910
versions of the world right where people
say

6860
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:09,920
say
 

6861
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,030
say
you know um there are countries that

6862
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:13,040
you know um there are countries that
 

6863
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,550
you know um there are countries that
don't have a good fiat currency

6864
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:14,560
don't have a good fiat currency
 

6865
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,950
don't have a good fiat currency
and i see a lot of people using bitcoin

6866
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:16,960
and i see a lot of people using bitcoin
 

6867
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:17,910
and i see a lot of people using bitcoin
so bitcoin

6868
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:17,920
so bitcoin
 

6869
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,070
so bitcoin
isn't internet money it's um

6870
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,080
isn't internet money it's um
 

6871
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,070
isn't internet money it's um
countries without a good currency money

6872
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:24,080
countries without a good currency money
 

6873
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:25,270
countries without a good currency money
so all the countries without a good

6874
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:25,280
so all the countries without a good
 

6875
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,430
so all the countries without a good
currency not now use uh bitcoin

6876
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:27,440
currency not now use uh bitcoin
 

6877
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:30,870
currency not now use uh bitcoin
and you know let there be bitcoin as

6878
01:51:30,870 --> 01:51:30,880
and you know let there be bitcoin as
 

6879
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:33,189
and you know let there be bitcoin as
this right as this conception of bitcoin

6880
01:51:33,189 --> 01:51:33,199
this right as this conception of bitcoin
 

6881
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:34,629
this right as this conception of bitcoin
what's the value of that

6882
01:51:34,629 --> 01:51:34,639
what's the value of that
 

6883
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:35,990
what's the value of that
i don't know that's a great question

6884
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:36,000
i don't know that's a great question
 

6885
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,149
i don't know that's a great question
probably probably a huge amount of value

6886
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:38,159
probably probably a huge amount of value
 

6887
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:40,870
probably probably a huge amount of value
um then there's then there's a further

6888
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:40,880
um then there's then there's a further
 

6889
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,149
um then there's then there's a further
conception of

6890
01:51:42,149 --> 01:51:42,159
conception of
 

6891
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:44,950
conception of
bitcoin has some you know digital gold

6892
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:44,960
bitcoin has some you know digital gold
 

6893
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,550
bitcoin has some you know digital gold
there's a scarcity dynamic

6894
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:46,560
there's a scarcity dynamic
 

6895
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,310
there's a scarcity dynamic
there's there's all these other kinds of

there's there's all these other kinds of
 

6897
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,589
there's there's all these other kinds of
dynamics

6898
01:51:49,589 --> 01:51:49,599
dynamics
 

6899
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:51,910
dynamics
what is a portable version of digital

6900
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:51,920
what is a portable version of digital
 

6901
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:52,629
what is a portable version of digital
gold

6902
01:51:52,629 --> 01:51:52,639
gold

with some kind of built-in um
 

6905
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:59,350
with some kind of built-in um
built-in scarcity worth you know kind of

artificially created
 

6909
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:03,750
artificially created
scarcity um what's that worth

6910
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:03,760
scarcity um what's that worth
 

6911
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,589
scarcity um what's that worth
i don't know that's that's a great

6912
01:52:05,589 --> 01:52:05,599
i don't know that's that's a great
 

6913
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,830
i don't know that's that's a great
question i haven't done the analysis on

6914
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:07,840
question i haven't done the analysis on
 

6915
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:08,790
question i haven't done the analysis on
that is the point

6916
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:08,800
that is the point
 

6917
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,669
that is the point
might be worth a lot what is it all

6918
01:52:11,669 --> 01:52:11,679
might be worth a lot what is it all
 

6919
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:14,149
might be worth a lot what is it all
worth if all three of these things

6920
01:52:14,149 --> 01:52:14,159
worth if all three of these things
 

6921
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:17,350
worth if all three of these things
you know flow into the same fiat um kind

6922
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:17,360
you know flow into the same fiat um kind
 

6923
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:17,750
you know flow into the same fiat um kind
of

6924
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:17,760
of
 

6925
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:19,669
of
let there be bitcoin as these three

6926
01:52:19,669 --> 01:52:19,679
let there be bitcoin as these three
 

6927
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:22,709
let there be bitcoin as these three
things conception of bitcoin

6928
01:52:22,709 --> 01:52:22,719
things conception of bitcoin
 

6929
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:23,750
things conception of bitcoin
i don't know what that's worth i also

6930
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:23,760
i don't know what that's worth i also
 

6931
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,270
i don't know what that's worth i also
don't know what that's worth but could

6932
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:25,280
don't know what that's worth but could
 

6933
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:26,709
don't know what that's worth but could
be worth a huge amount

6934
01:52:26,709 --> 01:52:26,719
be worth a huge amount
 

6935
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:29,189
be worth a huge amount
so i i think it's it's not i don't think

6936
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
so i i think it's it's not i don't think
 

6937
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:30,550
so i i think it's it's not i don't think
it's i personally don't think it's super

6938
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:30,560
it's i personally don't think it's super
 

6939
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,229
it's i personally don't think it's super
important what i think it's worth

6940
01:52:32,229 --> 01:52:32,239
important what i think it's worth
 

6941
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:34,070
important what i think it's worth
or what many other people think it's

6942
01:52:34,070 --> 01:52:34,080
or what many other people think it's
 

6943
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,430
or what many other people think it's
worth i don't think that's that's really

01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:35,440
worth i don't think that's that's really
 

6945
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,390

that important

6946
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:36,400
that important
 

6947
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,390
that important
i think what's probably important is

6948
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:38,400
i think what's probably important is
 

6949
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,149
i think what's probably important is
understanding

6950
01:52:40,149 --> 01:52:40,159
understanding
 

6951
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:44,390
understanding
what the societal conception of bitcoin

6952
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:44,400
what the societal conception of bitcoin
 

6953
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,589
what the societal conception of bitcoin
is

6954
01:52:45,589 --> 01:52:45,599
is
 

6955
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:47,830
is
and how does that societal conception

6956
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:47,840
and how does that societal conception
 

6957
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,470
and how does that societal conception
evolve over time

6958
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:50,480
evolve over time
 

6959
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,310
evolve over time
and that interestingly enough doesn't

6960
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:52,320
and that interestingly enough doesn't
 

6961
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:53,990
and that interestingly enough doesn't
just depend on

6962
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,000
just depend on
 

6963
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,629
just depend on
um you know you or me or the people who

6964
01:52:56,629 --> 01:52:56,639
um you know you or me or the people who
 

6965
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:57,990
um you know you or me or the people who
made bitcoin or anything else

6966
01:52:57,990 --> 01:52:58,000
made bitcoin or anything else
 

6967
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,790
made bitcoin or anything else
it actually depends on current events so

6968
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:00,800
it actually depends on current events so
 

6969
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,709
it actually depends on current events so
for example if people suddenly say

6970
01:53:02,709 --> 01:53:02,719
for example if people suddenly say
 

6971
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:04,950
for example if people suddenly say
i i'm more and more worried about fiat

6972
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:04,960
i i'm more and more worried about fiat
 

6973
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:05,910

currency
 

6975
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,669
currency
i'm more and more worried that

6976
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:07,679
i'm more and more worried that
 

6977
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:09,350
i'm more and more worried that
governmental fiat

6978
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:09,360
governmental fiat
 

6979
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,830
governmental fiat
even if it's the most reliable version

6980
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:11,840
even if it's the most reliable version
 

6981
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:12,470
even if it's the most reliable version
of that

6982
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:12,480
of that
 

6983
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:15,510
of that
is not as good as i thought it was maybe

6984
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:15,520
is not as good as i thought it was maybe
 

6985
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,149
is not as good as i thought it was maybe
i should go on the paypal app and maybe

6986
01:53:18,149 --> 01:53:18,159
i should go on the paypal app and maybe
 

6987
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:19,430
i should go on the paypal app and maybe
i should get some bitcoin

6988
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:19,440
i should get some bitcoin
 

6989
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:23,030
i should get some bitcoin
just in case what's the world

6990
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,040
just in case what's the world
 

6991
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,830
just in case what's the world
where bitcoin is a certain percentage of

6992
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:25,840
where bitcoin is a certain percentage of
 

6993
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,950

not being so good haven't done the

7000
01:53:33,270 --> 01:53:33,280
not being so good haven't done the
 

7001
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:34,070
not being so good haven't done the
analysis but

7002
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:34,080
analysis but
 

7003
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,589
analysis but
another example right here's this

7004
01:53:35,589 --> 01:53:35,599
another example right here's this
 

7005
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:37,350
another example right here's this
conception that's

7006
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:37,360
conception that's
 

7007
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,189
conception that's
that's the conception so when i look at

7008
01:53:39,189 --> 01:53:39,199
that's the conception so when i look at
 

7009
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:41,589
that's the conception so when i look at
bitcoin what i see is a lot of these

7010
01:53:41,589 --> 01:53:41,599
bitcoin what i see is a lot of these
 

7011
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:44,550
bitcoin what i see is a lot of these
fascinating conceptions of of what the

way all of them could be true
 

7019
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:51,990
way all of them could be true
um maybe some of them are true maybe

7020
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:52,000
um maybe some of them are true maybe
 

7021
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,270

and and the fascinating thing is is that
 

7025
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:56,790
and and the fascinating thing is is that
i've seen this conception change right

7026
01:53:56,790 --> 01:53:56,800
i've seen this conception change right
 

7027
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:57,990
i've seen this conception change right
so when i started

7028
01:53:57,990 --> 01:53:58,000
so when i started
 

7029
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,310
so when i started
in the bitcoin space the conception was

7030
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:00,320
in the bitcoin space the conception was
 

7031
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,830
in the bitcoin space the conception was
micro payments

7032
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:01,840
micro payments
 

7033
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,990
micro payments
the the the cost of bitcoin is low we'll

7034
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:04,000
the the the cost of bitcoin is low we'll
 

7035
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,270
the the the cost of bitcoin is low we'll
have micro payments

uh transactions micro payments are

7042
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:10,320
uh transactions micro payments are
 

7043
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,310
uh transactions micro payments are
wonderful in the emerging market

7044
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:12,320
wonderful in the emerging market
 

7045
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,149
wonderful in the emerging market
and that's fine right and and that was

7046
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:14,159
and that's fine right and and that was
 

7047
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:15,990
and that's fine right and and that was
one conception of bitcoin as

7048
01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:16,000
one conception of bitcoin as
 

7049
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,070
one conception of bitcoin as
let there be bitcoin as micro payments

7050
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:18,080
let there be bitcoin as micro payments
 

7051
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,510
let there be bitcoin as micro payments
platform right

7052
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:19,520
platform right
 

7053
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,350
platform right
but then the value rose and things

7054
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:21,360
but then the value rose and things
 

7055
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,950
but then the value rose and things
changed there was enough expansion in

7056
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:22,960
changed there was enough expansion in
 

7057
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:23,910
changed there was enough expansion in
certain ways

7058
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:23,920
certain ways
 

7059
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,550
certain ways
and and now the conception has evolved

7060
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:26,560
and and now the conception has evolved
 

7061
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,390
and and now the conception has evolved
into this other conception

7062
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:28,400
into this other conception
 

7063
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:31,030
into this other conception
but but at the end of the day um i think

7064
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,040
but but at the end of the day um i think
 

7065
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,750
but but at the end of the day um i think

worth this
for these these reasons bitcoin doesn't

7078

for these these reasons bitcoin doesn't
have that bitcoin doesn't have

and so it's what what that hole creates
 

7103
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,189
and so it's what what that hole creates
is a is a hole that we all fill right we

is a is a hole that we all fill right we
all basically come to some vague

7106

just in case um you know
 

7135
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:47,510
just in case um you know
what what are those numbers i mean if

7136
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:47,520
what what are those numbers i mean if
 

7137
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,629
what what are those numbers i mean if
that happens

7138

you know i'm guessing you can add a few

7140
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:50,480
you know i'm guessing you can add a few
 

7141
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,709
you know i'm guessing you can add a few
zeros

7142
01:55:52,709 --> 01:55:52,719
zeros
 

7143
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:54,310
zeros
i like how you say i haven't done the

7144
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:54,320
i like how you say i haven't done the
 

7145
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,390
i like how you say i haven't done the
analysis as if i'm sure a lot of people

7146
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:56,400
analysis as if i'm sure a lot of people
 

7147
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:56,870
analysis as if i'm sure a lot of people
have done

have done
 

7149
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,430
have done
quote-unquote analysis but it's not it's

so much of it has to do with
a large number of people holding an idea

there's a lot of excitement by its
 

7167

there's a lot of excitement by its
possibilities but the number of zeros

01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:27,030
do a perfect analysis
except whoever created this simulation

7176
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:27,040

 

7177
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:30,229

who is satoshi nakamoto there's quite a
few people

7182
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:35,360
few people
 

7183
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:39,510
few people
who suggest that person is you

7184
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:39,520

 

7185
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,629

so is it you

7191
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,870
i don't know who it is i i think if i
had to guess it's probably

7192
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:50,880
had to guess it's probably
 

7193
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,629
had to guess it's probably
a group of people some of which might

7194
01:56:52,629 --> 01:56:52,639
a group of people some of which might
 

7195
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:54,470
a group of people some of which might
not even be around anymore

7196
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:54,480
not even be around anymore
 

7197
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,709
not even be around anymore

01:57:12,229 --> 01:57:12,239
um i think also this kind of focus on
 

7217
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:12,790
um i think also this kind of focus on
who is

7218
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:12,800
who is
 

7219
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,270
who is
satoshi or who is in satoshi shouldn't

7220
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:15,280
satoshi or who is in satoshi shouldn't
 

7221
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:16,550
satoshi or who is in satoshi shouldn't
in my opinion matter

7222
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:16,560
in my opinion matter
 

7223
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:19,990
in my opinion matter
so much because regardless of who it is

7224
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:20,000
so much because regardless of who it is
 

7225
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,350
so much because regardless of who it is
that in my opinion should have no

7226
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:23,360
that in my opinion should have no
 

7227
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,270
that in my opinion should have no
substantial significant effect or

7228
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:25,280
substantial significant effect or
 

7229
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:26,870
substantial significant effect or
bearing on

7230
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:26,880
bearing on
 

7231
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,510
bearing on
the functioning or the value or the use

7232
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:29,520
the functioning or the value or the use
 

7233
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,390
the functioning or the value or the use
or the

7234
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:30,400
or the
 

7235
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,310
or the
or the security of of of the bitcoin

7236
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:32,320
or the security of of of the bitcoin
 

7237
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:34,390
or the security of of of the bitcoin
system right so i think

7238
01:57:34,390 --> 01:57:34,400
system right so i think
 

7239
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:36,550
system right so i think
whoever it is they're probably better

7240
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:36,560
whoever it is they're probably better
 

7241
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,709
whoever it is they're probably better
off not not not making that public

7242
01:57:38,709 --> 01:57:38,719
off not not not making that public
 

7243
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:41,910
off not not not making that public
and i think beyond that um whoever it

7244
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:41,920
and i think beyond that um whoever it
 

7245
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:42,709
and i think beyond that um whoever it
turned out to be

7246
01:57:42,709 --> 01:57:42,719
turned out to be
 

7247
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:44,790
turned out to be
shouldn't matter because it has nothing

7248
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:44,800
shouldn't matter because it has nothing
 

7249
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,229
shouldn't matter because it has nothing
to do

7250
01:57:46,229 --> 01:57:46,239
to do
 

7251
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:48,709
to do
with how the system is made useful or

7252
01:57:48,709 --> 01:57:48,719
with how the system is made useful or
 

7253
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:50,629
with how the system is made useful or
secure or anything else

7254
01:57:50,629 --> 01:57:50,639
secure or anything else
 

7255
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:52,310
secure or anything else
and so i think that's the um you know

7256
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:52,320
and so i think that's the um you know
 

7257
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,390
and so i think that's the um you know
that's the point of view that i have

7258
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:54,400
that's the point of view that i have
 

7259
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:57,350
that's the point of view that i have
now if you were satoshi nakamoto would

7260
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,360
now if you were satoshi nakamoto would
 

7261
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,350
now if you were satoshi nakamoto would
you tell me

7262
01:57:59,350 --> 01:57:59,360
you tell me
 

7263
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:02,550
you tell me
because you said they shouldn't whoever

7264
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:02,560
because you said they shouldn't whoever
 

7265
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:03,430
because you said they shouldn't whoever
satoshi is

7266
01:58:03,430 --> 01:58:03,440
satoshi is
 

7267
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,669
satoshi is
you should keep that private so would

7268
01:58:05,669 --> 01:58:05,679
you should keep that private so would
 

7269
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:06,950
you should keep that private so would
you tell it to me

7270
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:06,960
you tell it to me
 

7271
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:10,310
you tell it to me
or no we're in some kind of weird like

7272
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:10,320
or no we're in some kind of weird like
 

7273
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:13,430
or no we're in some kind of weird like
thought experiment here if if i was this

7274
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:13,440
thought experiment here if if i was this
 

7275
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:14,229
thought experiment here if if i was this
guy

7276
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:14,239
guy
 

7277
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:17,589
guy
um let me think about this which i'm not

7278
01:58:17,589 --> 01:58:17,599
um let me think about this which i'm not
 

7279
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:18,709
um let me think about this which i'm not
by the way i am not

7280
01:58:18,709 --> 01:58:18,719
by the way i am not
 

7281
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,030
by the way i am not
this person but if you were would you

7282
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:21,040
this person but if you were would you
 

7283
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,910
this person but if you were would you
say it

7284
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:23,920

 

7285
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:27,430

um i think

7286
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:27,440
um i think
 

7287
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,709
um i think
uh probably not i don't see the i i

7288
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:30,719
uh probably not i don't see the i i
 

7289
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,149
uh probably not i don't see the i i
i think that they would cause a lot of

7290
01:58:32,149 --> 01:58:32,159
i think that they would cause a lot of
 

7291
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:34,870
i think that they would cause a lot of
distraction and a lot of weird stuff

7292
01:58:34,870 --> 01:58:34,880
distraction and a lot of weird stuff
 

7293
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,790
distraction and a lot of weird stuff
and so realistically i don't think it

7294
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:36,800
and so realistically i don't think it
 

7295
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,149
and so realistically i don't think it
would help

7296
01:58:38,149 --> 01:58:38,159
would help
 

7297
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:40,550
would help
anybody or even the person who discloses

7298
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:40,560
anybody or even the person who discloses
 

7299
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,390
anybody or even the person who discloses
it but just to be clear i am not

7300
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:42,400
it but just to be clear i am not
 

7301
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,390
it but just to be clear i am not
and whoever it is i think they haven't

7302
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:44,400
and whoever it is i think they haven't
 

7303
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,750
and whoever it is i think they haven't
said anything because they don't want

7304
01:58:45,750 --> 01:58:45,760
said anything because they don't want
 

7305
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:47,189
said anything because they don't want
the attention and they don't want the

7306
01:58:47,189 --> 01:58:47,199
the attention and they don't want the
 

7307
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:48,550
the attention and they don't want the
distraction and they don't want all the

7308
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:48,560
distraction and they don't want all the
 

7309
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:49,750
distraction and they don't want all the
problems from this

7310
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:49,760
problems from this
 

7311
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,510
problems from this
and that's that makes sense to me

7312
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:51,520
and that's that makes sense to me
 

7313
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,950
and that's that makes sense to me
conceptually

7314
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:52,960
conceptually
 

7315
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,229
conceptually
it's fascinating to think if they're

7316
01:58:54,229 --> 01:58:54,239
it's fascinating to think if they're
 

7317
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:56,709
it's fascinating to think if they're
still out there and part of the

7318
01:58:56,709 --> 01:58:56,719
still out there and part of the
 

7319
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:00,550
still out there and part of the
the bitcoin the cryptocurrency community

7320
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,560

 

7321
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,669

and um it is inspiring to think that

7322
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:03,679
and um it is inspiring to think that
 

7323
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:07,350
and um it is inspiring to think that
if they're out there that they're not

7324
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:07,360
if they're out there that they're not
 

7325
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,350
if they're out there that they're not
revealing their identity because it

7326
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:09,360
revealing their identity because it
 

7327
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:11,189
revealing their identity because it
would be a distraction

7328
01:59:11,189 --> 01:59:11,199
would be a distraction
 

7329
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:12,629
would be a distraction
that's kind of inspiring that people are

7330
01:59:12,629 --> 01:59:12,639
that's kind of inspiring that people are
 

7331
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:15,669
that's kind of inspiring that people are
like that just like george washington

7332
01:59:15,669 --> 01:59:15,679
like that just like george washington
 

7333
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:18,070
like that just like george washington
relinquishing power is inspiring because

7334
01:59:18,070 --> 01:59:18,080
relinquishing power is inspiring because
 

7335
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,510
relinquishing power is inspiring because

02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:58,870
everything that it's done and that it
birthed this industry there's absolutely

7500
02:01:58,870 --> 02:01:58,880
birthed this industry there's absolutely
 

7501
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,870
birthed this industry there's absolutely
no doubt about that

7502
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:00,880
no doubt about that
 

7503
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:02,550
no doubt about that
you know at the same time whatever

7504
02:02:02,550 --> 02:02:02,560
you know at the same time whatever
 

7505
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:04,470
you know at the same time whatever
design decisions people make

7506
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:04,480
design decisions people make
 

7507
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:07,030
design decisions people make
are the design decisions they make right

7508
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:07,040
are the design decisions they make right
 

7509
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:07,669
are the design decisions they make right
and so they

7510
02:02:07,669 --> 02:02:07,679
and so they
 

7511
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:09,189
and so they
if you've made a design decision that

7512
02:02:09,189 --> 02:02:09,199
if you've made a design decision that
 

7513
02:02:09,199 --> 02:02:11,109
if you've made a design decision that
this ledger and this thing will be about

7514
02:02:11,109 --> 02:02:11,119
this ledger and this thing will be about
 

7515
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:11,990
this ledger and this thing will be about
bitcoin

7516
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:12,000
bitcoin
 

7517
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,310
bitcoin
it won't be about colored coins it won't

7518
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:14,320
it won't be about colored coins it won't
 

7519
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:16,550
it won't be about colored coins it won't
be about op return at 80 bytes

7520
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:16,560
be about op return at 80 bytes
 

7521
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,350
be about op return at 80 bytes
it won't be about these other kind of

7522
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:19,360
it won't be about these other kind of
 

7523
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,629
it won't be about these other kind of
nuances

7524
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:20,639
nuances
 

7525
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:22,870
nuances
that you don't want this to be about

7526
02:02:22,870 --> 02:02:22,880
that you don't want this to be about
 

7527
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:23,750
that you don't want this to be about
then that's fine

7528
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:23,760
then that's fine
 

7529
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:25,270
then that's fine
that's that's fine and that's that's

7530
02:02:25,270 --> 02:02:25,280
that's that's fine and that's that's
 

7531
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:26,870
that's that's fine and that's that's
that's a logical decision that's

7532
02:02:26,870 --> 02:02:26,880
that's a logical decision that's
 

7533
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:29,109
that's a logical decision that's
that's called focus and focus has a lot

7534
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:29,119
that's called focus and focus has a lot
 

7535
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:30,149
that's called focus and focus has a lot
of value

7536
02:02:30,149 --> 02:02:30,159
of value
 

7537
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:32,390
of value
um and a lot of great um technology

7538
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:32,400
um and a lot of great um technology
 

7539
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:33,990
um and a lot of great um technology
products have

7540
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:34,000
products have
 

7541
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,550
products have
focused on something and and done that

7542
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:36,560
focused on something and and done that
 

7543
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:37,910
focused on something and and done that
and then there's a lot of smart people

7544
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:37,920
and then there's a lot of smart people
 

7545
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:39,189
and then there's a lot of smart people
around bitcoin

7546
02:02:39,189 --> 02:02:39,199
around bitcoin
 

7547
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:41,830
around bitcoin
building um kind of additional systems

7548
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:41,840
building um kind of additional systems
 

7549
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,270
building um kind of additional systems
that anchor their security within

7550
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:43,280
that anchor their security within
 

7551
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:44,229
that anchor their security within
bitcoin

7552
02:02:44,229 --> 02:02:44,239
bitcoin
 

7553
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:45,430
bitcoin
and i think that's an interesting

7554
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:45,440
and i think that's an interesting
 

7555
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,109
and i think that's an interesting
approach that could that could bear

7556
02:02:47,109 --> 02:02:47,119
approach that could that could bear
 

7557
02:02:47,119 --> 02:02:48,390
approach that could that could bear
fruit

7558
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:48,400
fruit
 

7559
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:50,229
fruit
i think it'll eventually require an

7560
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:50,239
i think it'll eventually require an
 

7561
02:02:50,239 --> 02:02:52,470
i think it'll eventually require an
interaction with the bitcoin protocol

7562
02:02:52,470 --> 02:02:52,480
interaction with the bitcoin protocol
 

7563
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:54,629
interaction with the bitcoin protocol
in more advanced ways and then there

7564
02:02:54,629 --> 02:02:54,639
in more advanced ways and then there
 

7565
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:55,990
in more advanced ways and then there
will be another question of

7566
02:02:55,990 --> 02:02:56,000
will be another question of
 

7567
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,910
will be another question of
you know what is the design decision for

7568
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:57,920
you know what is the design decision for
 

7569
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,030
you know what is the design decision for
bitcoin

7570
02:02:59,030 --> 02:02:59,040
bitcoin
 

7571
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,790
bitcoin
is it that bitcoin will be just about

7572
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:00,800
is it that bitcoin will be just about
 

7573
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,550
is it that bitcoin will be just about
the bitcoin ledger

7574
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:02,560
the bitcoin ledger
 

7575
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:06,149
the bitcoin ledger
or does bitcoin want to evolve into

7576
02:03:06,149 --> 02:03:06,159
or does bitcoin want to evolve into
 

7577
02:03:06,159 --> 02:03:08,709
or does bitcoin want to evolve into
um you know an anchor for all these

7578
02:03:08,709 --> 02:03:08,719
um you know an anchor for all these
 

7579
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:09,270
um you know an anchor for all these
other

7580
02:03:09,270 --> 02:03:09,280
other
 

7581
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:11,589
other
other systems and and maybe create

7582
02:03:11,589 --> 02:03:11,599
other systems and and maybe create
 

7583
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:12,470
other systems and and maybe create
additional

7584
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:12,480
additional
 

7585
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:15,430
additional
data you know kind of more data on chain

7586
02:03:15,430 --> 02:03:15,440
data you know kind of more data on chain
 

7587
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:16,950
data you know kind of more data on chain
on the bitcoin blockchain related to

7588
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:16,960
on the bitcoin blockchain related to
 

7589
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,229
on the bitcoin blockchain related to
that

7590
02:03:18,229 --> 02:03:18,239
that
 

7591
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:20,550
that
so i i'm excited to see how that evolves

7592
02:03:20,550 --> 02:03:20,560
so i i'm excited to see how that evolves
 

7593
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:21,830
so i i'm excited to see how that evolves
but until then

7594
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:21,840
but until then
 

7595
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,990
but until then
kind of results speak for themselves and

7596
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:24,000
kind of results speak for themselves and
 

7597
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,750
kind of results speak for themselves and
the results that bitcoin has achieved

7598
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:25,760
the results that bitcoin has achieved
 

7599
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,589
the results that bitcoin has achieved
for our industry and for itself as

something that um
 

7613
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:39,109
something that um
i think really everybody in our industry

i think the next step um in line with
 

7863
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:32,310
i think the next step um in line with
our body of work

our body of work
 

7865
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:35,109
our body of work
is how does that scriptable on-chain

sure absolutely um i think i think

sure absolutely um i think i think
 

8037
02:10:16,239 --> 02:10:17,669
sure absolutely um i think i think
that's a great question and i think that

8038
02:10:17,669 --> 02:10:17,679
that's a great question and i think that
 

8039
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:18,310
that's a great question and i think that
actually gets

8040
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:18,320
actually gets
 

8041
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:20,229
actually gets
to the core of what the chain link

8042
02:10:20,229 --> 02:10:20,239
to the core of what the chain link
 

8043
02:10:20,239 --> 02:10:23,189
to the core of what the chain link
network is uh supposed to achieve

8044
02:10:23,189 --> 02:10:23,199
network is uh supposed to achieve
 

8045
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:26,310
network is uh supposed to achieve
we are supposed to achieve a maximally

8046
02:10:26,310 --> 02:10:26,320
we are supposed to achieve a maximally
 

8047
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:28,310
we are supposed to achieve a maximally
flexible system

flexible system
 

8049
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:29,910
flexible system
so once again this is the big difference

8050
02:10:29,910 --> 02:10:29,920
so once again this is the big difference
 

8051
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:31,750
so once again this is the big difference
between chain link and oracle networks

8052
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:31,760
between chain link and oracle networks
 

8053
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:32,470
between chain link and oracle networks
in general

in general
 

8055
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:34,470
in general
and blockchains in my opinion

8056
02:10:34,470 --> 02:10:34,480
and blockchains in my opinion
 

8057
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:36,709
and blockchains in my opinion
blockchains do not seek to be maximally

8058
02:10:36,709 --> 02:10:36,719
blockchains do not seek to be maximally
 

8059
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:37,990
blockchains do not seek to be maximally
flexible right they say

that's a very focused type of system
 

8087
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,669
that's a very focused type of system
and that's great and that makes sense

8088
02:11:01,669 --> 02:11:01,679
and that's great and that makes sense
 

8089
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:03,510
and that's great and that makes sense
because it's focused on creating

02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:03,280
which makes perfect sense and then
 

8155
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:06,790
which makes perfect sense and then
there's oracles and oracle networks

8156
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:06,800
there's oracles and oracle networks
 

8157
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,709
there's oracles and oracle networks
that is all the world's data right we're

8158
02:12:08,709 --> 02:12:08,719
that is all the world's data right we're
 

8159
02:12:08,719 --> 02:12:09,990
that is all the world's data right we're
talking about taking

8160
02:12:09,990 --> 02:12:10,000
talking about taking
 

8161
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,830
talking about taking
all the world's data and making it

8162
02:12:11,830 --> 02:12:11,840
all the world's data and making it
 

8163
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,189
all the world's data and making it
consumable for

8164
02:12:13,189 --> 02:12:13,199
consumable for
 

8165
02:12:13,199 --> 02:12:15,189
consumable for
all the world's use cases that have

8166
02:12:15,189 --> 02:12:15,199
all the world's use cases that have
 

8167
02:12:15,199 --> 02:12:16,470
all the world's use cases that have
trust issues

8168
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:16,480
trust issues
 

8169
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:18,149
trust issues
so the amount of variability there is

8170
02:12:18,149 --> 02:12:18,159
so the amount of variability there is
 

8171
02:12:18,159 --> 02:12:19,990
so the amount of variability there is
absolutely massive right

8172
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:20,000
absolutely massive right
 

8173
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,069
absolutely massive right
it's like the the decentralized oracle

8174
02:12:22,069 --> 02:12:22,079
it's like the the decentralized oracle
 

8175
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:23,750
it's like the the decentralized oracle
network and the conditions that that

8176
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:23,760
network and the conditions that that
 

8177
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:25,669
network and the conditions that that
decentralized oracle network needs to

8178
02:12:25,669 --> 02:12:25,679
decentralized oracle network needs to
 

8179
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:28,709
decentralized oracle network needs to
meet is going to vary very widely from

8180
02:12:28,709 --> 02:12:28,719
meet is going to vary very widely from
 

8181
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:30,390
meet is going to vary very widely from
an insurance contract

8182
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:30,400
an insurance contract
 

8183
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:33,350
an insurance contract
to a lending contract to an ad network

8184
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:33,360
to a lending contract to an ad network
 

8185
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:34,390
to a lending contract to an ad network
contract

8186
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:34,400
contract
 

8187
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:37,350
contract
to the data sales contract that that we

8188
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:37,360
to the data sales contract that that we
 

8189
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:38,149
to the data sales contract that that we
discussed

8190
02:12:38,149 --> 02:12:38,159
discussed
 

8191
02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:40,629
discussed
to any number of other smart contracts

8192
02:12:40,629 --> 02:12:40,639
to any number of other smart contracts
 

8193
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:41,669
to any number of other smart contracts
so really

8194
02:12:41,669 --> 02:12:41,679
so really
 

8195
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:43,750
so really
the ability of a decentralized oracle

8196
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:43,760
the ability of a decentralized oracle
 

8197
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:45,990
the ability of a decentralized oracle
network to flexibly address

8198
02:12:45,990 --> 02:12:46,000
network to flexibly address
 

8199
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,229
network to flexibly address
all of those requirements is what's

8200
02:12:48,229 --> 02:12:48,239
all of those requirements is what's
 

8201
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:49,750
all of those requirements is what's
necessary

8202
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
necessary
 

8203
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:52,229
necessary
so flexibility is the goal whereas with

8204
02:12:52,229 --> 02:12:52,239
so flexibility is the goal whereas with
 

8205
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:52,950
so flexibility is the goal whereas with
uh

8206
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:52,960
uh
 

8207
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:56,310
uh
on chain like bitcoin flexibility is the

8208
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:56,320
on chain like bitcoin flexibility is the
 

8209
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,589
on chain like bitcoin flexibility is the
enemy

8210
02:12:57,589 --> 02:12:57,599
enemy
 

8211
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:00,390
enemy
in the sense that uh you want security

8212
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:00,400
in the sense that uh you want security
 

8213
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:00,870
in the sense that uh you want security
the

8214
02:13:00,870 --> 02:13:00,880
the
 

8215
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:03,910
the
you want the focus there and

8216
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:03,920
you want the focus there and
 

8217
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:06,390
you want the focus there and
in that kind of world design decisions

8218
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:06,400
in that kind of world design decisions
 

8219
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:08,149
in that kind of world design decisions
have huge consequences

8220
02:13:08,149 --> 02:13:08,159
have huge consequences
 

8221
02:13:08,159 --> 02:13:09,589
have huge consequences
and then if you look at the distributed

8222
02:13:09,589 --> 02:13:09,599
and then if you look at the distributed
 

8223
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:12,149
and then if you look at the distributed
oracle network side

8224
02:13:12,149 --> 02:13:12,159
oracle network side
 

8225
02:13:12,159 --> 02:13:15,109
oracle network side
you want to remove the restrictions of

8226
02:13:15,109 --> 02:13:15,119
you want to remove the restrictions of
 

8227
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:16,069
you want to remove the restrictions of
design choices

8228
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:16,079
design choices
 

8229
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:18,310
design choices
you want to provide maximal flexibility

8230
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:18,320
you want to provide maximal flexibility
 

8231
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:19,270
you want to provide maximal flexibility
then so

8232
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:19,280
then so
 

8233
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:22,470
then so
it's a completely separate kind of uh

8234
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
it's a completely separate kind of uh
 

8235
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:24,390
it's a completely separate kind of uh
design framework it's a slightly

8236
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:24,400
design framework it's a slightly
 

8237
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:25,669
design framework it's a slightly
different problem right because i

8238
02:13:25,669 --> 02:13:25,679
different problem right because i
 

8239
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:27,830
different problem right because i
we're not trying to define transaction

there's this world of services or this

8248
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:35,360
there's this world of services or this
 

8249
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,629
there's this world of services or this
world of data that's not very

8250
02:13:36,629 --> 02:13:36,639
world of data that's not very
 

8251
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:37,510
world of data that's not very
deterministic

8252
02:13:37,510 --> 02:13:37,520
deterministic
 

8253
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:39,350
deterministic
but it's unbelievably useful to these

8254
02:13:39,350 --> 02:13:39,360
but it's unbelievably useful to these
 

8255
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:40,790
but it's unbelievably useful to these
smart contracts over here

8256
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:40,800
smart contracts over here
 

8257
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,870
smart contracts over here
and actually they need it to even exist

8258
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:42,880
and actually they need it to even exist
 

8259
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:43,990
and actually they need it to even exist
and we really want them to

8260
02:13:43,990 --> 02:13:44,000
and we really want them to
 

8261
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,589
and we really want them to
exist because once they exist it's going

8262
02:13:45,589 --> 02:13:45,599
exist because once they exist it's going
 

8263
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:47,030
exist because once they exist it's going
to completely redefine what our whole

8264
02:13:47,030 --> 02:13:47,040
to completely redefine what our whole
 

8265
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:48,229
to completely redefine what our whole
industry is known for

8266
02:13:48,229 --> 02:13:48,239
industry is known for
 

8267
02:13:48,239 --> 02:13:50,709
industry is known for
right and define nfts are not even the

8268
02:13:50,709 --> 02:13:50,719
right and define nfts are not even the
 

8269
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:52,069
right and define nfts are not even the
tip of the iceberg they're like

8270
02:13:52,069 --> 02:13:52,079
tip of the iceberg they're like
 

8271
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:53,510
tip of the iceberg they're like
like the snow coming off the top of the

8272
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:53,520
like the snow coming off the top of the
 

8273
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:55,430
like the snow coming off the top of the
iceberg

8274
02:13:55,430 --> 02:13:55,440
iceberg
 

8275
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:58,310
iceberg
and so our goal is to create a framework

8276
02:13:58,310 --> 02:13:58,320
and so our goal is to create a framework
 

8277
02:13:58,320 --> 02:13:59,830
and so our goal is to create a framework
and an infrastructure

8278
02:13:59,830 --> 02:13:59,840
and an infrastructure
 

8279
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:03,109
and an infrastructure
and a software that allows people to

8280
02:14:03,109 --> 02:14:03,119
and a software that allows people to
 

8281
02:14:03,119 --> 02:14:05,830
and a software that allows people to
compose decentralized oracle networks

8282
02:14:05,830 --> 02:14:05,840
compose decentralized oracle networks
 

8283
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:06,550
compose decentralized oracle networks
right so

8284
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:06,560
right so
 

8285
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:08,229
right so
initially you can compose a

8286
02:14:08,229 --> 02:14:08,239
initially you can compose a
 

8287
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:09,910
initially you can compose a
decentralized oracle network

8288
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:09,920
decentralized oracle network
 

8289
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,990
decentralized oracle network
of seven nodes that goes to three data

8290
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:12,000
of seven nodes that goes to three data
 

8291
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,990
of seven nodes that goes to three data
sources to trigger your contract worth a

8292
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:14,000
sources to trigger your contract worth a
 

8293
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,189
sources to trigger your contract worth a
million dollars

8294
02:14:15,189 --> 02:14:15,199
million dollars
 

8295
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:16,550
million dollars
and that's where you could start and

8296
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:16,560
and that's where you could start and
 

8297
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:17,990
and that's where you could start and
then let's say your smart contract your

8298
02:14:17,990 --> 02:14:18,000
then let's say your smart contract your
 

8299
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,669
then let's say your smart contract your
d5 smart contract goes to a billion

8300
02:14:19,669 --> 02:14:19,679
d5 smart contract goes to a billion
 

8301
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:20,470
d5 smart contract goes to a billion
dollars

8302
02:14:20,470 --> 02:14:20,480
dollars
 

8303
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:22,229
dollars
well then you need to make some changes

8304
02:14:22,229 --> 02:14:22,239
well then you need to make some changes
 

8305
02:14:22,239 --> 02:14:23,990
well then you need to make some changes
right you need to go from seven nodes

8306
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:24,000
right you need to go from seven nodes
 

8307
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,189
right you need to go from seven nodes
to 15 or maybe 31 nodes and you need to

8308
02:14:27,189 --> 02:14:27,199
to 15 or maybe 31 nodes and you need to
 

8309
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:28,629
to 15 or maybe 31 nodes and you need to
go from three data sources

8310
02:14:28,629 --> 02:14:28,639
go from three data sources
 

8311
02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:30,950
go from three data sources
to five or seven and you maybe need to

8312
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:30,960
to five or seven and you maybe need to
 

8313
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:31,750
to five or seven and you maybe need to
create some

8314
02:14:31,750 --> 02:14:31,760
create some
 

8315
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:34,550
create some
some kind of what we call circuit

8316
02:14:34,550 --> 02:14:34,560
some kind of what we call circuit
 

8317
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:35,109
some kind of what we call circuit

02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:41,110
and there's a large amount of data
sources that we already have putting

8644
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:41,120
sources that we already have putting
 

8645
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:42,709
sources that we already have putting
data on chain on testnet

8646
02:19:42,709 --> 02:19:42,719
data on chain on testnet
 

8647
02:19:42,719 --> 02:19:44,230
data on chain on testnet
which is the test environment in which

8648
02:19:44,230 --> 02:19:44,240
which is the test environment in which
 

8649
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:46,389
which is the test environment in which
people would build so i think d5 is

8650
02:19:46,389 --> 02:19:46,399
people would build so i think d5 is
 

8651
02:19:46,399 --> 02:19:47,030
people would build so i think d5 is
probably

8652
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:47,040
probably
 

8653
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:48,389
probably
to a certain degree the most exciting

8654
02:19:48,389 --> 02:19:48,399
to a certain degree the most exciting
 

8655
02:19:48,399 --> 02:19:51,830
to a certain degree the most exciting
for certain people and pretty pretty

8656
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:51,840
for certain people and pretty pretty
 

8657
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:54,150
for certain people and pretty pretty
expansive in terms of the tutorials and

8658
02:19:54,150 --> 02:19:54,160
expansive in terms of the tutorials and
 

8659
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,830
expansive in terms of the tutorials and
the amount of contracts to see how

8660
02:19:55,830 --> 02:19:55,840
the amount of contracts to see how
 

8661
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,670
the amount of contracts to see how
people have already built it

8662
02:19:57,670 --> 02:19:57,680
people have already built it
 

8663
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:59,030
people have already built it
i think beyond that we see people

8664
02:19:59,030 --> 02:19:59,040
i think beyond that we see people
 

8665
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:00,389
i think beyond that we see people
building amazing things at these

8666
02:20:00,389 --> 02:20:00,399
building amazing things at these
 

8667
02:20:00,399 --> 02:20:02,309
building amazing things at these
hackathons in the previous hackathon

8668
02:20:02,309 --> 02:20:02,319
hackathons in the previous hackathon
 

8669
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:04,630
hackathons in the previous hackathon
we saw somebody build a smart contract

8670
02:20:04,630 --> 02:20:04,640
we saw somebody build a smart contract
 

8671
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:05,990
we saw somebody build a smart contract
that allows

8672
02:20:05,990 --> 02:20:06,000
that allows
 

8673
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,230
that allows
the rental out someone to rent out their

8674
02:20:08,230 --> 02:20:08,240
the rental out someone to rent out their
 

8675
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:09,110
the rental out someone to rent out their
tesla

8676
02:20:09,110 --> 02:20:09,120
tesla
 

8677
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:12,469
tesla
right so it allows the tesla api

8678
02:20:12,469 --> 02:20:12,479
right so it allows the tesla api
 

8679
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:15,670
right so it allows the tesla api
to give someone else access and rent out

8680
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:15,680
to give someone else access and rent out
 

8681
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:17,429
to give someone else access and rent out
someone's tesla on the basis of a smart

8682
02:20:17,429 --> 02:20:17,439
someone's tesla on the basis of a smart
 

8683
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:19,670
someone's tesla on the basis of a smart
contract kind of coordinating payment

8684
02:20:19,670 --> 02:20:19,680
contract kind of coordinating payment
 

8685
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:21,429
contract kind of coordinating payment
which was you know which was kind of

8686
02:20:21,429 --> 02:20:21,439
which was you know which was kind of
 

8687
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:23,910
which was you know which was kind of
amazing the the more recent hackathon we

8688
02:20:23,910 --> 02:20:23,920
amazing the the more recent hackathon we
 

8689
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:24,790
amazing the the more recent hackathon we
saw something

8690
02:20:24,790 --> 02:20:24,800
saw something
 

8691
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:26,309
saw something
called d-bridge which uh is a

8692
02:20:26,309 --> 02:20:26,319
called d-bridge which uh is a
 

8693
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:27,830
called d-bridge which uh is a
cross-chain solution that uses oracle

8694
02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:27,840
cross-chain solution that uses oracle
 

8695
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:29,429
cross-chain solution that uses oracle
networks to confirm data on different

8696
02:20:29,429 --> 02:20:29,439
networks to confirm data on different
 

8697
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:30,469
networks to confirm data on different
chains

8698
02:20:30,469 --> 02:20:30,479
chains
 

8699
02:20:30,479 --> 02:20:33,830
chains
so i think the things that people build

8700
02:20:33,830 --> 02:20:33,840
so i think the things that people build
 

8701
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:36,309
so i think the things that people build
will will just become expansive and

8702
02:20:36,309 --> 02:20:36,319
will will just become expansive and
 

8703
02:20:36,319 --> 02:20:37,750
will will just become expansive and
varied in ways that i can't

8704
02:20:37,750 --> 02:20:37,760
varied in ways that i can't
 

8705
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:41,110
varied in ways that i can't
can't even imagine um but i i think this

8706
02:20:41,110 --> 02:20:41,120
can't even imagine um but i i think this
 

8707
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:42,790
can't even imagine um but i i think this
recent hackathon saw

8708
02:20:42,790 --> 02:20:42,800
recent hackathon saw
 

8709
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:45,429
recent hackathon saw
a huge huge list of different um

8710
02:20:45,429 --> 02:20:45,439
a huge huge list of different um
 

8711
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:46,630
a huge huge list of different um
different kind of winners in different

8712
02:20:46,630 --> 02:20:46,640
different kind of winners in different
 

8713
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:47,830
different kind of winners in different
categories

8714
02:20:47,830 --> 02:20:47,840
categories
 

8715
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:49,190
categories
and there's so many different categories

8716
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:49,200
and there's so many different categories
 

8717
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:51,510
and there's so many different categories
we even have a gov tech category and

8718
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:51,520
we even have a gov tech category and
 

8719
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:53,190
we even have a gov tech category and
a whole a whole bunch of things if

8720
02:20:53,190 --> 02:20:53,200
a whole a whole bunch of things if
 

8721
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:54,630
a whole a whole bunch of things if
people want to see what's possible they

8722
02:20:54,630 --> 02:20:54,640
people want to see what's possible they
 

8723
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:55,830
people want to see what's possible they
can go look at the winners

8724
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:55,840
can go look at the winners
 

8725
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,270
can go look at the winners
i think that's that's probably a good

8726
02:20:57,270 --> 02:20:57,280
i think that's that's probably a good
 

8727
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:59,349
i think that's that's probably a good
idea at

8728
02:20:59,349 --> 02:20:59,359
idea at
 

8729
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:00,710
idea at
yeah that's that'll be on the side of

8730
02:21:00,710 --> 02:21:00,720
yeah that's that'll be on the side of
 

8731
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:02,870
yeah that's that'll be on the side of
the hackathon there's a blog related to

8732
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:02,880
the hackathon there's a blog related to
 

8733
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:03,670
the hackathon there's a blog related to
that

8734
02:21:03,670 --> 02:21:03,680
that
 

8735
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:05,270
that
and we're going to have more of these

8736
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:05,280
and we're going to have more of these
 

8737
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:08,389
and we're going to have more of these
and once again our our explicit goal

8738
02:21:08,389 --> 02:21:08,399
and once again our our explicit goal
 

8739
02:21:08,399 --> 02:21:11,349
and once again our our explicit goal
is to take our industry into this world

8740
02:21:11,349 --> 02:21:11,359
is to take our industry into this world
 

8741
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:13,030
is to take our industry into this world
of hybrid smart contracts

8742
02:21:13,030 --> 02:21:13,040
of hybrid smart contracts
 

8743
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:14,790
of hybrid smart contracts
which which just benefits everybody it

8744
02:21:14,790 --> 02:21:14,800
which which just benefits everybody it
 

8745
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:16,790
which which just benefits everybody it
makes more on chain activity

8746
02:21:16,790 --> 02:21:16,800
makes more on chain activity
 

8747
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:19,990
makes more on chain activity
it it helps provide real world value to

8748
02:21:19,990 --> 02:21:20,000
it it helps provide real world value to
 

8749
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,590
it it helps provide real world value to
the average person from all of this

8750
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:21,600
the average person from all of this
 

8751
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:23,429
the average person from all of this
infrastructure period

8752
02:21:23,429 --> 02:21:23,439
infrastructure period
 

8753
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:25,990
infrastructure period
and at the end of the day i think that

8754
02:21:25,990 --> 02:21:26,000
and at the end of the day i think that
 

8755
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,150
and at the end of the day i think that
it just redefines what our industry is

8756
02:21:28,150 --> 02:21:28,160
it just redefines what our industry is
 

8757
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:30,469
it just redefines what our industry is
about through use cases right because

8758
02:21:30,469 --> 02:21:30,479
about through use cases right because
 

8759
02:21:30,479 --> 02:21:32,950
about through use cases right because
if you only learn through our industry

8760
02:21:32,950 --> 02:21:32,960
if you only learn through our industry
 

8761
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:34,389
if you only learn through our industry
from the point of view of a single use

8762
02:21:34,389 --> 02:21:34,399
from the point of view of a single use
 

8763
02:21:34,399 --> 02:21:34,870
from the point of view of a single use
case

8764
02:21:34,870 --> 02:21:34,880
case
 

8765
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,870
case
like the nft use case or some other use

8766
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:36,880
like the nft use case or some other use
 

8767
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,590
like the nft use case or some other use
case that's what our industry is about

8768
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:39,600
case that's what our industry is about
 

8769
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:41,670
case that's what our industry is about
and the more of these use cases that

8770
02:21:41,670 --> 02:21:41,680
and the more of these use cases that
 

8771
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:43,030
and the more of these use cases that
people can make available

8772
02:21:43,030 --> 02:21:43,040
people can make available
 

8773
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,190
people can make available
to the average person or to the fintech

8774
02:21:45,190 --> 02:21:45,200
to the average person or to the fintech
 

8775
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:46,710
to the average person or to the fintech
world or to the insurance world or

wherever
 

8779
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:50,630
wherever
the faster our industry will not just be

8780
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:50,640
the faster our industry will not just be
 

8781
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:53,030
the faster our industry will not just be
about bitcoins or tokens it will be

8782
02:21:53,030 --> 02:21:53,040
about bitcoins or tokens it will be
 

8783
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,110
about bitcoins or tokens it will be
about changing global finance

8784
02:21:55,110 --> 02:21:55,120
about changing global finance
 

8785
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:56,790
about changing global finance
changing global insurance changing

8786
02:21:56,790 --> 02:21:56,800
changing global insurance changing
 

8787
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:58,230
changing global insurance changing
global trade and

8788

global trade and
 

8789
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:00,550
global trade and
and that's the change in the world that

8790
02:22:00,550 --> 02:22:00,560
and that's the change in the world that
 

8791

about bitcoin and um
 

8803

probably closer to a social experiment

8830
02:22:38,630 --> 02:22:38,640
probably closer to a social experiment
 

8831
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:39,990
probably closer to a social experiment
than than anything else

8832
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:40,000
than than anything else
 

8833
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,710
than than anything else
isn't everything a social experiment

8834
02:22:42,710 --> 02:22:42,720
isn't everything a social experiment
 

8835
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,469
isn't everything a social experiment
yeah i i guess that's fair to to a

8836
02:22:44,469 --> 02:22:44,479
yeah i i guess that's fair to to a
 

8837
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:45,030
yeah i i guess that's fair to to a
degree

8838
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:45,040
degree
 

8839
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:47,830
degree
yeah um i think it's fascinating how

8840

yeah um i think it's fascinating how
 

8841
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:48,710
yeah um i think it's fascinating how
that's evolved

8842
02:22:48,710 --> 02:22:48,720
that's evolved
 

8843
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:51,110
that's evolved
um i think the people that made it made

8844
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:51,120
um i think the people that made it made
 

8845
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:52,230
um i think the people that made it made
it with certain you know

it with certain you know
 

8847
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:53,750
it with certain you know
goals in mind and then it's kind of

8848
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:53,760
goals in mind and then it's kind of
 

8849
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:55,910
goals in mind and then it's kind of
taken on a life of its own

8850
02:22:55,910 --> 02:22:55,920
taken on a life of its own
 

8851
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:57,910
taken on a life of its own
i don't fully understand exactly why

8852
02:22:57,910 --> 02:22:57,920
i don't fully understand exactly why
 

8853
02:22:57,920 --> 02:22:59,190
i don't fully understand exactly why
it's taking on a life of

it's taking on a life of
 

8855
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:01,349
it's taking on a life of
of its own at this point um i once again

8856
02:23:01,349 --> 02:23:01,359
of its own at this point um i once again
 

8857
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:03,270
of its own at this point um i once again
i don't spend too much time thinking

02:23:03,270 --> 02:23:03,280
i don't spend too much time thinking
 

8859
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:05,270
i don't spend too much time thinking
about you know different tokens and

about you know different tokens and
 

8861
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,270
about you know different tokens and
and and how they're evolving i'm much

8862

02:23:23,429 --> 02:23:23,439
how technology that is
 

8877
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:26,550
how technology that is
that leverages social dynamics that

to spread i think it's really

8884
02:23:33,670 --> 02:23:33,680
to spread i think it's really
 

8885
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:34,309
to spread i think it's really
interesting

8886
02:23:34,309 --> 02:23:34,319
interesting
 

8887
02:23:34,319 --> 02:23:36,469
interesting
i i don't think it should be discounted

8888
02:23:36,469 --> 02:23:36,479
i i don't think it should be discounted
 

8889
02:23:36,479 --> 02:23:37,750
i i don't think it should be discounted
as a

8890
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:37,760
as a
 

8891
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:39,590
as a
as if i think i tweeted today something

8892
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:39,600
as if i think i tweeted today something
 

8893
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:41,750
as if i think i tweeted today something
about like the fundamental force

8894
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:41,760
about like the fundamental force
 

8895
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:44,870
about like the fundamental force
field of fun uh that fun

8896
02:23:44,870 --> 02:23:44,880
field of fun uh that fun
 

8897
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:47,830
field of fun uh that fun
has an effect on the space time so

8898
02:23:47,830 --> 02:23:47,840
has an effect on the space time so
 

8899
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:49,590
has an effect on the space time so
general relativity

8900
02:23:49,590 --> 02:23:49,600
general relativity
 

8901
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:53,190
general relativity
describes how mass and energy

8902
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:53,200
describes how mass and energy
 

8903
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,990
describes how mass and energy
can curve space time and i was just

8904
02:23:55,990 --> 02:23:56,000
can curve space time and i was just
 

8905
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,389
can curve space time and i was just
giving an example that when life is fun

8906
02:23:58,389 --> 02:23:58,399
giving an example that when life is fun
 

8907
02:23:58,399 --> 02:24:00,309
giving an example that when life is fun
it seems short when life is not fun it

8908
02:24:00,309 --> 02:24:00,319
it seems short when life is not fun it
 

8909
02:24:00,319 --> 02:24:01,429
it seems short when life is not fun it
seems very long

8910
02:24:01,429 --> 02:24:01,439
seems very long
 

8911
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:03,429
seems very long
so fun has a very similar effect on

8912
02:24:03,429 --> 02:24:03,439
so fun has a very similar effect on
 

8913
02:24:03,439 --> 02:24:05,670
so fun has a very similar effect on
space time like in current space time

8914
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:05,680
space time like in current space time
 

8915
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:08,150
space time like in current space time
in that same sense there there is a

8916
02:24:08,150 --> 02:24:08,160
in that same sense there there is a
 

8917
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:09,990
in that same sense there there is a
power to the meme

8918
02:24:09,990 --> 02:24:10,000
power to the meme
 

8919
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,469
power to the meme
and i think dogecoin illustrates that i

8920
02:24:12,469 --> 02:24:12,479
and i think dogecoin illustrates that i
 

8921
02:24:12,479 --> 02:24:14,230
and i think dogecoin illustrates that i
think elon is an example of somebody

8922

think elon is an example of somebody
 

8923
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:16,309
think elon is an example of somebody
that uses dogecoin i don't know his

8924
02:24:16,309 --> 02:24:16,319
that uses dogecoin i don't know his
 

8925
02:24:16,319 --> 02:24:17,349
that uses dogecoin i don't know his
philosophy but

8926
02:24:17,349 --> 02:24:17,359
philosophy but
 

8927
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:19,990

serious right now
 

8941
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:35,510
serious right now
and we've spoken to about bitcoin

8942
02:24:35,510 --> 02:24:35,520
and we've spoken to about bitcoin
 

8943
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:36,630

8949
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:44,070
joking
in the bitcoin world but there's still

8950
02:24:44,070 --> 02:24:44,080
in the bitcoin world but there's still
 

8951
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:47,270
in the bitcoin world but there's still
a little bit of fun and uh humor left in

in that sense i think it's exceptionally
 

8957
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:54,710
in that sense i think it's exceptionally
powerful to inspire to excite

a very big impact on me
were plato's dialogues and particularly

9060
02:26:56,790 --> 02:26:56,800
were plato's dialogues and particularly
 

9061

were plato's dialogues and particularly
protagoras and gorgeous as

i i think what plato's dialogues do very
well is they

9068
02:27:05,990 --> 02:27:06,000
well is they
 

9069
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,790
well is they
give people a clear picture of what

9070
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:08,800
give people a clear picture of what
 

9071
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:09,910
give people a clear picture of what
dialogue looks like

9072
02:27:09,910 --> 02:27:09,920
dialogue looks like
 

9073
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:12,790
dialogue looks like
and what the assessment of information

9074
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:12,800
and what the assessment of information
 

9075
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:13,590
and what the assessment of information
um

9076
02:27:13,590 --> 02:27:13,600
um
 

9077
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,590
um
probably should look like right and how

9078
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:15,600
probably should look like right and how
 

9079
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:17,590
probably should look like right and how
the dissection

9080
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:17,600
the dissection
 

9081
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:19,510
the dissection
and analysis of an idea is very

9082
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:19,520
and analysis of an idea is very
 

9083
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:21,270
and analysis of an idea is very
important and how it can actually be

9084
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:21,280
important and how it can actually be
 

9085
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:22,230
important and how it can actually be
taken in either

9086
02:27:22,230 --> 02:27:22,240
taken in either
 

9087
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:25,110
taken in either
direction but at the end of the day that

9088
02:27:25,110 --> 02:27:25,120
direction but at the end of the day that
 

9089
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:26,870
direction but at the end of the day that
the process of eliminating

9090
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:26,880
the process of eliminating
 

9091
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:29,990
the process of eliminating
um kind of this fuzzy thinking

9092
02:27:29,990 --> 02:27:30,000
um kind of this fuzzy thinking
 

9093
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,710
um kind of this fuzzy thinking
and arriving at whether it's an external

9094
02:27:32,710 --> 02:27:32,720
and arriving at whether it's an external
 

9095
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:34,950
and arriving at whether it's an external
dialogue or an internal dialogue

9096
02:27:34,950 --> 02:27:34,960
dialogue or an internal dialogue
 

9097
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:37,110
dialogue or an internal dialogue
about an accurate picture of reality is

9098
02:27:37,110 --> 02:27:37,120
about an accurate picture of reality is
 

9099
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:38,790
about an accurate picture of reality is
actually very important

9100
02:27:38,790 --> 02:27:38,800
actually very important
 

9101
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:40,550
actually very important
and so i think i'm very lucky to have

9102
02:27:40,550 --> 02:27:40,560
and so i think i'm very lucky to have
 

9103
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:42,389
and so i think i'm very lucky to have
read the dialogues

9104
02:27:42,389 --> 02:27:42,399
read the dialogues
 

9105
02:27:42,399 --> 02:27:44,710
read the dialogues
when i was uh in my early teenage years

9106
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:44,720
when i was uh in my early teenage years

9108
02:27:46,389 --> 02:27:46,399
and it had a very large impact on me
 

9109
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:47,670
and it had a very large impact on me
because it kind of

9110
02:27:47,670 --> 02:27:47,680
because it kind of
 

9111
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:49,349
because it kind of
showed me that you know nobody knows

9112
02:27:49,349 --> 02:27:49,359
showed me that you know nobody knows
 

9113
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:50,870
showed me that you know nobody knows
what they're talking about

mind
 

9119
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:56,710
mind
and i would engage in certain dialogues

9120
02:27:56,710 --> 02:27:56,720
and i would engage in certain dialogues

explore the stars and and they don't
have to worry about

9616
02:36:17,030 --> 02:36:17,040
have to worry about
 

9617
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:19,670
have to worry about
economic scarcity or any number of these

9618

economic scarcity or any number of these
 

9619

other conceptions
 

9621
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:22,550
other conceptions
so i i don't know what the most

9622
02:36:22,550 --> 02:36:22,560
so i i don't know what the most
 

9623
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:24,790
so i i don't know what the most
impactful on me shows have been

9624
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:24,800
impactful on me shows have been
 

9625
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:27,270
impactful on me shows have been
but for some reason recently star trek

9626
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:27,280
but for some reason recently star trek
 

9627
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:29,590
but for some reason recently star trek
um in this in the newer variant

9628
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:29,600
um in this in the newer variant
 

9629
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:32,070
um in this in the newer variant
um not the most new new star trek shows

9630
02:36:32,070 --> 02:36:32,080
um not the most new new star trek shows
 

9631
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:33,830
um not the most new new star trek shows
those shows are a little strange the

9632
02:36:33,830 --> 02:36:33,840
those shows are a little strange the
 

9633
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:35,990
those shows are a little strange the
the kind of middle star trek universe

9634
02:36:35,990 --> 02:36:36,000
the kind of middle star trek universe
 

9635
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,190
the kind of middle star trek universe
where where everybody

9636
02:36:37,190 --> 02:36:37,200
where where everybody
 

9637
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:39,030
where where everybody
is doing something with like a very uh

9638
02:36:39,030 --> 02:36:39,040
is doing something with like a very uh
 

9639
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:40,550
is doing something with like a very uh
important purpose

9640
02:36:40,550 --> 02:36:40,560
important purpose
 

9641
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:42,150
important purpose
and and nobody's thinking about like

9642
02:36:42,150 --> 02:36:42,160
and and nobody's thinking about like
 

9643
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:44,230
and and nobody's thinking about like
where's my paycheck or where's my

9644
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:44,240
where's my paycheck or where's my
 

9645
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:46,630

you know where's my whatever they're all
 

9647
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:48,790
you know where's my whatever they're all
kind of like we have to discover

9648
02:36:48,790 --> 02:36:48,800
kind of like we have to discover
 

9649
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:51,990
kind of like we have to discover
the formula to this to save the planet

9650
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:52,000
the formula to this to save the planet
 

9651
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,590
the formula to this to save the planet
over there and literally every episode

9652
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:53,600
over there and literally every episode
 

9653
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:54,790
over there and literally every episode
you're discovering a formula to save a

9654
02:36:54,790 --> 02:36:54,800
you're discovering a formula to save a
 

9655
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:56,710
you're discovering a formula to save a
planet right of some kind or a universe

9656
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:56,720
planet right of some kind or a universe
 

9657
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:57,190
planet right of some kind or a universe
or

9658
02:36:57,190 --> 02:36:57,200
or
 

9659
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:59,030
or
ecosystem or whatever and it's and

9660
02:36:59,030 --> 02:36:59,040
ecosystem or whatever and it's and
 

9661
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:00,389
ecosystem or whatever and it's and
you're looking at you're like

9662
02:37:00,389 --> 02:37:00,399
you're looking at you're like
 

9663
02:37:00,399 --> 02:37:02,230
you're looking at you're like
you know this this this is this is like

9664
02:37:02,230 --> 02:37:02,240
you know this this this is this is like
 

9665
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:03,670
you know this this this is this is like
this is a pretty good place to end up

9666
02:37:03,670 --> 02:37:03,680
this is a pretty good place to end up
 

9667
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:05,349
this is a pretty good place to end up
this is where we might want to end up

9668
02:37:05,349 --> 02:37:05,359
this is where we might want to end up
 

9669
02:37:05,359 --> 02:37:07,190
this is where we might want to end up
so it gives you hope i mean it's funny

9670
02:37:07,190 --> 02:37:07,200
so it gives you hope i mean it's funny
 

9671
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:08,950
so it gives you hope i mean it's funny
that we don't generating

9672
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:08,960
that we don't generating
 

9673
02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:13,349
that we don't generating
we don't often think about the

9674
02:37:13,349 --> 02:37:13,359
we don't often think about the
 

9675
02:37:13,359 --> 02:37:15,910
we don't often think about the
i think it's very useful to think about

9676
02:37:15,910 --> 02:37:15,920
i think it's very useful to think about
 

9677
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:18,550
i think it's very useful to think about
positive visions of the future

9678
02:37:18,550 --> 02:37:18,560
positive visions of the future
 

9679
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:21,110
positive visions of the future
when we're trying to design technology

9680
02:37:21,110 --> 02:37:21,120
when we're trying to design technology
 

9681
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:21,670
when we're trying to design technology
there's

9682
02:37:21,670 --> 02:37:21,680
there's
 

9683
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:25,270
there's
a lot of sort of in public discourse

9684
02:37:25,270 --> 02:37:25,280
a lot of sort of in public discourse
 

9685
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:27,429

it's important to think about that

9690
02:37:30,870 --> 02:37:30,880
it's important to think about that
 

9691
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:33,110
it's important to think about that
sometimes but in moderation i think

9692
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:33,120
sometimes but in moderation i think
 

9693
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:33,830
sometimes but in moderation i think
because you

9694

there's not enough in my little
 

9697
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:39,110
there's not enough in my little
corner of artificial intelligence world

corner of artificial intelligence world
 

9699
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:41,910
corner of artificial intelligence world
people are very kind of fear monger

9700
02:37:41,910 --> 02:37:41,920
people are very kind of fear monger
 

9701
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:44,309
people are very kind of fear monger
centered there's a lot of discussions

like you have to think about a positive

9726
02:38:11,670 --> 02:38:11,680
like you have to think about a positive
 

9727
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:14,469
like you have to think about a positive
a better world as you create because

9728
02:38:14,469 --> 02:38:14,479
a better world as you create because
 

9729
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:17,030
a better world as you create because
then you can actually create it

9730

having an optimistic view of the world
 

9737
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:26,710
having an optimistic view of the world
is better for design and creativity

9738
02:38:26,710 --> 02:38:26,720
is better for design and creativity
 

9739
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:29,190
is better for design and creativity
than having a pessimistic one it's hard

9740
02:38:29,190 --> 02:38:29,200
than having a pessimistic one it's hard
 

9741
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:32,710
than having a pessimistic one it's hard
to design when you're in fear

9742

02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:12,080
what they won't be able to do in the
 

9777
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:14,070
what they won't be able to do in the
later stages of their life

9778
02:39:14,070 --> 02:39:14,080
later stages of their life
 

9779
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:16,469
later stages of their life
yeah and the way in my opinion from a

9780
02:39:16,469 --> 02:39:16,479
yeah and the way in my opinion from a
 

9781
02:39:16,479 --> 02:39:17,910
yeah and the way in my opinion from a
framework point of view to think about

9782
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:17,920
framework point of view to think about
 

9783
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:19,510
framework point of view to think about
that

9784
02:39:19,510 --> 02:39:19,520
that
 

9785
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:23,270
that
is that the amount of obligations

9786
02:39:23,270 --> 02:39:23,280
is that the amount of obligations
 

9787
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:27,670
is that the amount of obligations
and the amount of time that a person has

9788
02:39:27,670 --> 02:39:27,680
and the amount of time that a person has
 

9789
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:30,389
and the amount of time that a person has
seems to just diminish over time right

9790
02:39:30,389 --> 02:39:30,399
seems to just diminish over time right
 

9791
02:39:30,399 --> 02:39:31,750
seems to just diminish over time right
so the amount of free time they have

9792
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:31,760
so the amount of free time they have
 

9793
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:32,389
so the amount of free time they have
right

9794
02:39:32,389 --> 02:39:32,399
right
 

9795
02:39:32,399 --> 02:39:33,990
right
so you start your job you get a bunch of

9796
02:39:33,990 --> 02:39:34,000
so you start your job you get a bunch of
 

9797
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,910
so you start your job you get a bunch of
responsibilities some something with

9798
02:39:35,910 --> 02:39:35,920
responsibilities some something with
 

9799
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:37,110
responsibilities some something with
your partner's spouse

9800
02:39:37,110 --> 02:39:37,120
your partner's spouse
 

9801
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:39,429
your partner's spouse
more responsibilities kids probably even

philosophical question the ridiculous
 

10463
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:44,389
philosophical question the ridiculous
question

10464
02:50:44,389 --> 02:50:44,399
question
 

10465
02:50:44,399 --> 02:50:45,830
question
what do you think is the meaning of it

10466
02:50:45,830 --> 02:50:45,840
what do you think is the meaning of it
 

10467

what do you think is the meaning of it
all

10468
02:50:47,830 --> 02:50:47,840
all
 

10469
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:49,349
all
do you think about this kind of stuff as

10470
02:50:49,349 --> 02:50:49,359
do you think about this kind of stuff as
 

10471
02:50:49,359 --> 02:50:51,510
do you think about this kind of stuff as
you're creating all the technology

10472
02:50:51,510 --> 02:50:51,520
you're creating all the technology
 

10473
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:54,309
you're creating all the technology
uh as you're thinking about this future

10474
02:50:54,309 --> 02:50:54,319
uh as you're thinking about this future
 

10475
02:50:54,319 --> 02:50:57,030
uh as you're thinking about this future
you ever zoom out and think like why

10476
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:57,040
you ever zoom out and think like why
 

10477
02:50:57,040 --> 02:51:00,230
you ever zoom out and think like why
why why are you sergey striving why are

10478
02:51:00,230 --> 02:51:00,240
why why are you sergey striving why are
 

10479
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:00,950
why why are you sergey striving why are
we

10480
02:51:00,950 --> 02:51:00,960
we
 

10481
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:04,950
we
the human species striving for the stars

10482
02:51:04,950 --> 02:51:04,960
the human species striving for the stars
 

10483
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:07,670
the human species striving for the stars
so i think it comes down to um you know

10484
02:51:07,670 --> 02:51:07,680
so i think it comes down to um you know
 

10485
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:08,469
so i think it comes down to um you know
whether

10486
02:51:08,469 --> 02:51:08,479
whether
 

10487
02:51:08,479 --> 02:51:11,750
whether
people want to live in society so if

10488
02:51:11,750 --> 02:51:11,760
people want to live in society so if
 

10489
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:14,870
people want to live in society so if
if people decide to be part of society

10490
02:51:14,870 --> 02:51:14,880
if people decide to be part of society
 

10491
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:18,710
if people decide to be part of society
they have a certain um

10492
02:51:18,710 --> 02:51:18,720
they have a certain um
 

10493
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:21,190
they have a certain um
set of conditions that they decide to

10494
02:51:21,190 --> 02:51:21,200
set of conditions that they decide to
 

10495
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:22,150
set of conditions that they decide to
take part in

10496
02:51:22,150 --> 02:51:22,160
take part in
 

10497
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:24,870
take part in
right so i i think what this what this

10498
02:51:24,870 --> 02:51:24,880
right so i i think what this what this
 

10499
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:25,750
right so i i think what this what this
comes down to

10500
02:51:25,750 --> 02:51:25,760
comes down to
 

10501
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:29,110
comes down to
is a lot of really involved

10502
02:51:29,110 --> 02:51:29,120
is a lot of really involved
 

10503
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:30,150
is a lot of really involved
conversations

10504
02:51:30,150 --> 02:51:30,160
conversations
 

10505
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:31,750
conversations
but if we assume people have free will

10506
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:31,760
but if we assume people have free will
 

10507
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:33,910
but if we assume people have free will
and choice we just kind of make that

10508
02:51:33,910 --> 02:51:33,920
and choice we just kind of make that
 

10509
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:36,070
and choice we just kind of make that
blanket assumption

10510
02:51:36,070 --> 02:51:36,080
blanket assumption
 

10511
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:37,670
blanket assumption
then the question starts to become well

10512
02:51:37,670 --> 02:51:37,680
then the question starts to become well
 

10513
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:39,110
then the question starts to become well
what choices do we make

10514
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:39,120
what choices do we make
 

10515
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:41,910
what choices do we make
and how do we live with those choices

10516
02:51:41,910 --> 02:51:41,920
and how do we live with those choices
 

10517
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:42,309
and how do we live with those choices
and

10518
02:51:42,309 --> 02:51:42,319
and
 

10519
02:51:42,319 --> 02:51:44,150
and
i think probably the most fundamental

10520
02:51:44,150 --> 02:51:44,160
i think probably the most fundamental
 

10521
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:46,469
i think probably the most fundamental
choice is whether we exist

10522
02:51:46,469 --> 02:51:46,479
choice is whether we exist
 

10523
02:51:46,479 --> 02:51:48,790
choice is whether we exist
in a society or we choose to leave

10524
02:51:48,790 --> 02:51:48,800
in a society or we choose to leave
 

10525
02:51:48,800 --> 02:51:49,750
in a society or we choose to leave
society

10526
02:51:49,750 --> 02:51:49,760
society
 

10527

and there are people that do this there
 

10529
02:51:50,880 --> 02:51:52,070
and there are people that do this there
are people who live in the woods there

10530
02:51:52,070 --> 02:51:52,080
are people who live in the woods there
 

10531
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:53,510

i think there there are a number of
 

10755

but i think at least for me and and
 

10761
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:31,590
but i think at least for me and and
probably for many of the other people i

10762

probably for many of the other people i
 

10763

probably for many of the other people i
know there's a question of

02:55:33,750 --> 02:55:33,760
know there's a question of
 

10765
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:36,150
know there's a question of
what is the body of work that i was

10773
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:45,990

and in my opinion you you should have a

10774
02:55:45,990 --> 02:55:46,000
and in my opinion you you should have a
 

10775
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:47,429
and in my opinion you you should have a
good answer to that

10776
02:55:47,429 --> 02:55:47,439
good answer to that
 

10777
02:55:47,439 --> 02:55:49,590
good answer to that
and you mentioned the body work in

10778
02:55:49,590 --> 02:55:49,600
and you mentioned the body work in
 

10779
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:51,910
and you mentioned the body work in
relation to

10780
02:55:51,910 --> 02:55:51,920
relation to
 

10781
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:54,630
relation to
whether it helped make a better world

10782
02:55:54,630 --> 02:55:54,640
whether it helped make a better world
 

10783
02:55:54,640 --> 02:55:55,670
whether it helped make a better world
and

10784
02:55:55,670 --> 02:55:55,680
and
 

10785
02:55:55,680 --> 02:55:58,389
and
the fundamental question there is what

10786
02:55:58,389 --> 02:55:58,399
the fundamental question there is what
 

10787
02:55:58,399 --> 02:56:00,070
the fundamental question there is what
does better mean

10788
02:56:00,070 --> 02:56:00,080
does better mean
 

10789
02:56:00,080 --> 02:56:03,269
does better mean

02:56:03,269 --> 02:56:03,279
so it's our striving to understand what
 

10791
02:56:03,279 --> 02:56:03,830
so it's our striving to understand what
is better

10792

is better
 

10793
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:06,710
is better

after we're gone and i think that's

10798
02:56:10,469 --> 02:56:10,479
after we're gone and i think that's
 

10799
02:56:10,479 --> 02:56:11,510
after we're gone and i think that's
another

10800
02:56:11,510 --> 02:56:11,520
another
 

10801
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:13,670
another
thing almost unanswerable question but

from on high here this is
 

10869
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:12,950
from on high here this is
this is the this is the the objective

10870

metaphysical form
 

10877
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:19,750
metaphysical form
somewhere and then you build a building

10878
02:57:19,750 --> 02:57:19,760
somewhere and then you build a building
 

10879
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:21,590
somewhere and then you build a building
with marble and it's big and

10880
02:57:21,590 --> 02:57:21,600
with marble and it's big and
 

10881
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:23,110
with marble and it's big and
usually what happens and then you

10882
02:57:23,110 --> 02:57:23,120
usually what happens and then you
 

10883
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:24,389
usually what happens and then you
convince yourself that that building

10884
02:57:24,389 --> 02:57:24,399
convince yourself that that building
 

10885
02:57:24,399 --> 02:57:25,830
convince yourself that that building
represents i think those people actually

10886

represents i think those people actually
 

10887

represents i think those people actually
under

10888
02:57:26,309 --> 02:57:26,319
under
 

10889
02:57:26,319 --> 02:57:27,510
under
the people who build those buildings

10890
02:57:27,510 --> 02:57:27,520
the people who build those buildings
 

10891
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:28,950
the people who build those buildings
under probably understand that there is

10892
02:57:28,950 --> 02:57:28,960
under probably understand that there is
 

10893
02:57:28,960 --> 02:57:30,950
under probably understand that there is
no musical object they're just like

going to do right like
 

10903
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:37,269
going to do right like
they just they just look at it that way

10904
02:57:37,269 --> 02:57:37,279
they just they just look at it that way
 

10905
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:38,950
they just they just look at it that way
probably i

10906
02:57:38,950 --> 02:57:38,960
probably i
 

10907
02:57:38,960 --> 02:57:41,750
probably i
i i think i think what ends up happening

10908
02:57:41,750 --> 02:57:41,760
i i think i think what ends up happening
 

10909
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:43,349
i i think i think what ends up happening
with with all these values is yeah

10910
02:57:43,349 --> 02:57:43,359
with with all these values is yeah
 

10911
02:57:43,359 --> 02:57:44,469
with with all these values is yeah
people should determine that for

10912
02:57:44,469 --> 02:57:44,479
people should determine that for
 

10913
02:57:44,479 --> 02:57:46,070
people should determine that for
themselves i i agree that there's a

10914
02:57:46,070 --> 02:57:46,080
themselves i i agree that there's a
 

10915
02:57:46,080 --> 02:57:47,590
themselves i i agree that there's a
second order question here of what is

10916
02:57:47,590 --> 02:57:47,600
second order question here of what is
 

10917
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:48,469
second order question here of what is
the best the

10918
02:57:48,469 --> 02:57:48,479
the best the
 

10919
02:57:48,479 --> 02:57:51,429
the best the
the best body of work to work on um

10920
02:57:51,429 --> 02:57:51,439
the best body of work to work on um
 

10921
02:57:51,439 --> 02:57:53,510
the best body of work to work on um
personally i think that's probably a mix

10922
02:57:53,510 --> 02:57:53,520
personally i think that's probably a mix
 

10923
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:54,150
personally i think that's probably a mix
of

10924
02:57:54,150 --> 02:57:54,160
of
 

10925
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:56,870
of
what could you realistically achieve you

10926
02:57:56,870 --> 02:57:56,880
what could you realistically achieve you
 

10927
02:57:56,880 --> 02:57:57,269
what could you realistically achieve you
know

10928
02:57:57,269 --> 02:57:57,279
know
 

10929
02:57:57,279 --> 02:57:58,550
know
is that going to have an impact on

10930
02:57:58,550 --> 02:57:58,560
is that going to have an impact on
 

10931
02:57:58,560 --> 02:58:00,469
is that going to have an impact on
society that you feel good about yeah

10932
02:58:00,469 --> 02:58:00,479
society that you feel good about yeah
 

10933
02:58:00,479 --> 02:58:03,030
society that you feel good about yeah
right so these these are probably the

10934
02:58:03,030 --> 02:58:03,040
right so these these are probably the
 

10935
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:05,030
right so these these are probably the
two aspects of this question and

10936
02:58:05,030 --> 02:58:05,040
two aspects of this question and
 

10937
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:06,710
two aspects of this question and
is this going to have a good impact on

10938
02:58:06,710 --> 02:58:06,720
is this going to have a good impact on
 

10939
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:08,070
is this going to have a good impact on
society that you feel good about

10940
02:58:08,070 --> 02:58:08,080
society that you feel good about
 

10941
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:09,830
society that you feel good about
obviously very subjective right some

10942
02:58:09,830 --> 02:58:09,840
obviously very subjective right some
 

10943
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:11,670
obviously very subjective right some
people save animals some people say

10944
02:58:11,670 --> 02:58:11,680
people save animals some people say
 

10945
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:15,110
people save animals some people say
forests um we and and i are creating

10946
02:58:15,110 --> 02:58:15,120
forests um we and and i are creating
 

10947
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:15,510
forests um we and and i are creating
this

10948
02:58:15,510 --> 02:58:15,520
this
 

10949
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:17,750
this
uh system of economic fairness and

10950
02:58:17,750 --> 02:58:17,760
uh system of economic fairness and
 

10951
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:19,030
uh system of economic fairness and
transparency

10952
02:58:19,030 --> 02:58:19,040
transparency
 

10953
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:21,190
transparency
i feel that i'm in a good position to

10954
02:58:21,190 --> 02:58:21,200
i feel that i'm in a good position to
 

10955
02:58:21,200 --> 02:58:22,870
i feel that i'm in a good position to
enable that

10956
02:58:22,870 --> 02:58:22,880
enable that
 

10957
02:58:22,880 --> 02:58:24,469
enable that
i feel that i have a good chance of

10958
02:58:24,469 --> 02:58:24,479
i feel that i have a good chance of
 

10959
02:58:24,479 --> 02:58:26,469
i feel that i have a good chance of
succeeding at that and i think that the

10960
02:58:26,469 --> 02:58:26,479
succeeding at that and i think that the
 

10961
02:58:26,479 --> 02:58:27,590
succeeding at that and i think that the
impact will be

10962
02:58:27,590 --> 02:58:27,600
impact will be
 

10963
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:29,590
impact will be
quite um quite meaningful for a large

10964
02:58:29,590 --> 02:58:29,600
quite um quite meaningful for a large
 

10965
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:30,630
quite um quite meaningful for a large
number of people

10966
02:58:30,630 --> 02:58:30,640
number of people
 

10967
02:58:30,640 --> 02:58:33,990
number of people
and so i'm completely happy to look back

10968
02:58:33,990 --> 02:58:34,000
and so i'm completely happy to look back
 

10969
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,309
and so i'm completely happy to look back
once i made ian see a body of work that

10970
02:58:36,309 --> 02:58:36,319
once i made ian see a body of work that
 

10971
02:58:36,319 --> 02:58:37,190
once i made ian see a body of work that
achieved that

10972
02:58:37,190 --> 02:58:37,200
achieved that
 

10973
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:38,710
achieved that
and be very proud of that right because

10974
02:58:38,710 --> 02:58:38,720
and be very proud of that right because
 

10975
02:58:38,720 --> 02:58:40,389
and be very proud of that right because
i think that's what i'll be doing

10976
02:58:40,389 --> 02:58:40,399
i think that's what i'll be doing
 

10977
02:58:40,399 --> 02:58:42,550
i think that's what i'll be doing
when i'm looking back so well i agree

10978
02:58:42,550 --> 02:58:42,560
when i'm looking back so well i agree
 

10979
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:45,510
when i'm looking back so well i agree
