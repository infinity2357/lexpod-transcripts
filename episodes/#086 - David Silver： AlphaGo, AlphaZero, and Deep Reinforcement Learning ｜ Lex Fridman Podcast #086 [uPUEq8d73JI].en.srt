00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:19,910
university so I was an undergrad at
 

323
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,630
university so I was an undergrad at
Cambridge and studying computer science

324
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:22,640
Cambridge and studying computer science
 

325
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,670
Cambridge and studying computer science
and and I really started to question you

326
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
and and I really started to question you
 

327
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,470
and and I really started to question you
know what what really are the goals what

328
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:29,480
know what what really are the goals what
 

329
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,790
know what what really are the goals what
what's the goal where do we want to go

330
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
what's the goal where do we want to go
 

331
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,310
what's the goal where do we want to go
with with computer science and it seemed

332
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,320
with with computer science and it seemed
 

333
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,840
with with computer science and it seemed
to me that the the only step of major

334
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:37,850
to me that the the only step of major
 

335
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,100
to me that the the only step of major
significance to take was to try and

336
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,110
significance to take was to try and
 

337
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,690
significance to take was to try and
recreate something akin to human

338
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:43,700
recreate something akin to human
 

339
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,610
recreate something akin to human
intelligence if we could do that that

340
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:45,620
intelligence if we could do that that
 

341
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,790
intelligence if we could do that that
would be a major leap forward and that

342
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
would be a major leap forward and that
 

343
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,770
would be a major leap forward and that
idea certainly wasn't the first to have

344
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:50,780
idea certainly wasn't the first to have
 

345
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,630
idea certainly wasn't the first to have
it but it you know nestled within me

346
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:52,640
it but it you know nestled within me
 

347
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,390
it but it you know nestled within me
somewhere and and became like a bug you

348
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:55,400
somewhere and and became like a bug you
 

349
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,210
somewhere and and became like a bug you
know I really wanted to to crack that

350
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:58,220
know I really wanted to to crack that
 

351
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,160
know I really wanted to to crack that
problem so you thought it was like you

352
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,170
problem so you thought it was like you
 

353
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,900
problem so you thought it was like you
had a notion that this is something that

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:01,910
had a notion that this is something that

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:40,760
interesting games do you remember the
 

387
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,040
interesting games do you remember the
first time you were in the program that

388
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,050
first time you were in the program that
 

389
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,480
first time you were in the program that
beat you in a game said I won't beat you

390
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,490
beat you in a game said I won't beat you
 

391

silver level performance so I used to

394
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:54,919
silver level performance so I used to
 

395
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,950
silver level performance so I used to
work in the games industry so for five

396
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
work in the games industry so for five
 

397
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,070
work in the games industry so for five
years I programmed games for my first

398
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
years I programmed games for my first
 

399
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,189
years I programmed games for my first
job so it was a amazing opportunity to

400
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
job so it was a amazing opportunity to
 

401
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,159
job so it was a amazing opportunity to
get involved in a startup company and so

402
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:06,169
get involved in a startup company and so
 

403
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:10,060
get involved in a startup company and so
I I was involved in in building AI at

404
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,070
I I was involved in in building AI at
 

405
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,719
I I was involved in in building AI at
that time and so for sure there was a

406
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:13,729
that time and so for sure there was a
 

407
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:18,400
that time and so for sure there was a
sense of building handcrafted what

408
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,410
sense of building handcrafted what
 

409
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,810
sense of building handcrafted what
people used to call AI in the games

410
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:19,820
people used to call AI in the games
 

411
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,580
people used to call AI in the games
industry which i think is not really

412
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:21,590
industry which i think is not really
 

413
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,320
industry which i think is not really
what we might think of as AI and its

414
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,330
what we might think of as AI and its
 

415
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,120
what we might think of as AI and its
fullest sense but something which is

416
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,130
fullest sense but something which is
 

417
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,860
fullest sense but something which is
able to to take actions and in a way

418
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:29,870
able to to take actions and in a way
 

419
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,510
able to to take actions and in a way
which which makes things interesting and

420
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
which which makes things interesting and
 

421
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,070
which which makes things interesting and
challenging for their for the for the

422
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,080
challenging for their for the for the
 

423
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,790
challenging for their for the for the
human player and at that time I was able

424
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
human player and at that time I was able
 

425
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
human player and at that time I was able
to build you know these handcrafted

426
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:38,810
to build you know these handcrafted
 

427
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,630
to build you know these handcrafted
agents which in certain limited cases

428
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
agents which in certain limited cases
 

429
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,380
agents which in certain limited cases
could do things which which were able to

430
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,390
could do things which which were able to
 

431
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,120
could do things which which were able to
do better than me but mostly in these

432
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,130
do better than me but mostly in these
 

433
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,070
do better than me but mostly in these
kind of twitch like scenarios where

434
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
kind of twitch like scenarios where
 

435
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,960
kind of twitch like scenarios where
where they were able to do things faster

436
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:49,970
where they were able to do things faster
 

437
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,850
where they were able to do things faster
or because they had some pattern which

438
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:51,860
or because they had some pattern which
 

439
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,690
or because they had some pattern which
was able to exploit repeatedly I think

440
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:55,700
was able to exploit repeatedly I think
 

441
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,870
was able to exploit repeatedly I think
if we're talking about real AI the first

442
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
if we're talking about real AI the first
 

443
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,350
if we're talking about real AI the first
experience for me came after that when I

444
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
experience for me came after that when I
 

445
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,500
experience for me came after that when I
I realized that this path I was on

446
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:05,510
I realized that this path I was on
 

447
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,660
I realized that this path I was on
wasn't taking me towards it wasn't it

448
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:07,670
wasn't taking me towards it wasn't it
 

449
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,370
wasn't taking me towards it wasn't it
wasn't dealing with that bug which I

450
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:09,380
wasn't dealing with that bug which I
 

451
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,590
wasn't dealing with that bug which I
still had inside me to really understand

452
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
still had inside me to really understand
 

453
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,420
still had inside me to really understand
intelligence and try and and try and

454
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,430
intelligence and try and and try and
 

455
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,460
intelligence and try and and try and
solve it everything people were doing in

456
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:15,470
solve it everything people were doing in
 

457
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,920
solve it everything people were doing in
games was you know short-term fixes

458
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:17,930
games was you know short-term fixes
 

459
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,040
games was you know short-term fixes
rather than long-term vision and so I

460
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,050
rather than long-term vision and so I
 

461
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,980
rather than long-term vision and so I
went back to study for my PhD which was

462
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:23,990
went back to study for my PhD which was
 

463
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,960
went back to study for my PhD which was
fairly enough trying to apply

464
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:25,970
fairly enough trying to apply
 

465
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,670
fairly enough trying to apply
reinforcement learning to the game of go

466
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
reinforcement learning to the game of go
 

467
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,910
reinforcement learning to the game of go
and I built my first go program using

468
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:30,920
and I built my first go program using
 

469
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,470
and I built my first go program using
reinforcement learning a system which

470
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
reinforcement learning a system which
 

471
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,630
reinforcement learning a system which
would by trial and error play against

472
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
would by trial and error play against
 

473
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,590
would by trial and error play against
itself and was able to learn

474
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
itself and was able to learn
 

475
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,680
itself and was able to learn
which patterns were actually helpful to

476
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:40,690
which patterns were actually helpful to
 

477
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,150
which patterns were actually helpful to
predict whether it's going to win or

478
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
predict whether it's going to win or
 

479
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,280
predict whether it's going to win or
lose the game and then choose the moves

480
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,290
lose the game and then choose the moves
 

481

639
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,180
and and to me it just blew all of those
other games out of the water it was just

640
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,190
other games out of the water it was just
 

641
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,579
other games out of the water it was just
so deep and profound in its in its

what I discovered was that I could

646
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:22,260
what I discovered was that I could
 

647
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,910
what I discovered was that I could
devote endless hours to this game and I

648
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:26,920
devote endless hours to this game and I
 

649
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,410
devote endless hours to this game and I
knew in my heart of hearts that no

knew in my heart of hearts that no
 

651
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,090

matter how many hours I would devote to
 

653
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,300

it I would never become a you know a

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,310
it I would never become a you know a
 

655
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,790
it I would never become a you know a

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:35,800
grandmaster or there was another path
 

657
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,110
grandmaster or there was another path
and the other path was to try and

658
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
and the other path was to try and
 

659
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,780
and the other path was to try and

necessary and that's why my my PhD topic
 

887
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,950
necessary and that's why my my PhD topic
back then was trying to apply

if I put myself back in there in that

956
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,020
if I put myself back in there in that
 

957
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,280
if I put myself back in there in that
time I just wouldn't think like that

958
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,290
time I just wouldn't think like that
 

959
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,810
time I just wouldn't think like that
without a good demonstration of RL I

960
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:34,820
without a good demonstration of RL I
 

961
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,330
without a good demonstration of RL I
would I would think more in the symbolic

962
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:37,340
would I would think more in the symbolic
 

963
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,850
would I would think more in the symbolic
AI like that though it would not

964
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:39,860
AI like that though it would not

968
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,490
knowledge base like a growing knowledge
 

969
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,980
knowledge base like a growing knowledge
base but it would still be sort of

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:47,990
base but it would still be sort of
 

971
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,789
base but it would still be sort of
pattern based lot like basically have

972
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:51,799
pattern based lot like basically have
 

973
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,130
pattern based lot like basically have
little rules that you kind of assemble

974
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,140
little rules that you kind of assemble
 

975
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,990
little rules that you kind of assemble
together into a large knowledge base

976
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000

979
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,490
well in a sense that was the state of
the art back then so if you look at the

980
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:00,500
the art back then so if you look at the
 

981
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,440
the art back then so if you look at the

different pieces all put together into
 

1015
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,940
different pieces all put together into
this like collage which together would

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:45,950
this like collage which together would
 

1017
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,940
this like collage which together would
try and

1018
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,950
try and
 

1019
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,950
try and
play against a human and although not

1020
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:51,960

all of the pieces were handcrafted the

1022
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
all of the pieces were handcrafted the
 

1023
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,210
all of the pieces were handcrafted the
overall effect was nevertheless still

1024
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:56,220
overall effect was nevertheless still
 

1025
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,650
overall effect was nevertheless still
brittle and it was hard to make all

1026
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:57,660
brittle and it was hard to make all
 

1027
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,530
brittle and it was hard to make all
these pieces work well together and so

1028
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:00,540
these pieces work well together and so
 

1029
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,440
these pieces work well together and so
really what I was pressing for and the

1030
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,450
really what I was pressing for and the
 

1031
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,820
really what I was pressing for and the
main innovation of the approach they

1032
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:04,830
main innovation of the approach they
 

1033
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,980
main innovation of the approach they
took was to go back to first principles

1034
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:06,990
took was to go back to first principles
 

1035
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,040
took was to go back to first principles
and say well let's let's back off that

1036
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,050
and say well let's let's back off that
 

1037
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,560
and say well let's let's back off that
and try and find a principled approach

1038
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:12,570
and try and find a principled approach
 

1039
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,270
and try and find a principled approach
where the system can learn for itself it

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,410
where the system can learn for itself it
just from the outcome like you know

you know very important in those days
 

1061
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,000
you know very important in those days
but unfortunately we were missing some

1062
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,010
but unfortunately we were missing some
 

1063
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,690
but unfortunately we were missing some
important pieces back then so before we

important pieces back then so before we
 

1065
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,780
important pieces back then so before we
dive into may be discussing the beauty

1066

of reinforcement learning let's think

1068
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
of reinforcement learning let's think
 

1069
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,140
of reinforcement learning let's think
it's the back who kind of skipped

1070
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,150
it's the back who kind of skipped
 

1071
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,710
it's the back who kind of skipped
skipped it a bit but the rules of the

1072
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
skipped it a bit but the rules of the
 

1073
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,180
skipped it a bit but the rules of the
game of go what's the the elements of it

1074
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,190
game of go what's the the elements of it
 

1075
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,930
game of go what's the the elements of it
perhaps contrasting to chess that sort

1076
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:02,940
perhaps contrasting to chess that sort

of you really enjoyed as a human being

1078
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,570
of you really enjoyed as a human being
 

1079
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,350
of you really enjoyed as a human being
and also that make it really difficult

1080
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,360
and also that make it really difficult
 

1081
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,370
and also that make it really difficult
as a a I machine learning problem so the

1082
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:13,380
as a a I machine learning problem so the
 

1083
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,440
as a a I machine learning problem so the
game of CO was has remarkably simple

1084
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,450
game of CO was has remarkably simple
 

1085
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,410
game of CO was has remarkably simple
rules if that's so simple that people

1086
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:18,420
rules if that's so simple that people
 

1087
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,290
rules if that's so simple that people
have speculated that if we were to meet

1088
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:20,300
have speculated that if we were to meet
 

1089
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,430
have speculated that if we were to meet
alien life at some point that we

1090
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:22,440
alien life at some point that we
 

1091
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,570
alien life at some point that we
wouldn't be able to communicate with

1092
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:23,580
wouldn't be able to communicate with
 

1093
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,890
wouldn't be able to communicate with
them but we would be able to play hello

1094
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:24,900
them but we would be able to play hello
 

1095
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,930
them but we would be able to play hello
go with that probably have discovered

1096
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:26,940
go with that probably have discovered
 

1097
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,480
go with that probably have discovered
the same rule set yeah so the game is

1098
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,490
the same rule set yeah so the game is
 

1099
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,810
the same rule set yeah so the game is
played on a on a 19 by 19 grid and you

1100
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:32,820
played on a on a 19 by 19 grid and you
 

1101
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,890
played on a on a 19 by 19 grid and you
play on the intersections of the grid

1102
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:33,900
play on the intersections of the grid
 

1103
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,230
play on the intersections of the grid
and the players take turns and the aim

1104
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
and the players take turns and the aim
 

1105
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,910
and the players take turns and the aim
of the game is very simple it's to

1106
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:37,920
of the game is very simple it's to
 

1107
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,880
of the game is very simple it's to
surround as much territory as you can as

1108
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:40,890
surround as much territory as you can as
 

1109
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,650
surround as much territory as you can as
many of these intersections with your

1110
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:42,660
many of these intersections with your
 

1111
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,990
many of these intersections with your
stones and just around more than your

1113
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,870

opponent does and the only nuance to the
 

1115
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,820
opponent does and the only nuance to the
game is that if you fully surround your

1116
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:49,830
game is that if you fully surround your
 

1117
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,230
game is that if you fully surround your
opponent's piece then you get to capture

1118
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,240
opponent's piece then you get to capture
 

1119
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,580
opponent's piece then you get to capture
it and remove it from the board and it

1120
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:52,590
it and remove it from the board and it
 

1121
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,800
it and remove it from the board and it

chess you can kind of assign points to

1194
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:21,900
chess you can kind of assign points to
 

1195
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,310
chess you can kind of assign points to
the different units and it's kind of a

1196
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,320
the different units and it's kind of a
 

1197
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,500
the different units and it's kind of a
pretty good measure of who's one who's

1198
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,510
pretty good measure of who's one who's
 

1199
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,290
pretty good measure of who's one who's
losing it's not so clear yeah so this

games in addition to that has an
 

1247
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,900
games in addition to that has an
enormous search space so there's around

1248
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:20,910
enormous search space so there's around
 

1249
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,330

ten to one hundred and seventy positions
 

1251
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,950
ten to one hundred and seventy positions
in the game of go that's an astronomical

1252
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
in the game of go that's an astronomical
 

1253
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,100
in the game of go that's an astronomical
number and that search spaces is so

1254
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,110
number and that search spaces is so
 

1255
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,930
number and that search spaces is so
great that traditional heuristic search

1269
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,430
life your way of thinking we just talked
about learning but reinforcement

1270
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:46,440
about learning but reinforcement
 

1271
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,200
about learning but reinforcement
learning is very particular kind of

1272
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,210
learning is very particular kind of
 

1273
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,350
learning is very particular kind of
learning one that's both philosophically

1274
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
learning one that's both philosophically
 

1275
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,900
learning one that's both philosophically
sort of profound yeah but also one

1276
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:53,910
sort of profound yeah but also one
 

1277
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,490
sort of profound yeah but also one
that's pretty difficult to get to work

1278
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:55,500
that's pretty difficult to get to work
 

1279
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,770
that's pretty difficult to get to work
as if we look back in the earth at least

1280
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:57,780
as if we look back in the earth at least
 

1281
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,480
as if we look back in the earth at least
the early days so when did that enter

1282
00:25:59,480 --> 00:25:59,490
the early days so when did that enter
 

1283
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,540
the early days so when did that enter
your life and how did that work progress

1284
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:01,550
your life and how did that work progress
 

1285
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,510
your life and how did that work progress
so I had just finished working in the

1286
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
so I had just finished working in the
 

1287
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
so I had just finished working in the
games industry this startup company and

1288
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:07,530
games industry this startup company and
 

1289
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:12,560
games industry this startup company and
I took I took a year out to discover for

1290
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:12,570
I took I took a year out to discover for
 

1291
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,450
I took I took a year out to discover for
myself exactly which path I wanted to

1292
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:14,460
myself exactly which path I wanted to
 

1293
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,030
myself exactly which path I wanted to
take I knew I wanted to study

1294
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,040
take I knew I wanted to study
 

1295
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,080
take I knew I wanted to study
intelligence but I wasn't sure what that

1296
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,090
intelligence but I wasn't sure what that
 

1297
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,240
intelligence but I wasn't sure what that
meant at that stage I really didn't feel

1298
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,250
meant at that stage I really didn't feel
 

1299
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,580
meant at that stage I really didn't feel
had the tools to decide on exactly which

1300
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:22,590
had the tools to decide on exactly which
 

1301
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,310
had the tools to decide on exactly which
path I wants to follow so during that

1302
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:25,320
path I wants to follow so during that
 

1303
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,790
path I wants to follow so during that
year I I read a lot and one of the

1304
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:28,800
year I I read a lot and one of the
 

1305
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,250
year I I read a lot and one of the
things I read was Saturn Umberto the

1306
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,260
things I read was Saturn Umberto the
 

1307
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,710
things I read was Saturn Umberto the
sort of seminal tech spec are an

1308
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:33,720
sort of seminal tech spec are an
 

1309
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,030
sort of seminal tech spec are an
introduction to reinforcement learning

1310
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,040
introduction to reinforcement learning
 

1311
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:41,150
introduction to reinforcement learning
and when I read that textbook I I just

1312
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:41,160
and when I read that textbook I I just
 

1313
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,420
and when I read that textbook I I just
had this resonating feeling that this is

1314
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:44,430
had this resonating feeling that this is
 

1315
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,630
had this resonating feeling that this is
what I understood intelligence to be and

1316
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:47,640
what I understood intelligence to be and
 

1317
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,750
what I understood intelligence to be and
this was the path that I felt would be

1318
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:50,760
this was the path that I felt would be
 

1319
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,200
this was the path that I felt would be
necessary to go down to make progress in

1320
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,210
necessary to go down to make progress in
 

1321
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:59,540
necessary to go down to make progress in
in AI so I got in touch with rich Saturn

1322
00:26:59,540 --> 00:26:59,550
in AI so I got in touch with rich Saturn
 

1323
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,660
in AI so I got in touch with rich Saturn
and asked him if he would be interested

1324
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:02,670
and asked him if he would be interested
 

1325
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,470
and asked him if he would be interested
in supervising me on a PhD thesis in in

1326
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
in supervising me on a PhD thesis in in
 

1327
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,690
in supervising me on a PhD thesis in in
computer go and he he basically said

1328
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:11,700
computer go and he he basically said
 

1329
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,290
computer go and he he basically said
that if he's still alive he'd be happy

1330
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:15,300
that if he's still alive he'd be happy
 

1331
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,040
that if he's still alive he'd be happy
to but unfortunately he'd been you know

1332
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,050
to but unfortunately he'd been you know
 

1333
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,140
to but unfortunately he'd been you know
struggling with very serious cancer for

1334
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,150
struggling with very serious cancer for
 

1335
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,550
struggling with very serious cancer for
some years and he really wasn't

1336
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:22,560
some years and he really wasn't
 

1337
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,350
some years and he really wasn't
confident at that stage that he'd even

1338
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:24,360
confident at that stage that he'd even
 

1339
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,540
confident at that stage that he'd even
be around to see the end event but

1340
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,550
be around to see the end event but
 

1341
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,560
be around to see the end event but
fortunately

1342
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:27,570
fortunately
 

1343
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,210
fortunately
that part of the story worked out very

1344
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,220
that part of the story worked out very
 

1345
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,240
that part of the story worked out very
happily and I found myself out there in

1346
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,250
happily and I found myself out there in
 

1347
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,460
happily and I found myself out there in
Alberta they've got a great games group

1348
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:34,470
Alberta they've got a great games group
 

1349
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,990
Alberta they've got a great games group
out there with a history of fantastic

1350
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
out there with a history of fantastic
 

1351
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,050
out there with a history of fantastic
working in board games as well as rich

1352
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,060
working in board games as well as rich

that in the father of RL so it was the

1354
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:41,400
that in the father of RL so it was the
 

1355
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,250
that in the father of RL so it was the
the natural place for me to go in some

1356
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:43,260
the natural place for me to go in some
 

1357
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,450
the natural place for me to go in some
sense to study this question and the

1358
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:47,460
sense to study this question and the
 

1359
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,430
sense to study this question and the
more I looked into it the more the more

1360
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
more I looked into it the more the more
 

1361
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,390
more I looked into it the more the more
strongly ie

1362
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,400
strongly ie
 

1363
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,710
strongly ie
I felt that this wasn't just the path to

1364
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
I felt that this wasn't just the path to
 

1365
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,020
I felt that this wasn't just the path to
progress in computer go but really you

1366
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,030
progress in computer go but really you
 

1367
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,880
progress in computer go but really you
know this this was the thing I'd been

1368
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:58,890
know this this was the thing I'd been
 

1369
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:04,190
know this this was the thing I'd been
looking for this was really an

1370
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,200
looking for this was really an
 

1371
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,760
looking for this was really an
opportunity to to frame what

1372
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:06,770
opportunity to to frame what
 

1373
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,350
opportunity to to frame what
intelligence means like what does what

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,160
cracked the problem of AI so to you
reinforcement learning ideas at least

00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,090
sort of echoes of it would be at the
 

1389
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,320
sort of echoes of it would be at the
core of intelligence it is as a core of

core of intelligence it is as a core of
 

1391
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,900
core of intelligence it is as a core of
intelligence and if we ever create in a

00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:32,910
intelligence and if we ever create in a
 

1393
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,210
intelligence and if we ever create in a
human level intelligence system it would

human level intelligence system it would
be at the core of that kind of system

be at the core of that kind of system
let me say it this way that I think I

1398
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:38,970
let me say it this way that I think I
 

1399
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,460
let me say it this way that I think I
think it's helpful to separate out the

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,470
think it's helpful to separate out the
 

1401
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,700
think it's helpful to separate out the
problem from the solution so I see the

1402
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:43,710
problem from the solution so I see the
 

1403
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,880
problem from the solution so I see the
problem of intelligence I would say it

1404
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:46,890
problem of intelligence I would say it
 

1405
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,310
problem of intelligence I would say it
can be formalized as the reinforcement

and us as computer scientists to to

1424
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:10,980
and us as computer scientists to to
 

1425
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,060
and us as computer scientists to to
build them and so in that sense I feel

1426
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,070
build them and so in that sense I feel
 

1427
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,820
build them and so in that sense I feel
that it gives us a path maybe not the

1428
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:16,830
that it gives us a path maybe not the
 

1429
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,020
that it gives us a path maybe not the
only path but a path towards AI and so

1430
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,030
only path but a path towards AI and so
 

1431
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,530
only path but a path towards AI and so
do I think that any system in the future

1432
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:24,540
do I think that any system in the future
 

1433
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,170
do I think that any system in the future
that that's you know sold AI would would

1434
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:27,180
that that's you know sold AI would would
 

1435
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,990
that that's you know sold AI would would
have to have RL within it well I think

1436
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,000
have to have RL within it well I think
 

1437
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,640
have to have RL within it well I think
if you ask that you're asking about the

1438
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:31,650
if you ask that you're asking about the
 

1439
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,400
if you ask that you're asking about the
solution methods I would say that if we

1440
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,410
solution methods I would say that if we
 

1441
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,530
solution methods I would say that if we
have such a thing it would be a solution

1442
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:36,540
have such a thing it would be a solution
 

1443
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,840
have such a thing it would be a solution
to the RL problem now what particular

1444
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:38,850
to the RL problem now what particular
 

1445
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,030
to the RL problem now what particular
methods have been used to get there

1446
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,040
methods have been used to get there
 

1447
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,380
methods have been used to get there
well we should keep an open mind about

1448
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:42,390
well we should keep an open mind about
 

1449
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,000
well we should keep an open mind about
the best approaches to actually solve

1450
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,010
the best approaches to actually solve
 

1451
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,090
the best approaches to actually solve
any problem and you know the things we

1452
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:47,100
any problem and you know the things we
 

1453
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,250
any problem and you know the things we
have right now for reinforcement

we take a step back and kind of ask the
 

1483
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,630
we take a step back and kind of ask the
basic question of what is to you

1497
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,500
self is represented by some environment
like the world in which that agent is

1498
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:39,510
like the world in which that agent is
 

1499
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,230
like the world in which that agent is
situated and the goal of RL is clear

1500
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
situated and the goal of RL is clear
 

1501
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,770
situated and the goal of RL is clear
that the agent gets to take actions

1502
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:44,780
that the agent gets to take actions
 

1503
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,910
that the agent gets to take actions
those actions have some effects on the

environment and the environment gives
 

1507
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,000
environment and the environment gives
back an observation to the agent saying

back an observation to the agent saying
you know this is what you see your sense

1510
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:51,740
you know this is what you see your sense
 

1511
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,500
you know this is what you see your sense
and one special thing which it gives

1512
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,510
and one special thing which it gives
 

1513
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,510
and one special thing which it gives
back is it's called the raw signal how

1514
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:56,520
back is it's called the raw signal how
 

1515
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,830
back is it's called the raw signal how
well it's doing in the environment and

1516
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:57,840
well it's doing in the environment and
 

1517
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,400
well it's doing in the environment and
the reinforcement learning problem is to

1518
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,410
the reinforcement learning problem is to
 

1519
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,760
the reinforcement learning problem is to
simply take actions over time so as to

1520
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,770
simply take actions over time so as to
 

1521
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,720
simply take actions over time so as to
maximize that reward signal so a couple

1522
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:08,730
maximize that reward signal so a couple
 

1523
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,680
maximize that reward signal so a couple
of basic questions what types of RL

1524
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:12,690
of basic questions what types of RL
 

1525
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,050
of basic questions what types of RL
approaches are there so I don't know if

1526
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,060
approaches are there so I don't know if
 

1527
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,780
approaches are there so I don't know if
there's a nice brief in words way to

1528
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:17,790
there's a nice brief in words way to
 

1529
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,170
there's a nice brief in words way to
paint the picture of sort of value based

1530
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:21,180
paint the picture of sort of value based
 

1531
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,800
paint the picture of sort of value based
model based policy based reinforcement

1532
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:24,810
model based policy based reinforcement
 

1533
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,260
model based policy based reinforcement
learning yeah so now if we think about

1534
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,270
learning yeah so now if we think about
 

1535
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,680
learning yeah so now if we think about
okay so there's this ambitious problem

1536
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:30,690
okay so there's this ambitious problem
 

1537
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,570
okay so there's this ambitious problem
definition of RL it's really you know

1538
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:32,580
definition of RL it's really you know
 

1539
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,830
definition of RL it's really you know
it's truly ambitious it's trying to

1540
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
it's truly ambitious it's trying to
 

1541
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,510
it's truly ambitious it's trying to
capture and encircle all of the things

1542
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:35,520
capture and encircle all of the things
 

1543
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,220
capture and encircle all of the things
in which an agent interacts with an

1544
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,230
in which an agent interacts with an
 

1545
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,870
in which an agent interacts with an
environment and say well how can we

1546
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:38,880
environment and say well how can we
 

1547
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,280
environment and say well how can we
formalize and understand what it means

1548
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,290
formalize and understand what it means
 

1549
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,650
formalize and understand what it means
to to crack that now let's think about

1550
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:42,660
to to crack that now let's think about
 

1551
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,300
to to crack that now let's think about
the solution method well how do you

1552
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:44,310
the solution method well how do you
 

1553
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,730
the solution method well how do you
solve a really hard problem like that

1554
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:45,740
solve a really hard problem like that
 

1555
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,830
solve a really hard problem like that
well one approach you can take is is to

1556
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:48,840
well one approach you can take is is to
 

1557
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,290
well one approach you can take is is to
decompose that that very hard problem

1558
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:51,300
decompose that that very hard problem
 

1559
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,930
decompose that that very hard problem
into into pieces that work together to

1560
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:53,940
into into pieces that work together to
 

1561
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,900
into into pieces that work together to
solve that hard problem

1562
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:54,910
solve that hard problem
 

1563
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,390
solve that hard problem
and and so you can kind of look at the

1564
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:57,400
and and so you can kind of look at the
 

1565
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,250
and and so you can kind of look at the
decomposition that's inside the agents

1566
00:31:59,250 --> 00:31:59,260
decomposition that's inside the agents
 

1567
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,160
decomposition that's inside the agents
head if you like and ask well what form

1568
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,170
head if you like and ask well what form
 

1569
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,320
head if you like and ask well what form
does that decomposition take and some of

1570
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,330
does that decomposition take and some of
 

1571
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,120
does that decomposition take and some of
the most common pieces that people use

1572
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,130
the most common pieces that people use
 

1573
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,830
the most common pieces that people use
when they're kind of putting this system

1574
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:07,840
when they're kind of putting this system
 

1575
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,960
when they're kind of putting this system
the solution method together some of the

1576
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:09,970
the solution method together some of the
 

1577
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,880
the solution method together some of the
most common pieces that people use are

1578
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:11,890
most common pieces that people use are
 

1579
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,280
most common pieces that people use are
whether or not that solution has a value

1580
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,290
whether or not that solution has a value
 

1581
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,960
whether or not that solution has a value
function that means is it trying to

1582
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:15,970
function that means is it trying to
 

1583
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,120
function that means is it trying to
predict explicitly trying to predict how

1584
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,130
predict explicitly trying to predict how
 

1585
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,310
predict explicitly trying to predict how
much reward it will get in the future

1586
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,320
much reward it will get in the future
 

1587
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,990
much reward it will get in the future
does it have a representation of a

1588
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,000
does it have a representation of a
 

1589
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,150
does it have a representation of a
policy that means something which is

1590
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:24,160
policy that means something which is
 

1591
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,070
policy that means something which is
deciding how to pick actions is is that

1592
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,080
deciding how to pick actions is is that
 

1593
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,840
deciding how to pick actions is is that
decision-making process explicitly

1594
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:27,850
decision-making process explicitly
 

1595
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,530
decision-making process explicitly
represented and is there a model in the

1596
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:31,540
represented and is there a model in the
 

1597
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,940
represented and is there a model in the
system is there something which is

1598
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:32,950
system is there something which is
 

1599
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,740
system is there something which is
explicitly trying to predict what will

1600
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:34,750
explicitly trying to predict what will
 

1601
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,050
explicitly trying to predict what will
happen in the environment and so those

1602
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,060
happen in the environment and so those
 

1603
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,040
happen in the environment and so those
three pieces are to me some of the most

1604
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,050
three pieces are to me some of the most
 

1605
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,060
three pieces are to me some of the most
common building blocks and I understand

1606
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,070
common building blocks and I understand
 

1607
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,330
common building blocks and I understand
the different choices in RL as choices

1608
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:48,340
the different choices in RL as choices
 

1609
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,590
the different choices in RL as choices
of whether or not to use those building

1610
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,600
of whether or not to use those building
 

1611
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,910
of whether or not to use those building
blocks when you're trying to decompose

1612
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:50,920
blocks when you're trying to decompose
 

1613
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,100
blocks when you're trying to decompose
the solution you know should I have a

1614
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,110
the solution you know should I have a
 

1615
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,750
the solution you know should I have a
value function represented so they have

1616
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:54,760
value function represented so they have
 

1617
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,120
value function represented so they have
a policy represented should I have a

1618
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,130
a policy represented should I have a
 

1619
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,860
a policy represented should I have a
model represented and there are

1620
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:58,870
model represented and there are
 

1621
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,480
model represented and there are
combinations of those pieces and of

1622
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:00,490
combinations of those pieces and of
 

1623
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,440
combinations of those pieces and of
course other things that you could add

1624
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,450
course other things that you could add
 

1625
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,330
course other things that you could add
to add into the picture as well but

1626
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:03,340
to add into the picture as well but
 

1627
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,860
to add into the picture as well but
those those three fundamental choices

1628
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:04,870
those those three fundamental choices
 

1629
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,810
those those three fundamental choices
give rise to some of the branches of RL

1630
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:06,820
give rise to some of the branches of RL
 

1631
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,910
give rise to some of the branches of RL
with which we're very familiar and so

1632
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:08,920
with which we're very familiar and so
 

1633
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,730
with which we're very familiar and so
those as you mentioned there is the

1634
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:11,740
those as you mentioned there is the
 

1635
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,390
those as you mentioned there is the
choice of what's specified or modeled

1636
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:15,400
choice of what's specified or modeled
 

1637
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,130
choice of what's specified or modeled
explicitly and the idea is that all of

1638
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,140
explicitly and the idea is that all of
 

1639
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,080
explicitly and the idea is that all of
these are somehow implicitly learned

1640
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,090
these are somehow implicitly learned
 

1641
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,390
these are somehow implicitly learned
within the system so it's almost a

1642
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:24,400
within the system so it's almost a
 

1643
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,590
within the system so it's almost a
choice of how you approach a problem do

1644
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:28,600
choice of how you approach a problem do
 

1645
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,210
choice of how you approach a problem do
you see those as fundamental differences

1646
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:30,220
you see those as fundamental differences
 

1647
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,310
you see those as fundamental differences
or these almost like small specifics

1648
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:35,320
or these almost like small specifics
 

1649
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,140
or these almost like small specifics
like the details of how you saw the

1650
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,150
like the details of how you saw the
 

1651
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,550
like the details of how you saw the
problem but they're not fundamentally

1652
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:38,560
problem but they're not fundamentally
 

1653
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,690
problem but they're not fundamentally
different from each other I think the

1654
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:41,700
different from each other I think the
 

1655
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,180
different from each other I think the
the fundamental idea is is maybe at the

1656
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,190
the fundamental idea is is maybe at the
 

1657
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,150
the fundamental idea is is maybe at the
higher level the fundamental idea is the

1658
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:48,160
higher level the fundamental idea is the
 

1659
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,680
higher level the fundamental idea is the
first step of the decomposition is

1660
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:49,690
first step of the decomposition is
 

1661
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,860
first step of the decomposition is
really to say well how are we really

1662
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,870
really to say well how are we really
 

1663
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,200
really to say well how are we really
going to solve any kind of problem where

1664
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,210
going to solve any kind of problem where
 

1665
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,910
going to solve any kind of problem where
you're trying to figure out how to take

1666
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:56,920
you're trying to figure out how to take
 

1667
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,830
you're trying to figure out how to take
actions and just from a stream of

1668
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:58,840
actions and just from a stream of
 

1669
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,180
actions and just from a stream of
observations you know you've got some

1670
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,190
observations you know you've got some
 

1671
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,680
observations you know you've got some
agents situated it's sensory motor

1672
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:01,690
agents situated it's sensory motor
 

1673
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,660
agents situated it's sensory motor
stream and getting all these

1674
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:03,670
stream and getting all these
 

1675
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,800
stream and getting all these
observations here and getting to take

1676
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:04,810
observations here and getting to take
 

1677
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,090
observations here and getting to take
these actions and and what should it do

1678
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:06,100
these actions and and what should it do
 

1679
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,710
these actions and and what should it do
how can even broach that problem you

1680
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:07,720
how can even broach that problem you
 

1681
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,040
how can even broach that problem you
know me

1682
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,050
know me
 

1683
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,840
know me
the complexity of the world is so great

1684
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:09,850
the complexity of the world is so great
 

1685
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,780
the complexity of the world is so great
that you can't even imagine how to build

1686
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:12,790
that you can't even imagine how to build
 

1687
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,830
that you can't even imagine how to build
a system that would that would

1688
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:13,840
a system that would that would
 

1689
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,110
a system that would that would
understand how to deal with that and so

1690
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,120
understand how to deal with that and so
 

1691
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,850
understand how to deal with that and so
the first step of this decomposition is

1692
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:17,860
the first step of this decomposition is
 

1693
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,890
the first step of this decomposition is
to say well you have to learn the system

1694
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:19,900
to say well you have to learn the system
 

1695
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,919
to say well you have to learn the system
has to learn for itself and so note that

1696
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:22,929
has to learn for itself and so note that
 

1697
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,060
has to learn for itself and so note that
the reinforcement learning problem

1698
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,070
the reinforcement learning problem
 

1699
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,460
the reinforcement learning problem
doesn't actually stipulate that you have

1700
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:26,470
doesn't actually stipulate that you have
 

1701
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,050
doesn't actually stipulate that you have
to learn but you could maximize your

1702
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:28,060
to learn but you could maximize your
 

1703
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,760
to learn but you could maximize your
awards without learning it would just

1704
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:29,770
awards without learning it would just
 

1705
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,500
awards without learning it would just
say wouldn't do a very good job event

1706
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,510
say wouldn't do a very good job event
 

1707
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,890
say wouldn't do a very good job event
yes so learning is required because it's

1708
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:34,900
yes so learning is required because it's
 

1709
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,450
yes so learning is required because it's
the only way to achieve good performance

1710
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:36,460
the only way to achieve good performance
 

1711
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,810
the only way to achieve good performance
in any sufficiently large and complex

1712
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:38,820
in any sufficiently large and complex
 

1713
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,850
in any sufficiently large and complex
environment so so that's the first step

1714
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:41,860
environment so so that's the first step
 

1715
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,070
environment so so that's the first step
so that step give commonality to all of

1716
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,080
so that step give commonality to all of
 

1717
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,930
so that step give commonality to all of
the other pieces because now you might

1718
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:45,940
the other pieces because now you might
 

1719
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,000
the other pieces because now you might
ask well what should you be learning

1720
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,010
ask well what should you be learning
 

1721
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,190
ask well what should you be learning
what is learning even mean you know in

1722
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,200
what is learning even mean you know in
 

1723
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,169
what is learning even mean you know in
this sense you know learning might mean

1724
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:52,179
this sense you know learning might mean
 

1725
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,600
this sense you know learning might mean
well you're trying to update the

1726
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:54,610
well you're trying to update the
 

1727
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,710
well you're trying to update the
parameters of some system which is then

1728
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:58,720
parameters of some system which is then
 

1729
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,790
parameters of some system which is then
the thing that actually picks the

1730
00:34:59,790 --> 00:34:59,800
the thing that actually picks the
 

1731
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,370
the thing that actually picks the
actions and and those parameters could

1732
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:02,380
actions and and those parameters could
 

1733
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,810
actions and and those parameters could
be representing anything they could be

1734
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:03,820
be representing anything they could be
 

1735
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,820
be representing anything they could be
parameterizing a value function or a

1736
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:05,830
parameterizing a value function or a
 

1737
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,330
parameterizing a value function or a
model or a policy and so in that sense

1738
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:09,340
model or a policy and so in that sense
 

1739
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,070
model or a policy and so in that sense
there's a lot of commonality in that

1740
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,080
there's a lot of commonality in that
 

1741
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,450
there's a lot of commonality in that
whatever is being represented there is

1742
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:12,460
whatever is being represented there is
 

1743
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,680
whatever is being represented there is
the thing which is being learned and

1744
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:13,690
the thing which is being learned and
 

1745
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,480
the thing which is being learned and
it's being learned with the ultimate

1746
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:15,490
it's being learned with the ultimate
 

1747
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,840
it's being learned with the ultimate
goal of maximizing rewards but but the

1748
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:18,850
goal of maximizing rewards but but the
 

1749
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,010
goal of maximizing rewards but but the
way in which you decompose the problem

1750
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,020
way in which you decompose the problem
 

1751
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,380
way in which you decompose the problem
is is is really what gives the semantics

1752
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:22,390
is is is really what gives the semantics
 

1753
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,760
is is is really what gives the semantics
to the whole system like are you trying

1754
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:23,770
to the whole system like are you trying
 

1755
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,420
to the whole system like are you trying
to learn something to predict well like

1756
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:27,430
to learn something to predict well like
 

1757
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,710
to learn something to predict well like
a value function or a model are you

1758
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:28,720
a value function or a model are you
 

1759
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,150
a value function or a model are you
learning something to perform well like

1760
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,160
learning something to perform well like
 

1761
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,850
learning something to perform well like
a policy and and the form of that

1762
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:32,860
a policy and and the form of that
 

1763
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,740
a policy and and the form of that
objective like it's kind of giving the

1764
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:34,750
objective like it's kind of giving the
 

1765
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,020
objective like it's kind of giving the
semantics to the system and so it really

1766
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,030
semantics to the system and so it really
 

1767
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,930
semantics to the system and so it really
is at the next level down a fundamental

1768
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,940
is at the next level down a fundamental
 

1769
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,100
is at the next level down a fundamental
choice and we have to make those

1770
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,110
choice and we have to make those
 

1771
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,770
choice and we have to make those
fundamental choices a system designers

1772
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:43,780
fundamental choices a system designers
 

1773
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,410
fundamental choices a system designers
or enable are our algorithms to be able

or enable are our algorithms to be able
 

1775
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,270
or enable are our algorithms to be able
to learn how to make those choices for

1893
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,769
you still believe it works as well as it
does do you have good intuition about

00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:12,779
does do you have good intuition about
 

1895
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:16,039
does do you have good intuition about
why it works at all and works as well as

why it works at all and works as well as
 

1897
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:22,039
why it works at all and works as well as
it does I think let me take two parts to

1898
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:22,049
it does I think let me take two parts to
 

1899
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:26,569
it does I think let me take two parts to
that question I think it's not

1900
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:26,579
that question I think it's not
 

1901
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,759
that question I think it's not
surprising to me that the idea of

1902
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:28,769
surprising to me that the idea of
 

1903
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:31,130
surprising to me that the idea of
reinforcement learning works because in

1904
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,140
reinforcement learning works because in
 

1905
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,630
reinforcement learning works because in
some sense I think it's the I feel it's

00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:35,640
some sense I think it's the I feel it's

is a surprising and beautiful property

1982
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:11,760
is a surprising and beautiful property
 

1983
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,520
is a surprising and beautiful property
of neural nets which I find elegant and

00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:16,530
of neural nets which I find elegant and
 

1985
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,040
of neural nets which I find elegant and
beautiful and and somewhat shocking that

1986
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,050
beautiful and and somewhat shocking that
 

1987
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,560
beautiful and and somewhat shocking that
it turns out to be the case as you said

1988
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:21,570
it turns out to be the case as you said
 

1989
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,780
it turns out to be the case as you said
which I really like to our low

1990
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:23,790
which I really like to our low
 

1991
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,829
which I really like to our low
dimensional intuitions that's surprising

1992
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839
dimensional intuitions that's surprising
 

1993
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,579
dimensional intuitions that's surprising
yeah yeah we're very we're very tuned to

1994
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:31,589
yeah yeah we're very we're very tuned to
 

1995
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:33,800
yeah yeah we're very we're very tuned to
working within a three-dimensional

1996
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:33,810
working within a three-dimensional
 

1997
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,380
working within a three-dimensional
environment and so to start to visualize

1998
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,390
environment and so to start to visualize
 

1999
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,900
environment and so to start to visualize
what a billion dimensional neural

2000
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:38,910
what a billion dimensional neural
 

2001
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,260
what a billion dimensional neural
network um surface that you're trying to

2002
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:42,270
network um surface that you're trying to
 

2003
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,180
network um surface that you're trying to
optimize over what that even looks like

2004
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,190
optimize over what that even looks like
 

2005
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,730
optimize over what that even looks like
is very hard for us and so I think that

2006
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:46,740
is very hard for us and so I think that
 

2007
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,760
is very hard for us and so I think that
really if you try to account for

2008
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:49,770
really if you try to account for
 

2009
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,440
really if you try to account for
the essentially the AI winter where

2010
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:54,450
the essentially the AI winter where
 

2011
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,600
the essentially the AI winter where
where people gave up on Yule networks I

2012
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:56,610
where people gave up on Yule networks I
 

2013
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,640
where people gave up on Yule networks I
think it's really down to that that lack

2014
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:58,650
think it's really down to that that lack
 

2015
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,940
think it's really down to that that lack
of ability to generalize from from low

2016
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:01,950
of ability to generalize from from low
 

2017
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,500
of ability to generalize from from low
dimensions to high dimensions because

2018
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:03,510
dimensions to high dimensions because
 

2019
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,060
dimensions to high dimensions because
back then we were in the low dimensional

2020
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,070
back then we were in the low dimensional
 

2021
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,100
back then we were in the low dimensional
case people could only build neural nets

2022
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,110
case people could only build neural nets
 

2023
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,730
case people could only build neural nets
with you know 50 nodes in them or

2024
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:10,740
with you know 50 nodes in them or
 

2025
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,400
with you know 50 nodes in them or
something and to to imagine that it

2026
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,410
something and to to imagine that it
 

2027
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,990
something and to to imagine that it
might be possible to build a billion

2028
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:15,000
might be possible to build a billion
 

2029
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,609
might be possible to build a billion
dimension on your net and it might have

2030
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:16,619
dimension on your net and it might have
 

2031
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,109
dimension on your net and it might have
a completely different qualitatively

2032
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:18,119
a completely different qualitatively
 

2033
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,060
a completely different qualitatively
different property was very hard to

2034
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,070
different property was very hard to
 

2035
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,700
different property was very hard to
anticipate and I think even now we're

2036
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:22,710
anticipate and I think even now we're
 

2037
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,710
anticipate and I think even now we're
starting to build the the theory to

2038
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:24,720
starting to build the the theory to
 

2039
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,770
starting to build the the theory to
support that and and it's incomplete at

2040
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:27,780
support that and and it's incomplete at
 

2041
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,480
support that and and it's incomplete at
the moment but all of the theory seems

2042
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:29,490
the moment but all of the theory seems
 

2043
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,040
the moment but all of the theory seems
to be pointing in the direction that

2044
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,050
to be pointing in the direction that
 

2045
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,380
to be pointing in the direction that
indeed this is an approach which which

2046
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:33,390
indeed this is an approach which which
 

2047
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,240
indeed this is an approach which which

that a position could be evaluated or a

that a position could be evaluated or a
 

2171
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,880
that a position could be evaluated or a

00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,930

by humans saying whether that position

by humans saying whether that position
is good or not or even humans providing

is good or not or even humans providing

rules as to how you might evaluate it

00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,850
rules as to how you might evaluate it
but instead by allowing the system to

2180
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:40,860
but instead by allowing the system to
 

2181
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,930
but instead by allowing the system to
randomly play out the game until the end

2182
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:43,940
randomly play out the game until the end
 

2183
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,790
randomly play out the game until the end
multiple times and taking the average of

2184
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
multiple times and taking the average of
 

2185
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,730
multiple times and taking the average of
those outcomes as the prediction of what

2186
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:49,740
those outcomes as the prediction of what
 

2187
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,010
those outcomes as the prediction of what
will happen so for example if you're in

2188
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:52,020
will happen so for example if you're in
 

2189
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,080
will happen so for example if you're in
the game of go the intuition is that you

2190
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,090
the game of go the intuition is that you
 

2191
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,579
the game of go the intuition is that you
take a position

2192
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:55,589
take a position
 

2193
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:57,410
take a position
and you get the system to kind of play

2194
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:57,420
and you get the system to kind of play
 

2195
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,239
and you get the system to kind of play
random moves against itself all the way

00:44:59,239 --> 00:44:59,249
random moves against itself all the way
 

2197
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:00,529
random moves against itself all the way
to the end of the game and you see who

2198
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:00,539
to the end of the game and you see who
 

2199
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:03,319
to the end of the game and you see who
wins and if black ends up winning more

2200
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:03,329
wins and if black ends up winning more
 

2201
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:05,269

00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:20,700
was known as Monte Carlo search and a
 

2213
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,430
was known as Monte Carlo search and a
particular form of Monte Carlo search

particular form of Monte Carlo search
 

2215
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,559
particular form of Monte Carlo search
that became very effective and was

that became very effective and was
 

2217
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:26,749
that became very effective and was
developed in computer go first by Remy

Carlo tree search which basically takes

2224
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:34,469
Carlo tree search which basically takes
 

2225
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:37,819
Carlo tree search which basically takes
that same idea and uses that that

of the random play outs from that from
 

2233
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,380
of the random play outs from that from
that node onwards and this idea was very

00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:48,390
that node onwards and this idea was very
 

2235
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:51,079
that node onwards and this idea was very
powerful and suddenly led to huge leaps

00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:51,089
powerful and suddenly led to huge leaps
 

2237
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:52,700

it's it's truly remarkable that random
 

2271

2277
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,239
deterministic game that's very precise
and involves these very exact sequences

00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
why is it that that random randomization
 

2281
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,180
why is it that that random randomization
is helpful and so the intuition is that

2282
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,190
is helpful and so the intuition is that
 

2283
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,190
is helpful and so the intuition is that
randomization captures something about

2284
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,200
randomization captures something about
 

2285
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,489
randomization captures something about
the the nature of the of the search tree

2286
00:46:58,489 --> 00:46:58,499
the the nature of the of the search tree
 

2287
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:00,979
the the nature of the of the search tree
that from a position that you're you're

using randomization and this was a very
 

2295
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,800
using randomization and this was a very
powerful idea

2296
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:08,810
powerful idea
 

2297
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,730
powerful idea
and I've seen this in other spaces talk

2298
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:12,740
and I've seen this in other spaces talk
 

2299

seems to be a useful thing but so from
 

2313
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,070
seems to be a useful thing but so from
that moment can you maybe tell the

that moment can you maybe tell the
 

2315
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,350
that moment can you maybe tell the

the key challenge of how can you build

2362
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:44,539
the key challenge of how can you build
 

2363
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:47,109
the key challenge of how can you build
that intuition and how can you just have

2364
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:47,119
that intuition and how can you just have
 

2365
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,609
that intuition and how can you just have
a system that could look at a position

2366
00:48:48,609 --> 00:48:48,619
a system that could look at a position
 

2367
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:51,609
a system that could look at a position
and understand what moved to play or or

2368
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:51,619
and understand what moved to play or or
 

2369
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:53,109
and understand what moved to play or or
how well you're doing in that position

2370
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
how well you're doing in that position
 

2371
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,859
how well you're doing in that position
who's going to win and so the deep

2372
00:48:56,859 --> 00:48:56,869
who's going to win and so the deep
 

2373
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:59,260
who's going to win and so the deep
learning Revolution had just begun their

2374
00:48:59,260 --> 00:48:59,270
learning Revolution had just begun their
 

2375
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,099
learning Revolution had just begun their
systems like imagenet had suddenly been

2376
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:03,109
systems like imagenet had suddenly been
 

2377
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:04,809
systems like imagenet had suddenly been
won by deep learning techniques back in

2378
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:04,819
won by deep learning techniques back in
 

2379
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:08,079
won by deep learning techniques back in
2012 and following that it was natural

2380
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:08,089
2012 and following that it was natural
 

2381
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:10,599
2012 and following that it was natural
to ask well you know if if deep learning

2382
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:10,609
to ask well you know if if deep learning
 

2383
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:12,579
to ask well you know if if deep learning
is able to scale up so effectively with

2384
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:12,589
is able to scale up so effectively with
 

2385
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:14,710
is able to scale up so effectively with
images to to understand them enough to

2386
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:14,720
images to to understand them enough to
 

2387
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,609
images to to understand them enough to
to classify them well why not go why why

2388
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:18,619
to classify them well why not go why why
 

2389
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:21,940
to classify them well why not go why why
not take a the black and white stones of

2390
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:21,950
not take a the black and white stones of
 

2391
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,710
not take a the black and white stones of
the NGO board and build some a system

2392
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:23,720
the NGO board and build some a system
 

2393
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,539
the NGO board and build some a system
which can understand for itself what

2394
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:25,549
which can understand for itself what
 

2395
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,160
which can understand for itself what
that means in terms of what moved to

2396
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:27,170
that means in terms of what moved to
 

2397
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,900
that means in terms of what moved to
pick or who's going to win the game

2398
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:28,910
pick or who's going to win the game
 

2399
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,720
pick or who's going to win the game
black or white and so that was our

2400
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:31,730
black or white and so that was our
 

2401
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,490
black or white and so that was our
scientific question which we we were

2402
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:33,500
scientific question which we we were
 

2403
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,250
scientific question which we we were
probing and trying to understand and as

2404
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:36,260
probing and trying to understand and as
 

2405
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,529
probing and trying to understand and as
we started to look at it we discovered

2406
00:49:38,529 --> 00:49:38,539
we started to look at it we discovered
 

2407
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:41,019
we started to look at it we discovered
that we could build a a system so in

2408
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:41,029
that we could build a a system so in
 

2409
00:49:41,029 --> 00:49:43,329
that we could build a a system so in
fact our very first paper on alphago was

2410
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:43,339
fact our very first paper on alphago was
 

2411
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:46,170
fact our very first paper on alphago was
actually a pure deep learning system

2412
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:46,180
actually a pure deep learning system
 

2413
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,789
actually a pure deep learning system
which was trying to answer this question

2414
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:48,799
which was trying to answer this question
 

2415
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,819
which was trying to answer this question
and we showed that actually a pure deep

2416
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:51,829
and we showed that actually a pure deep
 

2417
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:53,289
and we showed that actually a pure deep
learning system with no search at all

2418
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:53,299
learning system with no search at all
 

2419
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:56,859
learning system with no search at all
was actually able to reach human van

2420
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:56,869
was actually able to reach human van
 

2421
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,019
was actually able to reach human van

2425
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,990
go 19 by 19 boards and so without any
search at all suddenly we had systems

2426
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:05,000
search at all suddenly we had systems
 

2427
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,940
search at all suddenly we had systems
which were playing at the level of the

2428
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:06,950
which were playing at the level of the
 

2429
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:10,180
which were playing at the level of the
best Monte Carlo tree search systems the

2430
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,190
best Monte Carlo tree search systems the
 

2431
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,099
best Monte Carlo tree search systems the
ones with randomized rollouts so first

2432
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:12,109
ones with randomized rollouts so first
 

2433
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,319
ones with randomized rollouts so first
I'm sorry to interrupt but there's kind

2434
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:14,329
I'm sorry to interrupt but there's kind
 

2435
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:16,930
I'm sorry to interrupt but there's kind
of a groundbreaking notion let's say

2436
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:16,940
of a groundbreaking notion let's say
 

2437
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,990
of a groundbreaking notion let's say
that's like basically a definitive step

2438
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,000
that's like basically a definitive step
 

2439
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,750
that's like basically a definitive step
away from the a couple of decades of

2440
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:22,760
away from the a couple of decades of
 

2441
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,410
away from the a couple of decades of
essentially search dominating AI yeah so

2442
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:26,420
essentially search dominating AI yeah so
 

2443
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,720
essentially search dominating AI yeah so
what how do them make you feel would you

2444
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:28,730
what how do them make you feel would you
 

2445
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,819
what how do them make you feel would you
that was a surprising from a scientific

2446
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:30,829
that was a surprising from a scientific
 

2447
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:33,460
that was a surprising from a scientific
perspective in general how to make you

2448
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:33,470
perspective in general how to make you
 

2449
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,859
perspective in general how to make you
feel I I found this to be profoundly

2450
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:35,869
feel I I found this to be profoundly
 

2451
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,079
feel I I found this to be profoundly
surprising in fact it was so surprising

2452
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:38,089
surprising in fact it was so surprising
 

2453
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:41,470
surprising in fact it was so surprising
that that we had a bet back then and

2454
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:41,480
that that we had a bet back then and
 

2455
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,690
that that we had a bet back then and
like many good projects you know bets

2456
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:43,700
like many good projects you know bets
 

2457
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,880
like many good projects you know bets
are quite motivating and Anna bet was

2458
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:45,890
are quite motivating and Anna bet was
 

2459
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,539
are quite motivating and Anna bet was
you know whether it was possible for a

2460
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:48,549
you know whether it was possible for a
 

2461
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:50,170
you know whether it was possible for a
system

2462
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:50,180
system
 

2463
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,630
system
purely on on deep learning no search at

2464
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:52,640
purely on on deep learning no search at
 

2465
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,440
purely on on deep learning no search at
all to beat a Dan level human player and

2466
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:56,450
all to beat a Dan level human player and
 

2467
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,170
all to beat a Dan level human player and
so we had someone who joined our team

2468
00:50:59,170 --> 00:50:59,180
so we had someone who joined our team
 

2469
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,510
so we had someone who joined our team
who was a damn level player he came in

2470
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:01,520
who was a damn level player he came in
 

2471
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,080
who was a damn level player he came in
and and we had this first match against

2472
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,090
and and we had this first match against
 

2473
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,870
and and we had this first match against
him and we turned the bit where you want

2474
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:07,880
him and we turned the bit where you want
 

2475
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,030
him and we turned the bit where you want
by the way do you handle losing and they

2476
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:10,040
by the way do you handle losing and they
 

2477
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,700
by the way do you handle losing and they
were in except I tend to be an optimist

2478
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:12,710
were in except I tend to be an optimist
 

2479
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:16,090
were in except I tend to be an optimist
with the with the power of of deep

2480
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:16,100
with the with the power of of deep
 

2481
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,990
with the with the power of of deep
learning and reinforcement learning so

2482
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:19,000
learning and reinforcement learning so
 

2483
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,880
learning and reinforcement learning so
the system won and we were able to beat

2484
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:21,890
the system won and we were able to beat
 

2485
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:24,580
the system won and we were able to beat
this human Dan level player and for me

2486
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:24,590
this human Dan level player and for me
 

2487
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,230
this human Dan level player and for me
that was the moment where where it's

2488
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,240
that was the moment where where it's
 

2489
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,510
that was the moment where where it's
like okay something something special is

2490
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:28,520
like okay something something special is
 

2491
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,570
like okay something something special is
afoot here we have a system which

2492
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:30,580
afoot here we have a system which
 

2493
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,240
afoot here we have a system which
without search is able to to already

2494
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:34,250
without search is able to to already
 

2495
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,190
without search is able to to already
just look at this position and

2496
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:36,200
just look at this position and
 

2497
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,170
just look at this position and
understand things as well as a strong

2498
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:38,180
understand things as well as a strong
 

2499
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,840
understand things as well as a strong
human player and from that point onwards

2500
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:40,850
human player and from that point onwards
 

2501
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:45,340
human player and from that point onwards
I really felt that reaching that

2502
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:45,350
I really felt that reaching that
 

2503
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,100
I really felt that reaching that
reaching the top levels of human play

2504
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,110
reaching the top levels of human play
 

2505
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,110
reaching the top levels of human play
you know professional level world

2506
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:50,120
you know professional level world
 

2507
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,910
you know professional level world
champion level I felt it was actually an

2508
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920
champion level I felt it was actually an
 

2509
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,340
champion level I felt it was actually an
inevitability and and if it was an

2510
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:57,350
inevitability and and if it was an
 

2511
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,080
inevitability and and if it was an
inevitable outcome

2512
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,090
inevitable outcome
 

2513
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,510
inevitable outcome
I was rather keen it would be us that

2514
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:01,520
I was rather keen it would be us that
 

2515
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,620
I was rather keen it would be us that
achieve it so we scaled up this was

2516
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:05,630
achieve it so we scaled up this was
 

2517
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:08,290
achieve it so we scaled up this was
something where you know so I had lots

2518
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:08,300
something where you know so I had lots
 

2519
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,450
something where you know so I had lots
of conversations back then with demo so

2520
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:10,460
of conversations back then with demo so
 

2521
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,710
of conversations back then with demo so
service that the head of deepmind who

2522
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:14,720
service that the head of deepmind who
 

2523
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,760
service that the head of deepmind who
was extremely excited and we we made the

2524
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:18,770
was extremely excited and we we made the
 

2525
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:21,070
was extremely excited and we we made the
decision to to scale up the project

2526
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:21,080
decision to to scale up the project
 

2527
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,820
decision to to scale up the project
brought more people on board and and so

2528
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:24,830
brought more people on board and and so
 

2529
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:28,900
brought more people on board and and so
alphago became something where where we

2530
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:28,910
alphago became something where where we
 

2531
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,930
alphago became something where where we
we had a clear goal which was to try and

2532
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:30,940
we had a clear goal which was to try and
 

2533
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,520
we had a clear goal which was to try and
crack this outstanding challenge of AI

2534
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:33,530
crack this outstanding challenge of AI
 

2535
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,460
crack this outstanding challenge of AI
to see if we could beat the world's best

2536
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:36,470
to see if we could beat the world's best
 

2537
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,770
to see if we could beat the world's best
players and this led within the space of

2538
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:40,780
players and this led within the space of
 

2539
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,870
players and this led within the space of
not so many months to playing against

2540
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:43,880
not so many months to playing against
 

2541
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,840
not so many months to playing against
the European champion fan way in a match

00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:46,850
the European champion fan way in a match
 

2543
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:48,700
the European champion fan way in a match
which became you know memorable in

history is the first time a go program

2546
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:50,690
history is the first time a go program
 

2547
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,720
history is the first time a go program
would ever beated a a professional

2548
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:52,730
would ever beated a a professional
 

2549
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,690
would ever beated a a professional
player and at that time we had to make a

2550
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:55,700
player and at that time we had to make a
 

2551
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,930
player and at that time we had to make a
judgment as to whether when and and

2552
00:52:58,930 --> 00:52:58,940
judgment as to whether when and and
 

2553
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,460
judgment as to whether when and and
whether we should go and challenge the

2554
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:00,470
whether we should go and challenge the
 

2555
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,740
whether we should go and challenge the
world champion and and this was a

2556
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:02,750
world champion and and this was a
 

2557
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,570
world champion and and this was a
difficult

2558
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:03,580
difficult
 

2559
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,700
difficult
to make again we were basing our

00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:08,340
predictions on on our own progress and
 

2563
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,340
predictions on on our own progress and
had to estimate based on the rapidity of

00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:11,350
had to estimate based on the rapidity of
 

2565
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,690
had to estimate based on the rapidity of

our own progress when we thought we
 

2567
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,470
our own progress when we thought we
would exceeds the level of the human

2568
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:16,480
would exceeds the level of the human
 

2569
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,870
would exceeds the level of the human
world champion and and we tried to make

2570
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:18,880
world champion and and we tried to make
 

2571
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,940
world champion and and we tried to make
an estimate and set up a match and that

2572
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:20,950
an estimate and set up a match and that
 

2573
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,580
an estimate and set up a match and that

alphago involves both learning from

2584
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:43,620
alphago involves both learning from
 

2585
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:49,470
alphago involves both learning from
expert games and as far as I remember a

2586
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:49,480
expert games and as far as I remember a
 

2587
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,930
expert games and as far as I remember a
self play component - where he learns by

2588
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:51,940
self play component - where he learns by
 

2589
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,410
self play component - where he learns by
playing guess himself but in your sense

2590
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:55,420
playing guess himself but in your sense
 

2591
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,630
playing guess himself but in your sense
what was the role of learning from

2592
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:57,640
what was the role of learning from
 

2593
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,540
what was the role of learning from
experts there and in terms of your self

2594
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:00,550
experts there and in terms of your self
 

2595
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,520
experts there and in terms of your self

00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,520
evaluation whether you can take on the

2598
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:05,530
world champion what was the thing that
 

2599
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,230

they're trying to do more of sort of

2600
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:07,240
they're trying to do more of sort of
 

2601
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,810
they're trying to do more of sort of
train more on expert games or was

00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:09,820
train more on expert games or was

train more on expert games or was
there's now another I'm asking so many

2604
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:13,590
there's now another I'm asking so many
 

2605
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:18,000
there's now another I'm asking so many
poorly faced questions but did you have

2606
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,010
poorly faced questions but did you have
 

2607
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,830
poorly faced questions but did you have
a hope a dream that self play would be

2608
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:19,840
a hope a dream that self play would be
 

2609
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,600
a hope a dream that self play would be
the key component at that moment yet so

2610
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:24,610
the key component at that moment yet so
 

2611
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:27,450
the key component at that moment yet so
in the early days of alphago we we used

2612
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:27,460
in the early days of alphago we we used
 

2613
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,850
in the early days of alphago we we used
human data to explore the science of

2614
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:29,860
human data to explore the science of
 

2615
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,620
human data to explore the science of
what deep learning can achieve and so

2616
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:31,630
what deep learning can achieve and so
 

2617
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:33,480
what deep learning can achieve and so
when we had our first paper that showed

2618
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:33,490
when we had our first paper that showed
 

2619
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:37,200
when we had our first paper that showed
that it was possible to predict the

2620
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,210
that it was possible to predict the
 

2621
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,550
that it was possible to predict the
winner of the game that it was possible

2622
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:38,560
winner of the game that it was possible
 

2623
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,320
winner of the game that it was possible
to suggest moves that was done using

2624
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:40,330
to suggest moves that was done using
 

2625
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,900
to suggest moves that was done using
human data of solely human did yes and

2626
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:42,910
human data of solely human did yes and
 

2627
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,790
human data of solely human did yes and
and and and so the reason that we did it

2628
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:44,800
and and and so the reason that we did it
 

2629
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,230
and and and so the reason that we did it
that way was at that time we were

2630
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,240
that way was at that time we were
 

2631
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:46,980
that way was at that time we were
exploring

2632
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:46,990
exploring
 

2633
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,170
exploring
separately the deep learning aspect from

2634
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:49,180
separately the deep learning aspect from
 

2635
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,270
separately the deep learning aspect from
the reinforcement learning aspect that

2636
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:51,280
the reinforcement learning aspect that
 

2637
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,010
the reinforcement learning aspect that
was the part which was which was new and

2638
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:53,020
was the part which was which was new and
 

2639
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:56,130
was the part which was which was new and
unknown to me at that time was how far

2640
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:56,140
unknown to me at that time was how far
 

2641
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:59,040
unknown to me at that time was how far
could that be stretched once we had that

2642
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,050
could that be stretched once we had that
 

2643
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,470
could that be stretched once we had that
it then became natural to try and use

2644
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:01,480
it then became natural to try and use
 

2645
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,570
it then became natural to try and use
that same representation and see if we

2646
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:03,580
that same representation and see if we
 

2647
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,310
that same representation and see if we
could learn for ourselves using that

2648
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:05,320
could learn for ourselves using that
 

2649
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,260
could learn for ourselves using that
same representation and so right from

2650
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:07,270
same representation and so right from
 

2651
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,590
same representation and so right from
the beginning actually our goal had been

2652
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:10,600
the beginning actually our goal had been
 

2653
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,490
the beginning actually our goal had been
to build a system using self play and to

2654
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:14,500
to build a system using self play and to
 

2655
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,200
to build a system using self play and to
us the human data right from the

2656
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:16,210
us the human data right from the
 

2657
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,190
us the human data right from the
beginning was

2658
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:17,200
beginning was
 

2659
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,770
beginning was
an expedient step to help us for

2660
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:19,780
an expedient step to help us for
 

2661
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,020
an expedient step to help us for
pragmatic reasons to go faster towards

2662
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,030
pragmatic reasons to go faster towards
 

2663
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:24,960
pragmatic reasons to go faster towards
the goals of the project then we might

2664
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:24,970
the goals of the project then we might
 

2665
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,609
the goals of the project then we might
be able to starting solely from self

2666
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:26,619
be able to starting solely from self
 

2667
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:29,370
be able to starting solely from self
play and so in those days we were very

2668
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:29,380
play and so in those days we were very
 

2669
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,099
play and so in those days we were very
aware that we were choosing to to use

2670
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:32,109
aware that we were choosing to to use
 

2671
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:33,690
aware that we were choosing to to use
human data and that might not be the

2672
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:33,700
human data and that might not be the
 

2673
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:38,370
human data and that might not be the
long-term holy grail of AI but that it

2674
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:38,380
long-term holy grail of AI but that it
 

2675
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,500
long-term holy grail of AI but that it
was something which was extremely useful

2676
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:40,510
was something which was extremely useful
 

2677
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:41,880
was something which was extremely useful
to us it helped us to understand the

2678
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:41,890
to us it helped us to understand the
 

2679
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,530
to us it helped us to understand the
system helped us to build deep learning

2680
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:43,540
system helped us to build deep learning
 

2681
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,960
system helped us to build deep learning
representations which were clear and

2682
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:45,970
representations which were clear and
 

2683
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,990
representations which were clear and
simple and easy to use and so really I

2684
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:49,000
simple and easy to use and so really I
 

2685
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,140
simple and easy to use and so really I
would say it's it served a purpose not

2686
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:52,150
would say it's it served a purpose not
 

2687
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,430
would say it's it served a purpose not
just as part of the algorithm but

2688
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:53,440
just as part of the algorithm but
 

2689
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,319
just as part of the algorithm but
something which I continued to use in

2690
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:55,329
something which I continued to use in
 

2691
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:57,390
something which I continued to use in
our research today which is trying to

2692
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:57,400
our research today which is trying to
 

2693
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,299
our research today which is trying to
break down a very hard challenge into

2694
00:56:00,299 --> 00:56:00,309
break down a very hard challenge into
 

2695
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:01,799
break down a very hard challenge into
pieces which are easier to understand

2696
00:56:01,799 --> 00:56:01,809
pieces which are easier to understand
 

2697
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:04,380
pieces which are easier to understand
for us as researchers and develop so if

2698
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:04,390
for us as researchers and develop so if
 

2699
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,690
for us as researchers and develop so if
you if you use a component based on

2700
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:06,700
you if you use a component based on
 

2701
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,910
you if you use a component based on
human data it can help you to understand

2702
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:08,920
human data it can help you to understand
 

2703
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,220
human data it can help you to understand
the system such that then you can build

2704
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:11,230
the system such that then you can build
 

2705
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,809
the system such that then you can build
the more principled version later that

2706
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:12,819
the more principled version later that
 

2707
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:17,460
the more principled version later that
does it for itself so as I said the

2708
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:17,470
does it for itself so as I said the
 

2709
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,549
does it for itself so as I said the
alphago victory and I don't think I'm

2710
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:20,559
alphago victory and I don't think I'm
 

2711
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,549
alphago victory and I don't think I'm
being sort of romanticizing this notion

2712
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:23,559
being sort of romanticizing this notion
 

2713
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:25,109
being sort of romanticizing this notion
I think is one of the greatest moments

2714
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:25,119
I think is one of the greatest moments
 

2715
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,280
I think is one of the greatest moments
in the history of AI

2716
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:26,290
in the history of AI
 

2717
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,789
in the history of AI
so were you cognizant of this magnitude

2718
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:29,799
so were you cognizant of this magnitude
 

2719
00:56:29,799 --> 00:56:32,490
so were you cognizant of this magnitude
of the accomplishment at the time I mean

2720
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:32,500
of the accomplishment at the time I mean
 

2721
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,099
of the accomplishment at the time I mean
we are you cognizant of it even now

2722
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:35,109
we are you cognizant of it even now
 

2723
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:37,829
we are you cognizant of it even now
because to me I feel like it's something

2724
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:37,839
because to me I feel like it's something
 

2725
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,109
because to me I feel like it's something
that would we mentioned what the AGI

2726
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:40,119
that would we mentioned what the AGI
 

2727
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:42,150
that would we mentioned what the AGI
systems of the future will look back I

2728
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
systems of the future will look back I
 

2729
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,760
systems of the future will look back I
think they'll look back at the alphago

2730
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:44,770
think they'll look back at the alphago
 

2731
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:48,120
think they'll look back at the alphago
tree as like holy crap they figured it

2732
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:48,130
tree as like holy crap they figured it
 

2733
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,910
tree as like holy crap they figured it
out this is where this is where the

2734
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:50,920
out this is where this is where the
 

2735
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,940
out this is where this is where the
started well thank you again I mean it's

2736
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:53,950
started well thank you again I mean it's
 

2737
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,440
started well thank you again I mean it's
funny because I guess I've been working

2738
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:55,450
funny because I guess I've been working
 

2739
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,480
funny because I guess I've been working
on I've been working on computer go for

2740
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:57,490
on I've been working on computer go for
 

2741
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:58,950
on I've been working on computer go for
a long time so I've been working at the

2742
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:58,960
a long time so I've been working at the
 

2743
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,200
a long time so I've been working at the
time at the alphago match on computer go

2744
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,210
time at the alphago match on computer go
 

2745
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,390
time at the alphago match on computer go
for more than a decade and throughout

2746
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:03,400
for more than a decade and throughout
 

2747
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,390
for more than a decade and throughout
that decade I'd had this dream of what

2748
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:06,400
that decade I'd had this dream of what
 

2749
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,370
that decade I'd had this dream of what
would it be like - what would it be like

2750
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:08,380
would it be like - what would it be like
 

2751
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,819
would it be like - what would it be like
really - to actually be able to build a

2752
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:11,829
really - to actually be able to build a
 

2753
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,289
really - to actually be able to build a
system that could play against the world

2754
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:13,299
system that could play against the world
 

2755
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:16,230
system that could play against the world
champion and and I imagined that that

2756
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:16,240
champion and and I imagined that that
 

2757
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,609
champion and and I imagined that that
would be an interesting moment that

2758
00:57:17,609 --> 00:57:17,619
would be an interesting moment that
 

2759
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:19,410
would be an interesting moment that
maybe you know some people might care

2760
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:19,420
maybe you know some people might care
 

2761
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,630
maybe you know some people might care
about that and that this might be you

2762
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:21,640
about that and that this might be you
 

2763
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,289
about that and that this might be you
know a nice achievement but I think when

2764
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:25,299
know a nice achievement but I think when
 

2765
00:57:25,299 --> 00:57:29,549
know a nice achievement but I think when
I arrived in in Seoul and discovered the

2766
00:57:29,549 --> 00:57:29,559
I arrived in in Seoul and discovered the
 

2767
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,020
I arrived in in Seoul and discovered the
legions of

2768
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,030
legions of
 

2769
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,510
legions of
that were following us around and 100

2770
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:33,520
that were following us around and 100
 

2771
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,950
that were following us around and 100
million people that were watching the

2772
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:34,960
million people that were watching the
 

2773
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,490
million people that were watching the
match online life I realized that I had

2774
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:38,500
match online life I realized that I had
 

2775
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,590
match online life I realized that I had
been off in my estimation of how

2776
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:40,600
been off in my estimation of how
 

2777
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,450
been off in my estimation of how
significant this moment was by several

2778
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:42,460
significant this moment was by several
 

2779
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,180
significant this moment was by several
orders of magnitude and so there was

2780
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:45,190
orders of magnitude and so there was
 

2781
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:49,740
orders of magnitude and so there was
definitely an adjustment process to to

2782
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:49,750
definitely an adjustment process to to
 

2783
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,980
definitely an adjustment process to to
realize that this this was something

2784
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:52,990
realize that this this was something
 

2785
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,680
realize that this this was something
which the world really cared about and

2786
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:55,690
which the world really cared about and
 

2787
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,170
which the world really cared about and
which was a watershed moment and I think

2788
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:58,180
which was a watershed moment and I think
 

2789
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:01,530
which was a watershed moment and I think
there was that moment of realization it

2790
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:01,540
there was that moment of realization it
 

2791
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,180
there was that moment of realization it
was also a little bit scary because you

2792
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:03,190
was also a little bit scary because you
 

2793
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,550
was also a little bit scary because you
know if you go into something thinking

2794
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:05,560
know if you go into something thinking
 

2795
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,010
know if you go into something thinking
it's going to be may be of interest and

2796
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:08,020
it's going to be may be of interest and
 

2797
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,170
it's going to be may be of interest and
then discover that 100 million people

2798
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:10,180
then discover that 100 million people
 

2799
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,850
then discover that 100 million people
are watching it suddenly makes you worry

2800
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:11,860
are watching it suddenly makes you worry
 

2801
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,170
are watching it suddenly makes you worry
about whether some of the decisions

2802
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:13,180
about whether some of the decisions
 

2803
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,250
about whether some of the decisions
you've made where really they're the

2804
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:14,260
you've made where really they're the
 

2805
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,590
you've made where really they're the
best ones or the wisest or we're going

2806
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:16,600
best ones or the wisest or we're going
 

2807
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,660
best ones or the wisest or we're going
to lead to the best outcome and we knew

2808
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:18,670
to lead to the best outcome and we knew
 

2809
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,620
to lead to the best outcome and we knew
for sure that there were still

2810
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:19,630
for sure that there were still
 

2811
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,960
for sure that there were still
imperfections in alphago which were

2812
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:21,970
imperfections in alphago which were
 

2813
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:23,190
imperfections in alphago which were
going to be exposed to the whole world

2814
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:23,200
going to be exposed to the whole world
 

2815
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,490
going to be exposed to the whole world
watching and so yeah it was a it was I

2816
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:26,500
watching and so yeah it was a it was I
 

2817
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,090
watching and so yeah it was a it was I
think a great experience and I I feel

2818
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:30,100
think a great experience and I I feel
 

2819
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,640
think a great experience and I I feel
privileged to have been part of it

2820
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,650
privileged to have been part of it
 

2821
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,320
privileged to have been part of it
privileged to have led that amazing team

2822
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:34,330
privileged to have led that amazing team
 

2823
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:38,070
privileged to have led that amazing team
I feel privileged to have been in a

2824
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:38,080
I feel privileged to have been in a
 

2825
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,180
I feel privileged to have been in a
moment of history like you say but also

lucky that you know in a sense I was

lucky that you know in a sense I was

00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,290
lucky that you know in a sense I was

insulated from from the knowledge of I

team I think it was you know we were we
 

2841

were in our bubble and we were working

on research and we were trying to answer
 

2845
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,980
on research and we were trying to answer
the scientific questions and then BAM

2846
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:01,990
the scientific questions and then BAM
 

2847
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:05,070
the scientific questions and then BAM
you know the public sees it and and I

2848
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:05,080
you know the public sees it and and I
 

2849
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,480
you know the public sees it and and I
think it was it was it was better that

way in retrospect were you confident did
 

2853
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:11,640
way in retrospect were you confident did
I guess what were the chances that you

2854
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:11,650
I guess what were the chances that you
 

2855
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:16,580
I guess what were the chances that you
could get the win so just like you said

2856
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:16,590
could get the win so just like you said
 

2857
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,110
could get the win so just like you said
I'm a little bit more familiar with

I'm a little bit more familiar with
 

2859
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,760
I'm a little bit more familiar with
another accomplishment that we may not

another accomplishment that we may not
 

2861
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,770
another accomplishment that we may not
even get a chance to talk to I talked to

incredible accomplishment but here you
 

2867
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,090
incredible accomplishment but here you
know with alpha star and beating the

the odds
 

2883
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,789
the odds
well we actually was there a bit but

2884
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:47,799
well we actually was there a bit but
 

2885
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:50,819
well we actually was there a bit but
funnily enough there was so so just

2886
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:50,829
funnily enough there was so so just
 

2887
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:51,809
funnily enough there was so so just
before the match

before the match

we weren't betting on anything concrete

we weren't betting on anything concrete
 

2891
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:56,999
we weren't betting on anything concrete
but we all held out a hand everyone in

2892
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:57,009
but we all held out a hand everyone in
 

2893

but we all held out a hand everyone in
the team held out her hand at beginning

the team held out her hand at beginning
 

2895
00:59:58,299 --> 01:00:00,239
the team held out her hand at beginning
of the match and the number of fingers

2896
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:00,249
of the match and the number of fingers
 

2897
01:00:00,249 --> 01:00:01,620
of the match and the number of fingers
that they had out on the hand was

2898
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:01,630
that they had out on the hand was
 

2899
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,359
that they had out on the hand was
supposed to represent how many games

2900
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:03,369
supposed to represent how many games
 

2901
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:04,319
supposed to represent how many games
they thought we would win

they thought we would win

I guess Lisa doll and there was an

2904
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:06,849
I guess Lisa doll and there was an
 

2905
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:08,640
I guess Lisa doll and there was an
amazing spread in there in the team's

2906
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:08,650
amazing spread in there in the team's
 

2907
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,099
amazing spread in there in the team's
predictions but I have to say I

2908
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:11,109
predictions but I have to say I
 

2909
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:16,439
predictions but I have to say I
predicted four one and and the reason

2910
01:00:16,439 --> 01:00:16,449
predicted four one and and the reason
 

2911
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:19,140
predicted four one and and the reason
was based purely on on data so I'm a

2912
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:19,150
was based purely on on data so I'm a
 

2913
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,599
was based purely on on data so I'm a
scientist first and foremost and one of

2914
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:21,609
scientist first and foremost and one of
 

2915
01:00:21,609 --> 01:00:23,279
scientist first and foremost and one of
the things which we had established was

2916
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:23,289
the things which we had established was
 

2917
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:23,579
the things which we had established was
that

2918
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:23,589
that
 

2919
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:27,539
that
alphago in around 1 in 5 games would

2920
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:27,549
alphago in around 1 in 5 games would
 

2921
01:00:27,549 --> 01:00:29,069
alphago in around 1 in 5 games would
develop something which we called a

2922
01:00:29,069 --> 01:00:29,079
develop something which we called a
 

2923
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:30,719
develop something which we called a
delusion which was a kind of inner hole

2924
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:30,729
delusion which was a kind of inner hole
 

2925
01:00:30,729 --> 01:00:32,579
delusion which was a kind of inner hole
in its in its knowledge where it wasn't

2926
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:32,589
in its in its knowledge where it wasn't
 

2927
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:35,099
in its in its knowledge where it wasn't
able to fully understand everything

2928
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:35,109
able to fully understand everything
 

2929
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:36,930
able to fully understand everything
about the position and that that hole

2930
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:36,940
about the position and that that hole
 

2931
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,880
about the position and that that hole
and its knowledge would persist for tens

2932
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:38,890
and its knowledge would persist for tens
 

2933
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:42,059
and its knowledge would persist for tens
of moves throughout the game and we knew

2934
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:42,069
of moves throughout the game and we knew
 

2935
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:43,799
of moves throughout the game and we knew
two things we knew that if there were no

2936
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:43,809
two things we knew that if there were no
 

2937
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:45,870
two things we knew that if there were no
delusions that alphago seemed to be

2938
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:45,880
delusions that alphago seemed to be
 

2939
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,430
delusions that alphago seemed to be
playing at a level that was far beyond

2940
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
playing at a level that was far beyond
 

2941
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,039
playing at a level that was far beyond
any human capabilities but we also knew

2942
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:50,049
any human capabilities but we also knew
 

2943
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:52,380
any human capabilities but we also knew
that if there were delusions the office

2944
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:52,390
that if there were delusions the office
 

2945
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:56,729
that if there were delusions the office
it was true and and and in fact you know

2946
01:00:56,729 --> 01:00:56,739
it was true and and and in fact you know
 

2947
01:00:56,739 --> 01:00:58,529
it was true and and and in fact you know
that's that's what came to pass we saw

2948
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:58,539
that's that's what came to pass we saw
 

2949
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:00,749
that's that's what came to pass we saw
we saw all of those outcomes and Lisa

2950
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:00,759
we saw all of those outcomes and Lisa
 

2951
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:03,150
we saw all of those outcomes and Lisa
doll in in one of the games played a

2952
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:03,160
doll in in one of the games played a
 

2953
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,359
doll in in one of the games played a
really beautiful sequence that that that

2954
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:06,369
really beautiful sequence that that that
 

2955
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:08,729
really beautiful sequence that that that
alphago just hadn't predicted and after

2956
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:08,739
alphago just hadn't predicted and after
 

2957
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:11,370
alphago just hadn't predicted and after
that it it led it into this situation

2958
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:11,380
that it it led it into this situation
 

2959
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,249
that it it led it into this situation
where it was unable to really understand

2960
01:01:14,249 --> 01:01:14,259
where it was unable to really understand
 

2961
01:01:14,259 --> 01:01:16,019
where it was unable to really understand
the position fully and and and found

2962
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:16,029
the position fully and and and found
 

2963
01:01:16,029 --> 01:01:17,609
the position fully and and and found
itself in one of these these delusions

2964
01:01:17,609 --> 01:01:17,619
itself in one of these these delusions
 

2965
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:20,249
itself in one of these these delusions
so so indeed yeah for one was the

2966
01:01:20,249 --> 01:01:20,259
so so indeed yeah for one was the
 

2967
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,229
so so indeed yeah for one was the
outcome so yeah and can you maybe speak

2968
01:01:22,229 --> 01:01:22,239
outcome so yeah and can you maybe speak
 

2969
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:24,049
outcome so yeah and can you maybe speak
to it a little bit more what were the

2970
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:24,059
to it a little bit more what were the
 

2971
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:26,459
to it a little bit more what were the
five games like what what happened is

2972
01:01:26,459 --> 01:01:26,469
five games like what what happened is
 

2973
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:29,400
five games like what what happened is
there interesting things that they come

2974
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:29,410
there interesting things that they come
 

2975
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:31,680
there interesting things that they come
to memory in terms of the play of the

2976
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:31,690
to memory in terms of the play of the
 

2977
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:35,130
to memory in terms of the play of the
human machine so I remember all of these

2978
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:35,140
human machine so I remember all of these
 

2979
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,529
human machine so I remember all of these
games vividly of course you know moments

2980
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:37,539
games vividly of course you know moments
 

2981
01:01:37,539 --> 01:01:39,539
games vividly of course you know moments

hadn't anticipated and computers
 

3063
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,390

01:04:58,579 --> 01:05:00,569
found a brilliant sequence in the middle
of the game a brilliant sequence that

3138
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:00,579
of the game a brilliant sequence that
 

3139
01:05:00,579 --> 01:05:04,660
of the game a brilliant sequence that
led him to really just transform the

3140
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:04,670
led him to really just transform the
 

3141
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:08,859
led him to really just transform the
position it kind of it it he found it's

3142
01:05:08,859 --> 01:05:08,869
position it kind of it it he found it's
 

3143
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:10,270
position it kind of it it he found it's
just a piece of genius really

3144
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:10,280
just a piece of genius really
 

3145
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,450
just a piece of genius really
and after that alphago

3146
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:13,460
and after that alphago
 

3147
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:16,180
and after that alphago
it's it's evaluation just tumbled it

3148
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:16,190
it's it's evaluation just tumbled it
 

3149
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,410
it's it's evaluation just tumbled it
thought it was winning this game and all

3150
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:17,420
thought it was winning this game and all
 

3151
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,500
thought it was winning this game and all
of a sudden it tumbled and said oh now

3152
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:20,510
of a sudden it tumbled and said oh now
 

3153
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:21,910
of a sudden it tumbled and said oh now
I've got no chance and it starts to

3154
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:21,920
I've got no chance and it starts to
 

3155
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,579
I've got no chance and it starts to
behave rather oddly at that point in the

3156
01:05:24,579 --> 01:05:24,589
behave rather oddly at that point in the
 

3157
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:27,430
behave rather oddly at that point in the
final game for some reason we as a team

3158
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440
final game for some reason we as a team
 

3159
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,440
final game for some reason we as a team
were convinced having seen alphago in

3160
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:29,450
were convinced having seen alphago in
 

3161
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,599
were convinced having seen alphago in
the previous game suffer from delusions

3162
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:31,609
the previous game suffer from delusions
 

3163
01:05:31,609 --> 01:05:34,270
the previous game suffer from delusions
we as a team were convinced that it was

3164
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:34,280
we as a team were convinced that it was
 

3165
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,099
we as a team were convinced that it was
suffering from another delusion we were

3166
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:36,109
suffering from another delusion we were
 

3167
01:05:36,109 --> 01:05:37,660
suffering from another delusion we were
convinced that it was miss evaluating

3168
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:37,670
convinced that it was miss evaluating
 

3169
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,339
convinced that it was miss evaluating
the position and that something was

3170
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:39,349
the position and that something was
 

3171
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:42,010
the position and that something was
going terribly wrong and it was only in

3172
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:42,020
going terribly wrong and it was only in
 

3173
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,960
going terribly wrong and it was only in
the last few moves of the game that we

3174
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:43,970
the last few moves of the game that we
 

3175
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:46,839
the last few moves of the game that we
realized that actually although it had

3176
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:46,849
realized that actually although it had
 

3177
01:05:46,849 --> 01:05:48,040
realized that actually although it had
been predicting it was going to win all

3178
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,050
been predicting it was going to win all
 

3179
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:51,609
been predicting it was going to win all
the way through it really was and and so

3180
01:05:51,609 --> 01:05:51,619
the way through it really was and and so
 

3181
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:53,800
the way through it really was and and so
somehow you know it just taught us yet

3182
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:53,810
somehow you know it just taught us yet
 

3183
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,569
somehow you know it just taught us yet
again that you have to have faith in in

3184
01:05:55,569 --> 01:05:55,579
again that you have to have faith in in
 

3185
01:05:55,579 --> 01:05:57,190
again that you have to have faith in in
your systems when they when they exceed

3186
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:57,200
your systems when they when they exceed
 

3187
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,960
your systems when they when they exceed
your own level of ability in your own

3188
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:58,970
your own level of ability in your own
 

3189
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:01,510
your own level of ability in your own
judgment you have to trust in them too

3190
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,520
judgment you have to trust in them too
 

3191
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,760
judgment you have to trust in them too
to know better than the new the designer

3192
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:03,770
to know better than the new the designer
 

3193
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:07,059
to know better than the new the designer
once you've you've stowed in them the

3194
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:07,069
once you've you've stowed in them the
 

3195
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:09,690
once you've you've stowed in them the
ability to to judge better than you can

3196
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:09,700
ability to to judge better than you can
 

3197
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:13,839
ability to to judge better than you can
then trust the system to do so so just

3198
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:13,849
then trust the system to do so so just
 

3199
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:15,400
then trust the system to do so so just
looking in case of deep blue beating

3200
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:15,410

Garry Kasparov

3202
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:18,809
Garry Kasparov
 

3203
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,829
Garry Kasparov
so get garrus is I think the first time

3204
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:21,839
so get garrus is I think the first time
 

3205
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:25,009
so get garrus is I think the first time
he's ever lost actually to anybody and I

3206
01:06:25,009 --> 01:06:25,019
he's ever lost actually to anybody and I
 

3207
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:27,169
he's ever lost actually to anybody and I
mean there's a similar situation loose

3208
01:06:27,169 --> 01:06:27,179
mean there's a similar situation loose
 

3209
01:06:27,179 --> 01:06:31,759
mean there's a similar situation loose
at all it's uh it's a tragic it's a

3210
01:06:31,759 --> 01:06:31,769
at all it's uh it's a tragic it's a
 

3211
01:06:31,769 --> 01:06:35,929
at all it's uh it's a tragic it's a
tragic loss for humans but a beautiful

3212
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:35,939
tragic loss for humans but a beautiful
 

3213
01:06:35,939 --> 01:06:39,859
tragic loss for humans but a beautiful
one I think that's kind of from the

3214
01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:39,869
one I think that's kind of from the
 

3215
01:06:39,869 --> 01:06:43,939
one I think that's kind of from the
tragedy sort of emerges over time

3216
01:06:43,939 --> 01:06:43,949
tragedy sort of emerges over time
 

3217
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:48,249
tragedy sort of emerges over time
emerges the kind of inspiring story but

3218
01:06:48,249 --> 01:06:48,259
emerges the kind of inspiring story but
 

3219
01:06:48,259 --> 01:06:50,599
emerges the kind of inspiring story but

about Garry Kasparov because actually at
 

3239
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:16,669
about Garry Kasparov because actually at
the panel yesterday he specifically said

3240
01:07:16,669 --> 01:07:16,679
the panel yesterday he specifically said
 

3241
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:19,039
the panel yesterday he specifically said
that when he first lost a deep-blue

3242
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:19,049
that when he first lost a deep-blue
 

3243
01:07:19,049 --> 01:07:22,699

he he viewed it as a failure he viewed
that this this had been a failure of his

that this this had been a failure of his
 

3247
01:07:24,509 --> 01:07:27,289
that this this had been a failure of his
but later on in his career he said he'd

3248
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:27,299
but later on in his career he said he'd
 

3249
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:29,599
but later on in his career he said he'd
come to realize that actually it was a

because this marked a transformational

3254
01:07:34,249 --> 01:07:34,259
because this marked a transformational
 

3255
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:38,089
because this marked a transformational
moment for AI and so even for Kip Garry

3256
01:07:38,089 --> 01:07:38,099
moment for AI and so even for Kip Garry
 

3257
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:40,399
moment for AI and so even for Kip Garry
Kasparov he came to realize at that

meant something much more than then you
 

3263
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:49,309
meant something much more than then you
know his personal loss in that moment

3264
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:49,319
know his personal loss in that moment

Lisa doll I think was a much more
 

3267
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:55,069
Lisa doll I think was a much more
cognizant of that even at the time so in

3268
01:07:55,069 --> 01:07:55,079
cognizant of that even at the time so in

01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:03,059
happened and the alphago match was not
 

3275
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:06,169
happened and the alphago match was not
only meaningful for AI but for humans as

3276
01:08:06,169 --> 01:08:06,179
only meaningful for AI but for humans as
 

3277
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:08,419
only meaningful for AI but for humans as
well and he felt as a go player that it

3278
01:08:08,419 --> 01:08:08,429
well and he felt as a go player that it
 

3279
01:08:08,429 --> 01:08:10,459
well and he felt as a go player that it
had opened his horizons and meant that

3280
01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:10,469
had opened his horizons and meant that
 

3281
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:12,829
had opened his horizons and meant that
he could start exploring new things it

3282
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:12,839
he could start exploring new things it
 

3283
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,269
he could start exploring new things it
brought his joy back for the game of go

3284
01:08:14,269 --> 01:08:14,279
brought his joy back for the game of go
 

3285
01:08:14,279 --> 01:08:17,959
brought his joy back for the game of go
because it broken all of the conventions

3286
01:08:17,959 --> 01:08:17,969
because it broken all of the conventions
 

3287

because it broken all of the conventions
and barriers and meant that you know

suddenly suddenly anything was possible
 

3291
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:25,189
suddenly suddenly anything was possible
again and so you know I was sad to hear

3292
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:25,199
again and so you know I was sad to hear
 

3293
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,629
again and so you know I was sad to hear
that he'd retired but you know he's been

3294
01:08:26,629 --> 01:08:26,639
that he'd retired but you know he's been
 

3295
01:08:26,639 --> 01:08:30,019
that he'd retired but you know he's been
a great a great world champion over many

3296
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:30,029
a great a great world champion over many
 

3297
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:31,450
a great a great world champion over many
many years

3298
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:31,460
many years
 

3299
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:34,090
many years
and I think you know that he'll be he'll

3300
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:34,100
and I think you know that he'll be he'll
 

3301
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,459
and I think you know that he'll be he'll
be remembered for that evermore he'll be

3302
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:36,469
be remembered for that evermore he'll be
 

3303
01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:38,800
be remembered for that evermore he'll be
remembered as the last person to to beat

3304
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:38,810
remembered as the last person to to beat
 

3305
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,190
remembered as the last person to to beat
alphago I mean after after that we

3306
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:41,200
alphago I mean after after that we
 

3307
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,180
alphago I mean after after that we
increased the power of the system and

3308
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:43,190
increased the power of the system and
 

3309
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:46,740
increased the power of the system and
and the next version of alphago beats

3310
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:46,750
and the next version of alphago beats
 

3311
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:50,380
and the next version of alphago beats
the the other strong human players 60

3312
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:50,390
the the other strong human players 60
 

3313
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:54,610
the the other strong human players 60
games to nil so you know what a great

3314
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:54,620
games to nil so you know what a great
 

3315
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,780
games to nil so you know what a great
moment for him and something to be

3316
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:55,790
moment for him and something to be
 

3317
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,150
moment for him and something to be
remembered for

3318
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:57,160
remembered for
 

3319
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,709
remembered for
it's interestingly you spent time at

3320
01:08:59,709 --> 01:08:59,719
it's interestingly you spent time at
 

3321
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:04,440
it's interestingly you spent time at
triple AI on a panel with Garry Kasparov

3322
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:04,450
triple AI on a panel with Garry Kasparov
 

3323
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:08,170
triple AI on a panel with Garry Kasparov
what I mean it's almost just curious to

3324
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:08,180
what I mean it's almost just curious to
 

3325
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:12,249
what I mean it's almost just curious to
learn the conversations you've had with

3326
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:12,259
learn the conversations you've had with
 

3327
01:09:12,259 --> 01:09:15,579
learn the conversations you've had with
Garry and the because he's also now he's

3328
01:09:15,579 --> 01:09:15,589
Garry and the because he's also now he's
 

3329
01:09:15,589 --> 01:09:16,809
Garry and the because he's also now he's
written a book about artificial

3330
01:09:16,809 --> 01:09:16,819
written a book about artificial
 

3331
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,030
written a book about artificial
intelligence he's thinking about AI he

3332
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:19,040
intelligence he's thinking about AI he
 

3333
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,670
intelligence he's thinking about AI he
has kind of a view of it and he talks

3334
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:21,680
has kind of a view of it and he talks
 

3335
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,209
has kind of a view of it and he talks
about alphago a lot what what's your

3336
01:09:25,209 --> 01:09:25,219
about alphago a lot what what's your
 

3337
01:09:25,219 --> 01:09:28,180
about alphago a lot what what's your
sense be arguably I'm not just being

3338
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:28,190
sense be arguably I'm not just being
 

3339
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:30,610
sense be arguably I'm not just being
Russian but I think Gary is the greatest

3340
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:30,620
Russian but I think Gary is the greatest
 

3341
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,979
Russian but I think Gary is the greatest
chess player of all time the probably

3342
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:32,989
chess player of all time the probably
 

3343
01:09:32,989 --> 01:09:35,559
chess player of all time the probably
one of the greatest game players of all

3344
01:09:35,559 --> 01:09:35,569
one of the greatest game players of all
 

3345
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:41,140
one of the greatest game players of all
time and you sort of at the center of

3346
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:41,150
time and you sort of at the center of
 

3347
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:43,630
time and you sort of at the center of
creating a system that beats one of the

3348
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:43,640
creating a system that beats one of the
 

3349
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,340
creating a system that beats one of the
greatest players of all time

3350
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:45,350
greatest players of all time
 

3351
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:46,840
greatest players of all time
so what's that conversation like is

3352
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:46,850
so what's that conversation like is
 

3353
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,180
so what's that conversation like is
there anything yeah any interesting digs

3354
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:49,190
there anything yeah any interesting digs
 

3355
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,789
there anything yeah any interesting digs
any bets and you come and you find new

things and you profound things so Gary

3358
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:54,049
things and you profound things so Gary
 

3359
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:59,310
things and you profound things so Gary
Kasparov has an incredible respect for

3360
01:09:59,310 --> 01:09:59,320
Kasparov has an incredible respect for
 

3361
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,570
Kasparov has an incredible respect for
what we did with alphago and you know

3362
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:01,580
what we did with alphago and you know
 

3363
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:05,320
what we did with alphago and you know
it's it's an amazing tribute coming from

3364
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:05,330
it's it's an amazing tribute coming from
 

3365
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:08,140
it's it's an amazing tribute coming from
from him of all people that he really

3366
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:08,150
from him of all people that he really
 

3367
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:10,270
from him of all people that he really
appreciates and respects what what we've

3368
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:10,280
appreciates and respects what what we've
 

3369
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,980
appreciates and respects what what we've
done and

3370
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:11,990
done and
 

3371
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,140
done and
I think he feels that the progress which

3372
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:14,150
I think he feels that the progress which
 

3373
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:17,479
I think he feels that the progress which
was happened in in computer chess which

3374
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:17,489
was happened in in computer chess which
 

3375
01:10:17,489 --> 01:10:20,479
was happened in in computer chess which
later after alphago we we built the

3376
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:20,489
later after alphago we we built the
 

3377
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:24,229
later after alphago we we built the
alpha zero system which defeated the the

3378
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:24,239
alpha zero system which defeated the the
 

3379
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:27,080
alpha zero system which defeated the the
world's strongest chess programs and to

3380
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:27,090
world's strongest chess programs and to
 

3381
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,270
world's strongest chess programs and to
Garry Kasparov that moment in computer

3382
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:29,280
Garry Kasparov that moment in computer
 

3383
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,880
Garry Kasparov that moment in computer
chess was more profound than than than

3384
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:31,890
chess was more profound than than than
 

3385
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:34,100
chess was more profound than than than
deep blue and the reason he believes it

3386
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:34,110
deep blue and the reason he believes it
 

3387
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:36,440
deep blue and the reason he believes it
mattered more was because it was done

3388
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:36,450
mattered more was because it was done
 

3389
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,180
mattered more was because it was done
with with learning and a system which

3390
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:38,190
with with learning and a system which
 

3391
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,190
with with learning and a system which
was able to discover for itself new

3392
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:40,200
was able to discover for itself new
 

3393
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,830
was able to discover for itself new
principles new ideas which were able to

3394
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:42,840
principles new ideas which were able to
 

3395
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,130
principles new ideas which were able to
play the game in a in a in a way which

3396
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:45,140
play the game in a in a in a way which
 

3397
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:49,280
play the game in a in a in a way which
he hadn't always known about or anyone

3398
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:49,290
he hadn't always known about or anyone
 

3399
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:51,890
he hadn't always known about or anyone
and in fact one of the things I

3400
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:51,900
and in fact one of the things I
 

3401
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,110
and in fact one of the things I
discovered at this panel was that the

3402
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:54,120
discovered at this panel was that the
 

3403
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,140
discovered at this panel was that the
current world champion Magnus Carlsen

3404
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:56,150
current world champion Magnus Carlsen
 

3405
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:59,510
current world champion Magnus Carlsen
apparently recently commented on his

3406
01:10:59,510 --> 01:10:59,520
apparently recently commented on his
 

3407
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,360
apparently recently commented on his
improvement in performance and he

3408
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:02,370
improvement in performance and he
 

3409
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,400
improvement in performance and he
attributes it to alpha zero that he's

3410
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:04,410
attributes it to alpha zero that he's
 

3411
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:05,690
attributes it to alpha zero that he's
been studying the games of alpha zero

3412
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:05,700
been studying the games of alpha zero
 

3413
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,580
been studying the games of alpha zero
and he's changed his style play more

3414
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:07,590
and he's changed his style play more
 

3415
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,880
and he's changed his style play more
like alpha zero and it's led to him

3416
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:09,890
like alpha zero and it's led to him
 

3417
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:13,100
like alpha zero and it's led to him
actually increasing his his his rating

3418
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:13,110
actually increasing his his his rating
 

3419
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:17,090
actually increasing his his his rating
to a new peak yeah I guess to me just

3420
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:17,100
to a new peak yeah I guess to me just
 

3421
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,300
to a new peak yeah I guess to me just
like to Gary the inspiring thing is that

3422
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:20,310
like to Gary the inspiring thing is that
 

3423
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:21,410
like to Gary the inspiring thing is that
and just like you said with

3424
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:21,420
and just like you said with
 

3425
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,050
and just like you said with
reinforcement learning reinforcement

3426
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:24,060
reinforcement learning reinforcement
 

3427
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,540
reinforcement learning reinforcement
learning and deep learning machine

3428
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:26,550
learning and deep learning machine
 

3429
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,700
learning and deep learning machine
learning feels like what intelligence is

3430
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:28,710
learning feels like what intelligence is
 

3431
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:32,450
learning feels like what intelligence is
yeah and you know you could attribute it

3432
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:32,460
yeah and you know you could attribute it
 

3433
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,110
yeah and you know you could attribute it
to sort of a bitter viewpoint from

3434
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:36,120
to sort of a bitter viewpoint from
 

3435
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,780
to sort of a bitter viewpoint from
Gary's perspective from us humans

3436
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:38,790
Gary's perspective from us humans
 

3437
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:41,060
Gary's perspective from us humans
perspective saying that sir pure search

3438
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:41,070
perspective saying that sir pure search
 

3439
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:44,420
perspective saying that sir pure search
that IBM do Blue was doing is not really

3440
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:44,430
that IBM do Blue was doing is not really
 

3441
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,760
that IBM do Blue was doing is not really
intelligence but somehow it didn't feel

3442
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:46,770
intelligence but somehow it didn't feel
 

3443
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,160
intelligence but somehow it didn't feel
like it and so that's the magical I'm

3444
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:49,170
like it and so that's the magical I'm
 

3445
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,900
like it and so that's the magical I'm
not sure what it is about learning that

3446
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:50,910
not sure what it is about learning that
 

3447
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:53,150
not sure what it is about learning that
feels like intelligence but it but it

3448
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:53,160
feels like intelligence but it but it
 

3449
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,200
feels like intelligence but it but it
does so I think we should not demean the

3450
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:57,210
does so I think we should not demean the
 

3451
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,760
does so I think we should not demean the
achievements of what was done in

3452
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:58,770
achievements of what was done in
 

3453
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,709
achievements of what was done in
previous eras of AI I think that deep

3454
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:00,719
previous eras of AI I think that deep
 

3455
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,570
previous eras of AI I think that deep
blue was an amazing achievement in

3456
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:02,580
blue was an amazing achievement in
 

3457
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,890
blue was an amazing achievement in
itself and that heuristic search of the

3458
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:06,900
itself and that heuristic search of the
 

3459
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,320
itself and that heuristic search of the
kind that was used by deep blue had some

3460
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:09,330
kind that was used by deep blue had some
 

3461
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,630
kind that was used by deep blue had some
powerful ideas that were in there but it

3462
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:11,640
powerful ideas that were in there but it
 

3463
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,729
powerful ideas that were in there but it
also missed some things so so the fact

3464
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:13,739
also missed some things so so the fact
 

3465
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:16,370
also missed some things so so the fact
that the that the evaluation function

3466
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:16,380
that the that the evaluation function
 

3467
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,690
that the that the evaluation function
the way that the chess position was

3468
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:17,700
the way that the chess position was
 

3469
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,660
the way that the chess position was
understood was created by humans and not

3470
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:20,670
understood was created by humans and not
 

3471
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,170
understood was created by humans and not
by the machine is a limitation which

3472
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:24,180
by the machine is a limitation which
 

3473
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:27,740
by the machine is a limitation which
means that there's a ceiling on how well

3474
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:27,750
means that there's a ceiling on how well
 

3475
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:30,590
means that there's a ceiling on how well
it can do but maybe more importantly it

3476
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:30,600
it can do but maybe more importantly it
 

3477
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:30,979
it can do but maybe more importantly it
means

3478
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:30,989
means
 

3479
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:33,200
means
the same idea cannot be applied in other

3480
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:33,210
the same idea cannot be applied in other
 

3481
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:35,830
the same idea cannot be applied in other
domains where we don't have access to

3482
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:35,840
domains where we don't have access to
 

3483
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,570
domains where we don't have access to
the kind of human Grand Master's and

3484
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:38,580
the kind of human Grand Master's and
 

3485
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,640
the kind of human Grand Master's and
that ability to kind of encode exactly

3486
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:40,650
that ability to kind of encode exactly
 

3487
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:42,020
that ability to kind of encode exactly
their knowledge into an evaluation

3488
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:42,030
their knowledge into an evaluation
 

3489
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:44,360
their knowledge into an evaluation
function and the reality is that the

3490
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:44,370
function and the reality is that the
 

3491
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:46,370
function and the reality is that the
story of AI is that you know most

3492
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:46,380
story of AI is that you know most
 

3493
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,260
story of AI is that you know most
domains turn out to be of the second

3494
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:48,270
domains turn out to be of the second
 

3495
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:50,660
domains turn out to be of the second
type where when knowledge is messy it's

3496
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:50,670
type where when knowledge is messy it's
 

3497
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,340
type where when knowledge is messy it's
hard to extract from experts or it isn't

3498
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:52,350
hard to extract from experts or it isn't
 

3499
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:56,720
hard to extract from experts or it isn't
even available and so so we need to

3500
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:56,730
even available and so so we need to
 

3501
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,990
even available and so so we need to
solve problems in a different way and I

3502
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:00,000
solve problems in a different way and I
 

3503
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,209
solve problems in a different way and I
think alphago is a step towards solving

3504
01:13:02,209 --> 01:13:02,219
think alphago is a step towards solving
 

3505
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:04,570
think alphago is a step towards solving
things in a way which which puts

3506
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:04,580
things in a way which which puts
 

3507
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,830
things in a way which which puts
learning as first-class citizen and says

3508
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:08,840
learning as first-class citizen and says
 

3509
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,580
learning as first-class citizen and says
systems need to understand for

3510
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:10,590
systems need to understand for
 

3511
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,370
systems need to understand for
themselves how to understand the world

3512
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:13,380
themselves how to understand the world
 

3513
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:19,010
themselves how to understand the world
how to judge their the value of any

3514
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:19,020
how to judge their the value of any
 

3515
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,450
how to judge their the value of any
action that they might take within that

3516
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:20,460
action that they might take within that
 

3517
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,890
action that they might take within that
world in any state they might find

3518
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:21,900
world in any state they might find
 

3519
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:27,290
world in any state they might find
themselves in and in order to do that we

3520
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:27,300
themselves in and in order to do that we
 

3521
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,900
themselves in and in order to do that we
we make progress towards AI yeah so one

3522
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:29,910
we make progress towards AI yeah so one
 

3523
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:32,120
we make progress towards AI yeah so one
of the nice things about this about

3524
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:32,130
of the nice things about this about
 

3525
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,940
of the nice things about this about
taking a learning approach to the game

3526
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:34,950
taking a learning approach to the game
 

3527
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:37,940
taking a learning approach to the game
of Go game playing is that the things

3528
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:37,950
of Go game playing is that the things
 

3529
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,440
of Go game playing is that the things
you learn the things you figure out are

3530
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:39,450
you learn the things you figure out are
 

3531
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:41,330
you learn the things you figure out are
actually going to be applicable to other

3532
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:41,340
actually going to be applicable to other
 

3533
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,640
actually going to be applicable to other
problems there are real-world problems

3534
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:43,650
problems there are real-world problems
 

3535
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:46,490
problems there are real-world problems
that's so that's ultimately I mean

3536
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:46,500
that's so that's ultimately I mean
 

3537
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,290
that's so that's ultimately I mean
there's two really interesting things

3538
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:48,300
there's two really interesting things
 

3539
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,780
there's two really interesting things
about alphago one is the science of it

3540
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:50,790
about alphago one is the science of it
 

3541
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:52,760
about alphago one is the science of it
just the science of learning the science

3542
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:52,770
just the science of learning the science
 

3543
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:55,430
just the science of learning the science
of intelligence and then the other is

3544
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:55,440
of intelligence and then the other is
 

3545
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,580
of intelligence and then the other is
all you're actually learning to figuring

3546
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:58,590
all you're actually learning to figuring
 

3547
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:00,229
all you're actually learning to figuring
out how to build systems that would be

3548
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:00,239
out how to build systems that would be
 

3549
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,990
out how to build systems that would be
potentially applicable in in other

3550
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:03,000
potentially applicable in in other
 

3551
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,840
potentially applicable in in other
applications medical autonomous vehicles

3552
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:05,850
applications medical autonomous vehicles
 

3553
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:07,700
applications medical autonomous vehicles
robotics all I mean it's just open the

3554
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:07,710
robotics all I mean it's just open the
 

3555
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:11,560
robotics all I mean it's just open the
door to all kinds of applications so the

3556
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:11,570
door to all kinds of applications so the
 

3557
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:15,440
door to all kinds of applications so the
next incredible step right really the

3558
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:15,450
next incredible step right really the
 

3559
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:18,020
next incredible step right really the
profound step is probably alphago zero I

3560
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:18,030
profound step is probably alphago zero I
 

3561
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:21,229
profound step is probably alphago zero I
mean it's arguable I kind of see them

3562
01:14:21,229 --> 01:14:21,239
mean it's arguable I kind of see them
 

3563
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:23,330
mean it's arguable I kind of see them
all as the same place but really in

3564
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:23,340
all as the same place but really in
 

3565
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,860
all as the same place but really in
perhaps you were already thinking that

3566
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:24,870
perhaps you were already thinking that
 

3567
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:27,350
perhaps you were already thinking that
alphago zeros the natural it was always

3568
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360
alphago zeros the natural it was always
 

3569
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,030
alphago zeros the natural it was always
going to be the next step

3570
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:29,040
going to be the next step
 

3571
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,670
going to be the next step
but it's removing the reliance on human

3572
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:31,680
but it's removing the reliance on human
 

3573
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,640
but it's removing the reliance on human
expert games for pre-training as you

3574
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:34,650
expert games for pre-training as you
 

3575
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,760
expert games for pre-training as you
mentioned so how big of an intellectual

3576
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:37,770
mentioned so how big of an intellectual
 

3577
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:42,320
mentioned so how big of an intellectual
leap was this that that self play could

3578
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:42,330
leap was this that that self play could
 

3579
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:44,239
leap was this that that self play could
achieve superhuman level performance

3580
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:44,249
achieve superhuman level performance
 

3581
01:14:44,249 --> 01:14:46,939
achieve superhuman level performance
it's on and maybe could you also say

3582
01:14:46,939 --> 01:14:46,949
it's on and maybe could you also say
 

3583
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,640
it's on and maybe could you also say
what is self play we kind of mentioned a

3584
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:49,650
what is self play we kind of mentioned a
 

3585
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:54,350
what is self play we kind of mentioned a
few times but so let me start with self

3586
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:54,360
few times but so let me start with self
 

3587
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,379
few times but so let me start with self
play so the idea of self play is

3588
01:14:57,379 --> 01:14:57,389
play so the idea of self play is
 

3589
01:14:57,389 --> 01:15:01,009
play so the idea of self play is
something which is really about systems

3590
01:15:01,009 --> 01:15:01,019
something which is really about systems
 

3591
01:15:01,019 --> 01:15:02,569
something which is really about systems
learning for themselves but in the

3592
01:15:02,569 --> 01:15:02,579
learning for themselves but in the
 

3593
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:04,399
learning for themselves but in the
situation where there's more than one

3594
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:04,409
situation where there's more than one
 

3595
01:15:04,409 --> 01:15:08,029
situation where there's more than one
agent and so if you're in a game and a

3596
01:15:08,029 --> 01:15:08,039
agent and so if you're in a game and a
 

3597
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:09,859
agent and so if you're in a game and a
game is a played between two players

3598
01:15:09,859 --> 01:15:09,869
game is a played between two players
 

3599
01:15:09,869 --> 01:15:11,629
game is a played between two players
then self play is really about

3600
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:11,639
then self play is really about
 

3601
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:16,250
then self play is really about
understanding that game just by playing

3602
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:16,260
understanding that game just by playing
 

3603
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,899
understanding that game just by playing
games against yourself rather than

3604
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:17,909
games against yourself rather than
 

3605
01:15:17,909 --> 01:15:20,330
games against yourself rather than
against any actual real opponent and so

3606
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:20,340
against any actual real opponent and so
 

3607
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:23,000
against any actual real opponent and so
it's a way to kind of um discover

3608
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,010
it's a way to kind of um discover
 

3609
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:24,879
it's a way to kind of um discover
strategies without having to actually

3610
01:15:24,879 --> 01:15:24,889
strategies without having to actually
 

3611
01:15:24,889 --> 01:15:30,439
strategies without having to actually
need to go out and play against any

3612
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:30,449
need to go out and play against any
 

3613
01:15:30,449 --> 01:15:36,140
need to go out and play against any
particular human player for example the

01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:36,150
particular human player for example the
 

3615
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:39,189
particular human player for example the
main idea of alpha zero was really to

3616
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:39,199
main idea of alpha zero was really to
 

3617
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:44,839
main idea of alpha zero was really to
you know try and step back from any of

01:15:44,839 --> 01:15:44,849
you know try and step back from any of
 

3619
01:15:44,849 --> 01:15:45,890
you know try and step back from any of
the knowledge that we'd put into the

3620
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:45,900
the knowledge that we'd put into the
 

3621
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,109
the knowledge that we'd put into the
system and ask the question is it

3622
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:48,119
system and ask the question is it
 

3623
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:51,100
system and ask the question is it
possible to come up with a single

3624
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:51,110
possible to come up with a single
 

3625
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:54,379
possible to come up with a single
elegant principle by which a system can

3626
01:15:54,379 --> 01:15:54,389
elegant principle by which a system can
 

3627
01:15:54,389 --> 01:15:57,350
elegant principle by which a system can
learn for itself all of the knowledge

3628
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:57,360
learn for itself all of the knowledge
 

3629
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,270
learn for itself all of the knowledge
which it requires to play to play a game

3630
01:15:59,270 --> 01:15:59,280
which it requires to play to play a game
 

3631
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,569
which it requires to play to play a game
such as go importantly by taking

01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:05,930
such as go importantly by taking
knowledge out you not only make the

3634
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:05,940
knowledge out you not only make the
 

3635
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:08,870
knowledge out you not only make the
system less brittle in the sense that

3636
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:08,880
system less brittle in the sense that
 

3637
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,370
system less brittle in the sense that
perhaps the knowledge you were putting

3638
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:10,380
perhaps the knowledge you were putting
 

3639
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:11,810
perhaps the knowledge you were putting
in was was just getting in the way and

3640
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:11,820
in was was just getting in the way and
 

3641
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:14,419
in was was just getting in the way and
maybe stopping the system learning for

3642
01:16:14,419 --> 01:16:14,429
maybe stopping the system learning for
 

3643
01:16:14,429 --> 01:16:16,959
maybe stopping the system learning for
itself but also you make it more general

3644
01:16:16,959 --> 01:16:16,969
itself but also you make it more general
 

3645
01:16:16,969 --> 01:16:20,209
itself but also you make it more general
the more knowledge you put in the harder

3646
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:20,219
the more knowledge you put in the harder
 

3647
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:22,810
the more knowledge you put in the harder
it is for a system to actually be placed

3648
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:22,820
it is for a system to actually be placed
 

3649
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,950
it is for a system to actually be placed
taken out of the system in which it's

3650
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:24,960
taken out of the system in which it's
 

3651
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,160
taken out of the system in which it's
kind of been designed and placed in some

3652
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:28,170
kind of been designed and placed in some
 

3653
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,359
kind of been designed and placed in some
other system that maybe would need a

3654
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:29,369
other system that maybe would need a
 

3655
01:16:29,369 --> 01:16:30,500
other system that maybe would need a
completely different knowledge base to

3656
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:30,510
completely different knowledge base to
 

3657
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:33,109
completely different knowledge base to
to understand and perform well and so

3658
01:16:33,109 --> 01:16:33,119
to understand and perform well and so
 

3659
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:36,229
to understand and perform well and so
the real goal here is to strip out all

3660
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:36,239
the real goal here is to strip out all
 

3661
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,089
the real goal here is to strip out all
of the knowledge that we put in to the

3662
01:16:38,089 --> 01:16:38,099
of the knowledge that we put in to the
 

3663
01:16:38,099 --> 01:16:39,709
of the knowledge that we put in to the
point that we can just plug it into

3664
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:39,719
point that we can just plug it into
 

3665
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:42,259
point that we can just plug it into
something totally different and that to

3666
01:16:42,259 --> 01:16:42,269
something totally different and that to
 

3667
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:44,719
something totally different and that to
me is really you know the the promise of

3668
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:44,729
me is really you know the the promise of
 

3669
01:16:44,729 --> 01:16:46,939
me is really you know the the promise of
AI is that we can have systems such as

3670
01:16:46,939 --> 01:16:46,949
AI is that we can have systems such as
 

3671
01:16:46,949 --> 01:16:48,560
AI is that we can have systems such as
that which you know no matter what the

3672
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:48,570
that which you know no matter what the
 

3673
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,979
that which you know no matter what the
goal is no matter what goal we set to

3674
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:51,989
goal is no matter what goal we set to
 

3675
01:16:51,989 --> 01:16:55,310
goal is no matter what goal we set to
the system we can come up with we have

3676
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:55,320
the system we can come up with we have
 

3677
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,839
the system we can come up with we have
an algorithm which can be placed into

3678
01:16:56,839 --> 01:16:56,849
an algorithm which can be placed into
 

3679
01:16:56,849 --> 01:16:58,640
an algorithm which can be placed into
that world into that and

3680
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:58,650
that world into that and
 

3681
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,590
that world into that and
and can succeed in achieving that goal

3682
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:00,600
and can succeed in achieving that goal
 

3683
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:05,420
and can succeed in achieving that goal
and then that that's to me is almost the

3684
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:05,430
and then that that's to me is almost the
 

3685
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:06,920
and then that that's to me is almost the
the essence of intelligence if we can

3686
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:06,930
the essence of intelligence if we can
 

3687
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:09,110
the essence of intelligence if we can
achieve that and so alpha zero is a step

3688
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
achieve that and so alpha zero is a step
 

3689
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,320
achieve that and so alpha zero is a step
towards that and it's a step that was

3690
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:12,330
towards that and it's a step that was
 

3691
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:14,960
towards that and it's a step that was
taken in the context of two-player

3692
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:14,970
taken in the context of two-player
 

3693
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:17,630
taken in the context of two-player
perfect information games like go and

3694
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:17,640
perfect information games like go and
 

3695
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,360
perfect information games like go and
chess we also applied it to Japanese

3696
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:20,370
chess we also applied it to Japanese
 

3697
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:23,630
chess we also applied it to Japanese
chess so just to clarify the first step

3698
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:23,640
chess so just to clarify the first step
 

3699
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,680
chess so just to clarify the first step
was alphago zero the first step was to

3700
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:26,690
was alphago zero the first step was to
 

3701
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:29,530
was alphago zero the first step was to
try and take all of the knowledge out of

3702
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:29,540
try and take all of the knowledge out of
 

3703
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,690
try and take all of the knowledge out of
alphago in such a way that it could play

3704
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:32,700
alphago in such a way that it could play
 

3705
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:37,640
alphago in such a way that it could play
in a in a fully self discovered way

3706
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:37,650
in a in a fully self discovered way
 

3707
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:40,400
in a in a fully self discovered way
purely from self play and to me the the

3708
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:40,410
purely from self play and to me the the
 

3709
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,020
purely from self play and to me the the
motivation for that was always that we

3710
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:42,030
motivation for that was always that we
 

3711
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:44,110
motivation for that was always that we
could then plug it into other domains

3712
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:44,120
could then plug it into other domains
 

3713
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:48,200
could then plug it into other domains
but we saved that bat until later well

3714
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:48,210
but we saved that bat until later well
 

3715
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:53,180
but we saved that bat until later well
in in fact I mean just for fun I could

3716
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:53,190
in in fact I mean just for fun I could
 

3717
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,950
in in fact I mean just for fun I could
tell you exactly the moment where where

3718
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:54,960
tell you exactly the moment where where
 

3719
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,979
tell you exactly the moment where where
the idea for alpha zero occurred to me

3720
01:17:56,979 --> 01:17:56,989
the idea for alpha zero occurred to me
 

3721
01:17:56,989 --> 01:17:58,910
the idea for alpha zero occurred to me
because I think there's maybe a lesson

3722
01:17:58,910 --> 01:17:58,920
because I think there's maybe a lesson
 

3723
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,800
because I think there's maybe a lesson
there for for researchers who kind of

3724
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:00,810
there for for researchers who kind of
 

3725
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,720
there for for researchers who kind of
too deeply embedded in their in their

3726
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:02,730
too deeply embedded in their in their
 

3727
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:05,510
too deeply embedded in their in their
research and you know working 24/7 to

3728
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:05,520
research and you know working 24/7 to
 

3729
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,300
research and you know working 24/7 to
try and come up with the next idea which

3730
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:08,310
try and come up with the next idea which
 

3731
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:13,300
try and come up with the next idea which
is actually occurred to me on honeymoon

3732
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:13,310
is actually occurred to me on honeymoon
 

3733
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:16,760
is actually occurred to me on honeymoon
like it's my most fully relaxed state

3734
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:16,770
like it's my most fully relaxed state
 

3735
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:20,060
like it's my most fully relaxed state
really enjoying myself and and just

3736
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:20,070
really enjoying myself and and just
 

3737
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:24,110
really enjoying myself and and just
being this like the algorithm for alpha

3738
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:24,120
being this like the algorithm for alpha
 

3739
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:28,520
being this like the algorithm for alpha
zero just appeared I come and in in its

3740
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:28,530
zero just appeared I come and in in its
 

3741
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,710
zero just appeared I come and in in its
full form and this was actually before

3742
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:30,720
full form and this was actually before
 

3743
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:34,460
full form and this was actually before
we played against Lisa doll but we we

3744
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:34,470
we played against Lisa doll but we we
 

3745
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:37,000
we played against Lisa doll but we we
just didn't I think we were so busy

3746
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,010
just didn't I think we were so busy
 

3747
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:40,060
just didn't I think we were so busy
trying to make sure we could beat the

3748
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:40,070
trying to make sure we could beat the
 

3749
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:43,100
trying to make sure we could beat the
the world champion that it was only

3750
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:43,110
the world champion that it was only
 

3751
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:46,070
the world champion that it was only
later that we had the the opportunity to

3752
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,080
later that we had the the opportunity to
 

3753
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,350
later that we had the the opportunity to
step back and start examining that that

3754
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:48,360
step back and start examining that that
 

3755
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,090
step back and start examining that that
sort of deeper scientific question of

3756
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:50,100
sort of deeper scientific question of
 

3757
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,380
sort of deeper scientific question of
whether this could really work so

whether this could really work so

01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:56,090
whether this could really work so
nevertheless so soft play is probably

gamer so was it surprising to you what

3778
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:22,890
gamer so was it surprising to you what
 

3779
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,710
gamer so was it surprising to you what
was the intuition can you sort of think

01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:24,720
was the intuition can you sort of think
 

3781
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,780
was the intuition can you sort of think
not necessarily at that time even now

01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:28,650
what's your intuition why this thing

01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,830
what's your intuition why this thing
works so well why I was able to learn

works so well why I was able to learn
 

3787
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,870
works so well why I was able to learn
from scratch well let me first say why

we tried it so we tried it both because

01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:35,730
we tried it so we tried it both because

01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:38,090
we tried it so we tried it both because
I feel that it was the deeper scientific

01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:48,050
general in my research I don't like to
do research on questions for which we

do research on questions for which we
 

3801
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:51,380
do research on questions for which we
already know the likely outcome I don't

where you're 95% confident that that you
 

3807
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:58,910
where you're 95% confident that that you
will succeed and so we could have tried

3808
01:19:58,910 --> 01:19:58,920
will succeed and so we could have tried
 

3809
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,210
will succeed and so we could have tried
you know maybe to to take alphago and do

3810
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:02,220
you know maybe to to take alphago and do
 

3811
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,860
you know maybe to to take alphago and do
something which we we knew for sure it

3812
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:03,870
something which we we knew for sure it
 

3813
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,630
something which we we knew for sure it
would succeed on but much more

3814
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:05,640
would succeed on but much more
 

3815
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,280
would succeed on but much more
interesting to me was to try try it on

3816
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:07,290
interesting to me was to try try it on
 

3817
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,780
interesting to me was to try try it on
the things which we weren't sure about

3818
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:08,790
the things which we weren't sure about
 

3819
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:12,680
the things which we weren't sure about
and one of the big questions on our

3820
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:12,690
and one of the big questions on our
 

3821
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:14,510
and one of the big questions on our
minds back then was you know could you

3822
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:14,520
minds back then was you know could you
 

3823
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,310
minds back then was you know could you
really do this with self play alone how

3824
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:16,320
really do this with self play alone how
 

3825
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,950
really do this with self play alone how
far could that go would it be as strong

3826
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:18,960
far could that go would it be as strong
 

3827
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,520
far could that go would it be as strong
and honestly we weren't sure yeah it was

3828
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:22,530
and honestly we weren't sure yeah it was
 

3829
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:25,340
and honestly we weren't sure yeah it was
50/50 I think you know we I really if

3830
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:25,350
50/50 I think you know we I really if
 

3831
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:27,500
50/50 I think you know we I really if
you'd asked me I wasn't confident that

3832
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:27,510
you'd asked me I wasn't confident that
 

3833
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:30,110
you'd asked me I wasn't confident that
it could reach the same level as these

3834
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:30,120
it could reach the same level as these
 

3835
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,640
it could reach the same level as these
systems but it felt like the right

3836
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:31,650
systems but it felt like the right
 

3837
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:35,120
systems but it felt like the right
question to ask and even if even if it

3838
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:35,130
question to ask and even if even if it
 

3839
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,460
question to ask and even if even if it
had not achieved the same level I felt

3840
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:37,470
had not achieved the same level I felt
 

3841
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:41,750
had not achieved the same level I felt
that that was an important direction to

3842
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:41,760
that that was an important direction to
 

3843
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:47,750
that that was an important direction to
be studying and so then lo and behold it

3844
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:47,760
be studying and so then lo and behold it
 

3845
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,480
be studying and so then lo and behold it
actually ended up outperforming the

3846
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:50,490
actually ended up outperforming the
 

3847
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:52,340
actually ended up outperforming the
previous version of of alphago and

3848
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:52,350
previous version of of alphago and
 

3849
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:54,860
previous version of of alphago and
indeed was able to beat it by 100 games

3850
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:54,870
indeed was able to beat it by 100 games
 

3851
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:57,950
indeed was able to beat it by 100 games
to zero so what's the intuition as to as

3852
01:20:57,950 --> 01:20:57,960
to zero so what's the intuition as to as
 

3853
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:01,070
to zero so what's the intuition as to as
to why I think that the intuition to me

3854
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:01,080
to why I think that the intuition to me
 

3855
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:05,150
to why I think that the intuition to me
is clear that whenever you have errors

3856
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:05,160
is clear that whenever you have errors
 

3857
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,320
is clear that whenever you have errors
in a in a system as we did in alphago

3858
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:09,330
in a in a system as we did in alphago
 

3859
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:11,560
in a in a system as we did in alphago
alphago suffered from these delusions

3860
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:11,570
alphago suffered from these delusions
 

3861
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:13,400
alphago suffered from these delusions
occasionally it would misunderstand what

3862
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:13,410
occasionally it would misunderstand what
 

3863
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,570
occasionally it would misunderstand what
was going on in a position and miss

3864
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:14,580
was going on in a position and miss
 

3865
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:17,570
was going on in a position and miss
evaluate it how can how can you remove

3866
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:17,580
evaluate it how can how can you remove
 

3867
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:20,270
evaluate it how can how can you remove
all of these these errors errors arise

3868
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:20,280
all of these these errors errors arise
 

3869
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,370
all of these these errors errors arise
from many sources for us they were

3870
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:22,380
from many sources for us they were
 

3871
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,470
from many sources for us they were
arising both from you know it started

3872
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:24,480
arising both from you know it started
 

3873
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,880
arising both from you know it started
from the human data but also

3874
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:25,890
from the human data but also
 

3875
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:27,620
from the human data but also
from there from the nature of the search

3876
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:27,630
from there from the nature of the search
 

3877
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,000
from there from the nature of the search
and the nature of the algorithm itself

3878
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:29,010
and the nature of the algorithm itself
 

3879
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,730
and the nature of the algorithm itself
but the only way to address them in any

3880
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:31,740
but the only way to address them in any
 

3881
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:35,720
but the only way to address them in any
complex system is to give the system the

3882
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:35,730
complex system is to give the system the
 

3883
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:38,120
complex system is to give the system the
ability to correct its own errors it

3884
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:38,130
ability to correct its own errors it
 

3885
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:40,010
ability to correct its own errors it
must be able to correct them it must be

3886
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:40,020
must be able to correct them it must be
 

3887
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,930
must be able to correct them it must be
able to learn for itself when it's doing

3888
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:41,940
able to learn for itself when it's doing
 

3889
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:44,300
able to learn for itself when it's doing
something wrong and correct for it and

3890
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:44,310
something wrong and correct for it and
 

3891
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:46,040
something wrong and correct for it and
so it seemed to me that the way to

3892
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:46,050
so it seemed to me that the way to
 

3893
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:49,700
so it seemed to me that the way to
correct delusions was indeed to have

3894
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:49,710
correct delusions was indeed to have
 

3895
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:51,380
correct delusions was indeed to have
more iterations of reinforcement

3896
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:51,390
more iterations of reinforcement
 

3897
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,030
more iterations of reinforcement
learning that you know no matter where

3898
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:53,040
learning that you know no matter where
 

3899
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,560
learning that you know no matter where
you start you should be able to correct

3900
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:54,570
you start you should be able to correct
 

3901
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:57,140
you start you should be able to correct
those errors until it gets to play that

3902
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:57,150
those errors until it gets to play that
 

3903
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:59,510
those errors until it gets to play that
out and understand oh well I thought

3904
01:21:59,510 --> 01:21:59,520
out and understand oh well I thought
 

3905
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,890
out and understand oh well I thought
that I was going to win in this

3906
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:00,900
that I was going to win in this
 

3907
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,840
that I was going to win in this
situation but then I ended up losing

3908
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:02,850
situation but then I ended up losing
 

3909
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:05,060
situation but then I ended up losing
that suggests that I was miss evaluating

3910
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:05,070
that suggests that I was miss evaluating

01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,230
that suggests that I was miss evaluating
something there's a hole in my knowledge

3912
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:06,240
something there's a hole in my knowledge
 

3913
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,180
something there's a hole in my knowledge
and now now the system can correct for

3914
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:08,190
and now now the system can correct for
 

3915
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:09,950
and now now the system can correct for
itself and and understand how to do

01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:09,960
itself and and understand how to do
 

3917
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,380
itself and and understand how to do
better now if you take that same idea

3918
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:12,390
better now if you take that same idea
 

3919
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:15,170
better now if you take that same idea
and trace it back all the way to the

01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,270

highest levels of knowledge that you can
achieve in in a domain and the principle

achieve in in a domain and the principle
 

3931
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,480
achieve in in a domain and the principle
is the same that if you give if you

bestow a system with the ability to
 

3935
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,640
bestow a system with the ability to
correct its own errors then it can take

correct its own errors then it can take
 

3937
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:36,080
correct its own errors then it can take
you from random to something slightly

3938
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:36,090
you from random to something slightly
 

3939
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:38,480
you from random to something slightly
better than random because it sees the

better than random because it sees the

take you from that slightly better

4067
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:22,190
represent every state in a big table of
the game then we we know for sure that a

4068
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:22,200
the game then we we know for sure that a
 

4069
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,650
the game then we we know for sure that a
progress of self-improvement will lead

4070
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:24,660
progress of self-improvement will lead
 

4071
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:27,320
progress of self-improvement will lead
all the way in the single agent case to

4072
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:27,330
all the way in the single agent case to
 

4073
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,330
all the way in the single agent case to
the optimal possible behavior and in the

4074
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:29,340
the optimal possible behavior and in the
 

4075
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,430
the optimal possible behavior and in the
two-player case to the minimax optimal

4076
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:31,440
two-player case to the minimax optimal
 

4077
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,440
two-player case to the minimax optimal
behavior and that is that the best way

4078
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:33,450
behavior and that is that the best way
 

4079
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:35,810
behavior and that is that the best way
that I can play knowing that you're

4080
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:35,820
that I can play knowing that you're
 

4081
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:39,050
that I can play knowing that you're
playing perfectly against me and so so

4082
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:39,060
playing perfectly against me and so so
 

4083
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,390
playing perfectly against me and so so
for those cases we know that even if you

4084
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:41,400
for those cases we know that even if you
 

4085
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:45,170
for those cases we know that even if you
do open up some new error that in some

4086
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:45,180
do open up some new error that in some
 

4087
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,450
do open up some new error that in some
sense you've made progress you've you're

4088
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:47,460
sense you've made progress you've you're
 

4089
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,220
sense you've made progress you've you're
progressing towards the the best that

4090
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:49,230
progressing towards the the best that
 

4091
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:52,550
progressing towards the the best that
can be done so alphago was initially

4092
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
can be done so alphago was initially
 

4093
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,739
can be done so alphago was initially
trained

4094
01:25:53,739 --> 01:25:53,749
trained
 

4095
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:56,959
trained
expert games with some self play alphago

4096
01:25:56,959 --> 01:25:56,969
expert games with some self play alphago
 

4097
01:25:56,969 --> 01:25:59,089
expert games with some self play alphago
zero removed the need to be trained on

4098
01:25:59,089 --> 01:25:59,099
zero removed the need to be trained on
 

4099
01:25:59,099 --> 01:26:02,270
zero removed the need to be trained on
expert games and then another incredible

4100
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:02,280
expert games and then another incredible
 

4101
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,560
expert games and then another incredible
step for me because I just love chess is

4102
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:05,570
step for me because I just love chess is
 

4103
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:08,629
step for me because I just love chess is
to generalize that further to be in

4104
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
to generalize that further to be in
 

4105
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,609
to generalize that further to be in
alpha zero to be able to play the game

4106
01:26:10,609 --> 01:26:10,619
alpha zero to be able to play the game
 

4107
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:14,179
alpha zero to be able to play the game
of go beating alphago zero and alphago

4108
01:26:14,179 --> 01:26:14,189
of go beating alphago zero and alphago
 

4109
01:26:14,189 --> 01:26:16,099
of go beating alphago zero and alphago
and then also being able to play the

4110
01:26:16,099 --> 01:26:16,109
and then also being able to play the
 

4111
01:26:16,109 --> 01:26:19,369
and then also being able to play the
check the game of chess and others so

4112
01:26:19,369 --> 01:26:19,379
check the game of chess and others so
 

4113
01:26:19,379 --> 01:26:21,469
check the game of chess and others so
what was that step like what's the

4114
01:26:21,469 --> 01:26:21,479
what was that step like what's the
 

4115
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:24,799
what was that step like what's the
interesting aspects there that required

4116
01:26:24,799 --> 01:26:24,809
interesting aspects there that required
 

4117
01:26:24,809 --> 01:26:25,790
interesting aspects there that required
to make that happen

4118
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:25,800
to make that happen
 

4119
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,169
to make that happen
I think the remarkable observation which

4120
01:26:30,169 --> 01:26:30,179
I think the remarkable observation which
 

4121
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:32,869
I think the remarkable observation which
we saw with alpha zero was that actually

4122
01:26:32,869 --> 01:26:32,879
we saw with alpha zero was that actually
 

4123
01:26:32,879 --> 01:26:35,239
we saw with alpha zero was that actually
without modifying the algorithm at all

4124
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:35,249
without modifying the algorithm at all
 

4125
01:26:35,249 --> 01:26:38,029
without modifying the algorithm at all
it was able to play and crack some of a

4126
01:26:38,029 --> 01:26:38,039
it was able to play and crack some of a
 

4127
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:41,389
it was able to play and crack some of a
i's greatest previous challenges in

4128
01:26:41,389 --> 01:26:41,399
i's greatest previous challenges in
 

4129
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:43,879
i's greatest previous challenges in
particular we dropped it into the game

4130
01:26:43,879 --> 01:26:43,889
particular we dropped it into the game
 

4131
01:26:43,889 --> 01:26:46,459
particular we dropped it into the game
of chess and unlike the previous systems

4132
01:26:46,459 --> 01:26:46,469
of chess and unlike the previous systems
 

4133
01:26:46,469 --> 01:26:48,770
of chess and unlike the previous systems
like deep blue which had been worked on

4134
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:48,780
like deep blue which had been worked on
 

4135
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:51,979
like deep blue which had been worked on
for you know years and years and we were

4136
01:26:51,979 --> 01:26:51,989
for you know years and years and we were
 

4137
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:53,989
for you know years and years and we were
able to beat the world's strongest

4138
01:26:53,989 --> 01:26:53,999
able to beat the world's strongest
 

4139
01:26:53,999 --> 01:26:56,899
able to beat the world's strongest
computer chess program convincingly

4140
01:26:56,899 --> 01:26:56,909
computer chess program convincingly
 

4141
01:26:56,909 --> 01:27:00,949
computer chess program convincingly
using a system that was fully discovered

4142
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:00,959
using a system that was fully discovered
 

4143
01:27:00,959 --> 01:27:03,439
using a system that was fully discovered
by its own from from scratch with its

4144
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:03,449
by its own from from scratch with its
 

4145
01:27:03,449 --> 01:27:06,139
by its own from from scratch with its
own principles and in fact one of the

4146
01:27:06,139 --> 01:27:06,149
own principles and in fact one of the
 

4147
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:08,389
own principles and in fact one of the
nice things that that we found was that

4148
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:08,399
nice things that that we found was that
 

4149
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:11,359
nice things that that we found was that
in fact we also achieved the same result

4150
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:11,369
in fact we also achieved the same result
 

4151
01:27:11,369 --> 01:27:13,429
in fact we also achieved the same result
in in Japanese chess a variant of chess

4152
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:13,439
in in Japanese chess a variant of chess
 

4153
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:15,169
in in Japanese chess a variant of chess
where where you get to capture pieces

4154
01:27:15,169 --> 01:27:15,179
where where you get to capture pieces
 

4155
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:16,879
where where you get to capture pieces
and then place them back down on your on

4156
01:27:16,879 --> 01:27:16,889
and then place them back down on your on
 

4157
01:27:16,889 --> 01:27:19,339
and then place them back down on your on
your own side as an extra piece so much

4158
01:27:19,339 --> 01:27:19,349
your own side as an extra piece so much
 

4159
01:27:19,349 --> 01:27:22,040
your own side as an extra piece so much
more complicated variant of chess and we

4160
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:22,050
more complicated variant of chess and we
 

4161
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:23,569
more complicated variant of chess and we
also beat the world's strongest programs

4162
01:27:23,569 --> 01:27:23,579
also beat the world's strongest programs
 

4163
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:26,810
also beat the world's strongest programs
and reach superhuman performance in that

4164
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:26,820
and reach superhuman performance in that
 

4165
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:27,589
and reach superhuman performance in that
game too

4166
01:27:27,589 --> 01:27:27,599
game too
 

4167
01:27:27,599 --> 01:27:30,349
game too
and it was the very first time that we'd

4168
01:27:30,349 --> 01:27:30,359
and it was the very first time that we'd
 

4169
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:33,139
and it was the very first time that we'd
ever run the system on that particular

4170
01:27:33,139 --> 01:27:33,149
ever run the system on that particular
 

4171
01:27:33,149 --> 01:27:35,839
ever run the system on that particular
game was the version that we published

4172
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:35,849
game was the version that we published
 

4173
01:27:35,849 --> 01:27:38,869
game was the version that we published
in the paper on on alpha zero it just

4174
01:27:38,869 --> 01:27:38,879
in the paper on on alpha zero it just
 

4175
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:41,209
in the paper on on alpha zero it just
works out of the box literally no no no

4176
01:27:41,209 --> 01:27:41,219
works out of the box literally no no no
 

4177
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:42,409
works out of the box literally no no no
touching it we didn't have to do

4178
01:27:42,409 --> 01:27:42,419
touching it we didn't have to do
 

4179
01:27:42,419 --> 01:27:44,750
touching it we didn't have to do
anything and and there it was superhuman

4180
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:44,760
anything and and there it was superhuman
 

4181
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,790
anything and and there it was superhuman
performance no tweaking no no twiddling

4182
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:46,800
performance no tweaking no no twiddling
 

4183
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,099
performance no tweaking no no twiddling
and so I think there's something

4184
01:27:49,099 --> 01:27:49,109
and so I think there's something
 

4185
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:51,020
and so I think there's something
beautiful about that principle that you

4186
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:51,030
beautiful about that principle that you
 

4187
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:53,389
beautiful about that principle that you
can take and algorithm and without

4188
01:27:53,389 --> 01:27:53,399
can take and algorithm and without
 

4189
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:56,889
can take and algorithm and without
twiddling anything it just it just works

4190
01:27:56,889 --> 01:27:56,899
twiddling anything it just it just works
 

4191
01:27:56,899 --> 01:28:01,310
twiddling anything it just it just works
now to go beyond alpha zero what's

4192
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:01,320
now to go beyond alpha zero what's
 

4193
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,429
now to go beyond alpha zero what's
required alpha zero is is just a step

4194
01:28:04,429 --> 01:28:04,439
required alpha zero is is just a step
 

4195
01:28:04,439 --> 01:28:06,979
required alpha zero is is just a step
and there's a long way to go beyond that

4196
01:28:06,979 --> 01:28:06,989
and there's a long way to go beyond that
 

4197
01:28:06,989 --> 01:28:10,120
and there's a long way to go beyond that
to really crack the deep problems of AI

4198
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:10,130
to really crack the deep problems of AI
 

4199
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:12,919
to really crack the deep problems of AI
but one of the important steps is to

4200
01:28:12,919 --> 01:28:12,929
but one of the important steps is to
 

4201
01:28:12,929 --> 01:28:14,899
but one of the important steps is to
acknowledge that the world is a really

4202
01:28:14,899 --> 01:28:14,909
acknowledge that the world is a really
 

4203
01:28:14,909 --> 01:28:16,970
acknowledge that the world is a really
messy place you know it's this rich

4204
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:16,980
messy place you know it's this rich
 

4205
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,569
messy place you know it's this rich
complex beautiful but messy environment

4206
01:28:20,569 --> 01:28:20,579
complex beautiful but messy environment
 

4207
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:22,850
complex beautiful but messy environment
that we live in and no one gives us the

4211
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:27,979

in it somehow the agent needs to

4224
01:28:41,419 --> 01:28:41,429
in it somehow the agent needs to
 

4225
01:28:41,429 --> 01:28:44,209
in it somehow the agent needs to
understand the world for itself in a way

4226
01:28:44,209 --> 01:28:44,219
understand the world for itself in a way
 

4227
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:45,950
understand the world for itself in a way
where no one tells it the rules of the

game and yet it can still figure out
 

4231
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,379
game and yet it can still figure out
what to do in that world deal with this

4232
01:28:51,379 --> 01:28:51,389
what to do in that world deal with this
 

4233
01:28:51,389 --> 01:28:53,779
what to do in that world deal with this
stream of observations coming in rich

sensory input coming in actions going
 

4237
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:58,459
sensory input coming in actions going
out in a way that allows it to reason in

01:28:58,459 --> 01:28:58,469
out in a way that allows it to reason in
 

4239
01:28:58,469 --> 01:29:00,680
out in a way that allows it to reason in
the way that alphago or alpha zero can

01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:00,690
the way that alphago or alpha zero can
 

4241
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,870
the way that alphago or alpha zero can
reason in the way that these go and

4242
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:02,880
reason in the way that these go and
 

4243
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,330
reason in the way that these go and
chess-playing programs can reason but in

4244
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:05,340
chess-playing programs can reason but in
 

4245
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,910
chess-playing programs can reason but in
a way that allows it to take actions in

01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:07,920
a way that allows it to take actions in
 

4247
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,660
a way that allows it to take actions in
that messy world to to achieve its goals

4248
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:10,670
that messy world to to achieve its goals
 

4249
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:15,020
that messy world to to achieve its goals
and so this led us to the most recent

4250
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:15,030
and so this led us to the most recent
 

4251
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:17,120
and so this led us to the most recent
step in the story of alphago

4252
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:17,130
step in the story of alphago
 

4253
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:20,509
step in the story of alphago
which was a system called mu 0 and mu

which was a system called mu 0 and mu
 

4255
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:23,060
which was a system called mu 0 and mu
zero is a system which learns for itself

4256
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:23,070
zero is a system which learns for itself
 

4257
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:25,100
zero is a system which learns for itself
even when the rules are not given to it

01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:25,110
even when the rules are not given to it
 

4259
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,529
even when the rules are not given to it
it actually can be dropped into a system

4260
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:27,539
it actually can be dropped into a system
 

4261
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:30,140
it actually can be dropped into a system
with messy perceptual inputs we actually

01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:30,150
with messy perceptual inputs we actually
 

4263
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:34,009
with messy perceptual inputs we actually
tried it in the in some Atari games the

4264
01:29:34,009 --> 01:29:34,019
tried it in the in some Atari games the
 

4265
01:29:34,019 --> 01:29:36,770
tried it in the in some Atari games the
canonical domains of Atari that have

4266
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:36,780
canonical domains of Atari that have
 

4267
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,239
canonical domains of Atari that have
been used for reinforcement learning and

4268
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:38,249
been used for reinforcement learning and
 

4269
01:29:38,249 --> 01:29:42,379
been used for reinforcement learning and
and this system learned to build a model

4270
01:29:42,379 --> 01:29:42,389
and this system learned to build a model
 

4271
01:29:42,389 --> 01:29:44,540
and this system learned to build a model
of these Atari games they were

4272
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:44,550
of these Atari games they were
 

4273
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:48,739
of these Atari games they were
sufficiently rich and useful enough for

4274
01:29:48,739 --> 01:29:48,749
sufficiently rich and useful enough for
 

4275
01:29:48,749 --> 01:29:51,290
sufficiently rich and useful enough for
it to be able to plan successfully and

01:29:51,290 --> 01:29:51,300
it to be able to plan successfully and
 

4277
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,720
it to be able to plan successfully and
in fact that system not only went on to

01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:53,730
in fact that system not only went on to
 

4279
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:56,089
in fact that system not only went on to
to beat the state of the art in Atari

4280
01:29:56,089 --> 01:29:56,099
to beat the state of the art in Atari
 

4281
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:58,520
to beat the state of the art in Atari
but the same system without modification

was able to reach the same level of
superhuman performance in go chess and

01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:04,380
superhuman performance in go chess and
 

4287
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,279
superhuman performance in go chess and
shogi that we'd seen in alpha zero

showing that even without the rules the
 

4291
01:30:08,789 --> 01:30:10,580

4324
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:46,410
achieve its goals and that's the you
 

4325
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:48,020
achieve its goals and that's the you
know that's the fundamental process

01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:48,030
know that's the fundamental process
 

4327
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:49,310
know that's the fundamental process
there to go through when you're facing

there to go through when you're facing
 

4329
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,590
there to go through when you're facing
any uncertain kind of environment they

4330
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:51,600
any uncertain kind of environment they
 

4331
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,750
any uncertain kind of environment they
would in the real world it's figuring

4332
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:53,760
would in the real world it's figuring
 

4333
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,550
would in the real world it's figuring
out the sort of the rules the basic

4334
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:55,560
out the sort of the rules the basic
 

4335
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,440
out the sort of the rules the basic
rules of the game that's right so

4336
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:57,450
rules of the game that's right so
 

4337
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:59,540
rules of the game that's right so
there's a lot I mean the ad that that

4338
01:30:59,540 --> 01:30:59,550
there's a lot I mean the ad that that
 

4339
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:01,250
there's a lot I mean the ad that that
allows it to be applicable to basically

01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:05,960
allows it to be applicable to basically
any domain that could be digitized in

4345
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:10,940
the way that it needs to in order to be
consumable sort of in order for the

01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:10,950
consumable sort of in order for the
 

4347
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:12,410
consumable sort of in order for the
reinforcement learning framework to be

4348
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:12,420
reinforcement learning framework to be
 

4349

reinforcement learning problem needs to
 

4355
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,310
reinforcement learning problem needs to
deal with with worlds that are unknown

that so museu I was as a step I felt a
step in that direction one of the things

step in that direction one of the things
 

4365
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,790

01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:42,570
display of creativity some new
 

4377
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:45,320
display of creativity some new
strategies new behaviors that were

4378
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:45,330
strategies new behaviors that were
 

4379
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:48,020
strategies new behaviors that were
created that that again has echoes of

4380
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:48,030
created that that again has echoes of
 

4381
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:49,730
created that that again has echoes of
intelligence so is there something that

4382
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:49,740
intelligence so is there something that
 

4383
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,710
intelligence so is there something that
stands up do you see it the same way

4384
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:51,720
stands up do you see it the same way
 

4385
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,730
stands up do you see it the same way
that there's creativity and there's some

4386
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:54,740
that there's creativity and there's some
 

4387
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,740
that there's creativity and there's some
behaviors patterns you saw that alpha

4388
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:57,750
behaviors patterns you saw that alpha
 

4389
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,900
behaviors patterns you saw that alpha
zero was able to display their truly

4390
01:31:59,900 --> 01:31:59,910
zero was able to display their truly
 

4391
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:05,000
zero was able to display their truly
creative so let me start by I think

4392
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,010
creative so let me start by I think
 

4393
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:06,800
creative so let me start by I think
saying that I think we should ask what

4394
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:06,810
saying that I think we should ask what
 

4395
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:08,710
saying that I think we should ask what
creativity really means so to me

4396
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:08,720
creativity really means so to me
 

4397
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:12,920
creativity really means so to me
creativity means discovering something

4398
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:12,930
creativity means discovering something
 

4399
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:16,100
creativity means discovering something
which wasn't known before something

4400
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:16,110
which wasn't known before something
 

4401
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:18,470
which wasn't known before something
unexpected something out outside of our

4402
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
unexpected something out outside of our
 

4403
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:23,840
unexpected something out outside of our
norms and so in that sense the process

4404
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:23,850
norms and so in that sense the process
 

4405
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,670
norms and so in that sense the process
of reinforcement learning or

4406
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:25,680
of reinforcement learning or
 

4407
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:28,220
of reinforcement learning or
the self play approach that was used by

4408
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:28,230
the self play approach that was used by
 

4409
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:31,010
the self play approach that was used by
alpha zero is it's the essence of

4410
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:31,020
alpha zero is it's the essence of
 

4411
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:33,530
alpha zero is it's the essence of
creativity it's really saying at every

4412
01:32:33,530 --> 01:32:33,540
creativity it's really saying at every
 

4413
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:34,610
creativity it's really saying at every
stage

4414
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:34,620
stage
 

4415
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,720
stage
you're playing according to your current

4416
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:35,730
you're playing according to your current
 

4417
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:39,290
you're playing according to your current
norms and you try something and if it

4418
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:39,300
norms and you try something and if it
 

4419
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:42,500
norms and you try something and if it
works out you say hey here's something

4420
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:42,510
works out you say hey here's something
 

4421
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:44,570
works out you say hey here's something
great I'm gonna start using that and

4422
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:44,580
great I'm gonna start using that and
 

4423
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,580
great I'm gonna start using that and
then that process it's like a micro

4424
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:46,590
then that process it's like a micro
 

4425
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:48,680
then that process it's like a micro
discovery that happens millions and

4426
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:48,690

4427
01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:50,780
discovery that happens millions and
millions of times over the course of the

01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:55,530
some new idea oh this pattern this
 

4433
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:56,960
some new idea oh this pattern this
patterns working really well for me I'm

4434
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:56,970
patterns working really well for me I'm
 

4435
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:58,910
patterns working really well for me I'm
gonna I'm gonna start using that oh now

4436
01:32:58,910 --> 01:32:58,920
gonna I'm gonna start using that oh now
 

4437
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,770
gonna I'm gonna start using that oh now
oh here's this other thing I can do I

4438
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:00,780
oh here's this other thing I can do I
 

4439
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:02,780
oh here's this other thing I can do I
can start to to connect these stones

4440
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:02,790
can start to to connect these stones
 

4441
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:04,970
can start to to connect these stones
together in this way or I can start to

4442
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:04,980
together in this way or I can start to
 

4443
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:07,730
together in this way or I can start to
you know sacrifice stones or give up on

4444
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:07,740
you know sacrifice stones or give up on
 

4445
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,700
you know sacrifice stones or give up on
on on pieces or play shoulder hits on

4446
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:10,710
on on pieces or play shoulder hits on
 

4447
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,530
on on pieces or play shoulder hits on
the fifth line or whatever it is the

4448
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:12,540
the fifth line or whatever it is the
 

4449
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,850
the fifth line or whatever it is the
system is discovering things like this

4450
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:13,860
system is discovering things like this
 

4451
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,980
system is discovering things like this
for itself continually repeatedly all

4452
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:15,990
for itself continually repeatedly all
 

4453
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:18,260
for itself continually repeatedly all
the time and so it should come as no

4454
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:18,270
the time and so it should come as no
 

4455
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:20,930
the time and so it should come as no
surprise to us then when if you leave

these systems going that they discover

4458
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:22,740
these systems going that they discover
 

4459
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:26,240
these systems going that they discover
things that are not known to humans to

01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:26,250
things that are not known to humans to
 

4461
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:29,990
things that are not known to humans to
the human norms are considered creative

4462
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:30,000
the human norms are considered creative
 

4463
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,990
the human norms are considered creative
and we've seen this several times in

4464
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:33,000
and we've seen this several times in
 

4465
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,140
and we've seen this several times in
fact in alphago zero we saw this

4466
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:36,150
fact in alphago zero we saw this
 

4467
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:40,540
fact in alphago zero we saw this
beautiful timeline of discovery where

4468
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:40,550
beautiful timeline of discovery where
 

4469
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:43,070
beautiful timeline of discovery where
what we saw was that there are these

4470
01:33:43,070 --> 01:33:43,080
what we saw was that there are these
 

4471
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,900
what we saw was that there are these
opening patterns that humans play called

4472
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:44,910
opening patterns that humans play called
 

4473
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,730
opening patterns that humans play called
joseki these are like the patterns that

4474
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:46,740
joseki these are like the patterns that
 

4475
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:48,740
joseki these are like the patterns that
humans learn to play in the corners and

4476
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:48,750
humans learn to play in the corners and
 

4477
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,480
humans learn to play in the corners and
they've been developed and refined over

4478
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:50,490
they've been developed and refined over
 

4479
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:52,070
they've been developed and refined over
over literally thousands of years in the

4480
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:52,080
over literally thousands of years in the
 

4481
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,290
over literally thousands of years in the
game of go and what we saw was in the

4482
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:54,300
game of go and what we saw was in the
 

4483
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,630
game of go and what we saw was in the
course of the training

4484
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:56,640
course of the training
 

4485
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:00,050
course of the training
alphago 0 over the course of the 40 days

01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:00,060
alphago 0 over the course of the 40 days
 

4487
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,590
alphago 0 over the course of the 40 days
that we trained this system it's just to

4488
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:02,600
that we trained this system it's just to
 

4489
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,630
that we trained this system it's just to
discover exactly these patterns that

4490
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:05,640
discover exactly these patterns that
 

4491
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,450
discover exactly these patterns that
human players play and over time we

4492
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:08,460
human players play and over time we
 

4493
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,820
human players play and over time we
found that all of the joseki that humans

4494
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:10,830
found that all of the joseki that humans
 

4495
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:12,740
found that all of the joseki that humans
played were were discovered by the

4496
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:12,750
played were were discovered by the
 

4497
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:15,530
played were were discovered by the
system through this process of self play

4498
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:15,540
system through this process of self play
 

4499
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:18,140
system through this process of self play
and a sort of essential notion of

4500
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:18,150
and a sort of essential notion of
 

4501
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:20,210
and a sort of essential notion of
creativity well what was really

4502
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:20,220
creativity well what was really
 

4503
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,730
creativity well what was really
interesting was that over time it then

4504
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:22,740
interesting was that over time it then
 

4505
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:25,100
interesting was that over time it then
started to discard some of these maybe

4506
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:25,110
started to discard some of these maybe
 

4507
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:27,470
started to discard some of these maybe
own joseki that humans didn't know about

4508
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:27,480
own joseki that humans didn't know about
 

4509
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,420
own joseki that humans didn't know about
yeah and it starts to say oh well you

4510
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:29,430
yeah and it starts to say oh well you
 

4511
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:32,540
yeah and it starts to say oh well you
thought that the Knights move pincer

4512
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:32,550
thought that the Knights move pincer
 

4513
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:35,570
thought that the Knights move pincer
joseki was a great idea but here's

4514
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:35,580
joseki was a great idea but here's
 

4515
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:36,920
joseki was a great idea but here's
something you different you can do there

4516
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:36,930
something you different you can do there
 

4517
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:39,020
something you different you can do there
which make some new variation that the

4518
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:39,030
which make some new variation that the
 

4519
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:40,850
which make some new variation that the
humans didn't know about and actually

4520
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:40,860
humans didn't know about and actually
 

4521
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:43,250
humans didn't know about and actually
now the human go player study the joseki

4522
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:43,260
now the human go player study the joseki
 

4523
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,650
now the human go player study the joseki
their alphago played and they become the

4524
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:45,660
their alphago played and they become the
 

4525
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:48,050
their alphago played and they become the
new norms that are used in today

4531
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:57,770

just makes me feel good as a human being

4532
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:57,780
just makes me feel good as a human being
 

4533
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,740
just makes me feel good as a human being
that a self play mechanism knows nothing

4534
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:00,750
that a self play mechanism knows nothing
 

4535
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:03,230
that a self play mechanism knows nothing
about us humans discovers patterns that

4536
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:03,240
about us humans discovers patterns that
 

4537
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,510
about us humans discovers patterns that
we humans do it's just I get an

4538
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
we humans do it's just I get an
 

4539
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,310
we humans do it's just I get an
affirmation that we're doing we're doing

4540
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:07,320
affirmation that we're doing we're doing
 

4541
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:11,570
affirmation that we're doing we're doing
okay as humans yeah in this domain in

4542
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:11,580
okay as humans yeah in this domain in
 

4543
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,370
okay as humans yeah in this domain in
other domains we do we figure it out

4544
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:13,380
other domains we do we figure it out
 

4545
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,020
other domains we do we figure it out
it's like the Churchill quote about

4546
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:15,030
it's like the Churchill quote about
 

4547
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:17,870
it's like the Churchill quote about
democracy it's the you know it's the but

4548
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:17,880
democracy it's the you know it's the but
 

4549
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,310
democracy it's the you know it's the but
it sucks but it's the best song we've

4550
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:19,320
it sucks but it's the best song we've
 

4551
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:23,600
it sucks but it's the best song we've
tried so in general taking a step

4552
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:23,610
tried so in general taking a step
 

4553
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:26,450
tried so in general taking a step
outside of go and I take a million

4554
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:26,460
outside of go and I take a million
 

4555
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:28,370
outside of go and I take a million
accomplishment to have no time to talk

accomplishment to have no time to talk
 

4557
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:31,130
accomplishment to have no time to talk
about that with alpha star and so on and

4558
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:31,140
about that with alpha star and so on and
 

4559
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:34,540
about that with alpha star and so on and
and and the current work but in general

this self play mechanism that you've

4562
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:36,990
this self play mechanism that you've
 

4563
01:35:36,990 --> 01:35:39,260
this self play mechanism that you've
inspired the world with by beating the

inspired the world with by beating the
 

4565
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:42,770
inspired the world with by beating the
world champion goal player do you see

4566
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:42,780
world champion goal player do you see
 

4567
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:46,580
world champion goal player do you see
that as DC being applied in other

that as DC being applied in other
 

4569
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:50,150
that as DC being applied in other
domains do you have sort of dreams and

4570
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:50,160
domains do you have sort of dreams and
 

4571
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,980
domains do you have sort of dreams and
hopes that is applied in both the

4572
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:51,990
hopes that is applied in both the
 

4573
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:54,530

I mean alpha star really demonstrates

4578
01:35:58,910 --> 01:35:58,920
I mean alpha star really demonstrates
 

4579
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,990
I mean alpha star really demonstrates
that you can remove a lot of the

01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:00,000
that you can remove a lot of the
 

4581
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,030
that you can remove a lot of the
constraints but nevertheless it's in a

01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:02,040
constraints but nevertheless it's in a
 

4583
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,250
constraints but nevertheless it's in a
digital simulated environment do you

4584
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:04,260
digital simulated environment do you
 

4585
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,620
digital simulated environment do you
have a hope a dream that it starts being

4586
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:06,630
have a hope a dream that it starts being
 

4587
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:09,170
have a hope a dream that it starts being
applied in the robotics environment and

4588
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:09,180
applied in the robotics environment and
 

4589
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,840
applied in the robotics environment and
maybe even in domains that are a little

4590
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:11,850
maybe even in domains that are a little
 

4591
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:14,930
maybe even in domains that are a little
safety critical and so on and have you

4592
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:14,940
safety critical and so on and have you
 

4593
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,310
safety critical and so on and have you
know have a real impact in the real

01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:23,150
dream at this point so I absolutely do
 

4601
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:26,300
dream at this point so I absolutely do
hope and and imagine that we will we

01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:26,310
hope and and imagine that we will we
 

4603
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:28,130
hope and and imagine that we will we
will get to the point where ideas just

4604
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:28,140
will get to the point where ideas just
 

4605
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,810
will get to the point where ideas just
like these are used in all kinds of

01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:29,820
like these are used in all kinds of
 

4607
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:31,760
like these are used in all kinds of
different domains in fact one of the

01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:31,770
different domains in fact one of the
 

4609
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:33,350
different domains in fact one of the
most satisfying things as a researcher

most satisfying things as a researcher
 

4611
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,330
most satisfying things as a researcher
as when you start to see other people

4612
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:35,340
as when you start to see other people
 

4613
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,550
as when you start to see other people
use your your algorithms in unexpected

01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:37,560
use your your algorithms in unexpected
 

4615
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,130
use your your algorithms in unexpected
ways so in the last couple of years

4616
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:40,140
ways so in the last couple of years
 

4617
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,800
ways so in the last couple of years
there have been you know a couple of

4618
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:41,810
there have been you know a couple of
 

4619
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:45,080
there have been you know a couple of
nature papers where different teams

4620
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:45,090
nature papers where different teams
 

4621
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:48,920
nature papers where different teams
unbeknownst to to us took alpha zero and

4622
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:48,930
unbeknownst to to us took alpha zero and
 

4623
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:51,920
unbeknownst to to us took alpha zero and
applied exactly those same algorithms

4624
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:51,930
applied exactly those same algorithms
 

4625
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:56,030
applied exactly those same algorithms
and ideas to real-world problems of huge

4626
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:56,040
and ideas to real-world problems of huge
 

4627
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,310
and ideas to real-world problems of huge
meaning to to society so one of them was

4628
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:58,320
meaning to to society so one of them was
 

4629
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,710
meaning to to society so one of them was
the problem of chemical synthesis and

4630
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:00,720
the problem of chemical synthesis and
 

4631
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,959
the problem of chemical synthesis and
they were able to beat the

4632
01:37:01,959 --> 01:37:01,969
they were able to beat the
 

4633
01:37:01,969 --> 01:37:05,080
they were able to beat the
state-of-the-art in finding pathways of

01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:12,189
how to actually synthesize chemicals
retro retro chemical synthesis and the

01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:12,199
retro retro chemical synthesis and the
 

4639
01:37:12,199 --> 01:37:13,899

second paper actually actually just came

4640
01:37:13,899 --> 01:37:13,909
second paper actually actually just came
 

4641
01:37:13,909 --> 01:37:15,939
second paper actually actually just came
out a couple of weeks ago in nature

4642
01:37:15,939 --> 01:37:15,949
out a couple of weeks ago in nature
 

4643
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:19,540
out a couple of weeks ago in nature
showed that in quantum computation you

4644
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:19,550
showed that in quantum computation you
 

4645
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:20,830
showed that in quantum computation you
know one of the big questions is how to

4646
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:20,840
know one of the big questions is how to
 

4647
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:23,969
know one of the big questions is how to
how to understand the nature of the the

4648
01:37:23,969 --> 01:37:23,979
how to understand the nature of the the
 

4649
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:28,149
how to understand the nature of the the
function in quantum computation and a

4650
01:37:28,149 --> 01:37:28,159
function in quantum computation and a
 

4651
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:29,709
function in quantum computation and a
system based on alpha zero beat the

4652
01:37:29,709 --> 01:37:29,719
system based on alpha zero beat the
 

4653
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:31,180
system based on alpha zero beat the
state of the art by quite some distance

4654
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:31,190
state of the art by quite some distance
 

4655
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:33,430
state of the art by quite some distance
there again so so these are just

4656
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:33,440
there again so so these are just
 

4657
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,830
there again so so these are just
examples and I think you know the lesson

4658
01:37:35,830 --> 01:37:35,840
examples and I think you know the lesson
 

4659
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,169
examples and I think you know the lesson
which we've seen elsewhere in machine

4660
01:37:38,169 --> 01:37:38,179
which we've seen elsewhere in machine
 

4661
01:37:38,179 --> 01:37:39,879
which we've seen elsewhere in machine
learning time and time again is that if

4662
01:37:39,879 --> 01:37:39,889
learning time and time again is that if
 

4663
01:37:39,889 --> 01:37:42,969
learning time and time again is that if
you make something general it will be

4664
01:37:42,969 --> 01:37:42,979
you make something general it will be
 

4665
01:37:42,979 --> 01:37:44,410
you make something general it will be
used in all kinds of ways you know you

4666
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:44,420
used in all kinds of ways you know you
 

4667
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:46,120
used in all kinds of ways you know you
provide a really powerful tools to

4668
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:46,130
provide a really powerful tools to
 

4669
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:48,790
provide a really powerful tools to
society and and those tools can be used

4670
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:48,800
society and and those tools can be used
 

4671
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,870
society and and those tools can be used
in in amazing ways and so I think we're

4672
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:52,880
in in amazing ways and so I think we're
 

4673
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,330
in in amazing ways and so I think we're
just at the beginning and and for sure I

4674
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:55,340
just at the beginning and and for sure I
 

4675
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,830
just at the beginning and and for sure I
hope that we we see all kinds of

4676
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:56,840
hope that we we see all kinds of
 

4677
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:00,879
hope that we we see all kinds of
outcomes so the the in the the other

4678
01:38:00,879 --> 01:38:00,889
outcomes so the the in the the other
 

4679
01:38:00,889 --> 01:38:03,250
outcomes so the the in the the other
side of the question of a reinforcement

4680
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:03,260
side of the question of a reinforcement
 

4681
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:05,620
side of the question of a reinforcement
learning framework is you know you

4682
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:05,630
learning framework is you know you
 

4683
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:06,879
learning framework is you know you
usually want to specify a reward

4684
01:38:06,879 --> 01:38:06,889
usually want to specify a reward
 

4685
01:38:06,889 --> 01:38:11,439
usually want to specify a reward
function and an objective function what

4686
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:11,449
function and an objective function what
 

4687
01:38:11,449 --> 01:38:12,790
function and an objective function what
do you think about sort of ideas of

4688
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:12,800
do you think about sort of ideas of
 

4689
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,700
do you think about sort of ideas of
intrinsic rewards if we're not really

4690
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:15,710
intrinsic rewards if we're not really
 

4691
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:21,430
intrinsic rewards if we're not really
sure about you know of if we take you

4692
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:21,440
sure about you know of if we take you
 

4693
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,799
sure about you know of if we take you
know human beings existence proof that

4694
01:38:23,799 --> 01:38:23,809
know human beings existence proof that
 

4695
01:38:23,809 --> 01:38:26,080
know human beings existence proof that
we don't seem to be operating according

4696
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:26,090
we don't seem to be operating according
 

4697
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:29,069
we don't seem to be operating according
to a single reward do you think that

4698
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:29,079
to a single reward do you think that
 

4699
01:38:29,079 --> 01:38:32,859
to a single reward do you think that
there's interesting ideas for when you

4700
01:38:32,859 --> 01:38:32,869
there's interesting ideas for when you
 

4701
01:38:32,869 --> 01:38:34,750
there's interesting ideas for when you
don't know how to truly specify the

4702
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:34,760
don't know how to truly specify the
 

4703
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:37,450
don't know how to truly specify the
reward you know that there's some

4704
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:37,460
reward you know that there's some
 

4705
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:38,919
reward you know that there's some
flexibility for discovering it

4706
01:38:38,919 --> 01:38:38,929
flexibility for discovering it
 

4707
01:38:38,929 --> 01:38:40,450
flexibility for discovering it
intrinsically or so on

4708
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:40,460
intrinsically or so on
 

4709
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:42,279
intrinsically or so on
in the context of reinforcement learning

4710
01:38:42,279 --> 01:38:42,289
in the context of reinforcement learning
 

4711
01:38:42,289 --> 01:38:44,169
in the context of reinforcement learning
so I think you know when we think about

4712
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:44,179
so I think you know when we think about
 

4713
01:38:44,179 --> 01:38:46,330
so I think you know when we think about
intelligence it's really important to be

4714
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:46,340
intelligence it's really important to be
 

4715
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:48,189
intelligence it's really important to be
clear about the problem of intelligence

4716
01:38:48,189 --> 01:38:48,199
clear about the problem of intelligence
 

4717
01:38:48,199 --> 01:38:50,560
clear about the problem of intelligence
and I think it's clearest to understand

4718
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:50,570
and I think it's clearest to understand
 

4719
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:52,359
and I think it's clearest to understand
that problem in terms of some ultimate

4720
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:52,369
that problem in terms of some ultimate
 

4721
01:38:52,369 --> 01:38:54,129
that problem in terms of some ultimate
goal that we want the system to to try

4722
01:38:54,129 --> 01:38:54,139
goal that we want the system to to try
 

4723
01:38:54,139 --> 01:38:56,709
goal that we want the system to to try
and solve for and after all if we don't

4724
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:56,719
and solve for and after all if we don't
 

4725
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,029
and solve for and after all if we don't
understand the ultimate purpose of the

4726
01:38:58,029 --> 01:38:58,039
understand the ultimate purpose of the
 

4727
01:38:58,039 --> 01:39:01,120
understand the ultimate purpose of the
system do we really even have a clearly

4728
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:01,130
system do we really even have a clearly
 

4729
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,529
system do we really even have a clearly
defined defined problem that we are

4730
01:39:02,529 --> 01:39:02,539
defined defined problem that we are
 

4731
01:39:02,539 --> 01:39:07,149
defined defined problem that we are
solving at all now within that as with

4732
01:39:07,149 --> 01:39:07,159
solving at all now within that as with
 

4733
01:39:07,159 --> 01:39:10,989
solving at all now within that as with
your example for humans the system may

4734
01:39:10,989 --> 01:39:10,999
your example for humans the system may
 

4735
01:39:10,999 --> 01:39:14,080
your example for humans the system may
choose to create its own motivations and

4736
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:14,090
choose to create its own motivations and
 

4737
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:15,459
choose to create its own motivations and
sub goals

4738
01:39:15,459 --> 01:39:15,469
sub goals
 

4739
01:39:15,469 --> 01:39:16,899
sub goals
that helped the system to achieve its

4740
01:39:16,899 --> 01:39:16,909
that helped the system to achieve its
 

4741
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:20,979
that helped the system to achieve its
ultimate goal and that may indeed be a

4742
01:39:20,979 --> 01:39:20,989
ultimate goal and that may indeed be a
 

4743
01:39:20,989 --> 01:39:22,600
ultimate goal and that may indeed be a
hugely important mechanism to achieve

4744
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:22,610
hugely important mechanism to achieve
 

4745
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:24,430
hugely important mechanism to achieve
those altima goals but there is still

4746
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:24,440
those altima goals but there is still
 

4747
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,020
those altima goals but there is still
some ultimate goal I think the system

4748
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:26,030
some ultimate goal I think the system
 

4749
01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:28,390
some ultimate goal I think the system
needs to be measurable and and evaluated

4750
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:28,400
needs to be measurable and and evaluated
 

4751
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,669
needs to be measurable and and evaluated
against and even for humans I mean

4752
01:39:30,669 --> 01:39:30,679
against and even for humans I mean
 

4753
01:39:30,679 --> 01:39:32,680
against and even for humans I mean
humans were incredibly flexible we feel

4754
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:32,690
humans were incredibly flexible we feel
 

4755
01:39:32,690 --> 01:39:34,390
humans were incredibly flexible we feel
that we we can you know any goal that

4756
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:34,400
that we we can you know any goal that
 

4757
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,870
that we we can you know any goal that
we're given we feel we can we can master

4758
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:37,880
we're given we feel we can we can master
 

4759
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:40,930
we're given we feel we can we can master
to some degree but if we think of those

4760
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:40,940
to some degree but if we think of those
 

4761
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,060
to some degree but if we think of those
goals really you know like the goal of

4762
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:43,070
goals really you know like the goal of
 

4763
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:45,040
goals really you know like the goal of
being able to pick up an object or the

4764
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,050
being able to pick up an object or the
 

4765
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:46,660
being able to pick up an object or the
goal of being able to communicate

4766
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:46,670
goal of being able to communicate
 

4767
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:49,750
goal of being able to communicate
although influence people to do things

4768
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:49,760
although influence people to do things
 

4769
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,080
although influence people to do things
in a particular way or whatever those

4770
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:53,090
in a particular way or whatever those
 

4771
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:56,439
in a particular way or whatever those
goals are really they are that they're

4772
01:39:56,439 --> 01:39:56,449
goals are really they are that they're
 

4773
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:57,850
goals are really they are that they're
sub goals really that we set ourselves

4774
01:39:57,850 --> 01:39:57,860
sub goals really that we set ourselves
 

4775
01:39:57,860 --> 01:40:00,910
sub goals really that we set ourselves
you know we choose to pick up the object

4776
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:00,920
you know we choose to pick up the object
 

4777
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:04,180
you know we choose to pick up the object
we choose to communicate we choose to to

4778
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:04,190
we choose to communicate we choose to to
 

4779
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:05,739
we choose to communicate we choose to to
influence someone else and we choose

4780
01:40:05,739 --> 01:40:05,749
influence someone else and we choose
 

4781
01:40:05,749 --> 01:40:07,600
influence someone else and we choose
those because we think it will lead us

4782
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:07,610
those because we think it will lead us
 

4783
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:10,600
those because we think it will lead us
to something in our in later art and we

4784
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:10,610
to something in our in later art and we
 

4785
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:12,040
to something in our in later art and we
think that that's helpful to us to

4786
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:12,050
think that that's helpful to us to
 

4787
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:15,489
think that that's helpful to us to
achieve some ultimate goal now I don't

4788
01:40:15,489 --> 01:40:15,499
achieve some ultimate goal now I don't
 

4789
01:40:15,499 --> 01:40:17,350
achieve some ultimate goal now I don't
want to speculate whether or not humans

4790
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:17,360
want to speculate whether or not humans
 

4791
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,049
want to speculate whether or not humans
as a system necessarily have a singular

4792
01:40:20,049 --> 01:40:20,059
as a system necessarily have a singular
 

4793
01:40:20,059 --> 01:40:22,419
as a system necessarily have a singular
overall goal of survival or whatever it

4794
01:40:22,419 --> 01:40:22,429
overall goal of survival or whatever it
 

4795
01:40:22,429 --> 01:40:24,819
overall goal of survival or whatever it
is but I think the principle for

4796
01:40:24,819 --> 01:40:24,829
is but I think the principle for
 

4797
01:40:24,829 --> 01:40:26,200
is but I think the principle for
understanding and implementing

4798
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:26,210
understanding and implementing
 

4799
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:28,450
understanding and implementing
intelligences has to be that if we're

4800
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:28,460
intelligences has to be that if we're
 

4801
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:30,160
intelligences has to be that if we're
trying to understand intelligence or

4802
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:30,170
trying to understand intelligence or
 

4803
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:31,959
trying to understand intelligence or
implement our own there has to be a

4804
01:40:31,959 --> 01:40:31,969
implement our own there has to be a
 

4805
01:40:31,969 --> 01:40:35,049
implement our own there has to be a
well-defined problem otherwise if it's

4806
01:40:35,049 --> 01:40:35,059
well-defined problem otherwise if it's
 

4807
01:40:35,059 --> 01:40:37,479
well-defined problem otherwise if it's
not I think it's it's like an admission

4808
01:40:37,479 --> 01:40:37,489
not I think it's it's like an admission
 

4809
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:40,839
not I think it's it's like an admission
of defeat that forget to be hope for

4810
01:40:40,839 --> 01:40:40,849
of defeat that forget to be hope for
 

4811
01:40:40,849 --> 01:40:42,009
of defeat that forget to be hope for
understanding or implementing

understanding or implementing
 

4813
01:40:42,019 --> 01:40:43,719
understanding or implementing
intelligence we have to know what we're

4814
01:40:43,719 --> 01:40:43,729
intelligence we have to know what we're
 

4815
01:40:43,729 --> 01:40:44,830
intelligence we have to know what we're
doing we have to know what we're asking

doing we have to know what we're asking
 

4817
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,560
doing we have to know what we're asking
the system to do otherwise if you if you

4818
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:47,570
the system to do otherwise if you if you
 

4819
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:48,669
the system to do otherwise if you if you
don't have a clearly defined purpose

4820
01:40:48,669 --> 01:40:48,679
don't have a clearly defined purpose
 

4821
01:40:48,679 --> 01:40:49,660
don't have a clearly defined purpose
you're not going to get a clearly

01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:49,670
you're not going to get a clearly
 

4823
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:53,319
you're not going to get a clearly
defined answer the the ridiculous

4824
01:40:53,319 --> 01:40:53,329
defined answer the the ridiculous
 

4825
01:40:53,329 --> 01:40:55,479
defined answer the the ridiculous
big question that has to naturally

4826
01:40:55,479 --> 01:40:55,489
big question that has to naturally
 

4827
01:40:55,489 --> 01:40:58,600
big question that has to naturally
follow because they have to pin you down

4828
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:58,610
follow because they have to pin you down
 

4829
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:01,299
follow because they have to pin you down
on this on this thing that nevertheless

4830
01:41:01,299 --> 01:41:01,309
on this on this thing that nevertheless
 

4831
01:41:01,309 --> 01:41:04,270
on this on this thing that nevertheless
one of the big silly or big real

4832
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:04,280
one of the big silly or big real
 

4833
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,969
one of the big silly or big real
questions before humans is the meaning

4834
01:41:06,969 --> 01:41:06,979
questions before humans is the meaning
 

4835
01:41:06,979 --> 01:41:09,399
questions before humans is the meaning
of life is us trying to figure out our

4836
01:41:09,399 --> 01:41:09,409
of life is us trying to figure out our
 

4837
01:41:09,409 --> 01:41:11,649
of life is us trying to figure out our
own reward function yeah and you just

4838
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:11,659
own reward function yeah and you just
 

4839
01:41:11,659 --> 01:41:13,029
own reward function yeah and you just
kind of mentioned that if you want to

4840
01:41:13,029 --> 01:41:13,039
kind of mentioned that if you want to
 

4841
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:15,489
kind of mentioned that if you want to
build the intelligence systems and you

4842
01:41:15,489 --> 01:41:15,499
build the intelligence systems and you
 

4843
01:41:15,499 --> 01:41:16,810
build the intelligence systems and you
know what you're doing you should be at

4844
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:16,820
know what you're doing you should be at
 

4845
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,609
know what you're doing you should be at
least cognizant to some degree of what

4846
01:41:18,609 --> 01:41:18,619
least cognizant to some degree of what
 

4847
01:41:18,619 --> 01:41:20,680
least cognizant to some degree of what
the reward function is so the natural

4848
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:20,690
the reward function is so the natural
 

4849
01:41:20,690 --> 01:41:24,759
the reward function is so the natural
question is what do you think is the

4850
01:41:24,759 --> 01:41:24,769
question is what do you think is the
 

4851
01:41:24,769 --> 01:41:26,379
question is what do you think is the
reward function of human life the

4852
01:41:26,379 --> 01:41:26,389
reward function of human life the
 

4853
01:41:26,389 --> 01:41:29,080
reward function of human life the
meaning of life for us humans

4854
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:29,090
meaning of life for us humans
 

4855
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:33,550
meaning of life for us humans
the meaning of our existence I think you

4856
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:33,560
the meaning of our existence I think you
 

4857
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:35,430
the meaning of our existence I think you
know I'd be speculating beyond my own

4858
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:35,440
know I'd be speculating beyond my own
 

4859
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,930
know I'd be speculating beyond my own
expertise but but just for fun let me do

4860
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:37,940
expertise but but just for fun let me do
 

4861
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:40,360
expertise but but just for fun let me do
that yes please and say I think that

4862
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:40,370
that yes please and say I think that
 

4863
01:41:40,370 --> 01:41:41,650
that yes please and say I think that
there are many levels at which you can

4864
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:41,660
there are many levels at which you can
 

4865
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:43,960
there are many levels at which you can
understand a system and and you can

4866
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:43,970
understand a system and and you can
 

4867
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:46,390
understand a system and and you can
understand something as as optimizing

4868
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:46,400
understand something as as optimizing
 

4869
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:50,500
understand something as as optimizing
for a goal at many levels and so so you

4870
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:50,510
for a goal at many levels and so so you
 

4871
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:52,690
for a goal at many levels and so so you
can understand the the you know let's

4872
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:52,700
can understand the the you know let's
 

4873
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:54,730
can understand the the you know let's
start with the universe like um does the

4874
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:54,740
start with the universe like um does the
 

4875
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:56,320
start with the universe like um does the
universe have a purpose well it feels

4876
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:56,330
universe have a purpose well it feels
 

4877
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:59,520
universe have a purpose well it feels
like it's just one level just following

4878
01:41:59,520 --> 01:41:59,530
like it's just one level just following
 

4879
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:02,080
like it's just one level just following
certain mechanical laws of physics and

4880
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:02,090
certain mechanical laws of physics and
 

4881
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:03,760
certain mechanical laws of physics and
that that's led to the development of

4882
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:03,770
that that's led to the development of
 

4883
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:05,950
that that's led to the development of
the universe but at another level you

4884
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:05,960
the universe but at another level you
 

4885
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:08,770
the universe but at another level you
can view it as actually there's the

4886
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:08,780
can view it as actually there's the
 

4887
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:10,240
can view it as actually there's the
second law of thermodynamics that says

4888
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:10,250
second law of thermodynamics that says
 

4889
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,370
second law of thermodynamics that says
that this is increasing in entropy over

4890
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:12,380
that this is increasing in entropy over
 

4891
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:14,020
that this is increasing in entropy over
time forever and now there's a view

4892
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:14,030
time forever and now there's a view
 

4893
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:16,630
time forever and now there's a view
that's been developed by certain people

4894
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:16,640
that's been developed by certain people
 

4895
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,580
that's been developed by certain people
at MIT that this you can think of this

4896
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:18,590
at MIT that this you can think of this
 

4897
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:20,560
at MIT that this you can think of this
as as almost like a goal of the universe

4898
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:20,570
as as almost like a goal of the universe
 

4899
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:22,690
as as almost like a goal of the universe
that the purpose of the universe is to

4900
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:22,700
that the purpose of the universe is to
 

4901
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:25,510
that the purpose of the universe is to
maximize entropy so there's multiple

4902
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:25,520
maximize entropy so there's multiple
 

4903
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,950
maximize entropy so there's multiple
levels at which you can understand a

4904
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:26,960
levels at which you can understand a
 

4905
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:30,580
levels at which you can understand a
system the next level down you might say

4906
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:30,590
system the next level down you might say
 

4907
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:33,580
system the next level down you might say
well if the goal is to is to maximize

4908
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:33,590
well if the goal is to is to maximize
 

4909
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:38,740
well if the goal is to is to maximize
entropy well how do how does how can

4910
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:38,750
entropy well how do how does how can
 

4911
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:40,090
entropy well how do how does how can
that be done by a particular system and

4912
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:40,100
that be done by a particular system and
 

4913
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:42,190
that be done by a particular system and
maybe evolution is something that the

4914
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:42,200
maybe evolution is something that the
 

4915
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,170
maybe evolution is something that the
universe discovered in order in order to

4916
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:44,180
universe discovered in order in order to
 

4917
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:46,360
universe discovered in order in order to
kind of dissipate energy as efficiently

4918
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:46,370
kind of dissipate energy as efficiently
 

4919
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:48,730
kind of dissipate energy as efficiently
as possible and by the way I'm borrowing

4920
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:48,740
as possible and by the way I'm borrowing
 

4921
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:50,380
as possible and by the way I'm borrowing
from Max tegmark for some of these

4922
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:50,390
from Max tegmark for some of these
 

4923
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:53,010
from Max tegmark for some of these
metaphors yes the physicist

4924
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:53,020
metaphors yes the physicist
 

4925
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:55,570
metaphors yes the physicist
but if you can think of evolution as a

4926
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:55,580
but if you can think of evolution as a
 

4927
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:59,590
but if you can think of evolution as a
mechanism for dispersing energy then

4928
01:42:59,590 --> 01:42:59,600
mechanism for dispersing energy then
 

4929
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:03,040
mechanism for dispersing energy then
then evolution you you might say as then

4930
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:03,050
then evolution you you might say as then
 

4931
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:05,680
then evolution you you might say as then
becomes a goal which is if if evolution

4932
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:05,690
becomes a goal which is if if evolution
 

4933
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:07,450
becomes a goal which is if if evolution
disperses energy by reproducing as

4934
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:07,460
disperses energy by reproducing as
 

4935
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:09,100
disperses energy by reproducing as
efficiently as possible

4936
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:09,110
efficiently as possible
 

4937
01:43:09,110 --> 01:43:12,430
efficiently as possible
what's evolution then well it's now got

4938
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:12,440
what's evolution then well it's now got
 

4939
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,420
what's evolution then well it's now got
its own goal within that which is to

4940
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:15,430
its own goal within that which is to
 

4941
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:18,070
its own goal within that which is to
actually reproduce as effectively as

4942
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:18,080
actually reproduce as effectively as
 

4943
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:21,420
actually reproduce as effectively as
possible and now how does reproduction

4944
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:21,430
possible and now how does reproduction
 

4945
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:23,440
possible and now how does reproduction
how is that made as effective as

4946
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:23,450
how is that made as effective as
 

4947
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:27,310
how is that made as effective as
possible well you need entities within

4948
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:27,320
possible well you need entities within
 

4949
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,720
possible well you need entities within
that that can survive and reproduce as

4950
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:28,730
that that can survive and reproduce as
 

4951
01:43:28,730 --> 01:43:30,250
that that can survive and reproduce as
effectively as possible and so it's

4952
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:30,260
effectively as possible and so it's
 

4953
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:31,870
effectively as possible and so it's
natural in order to achieve that high

4954
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:31,880
natural in order to achieve that high
 

4955
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:33,820
natural in order to achieve that high
level goal those individual organisms

4956
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:33,830
level goal those individual organisms
 

4957
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:37,450
level goal those individual organisms
discover brains intelligences which

4958
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:37,460
discover brains intelligences which
 

4959
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:41,290
discover brains intelligences which
enable them to support the goals of

01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:41,300
enable them to support the goals of

and those brains what do they do well

4964
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:45,560
and those brains what do they do well
 

4965
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:48,250
and those brains what do they do well
perhaps the early brains maybe they were

4966
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:48,260
perhaps the early brains maybe they were
 

4967
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,850
perhaps the early brains maybe they were
controlling things at some direct level

4968
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:50,860
controlling things at some direct level
 

4969
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:52,780
controlling things at some direct level
you know maybe they were the equivalent

4970
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:52,790
you know maybe they were the equivalent
 

4971
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:54,490
you know maybe they were the equivalent
of pre-programmed systems which were

4972
01:43:54,490 --> 01:43:54,500
of pre-programmed systems which were
 

4973
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,340
of pre-programmed systems which were
directly controlling what was going on

4974
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:56,350
directly controlling what was going on
 

4975
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:59,709
directly controlling what was going on
and setting certain you know things in

4976
01:43:59,709 --> 01:43:59,719
and setting certain you know things in

01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:00,800
order to achieve these particular
 

4979
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,729
order to achieve these particular
particular goals but that led to a

4980
01:44:03,729 --> 01:44:03,739
particular goals but that led to a
 

4981
01:44:03,739 --> 01:44:06,220
particular goals but that led to a
another level of discovery which was

4982
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:06,230
another level of discovery which was
 

4983
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:07,660
another level of discovery which was
learning systems you know parts of the

4984
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:07,670
learning systems you know parts of the
 

4985
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:09,250
learning systems you know parts of the
brain which were able to learn from

4986
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:09,260
brain which were able to learn from
 

4987
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:11,649
brain which were able to learn from
themselves and learn how to to program

themselves to achieve any goal and
 

4991
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:14,919
themselves to achieve any goal and
presumably there are parts of the game

4992
01:44:14,919 --> 01:44:14,929
presumably there are parts of the game
 

4993
01:44:14,929 --> 01:44:18,399
presumably there are parts of the game
of the brain where goals are set to to

01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:18,409
of the brain where goals are set to to

parts of that that system and provides
 

4997
01:44:20,989 --> 01:44:22,360
parts of that that system and provides
this very flexible notion of

01:44:23,989 --> 01:44:25,899
intelligence that we as humans
presumably have which is the ability to

5002
01:44:25,899 --> 01:44:25,909
presumably have which is the ability to
 

5003
01:44:25,909 --> 01:44:27,760
presumably have which is the ability to
kind of wipe the reason we feel that we

5004
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:27,770
kind of wipe the reason we feel that we
 

5005
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:30,610
kind of wipe the reason we feel that we
can we can we can achieve any goal so so

5006
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:30,620
can we can we can achieve any goal so so
 

5007
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:32,169
can we can we can achieve any goal so so
it's a very long-winded answer to say

5008
01:44:32,169 --> 01:44:32,179
it's a very long-winded answer to say
 

5009
01:44:32,179 --> 01:44:33,550
it's a very long-winded answer to say
that you know I think there are many

5010
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:33,560
that you know I think there are many
 

5011
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,649
that you know I think there are many
perspectives and many levels at which

5012
01:44:35,649 --> 01:44:35,659
perspectives and many levels at which
 

5013
01:44:35,659 --> 01:44:39,220
perspectives and many levels at which
intelligence can be understood and and

5014
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:39,230
intelligence can be understood and and
 

5015
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:40,870
intelligence can be understood and and
each of those levels you can take

5016
01:44:40,870 --> 01:44:40,880
each of those levels you can take
 

5017
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,250
each of those levels you can take
multiple perspectives that you know you

5018
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:42,260
multiple perspectives that you know you
 

5019
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:44,050
multiple perspectives that you know you
can view the system as something which

5020
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:44,060
can view the system as something which
 

5021
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,550
can view the system as something which
is optimizing for a goal which is

5022
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:45,560
is optimizing for a goal which is
 

5023
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,310
is optimizing for a goal which is
understanding it at a level by which we

5024
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:48,320
understanding it at a level by which we
 

5025
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,050
understanding it at a level by which we
can maybe implement it and understand it

5026
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:50,060
can maybe implement it and understand it
 

5027
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:52,930
can maybe implement it and understand it
as AI researchers or computer scientists

5028
01:44:52,930 --> 01:44:52,940
as AI researchers or computer scientists
 

5029
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:54,850
as AI researchers or computer scientists
or you can understand it at the level of

5030
01:44:54,850 --> 01:44:54,860
or you can understand it at the level of
 

5031
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:56,260
or you can understand it at the level of
the mechanistic thing which is going on

5032
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:56,270
the mechanistic thing which is going on
 

5033
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:57,700
the mechanistic thing which is going on
that there are these you know atoms

5034
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:57,710
that there are these you know atoms
 

5035
01:44:57,710 --> 01:44:59,110
that there are these you know atoms
bouncing around in the brain and they

01:44:59,110 --> 01:44:59,120
bouncing around in the brain and they
 

5037
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:00,820
bouncing around in the brain and they
lead to the the outcome of that system

structured so beautifully in layers but

5050
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:16,940
structured so beautifully in layers but
 

5051
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:19,240
structured so beautifully in layers but
you did miss one layer which is the next

5052
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:19,250
you did miss one layer which is the next
 

5053
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:21,880
you did miss one layer which is the next

intelligence and data layer on top of
 

5059
01:45:27,949 --> 01:45:30,880
intelligence and data layer on top of
that and I can't wait to see well I may

5060
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:30,890
that and I can't wait to see well I may
 

5061
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:33,939
that and I can't wait to see well I may
not be around but they can't wait to see

5062
01:45:33,939 --> 01:45:33,949
not be around but they can't wait to see
 

5063
01:45:33,949 --> 01:45:36,640
not be around but they can't wait to see
what the next layer beyond that well we

5064
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:36,650
what the next layer beyond that well we
 

5065
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:38,439
what the next layer beyond that well we
well let's just take that that argument

5066
01:45:38,439 --> 01:45:38,449
well let's just take that that argument
 

5067
01:45:38,449 --> 01:45:40,300
well let's just take that that argument
you know and pursue it to a central

5068
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:40,310
you know and pursue it to a central
 

5069
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:42,760
you know and pursue it to a central
conclusion so the next level indeed is

5070
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:42,770
conclusion so the next level indeed is
 

5071
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:45,370
conclusion so the next level indeed is
for for how can our how can our learning

5072
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:45,380
for for how can our how can our learning
 

5073
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:48,669
for for how can our how can our learning
brain achieve its goals most effectively

5074
01:45:48,669 --> 01:45:48,679
brain achieve its goals most effectively
 

5075
01:45:48,679 --> 01:45:52,419
brain achieve its goals most effectively
well maybe it does so by by us as

5076
01:45:52,419 --> 01:45:52,429
well maybe it does so by by us as
 

5077
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:58,030
well maybe it does so by by us as
learning beings building a system which

5078
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:58,040
learning beings building a system which
 

5079
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:00,340
learning beings building a system which
is able to solve for those goals more

5080
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:00,350
is able to solve for those goals more
 

5081
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:02,680
is able to solve for those goals more
effectively than we can and so when we

5082
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:02,690
effectively than we can and so when we
 

5083
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,450
effectively than we can and so when we
build a system to play the game of go

5084
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:04,460
build a system to play the game of go
 

5085
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:06,370
build a system to play the game of go
you know when I said that I wanted to

5086
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:06,380
you know when I said that I wanted to
 

5087
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,660
you know when I said that I wanted to
build a system that can play go better

5088
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:07,670
build a system that can play go better
 

5089
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:09,760
build a system that can play go better
than I can I've enabled myself to

5090
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:09,770
than I can I've enabled myself to
 

5091
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:12,399
than I can I've enabled myself to
achieve that goal of playing go better

5092
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:12,409
achieve that goal of playing go better
 

5093
01:46:12,409 --> 01:46:14,500
achieve that goal of playing go better
than I could buy buy directly playing it

5094
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:14,510
than I could buy buy directly playing it
 

5095
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:17,439
than I could buy buy directly playing it
and learning it myself and so now a new

5096
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:17,449
and learning it myself and so now a new
 

5097
01:46:17,449 --> 01:46:19,360
and learning it myself and so now a new
layer has been created which is systems

5098
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:19,370
layer has been created which is systems
 

5099
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:21,399
layer has been created which is systems
which are able to achieve goals for

5100
01:46:21,399 --> 01:46:21,409
which are able to achieve goals for
 

5101
01:46:21,409 --> 01:46:21,970
which are able to achieve goals for
themselves

5102
01:46:21,970 --> 01:46:21,980
themselves
 

5103
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:24,399
themselves
and ultimately there may be layers

5104
01:46:24,399 --> 01:46:24,409
and ultimately there may be layers
 

5105
01:46:24,409 --> 01:46:26,410
and ultimately there may be layers
beyond that where they set sub goals to

5106
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:26,420
beyond that where they set sub goals to
 

5107
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:30,160
beyond that where they set sub goals to
parts of their own system in order to to

5108
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:30,170
parts of their own system in order to to
 

5109
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:33,850
parts of their own system in order to to
achieve those and so forth so incredible

5110
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:33,860
achieve those and so forth so incredible
 

5111
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:36,010
achieve those and so forth so incredible
so the story of intelligence I think I

5112
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:36,020
so the story of intelligence I think I
 

5113
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,840
so the story of intelligence I think I
think is is a multi-layered one and a

5114
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:37,850
think is is a multi-layered one and a
 

5115
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:40,570
think is is a multi-layered one and a
multi perspective one we live in an

5116
01:46:40,570 --> 01:46:40,580
multi perspective one we live in an
 

5117
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:42,970
multi perspective one we live in an
