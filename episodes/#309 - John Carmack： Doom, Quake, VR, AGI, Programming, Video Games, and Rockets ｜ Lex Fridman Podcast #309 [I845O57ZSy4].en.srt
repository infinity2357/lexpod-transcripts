00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,670
reasonably you could do a listing and it
would scroll things up and i figured out

468
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
would scroll things up and i figured out
 

469
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,390
would scroll things up and i figured out
that i could kind of tweak just a couple

470
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
that i could kind of tweak just a couple
 

471
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,230
that i could kind of tweak just a couple
things that i barely understood to put

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
things that i barely understood to put
 

473
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,150
things that i barely understood to put
it into a graphics mode and i could draw

474
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
it into a graphics mode and i could draw
 

475
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,469
it into a graphics mode and i could draw
graphics and then i could just do a line

476
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
graphics and then i could just do a line
 

477
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,230
graphics and then i could just do a line
feed at the very bottom of the screen

478
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
feed at the very bottom of the screen
 

479
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,990
feed at the very bottom of the screen
and then the system would scroll it all

480
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
and then the system would scroll it all
 

481
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,909
and then the system would scroll it all
up using an assembly language routine

482
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
up using an assembly language routine
 

483
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,350
up using an assembly language routine
that i didn't know how to write back

484
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
that i didn't know how to write back
 

485
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,150
that i didn't know how to write back
then

486
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
then
 

487
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,190
then
so i that was like this first great hack

488
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
so i that was like this first great hack
 

489
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,509
so i that was like this first great hack
that sort of had analogs later on in my

490
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
that sort of had analogs later on in my
 

491
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,110
that sort of had analogs later on in my
career for a lot of different things so

492
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
career for a lot of different things so
 

493
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,350
career for a lot of different things so
i found out that i could draw a screen i

494
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
i found out that i could draw a screen i
 

495
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,870
i found out that i could draw a screen i
could do a line feed at the bottom it

496
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
could do a line feed at the bottom it
 

497
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,469
could do a line feed at the bottom it
would scroll it up once i could draw a

498
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
would scroll it up once i could draw a
 

499
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,630
would scroll it up once i could draw a
couple more lines of stuff at the bottom

500
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
couple more lines of stuff at the bottom
 

501
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,710
couple more lines of stuff at the bottom
and that was my first way to kind of

502
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
and that was my first way to kind of
 

503
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,190
and that was my first way to kind of
scroll the screen which i you know which

504
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
scroll the screen which i you know which
 

505
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,630
scroll the screen which i you know which
was interesting and that that played a

506
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
was interesting and that that played a
 

507
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,389
was interesting and that that played a
big part later on in the id software

508
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
big part later on in the id software
 

509
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,630
big part later on in the id software
days as well so do efficient school

510
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
days as well so do efficient school
 

511
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,030
days as well so do efficient school
efficient drawing

512
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
efficient drawing
 

513
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,310
efficient drawing
where you don't have to draw the whole

514
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
where you don't have to draw the whole
 

515
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,550
where you don't have to draw the whole
screen but you draw from the bottom

516
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
screen but you draw from the bottom
 

517
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,630
screen but you draw from the bottom
using the thing that was designed in the

518
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
using the thing that was designed in the
 

519
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,590
using the thing that was designed in the
hardware for text output yeah where so

520
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
hardware for text output yeah where so
 

521
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,990
hardware for text output yeah where so
much of until recently i'm game design

522
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
much of until recently i'm game design
 

523
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,990
much of until recently i'm game design
was limited by what you could actually

524
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
was limited by what you could actually
 

525
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,829
was limited by what you could actually
get the computer to do where it's easy

526
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
get the computer to do where it's easy
 

527
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,590
get the computer to do where it's easy
to say like okay i want to scroll the

528
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
to say like okay i want to scroll the
 

529
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,750
to say like okay i want to scroll the
screen you just redraw the entire screen

530
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
screen you just redraw the entire screen
 

531
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,550
screen you just redraw the entire screen
at a slight offset and nowadays that

532
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
at a slight offset and nowadays that
 

533
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,389
at a slight offset and nowadays that
works just fine computers are

534
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
works just fine computers are
 

535
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,630
works just fine computers are
ludicrously fast i but up until a decade

536
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
ludicrously fast i but up until a decade
 

537
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,710
ludicrously fast i but up until a decade
ago or so there were all these things

538
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
ago or so there were all these things
 

539
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,949
ago or so there were all these things
everybody wanted to do but if they knew

540
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
everybody wanted to do but if they knew
 

541
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,870
everybody wanted to do but if they knew
enough programming to be able to make it

542
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
enough programming to be able to make it
 

543
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,190
enough programming to be able to make it
happen it would happen too slow to be a

544
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
happen it would happen too slow to be a
 

545
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,389
happen it would happen too slow to be a
good experience

546
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
good experience
 

547
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,630
good experience
either just ridiculously slow or just

548
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
either just ridiculously slow or just
 

549
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,310
either just ridiculously slow or just
slow enough that it wasn't fun to

550
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
slow enough that it wasn't fun to
 

551
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,030
slow enough that it wasn't fun to
experience it like that so so much of

552
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
experience it like that so so much of
 

553
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,710
experience it like that so so much of
kind of the first couple decades of the

554
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
kind of the first couple decades of the
 

555
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,269
kind of the first couple decades of the
programming work that i did was largely

556
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
programming work that i did was largely
 

557
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,710
programming work that i did was largely
figuring out how to do something that

558
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
figuring out how to do something that
 

559
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,790
figuring out how to do something that
everybody knows how they want it to

560
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
everybody knows how they want it to
 

561
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,269
everybody knows how they want it to
happen it just has to happen two to ten

562
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
happen it just has to happen two to ten
 

563
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,790
happen it just has to happen two to ten
times faster than sort of the

564
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
times faster than sort of the
 

565
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,269
times faster than sort of the
straightforward way of doing things

566
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
straightforward way of doing things
 

567
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,350
straightforward way of doing things
would make it happen and it's different

568
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
would make it happen and it's different
 

569
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,829
would make it happen and it's different
now because at this point

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
now because at this point
 

571
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,269
now because at this point
lots of things you can just do in the

572
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
lots of things you can just do in the
 

573
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,509
lots of things you can just do in the
most naive possible way and it still

574
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
most naive possible way and it still
 

575
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,910
most naive possible way and it still
works out you know you don't have nearly

576
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
works out you know you don't have nearly
 

577
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,910
works out you know you don't have nearly
the creative limitations or the

578
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
the creative limitations or the
 

579
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,470
the creative limitations or the
incentives for optimizing on that level

580
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
incentives for optimizing on that level
 

581
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,069
incentives for optimizing on that level
and there's a lot of pros and cons to

582
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
and there's a lot of pros and cons to
 

583
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,230
and there's a lot of pros and cons to
that but i do generally you know i'm not

584
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
that but i do generally you know i'm not
 

585
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,230
that but i do generally you know i'm not
going to do the the angry old man

586
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
going to do the the angry old man
 

587
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,069
going to do the the angry old man
shaking my fist at the clouds bit where

588
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
shaking my fist at the clouds bit where
 

589
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,910
shaking my fist at the clouds bit where
back in my day programmers had to do

590
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
back in my day programmers had to do
 

591
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,990
back in my day programmers had to do
real programming you know it's it's

592
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
real programming you know it's it's
 

593
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,990
real programming you know it's it's
amazing that you can just kind of pick

594
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
amazing that you can just kind of pick
 

595
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,910
amazing that you can just kind of pick
an idea and go do it right now and you

596
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
an idea and go do it right now and you
 

597
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,990
an idea and go do it right now and you
don't have to be some assembly language

598
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
don't have to be some assembly language
 

599
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,949
don't have to be some assembly language
wizard or deep gpu arcanist to be able

600
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
wizard or deep gpu arcanist to be able
 

601
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,630
wizard or deep gpu arcanist to be able
to figure out how to make your wishes

602
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
to figure out how to make your wishes
 

603
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,790
to figure out how to make your wishes
happen well they're still

604
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
happen well they're still
 

605
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,430
happen well they're still
see that's true but let me put on my old

606
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
see that's true but let me put on my old
 

607
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,630
see that's true but let me put on my old
man with a

608
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
man with a
 

609
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,670
man with a
hat and say that probably the thing that

610
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
hat and say that probably the thing that
 

611
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,069
hat and say that probably the thing that
will define the future still requires

612
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
will define the future still requires
 

613
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,190
will define the future still requires
you to

614
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
you to
 

615
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,110
you to
operate at the limits of the current

616
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
operate at the limits of the current
 

617
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,670
operate at the limits of the current
system so we'll probably talk about this

618
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
system so we'll probably talk about this
 

619
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,030
system so we'll probably talk about this
but if you talk about building the

620
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
but if you talk about building the
 

621
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,310
but if you talk about building the
metaverse

622
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
metaverse
 

623
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,230
metaverse
and building a vr experience that's

624
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
and building a vr experience that's
 

625
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,630
and building a vr experience that's
compelling it probably requires you to

626
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
compelling it probably requires you to
 

627
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,590
compelling it probably requires you to
not

628
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
not
 

629
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,230
not
to go to assembly or

630
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
to go to assembly or
 

631
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,710
to go to assembly or
maybe not literally but sort of uh

632
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
maybe not literally but sort of uh
 

633
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,030
maybe not literally but sort of uh
spiritually to go to the limits of what

634
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
spiritually to go to the limits of what
 

635
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,550
spiritually to go to the limits of what
the system is capable of yeah and that

636
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
the system is capable of yeah and that
 

637
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,910
the system is capable of yeah and that
really was why virtual reality was um

638
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
really was why virtual reality was um
 

639
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,910
really was why virtual reality was um
specifically interesting to me where it

640
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
specifically interesting to me where it
 

641
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,670
specifically interesting to me where it
had all the ties to you could say that

642
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
had all the ties to you could say that
 

643
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,509
had all the ties to you could say that
even back in the early days i have some

644
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
even back in the early days i have some
 

645
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,590
even back in the early days i have some
old magazine articles that's talking

old magazine articles that's talking
 

647
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,350
old magazine articles that's talking
about doom as a virtual reality

about doom as a virtual reality
 

649
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,110
about doom as a virtual reality
experience back when just seeing

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
experience back when just seeing
 

651
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,069
experience back when just seeing
anything in 3d uh so you could say that

652
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
anything in 3d uh so you could say that
 

653
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,829
anything in 3d uh so you could say that
we've been trying to build those virtual

we've been trying to build those virtual
 

655
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,990
we've been trying to build those virtual

you're scheduling all the dn dma
 

679
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,629
you're scheduling all the dn dma
accesses but it is still definitely a

is that it's not the writing of the

it's not necessarily just how fast you

wrote it or how how fast it operates but

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,750
wrote it or how how fast it operates but
it's how can it bend and adapt as

it's how can it bend and adapt as
 

865
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,910
it's how can it bend and adapt as
situations change and then the thing

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
situations change and then the thing
 

867
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,670

malleable of a language it is that if

958
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
malleable of a language it is that if
 

959
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,150
malleable of a language it is that if
you write a huge list program you've

960
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
you write a huge list program you've
 

961
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,550
you write a huge list program you've
basically invented your own kind of

962
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
basically invented your own kind of
 

963
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,710
basically invented your own kind of
language and structure because it's not

964
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
language and structure because it's not
 

965
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,990
language and structure because it's not
the primitives of the language you're

966
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
the primitives of the language you're
 

967
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,749
the primitives of the language you're
using very much it's all of the things

968
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
using very much it's all of the things
 

969
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,670
using very much it's all of the things
you've built on top of that and then a

970
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
you've built on top of that and then a
 

971
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,430
you've built on top of that and then a
language like racket kind of one of the

972
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
language like racket kind of one of the
 

973
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,509
language like racket kind of one of the
more modern lisp versions it's

974
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
more modern lisp versions it's
 

975
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,350
more modern lisp versions it's
essentially touted as a language for

976
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
essentially touted as a language for
 

977
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,069
essentially touted as a language for
building other languages and

978
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
building other languages and
 

979
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,710
building other languages and
i understand the value of that for a

980
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
i understand the value of that for a
 

981
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,429
i understand the value of that for a
tiny little project but the idea of that

982
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
tiny little project but the idea of that
 

983
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,510
tiny little project but the idea of that
for one of these long term supported by

984
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
for one of these long term supported by
 

985
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,909
for one of these long term supported by
lots of people kind of horrifies me

986
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
lots of people kind of horrifies me
 

987
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,990
lots of people kind of horrifies me
where all of those abstractions that

988
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
where all of those abstractions that
 

989
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,669
where all of those abstractions that
you're like okay you can't touch this

990
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
you're like okay you can't touch this
 

991
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,470
you're like okay you can't touch this
code till you educate yourself on all of

992
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
code till you educate yourself on all of
 

993
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,230
code till you educate yourself on all of
these things that we've built on top of

994
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
these things that we've built on top of
 

995
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,630
these things that we've built on top of
that and it was interesting to see how

996
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
that and it was interesting to see how
 

997
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,669
that and it was interesting to see how
uh when google made go a lot of time

998
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
uh when google made go a lot of time
 

999
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,270
uh when google made go a lot of time
criticisms of that are it's like wow

1000
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
criticisms of that are it's like wow
 

1001
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,870
criticisms of that are it's like wow
this is not a state-of-the-art language

1002
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
this is not a state-of-the-art language
 

1003
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,029
this is not a state-of-the-art language
this language is just so simple and

1004
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
this language is just so simple and
 

1005
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,710
this language is just so simple and
almost crude and you could see the

1006
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
almost crude and you could see the
 

1007
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,029
almost crude and you could see the
programming language people just looking

1008
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
programming language people just looking
 

1009
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,430
programming language people just looking
down at it but it does seem to be quite

1010
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
down at it but it does seem to be quite
 

1011
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,750
down at it but it does seem to be quite
popular as basically saying this is the

good things about c everybody can just

1014
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
good things about c everybody can just
 

1015
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,990
good things about c everybody can just
jump right in and use it you don't need

1016
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
jump right in and use it you don't need
 

1017
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,630
jump right in and use it you don't need
to restructure your brain to write good

programming language is the one that

mixed languages on a project that's a
 

1049
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,270
mixed languages on a project that's a
mistake i would rather

1050
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
mistake i would rather
 

1051
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,190
mistake i would rather
stay just in one language so that

1052
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
stay just in one language so that
 

1053
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,029
stay just in one language so that
everybody can work across the entire

thing and we have i get meta we have a

1056
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
thing and we have i get meta we have a
 

1057
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,750
thing and we have i get meta we have a
lot of projects that use kind of react

1058
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
lot of projects that use kind of react
 

1059
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,750
lot of projects that use kind of react
frameworks so you've got javascript here

1060
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
frameworks so you've got javascript here
 

1061
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,190
frameworks so you've got javascript here
and then you have

1062
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
and then you have
 

1063
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,110
and then you have
c plus plus for real work and then you

1064
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
c plus plus for real work and then you
 

1065
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,870
c plus plus for real work and then you
may have java interfacing with some

1066
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
may have java interfacing with some
 

1067
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,870
may have java interfacing with some
other part of the android system and

other part of the android system and
 

1069
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,950
other part of the android system and
those are all kind of horrible things

1070
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
those are all kind of horrible things
 

1071

you just you go out and you find those
 

1109
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,789
you just you go out and you find those
programmers and you don't hire the other

1110

programmers and you don't hire the other
 

1111

programmers that don't do the languages
that you want to use

1114
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
that you want to use
 

1115
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,590
that you want to use
but right now i guess yeah they're using

1116
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
but right now i guess yeah they're using
 

1117
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,990
but right now i guess yeah they're using
javascript on a bunch of the the spacex

1118
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,000
javascript on a bunch of the the spacex
 

1119
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,830
javascript on a bunch of the the spacex
work for the ui side of things when you

1120
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
work for the ui side of things when you
 

1121
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,430
work for the ui side of things when you
go find ui programmers they're

1122
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
go find ui programmers they're
 

1123
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,350
go find ui programmers they're
javascript programmers i wonder if

1124
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
javascript programmers i wonder if
 

1125
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,310
javascript programmers i wonder if
that's because there's a lot of

1126
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
that's because there's a lot of
 

1127
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,549
that's because there's a lot of
javascript programmers because i do

1128
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
javascript programmers because i do
 

1129
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,430
javascript programmers because i do
think

1130
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
think
 

1131
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,630
think
that great programmers are rare

1132
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
that great programmers are rare
 

1133
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,630
that great programmers are rare
that it's not

1134
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,640
that it's not
 

1135
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,230
that it's not
you know if you just look at statistics

1136
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
you know if you just look at statistics
 

1137
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,230
you know if you just look at statistics
of how many people are using different

1138
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,240
of how many people are using different
 

1139
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,750
of how many people are using different
programming languages that doesn't tell

1140
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
programming languages that doesn't tell
 

1141
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,110
programming languages that doesn't tell
you the story

1142
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
you the story
 

1143
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,750
you the story
of what the great programmers are using

1144
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
of what the great programmers are using
 

1145
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,270
of what the great programmers are using
and so you have to

1146
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
and so you have to
 

1147
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,029
and so you have to
really look at what you were speaking to

1148
00:19:59,029 --> 00:19:59,039
really look at what you were speaking to
 

1149
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,630
really look at what you were speaking to
which is the fundamentals of a language

1150
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,640
which is the fundamentals of a language
 

1151
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,990
which is the fundamentals of a language
what does it encourage how does it

1152
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
what does it encourage how does it
 

1153
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,590
what does it encourage how does it
encourage you to think what kind of

1154
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
encourage you to think what kind of
 

1155
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,510
encourage you to think what kind of
systems does it encourage you to build

1156
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
systems does it encourage you to build
 

1157
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,789
systems does it encourage you to build
there is something about c plus plus

1158
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
there is something about c plus plus
 

1159
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,350
there is something about c plus plus
that has elements of creativity but

1160
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
that has elements of creativity but
 

1161
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,750
that has elements of creativity but
forces you to be an adult

1162
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
forces you to be an adult
 

1163
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,590
forces you to be an adult
about your programming which it expects

1164
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
about your programming which it expects
 

1165
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,350
about your programming which it expects
you to be an adult expectantly not

1166
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
you to be an adult expectantly not
 

1167
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,750
you to be an adult expectantly not
forced you do and so

1168
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
forced you do and so
 

1169
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,470
forced you do and so
it's

1170
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
it's
 

1171
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,190
it's
so it brings out people

1172
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
so it brings out people
 

1173
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,590
so it brings out people
that are willing to be creative in terms

1174
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
that are willing to be creative in terms

let me ask you about this other language

1188
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
let me ask you about this other language
 

1189
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,350
let me ask you about this other language
javascript

1190
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,360
javascript
 

1191
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,470
javascript
so if we you know aliens visit

1192
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
so if we you know aliens visit
 

1193
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,470
so if we you know aliens visit
in thousands of years and humans are

1194
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
in thousands of years and humans are
 

1195
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,990
in thousands of years and humans are
long gone

1196
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
long gone
 

1197
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,230
long gone
something tells me that most of the

1198
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
something tells me that most of the
 

1199
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,909
something tells me that most of the
systems they find would be running

1200
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
systems they find would be running
 

1201
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,310
systems they find would be running
javascript i kind of think that if the

1202
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320
javascript i kind of think that if the
 

1203
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,909
javascript i kind of think that if the
simula if we're living in a simulation

1204
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
simula if we're living in a simulation
 

1205
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,870
simula if we're living in a simulation
it's really it's written in javascript

1206
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
it's really it's written in javascript
 

1207
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,669
it's really it's written in javascript
um you know for the longest time even

1208
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
um you know for the longest time even
 

1209
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,350
um you know for the longest time even
still

1210
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:05,360
still
 

1211
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,990
still
javascript didn't get any respect

1212
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
javascript didn't get any respect
 

1213
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,909
javascript didn't get any respect
and yet it runs so much of the world in

1214
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
and yet it runs so much of the world in
 

1215
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,350
and yet it runs so much of the world in
an increasing

1216
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360
an increasing
 

1217
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,590
an increasing
number of the world is it possible that

1218
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:13,600
number of the world is it possible that
 

1219
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,110
number of the world is it possible that
all everything will be written in

1220
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
all everything will be written in
 

1221
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,669
all everything will be written in
javascript one day so the engineering

1222
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
javascript one day so the engineering
 

1223
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,990
javascript one day so the engineering
under javascript is really pretty

1224
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
under javascript is really pretty
 

1225
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,990
under javascript is really pretty
phenomenal uh the

1226
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
phenomenal uh the
 

1227
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,149
phenomenal uh the
the systems that make javascript run as

1228
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
the systems that make javascript run as
 

1229
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,310
the systems that make javascript run as
fast as it does right now

1230
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,320
fast as it does right now
 

1231
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,909
fast as it does right now
are kind of miracles of modern

1232
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919
are kind of miracles of modern
 

1233
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,950
are kind of miracles of modern
engineering in many ways it does feel

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
engineering in many ways it does feel
 

1235
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,470
engineering in many ways it does feel
like

1236
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:32,480
like
 

1237
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,630
like
it is not an optimal language for all

1238
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
it is not an optimal language for all
 

1239

uh without type systems and so on i am

1246
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
uh without type systems and so on i am
 

1247
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,630
uh without type systems and so on i am
but i think for a lot of people it does

programming effort
 

1607
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,870
programming effort
it's uh it seems like efficiency isn't

1608
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:12,880
it's uh it seems like efficiency isn't
 

1609

it's uh it seems like efficiency isn't
the thing that's being optimized for

the thing that's being optimized for
 

1611
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,389
the thing that's being optimized for
like natural selection is very

1612
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:16,399
like natural selection is very
 

1613
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,909
like natural selection is very
inefficient but it kind of

1614
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:19,919
inefficient but it kind of
 

1615
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,590
inefficient but it kind of
adapts and through the process of

pretty interesting and so i think of
 

1625
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,789
pretty interesting and so i think of

they're becoming useful to people they
kind of naturally live and then you

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
kind of naturally live and then you
 

1637
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,590

kind of the evolutionary process so
that's a really good analogy and we can

that's a really good analogy and we can

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,190
technical people it's like
you shouldn't be taking pride just in

1906
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,200
you shouldn't be taking pride just in
 

1907
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,029
you shouldn't be taking pride just in
the specific thing like code golf is the

00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
the specific thing like code golf is the
 

1909
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,950
the specific thing like code golf is the
sort of thing it's a fun puzzle game but

1910
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:34,960
sort of thing it's a fun puzzle game but
 

1911
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,630
sort of thing it's a fun puzzle game but
that really should not be a major

1912
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:36,640
that really should not be a major
 

1913
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,470
that really should not be a major
motivator for you it's like we're

1914
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,480
motivator for you it's like we're
 

1915
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,389
motivator for you it's like we're
solving problems for people or we're

1916
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:40,399
solving problems for people or we're
 

1917
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,070
solving problems for people or we're
providing entertainment to people we're

1918
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,080
providing entertainment to people we're
 

1919
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,990
providing entertainment to people we're
doing something of value to people

1920
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
doing something of value to people
 

1921
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,590
doing something of value to people
that's displacing something else in

1922
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,600
that's displacing something else in
 

1923
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,830
that's displacing something else in
their life so we want to be providing a

1924
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
their life so we want to be providing a
 

1925
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,870
their life so we want to be providing a
net value over what they could be doing

1926
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
net value over what they could be doing
 

1927
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,470
net value over what they could be doing
uh but instead they're choosing to use

1928
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
uh but instead they're choosing to use
 

1929
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,110
uh but instead they're choosing to use
our products and that's where i mean it

1930
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
our products and that's where i mean it
 

1931
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,190
our products and that's where i mean it
sounds trite or corny but i

1932
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
sounds trite or corny but i
 

1933
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,870
sounds trite or corny but i
fundamentally do think that's how you

1934
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:58,880
fundamentally do think that's how you
 

1935
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,029
fundamentally do think that's how you
make the world a better place if you

1936
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:01,039
make the world a better place if you
 

1937
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,110
make the world a better place if you
have given more value to people than it

1938
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
have given more value to people than it
 

1939
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,669
have given more value to people than it
took you and your team to create

1940
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:05,679
took you and your team to create
 

1941
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,830
took you and your team to create
then the world's a better place people

1942
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
then the world's a better place people
 

1943
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,589
then the world's a better place people
have they've gone from something of

1944
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:09,599
have they've gone from something of
 

1945
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,829
have they've gone from something of
lesser value chosen to use your product

1946
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
lesser value chosen to use your product
 

1947
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,909
lesser value chosen to use your product
and their life feels better for that and

1948
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
and their life feels better for that and
 

1949
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,149
and their life feels better for that and
if you've produced that economically

1950
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
if you've produced that economically
 

1951
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,629
if you've produced that economically
that's that's a really good thing

1952
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:18,639
that's that's a really good thing
 

1953
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,790
that's that's a really good thing
i you know on the other hand if you

1954
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:20,800
i you know on the other hand if you
 

1955
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,869
i you know on the other hand if you
spent ridiculous amounts of money you've

1956
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:22,879
spent ridiculous amounts of money you've
 

1957
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,389
spent ridiculous amounts of money you've
just kind of shoveled a lot of cash into

1958
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:24,399
just kind of shoveled a lot of cash into
 

1959
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,310
just kind of shoveled a lot of cash into
a wood chipper there and you should

1960
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,320
a wood chipper there and you should
 

1961
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,310
a wood chipper there and you should
maybe you know not feel so good about

1962
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,320
maybe you know not feel so good about
 

1963
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,669
maybe you know not feel so good about
what you're doing

1964

what you're doing
 

1965
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,950
what you're doing
so

1966
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
so
 

1967
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,710
so
being proud about like a specific

1968
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
being proud about like a specific
 

1969
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,109
being proud about like a specific
architecture or specific technology or a

1970
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:35,119
architecture or specific technology or a
 

1971
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,510
architecture or specific technology or a
specific code sequence that you've done

1972
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,520
specific code sequence that you've done
 

1973
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,270
specific code sequence that you've done
it's great to get a little smile like a

1974
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,280
it's great to get a little smile like a
 

1975
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,510
it's great to get a little smile like a
tiny little dopamine hit for that but

1976
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
tiny little dopamine hit for that but
 

1977
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,349
tiny little dopamine hit for that but
the top level metric should be that

1978
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:43,359
the top level metric should be that
 

1979
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,669
the top level metric should be that
you're building things of value now you

1980
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:45,679
you're building things of value now you
 

1981
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,669
you're building things of value now you
can get in the argument about how you

1982
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
can get in the argument about how you
 

1983
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,669
can get in the argument about how you
you know what is user value how do you

1984
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:49,679
you know what is user value how do you
 

1985
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,909
you know what is user value how do you
actually quantify that and there can be

1986
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919
actually quantify that and there can be
 

1987
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,909
actually quantify that and there can be
big arguments about that but it's easy

1988
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
big arguments about that but it's easy
 

1989
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,990
big arguments about that but it's easy
to be able to say okay this pissed off

1990
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:56,000
to be able to say okay this pissed off
 

1991
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,910
to be able to say okay this pissed off
user there is not getting value from

user there is not getting value from
 

1993
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,829
user there is not getting value from
what you're doing this user over there

1994

what you're doing this user over there

the moment of delight when something

1998
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
the moment of delight when something
 

1999
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,510
the moment of delight when something
happened there's a value that's happened

2000
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:05,520
happened there's a value that's happened
 

2001
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,190
happened there's a value that's happened
there i mean if you you have to at least

2002
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,200
there i mean if you you have to at least
 

2003
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,349
there i mean if you you have to at least
accept that there is a concept of user

2004
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
accept that there is a concept of user
 

2005
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,510
accept that there is a concept of user
value even if you have trouble exactly

2006
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:11,520
value even if you have trouble exactly
 

2007
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,670
value even if you have trouble exactly
quantifying it you can usually make

2008
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:13,680
quantifying it you can usually make
 

2009
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,750
quantifying it you can usually make
relative arguments about it well this

2010
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:15,760
relative arguments about it well this
 

2011
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,910
relative arguments about it well this
was better than this uh we've improved

2012
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:17,920
was better than this uh we've improved
 

2013
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,790
was better than this uh we've improved
things

2014
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:18,800
things
 

2015
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,750

me ask you about this the big debates
 

2119
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,270
me ask you about this the big debates
that you're mentioning of how to measure

is it possible to measure it kind of um

2124
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,400
is it possible to measure it kind of um
 

2125
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,950
is it possible to measure it kind of um

the designer route of imagining
 

2131
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,790
the designer route of imagining
sort of uh somebody using a thing and

2132
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:28,800
sort of uh somebody using a thing and
 

2133
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,790
sort of uh somebody using a thing and

00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:35,839
that you have when you use the thing
 

2139
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,910
that you have when you use the thing
that's from a design perspective or if

2140
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
that's from a design perspective or if
 

2141
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,750
that's from a design perspective or if
you're building more like a low lower

2142
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
you're building more like a low lower
 

2143
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,550
you're building more like a low lower
level thing for like linux you imagine a

2144
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:42,560
level thing for like linux you imagine a
 

2145
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,550
level thing for like linux you imagine a
developer that might come across this

2146
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
developer that might come across this
 

2147
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,870
developer that might come across this
and use it and become

2148
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:46,880
and use it and become
 

2149
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,750
and use it and become
uh

2150
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:47,760
uh
 

2151
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,550
uh
happy and better off because of it so

2152
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
happy and better off because of it so
 

2153
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,870
happy and better off because of it so
where do you land on those things is it

2154
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:52,880
where do you land on those things is it
 

2155
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,990
where do you land on those things is it
measurable so i imagine like meta

2156
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
measurable so i imagine like meta
 

2157
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,109
measurable so i imagine like meta
and google

2158
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
and google
 

2159
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,710
and google
will probably try to measure the thing

2160
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:58,720
will probably try to measure the thing
 

2161
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,310
will probably try to measure the thing
they'll try to it's like you try to

2162
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,320
they'll try to it's like you try to
 

2163
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,230
they'll try to it's like you try to
optimize engagement or something let's

2164
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,240
optimize engagement or something let's
 

2165
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,069
optimize engagement or something let's
measure engagement and then i think

2166
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:04,079
measure engagement and then i think
 

2167
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,990
measure engagement and then i think
there is a kind of

2168
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
there is a kind of
 

2169
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,390
there is a kind of
i mean i admire the designer ethic of

2170
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,400
i mean i admire the designer ethic of
 

2171
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,430
i mean i admire the designer ethic of
like

2172
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
like
 

2173
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,870
like
think of a future that's immeasurable

2174
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:12,880
think of a future that's immeasurable
 

2175
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,870
think of a future that's immeasurable
and you try to make somebody in that

2176
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:14,880
and you try to make somebody in that
 

2177
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,270
and you try to make somebody in that
future that's different from today happy

2178
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
future that's different from today happy
 

2179
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,950
future that's different from today happy
so i do

2180
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
so i do
 

2181
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,910
so i do

listen to the data but you can go too

2186
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:26,560
listen to the data but you can go too
 

2187
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,790
listen to the data but you can go too

file rights uh to kind of archive this

2196
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:36,880
file rights uh to kind of archive this
 

2197
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,069
file rights uh to kind of archive this
stuff because we needed to collect

2198
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:38,079
stuff because we needed to collect
 

2199
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,510

doing you know if our plans were good

2202
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:42,560
doing you know if our plans were good
 

2203
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,670
doing you know if our plans were good
so

2204
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
so
 

2205
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,829
so
when information is available you should

2545
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,550
generally didn't bother me much uh at id
and i could get a lot of programming

2546
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:32,560
and i could get a lot of programming
 

2547
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,589
and i could get a lot of programming
work done

2548
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:33,599
work done
 

2549
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,870
work done
that way

2550
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880

i did settle into a more normal schedule
 

2553
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,030
i did settle into a more normal schedule
when i was taking kids to school and

00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,040
when i was taking kids to school and
 

2555

when i was taking kids to school and
things like that

things like that
 

2557
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,910
things like that
so kids were the forcing function that

2558
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
so kids were the forcing function that
 

2559
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,430
so kids were the forcing function that
got you to wake up and

2560

got you to wake up and
 

2561
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,430
got you to wake up and
at the same time it's not clear to me

2562
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:45,440
at the same time it's not clear to me
 

2563
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,349
at the same time it's not clear to me
that there was a much of a difference in

2564
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:47,359
that there was a much of a difference in
 

2565
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,390
that there was a much of a difference in
the productivity with i with that where

2566
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:50,400
the productivity with i with that where
 

2567
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,390
the productivity with i with that where
i kind of feel if i just get up when i

2568
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:52,400
i kind of feel if i just get up when i
 

2569
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,309
i kind of feel if i just get up when i
feel like it it's usually a little later

2570
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
feel like it it's usually a little later
 

2571
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,190
feel like it it's usually a little later
each day but i just recently made the

00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:57,200
each day but i just recently made the
 

2573
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,870
each day but i just recently made the
focusing decision to try to push my

2574
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:58,880
focusing decision to try to push my
 

2575
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,950
focusing decision to try to push my
schedule back a little bit earlier to

00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
schedule back a little bit earlier to
 

2577

2579
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,950
getting up at eight in the morning and
trying to to shift things around like

2580
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:04,960
trying to to shift things around like
 

2581
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,750
trying to to shift things around like
i'm

00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920
i'm often doing experiments with myself
 

2585
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,750
i'm often doing experiments with myself
about what should i be doing to to be

2586
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:09,760
about what should i be doing to to be
 

2587
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,910
about what should i be doing to to be
more productive and one of the things

2588
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
more productive and one of the things
 

2589
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,230
more productive and one of the things
that i did realize was happening in

2590
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,240
that i did realize was happening in
 

2591
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,190
that i did realize was happening in
recent months where i would i would go

2592
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,200
recent months where i would i would go
 

2593
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,069
recent months where i would i would go
for a walk or a run i cover like four

2594
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:20,079
for a walk or a run i cover like four
 

2595
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,990
for a walk or a run i cover like four
miles a day and

2596
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,000
miles a day and
 

2597
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,589
miles a day and
and i would usually do that just as the

2598
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:23,599
and i would usually do that just as the
 

2599

2602
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:27,839
and it's still really damn hot but i'd
 

2603
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,950
and it's still really damn hot but i'd
go out at 8 30 or something and cover

2604
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:30,960
go out at 8 30 or something and cover
 

2605
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,790
go out at 8 30 or something and cover
the time there and then the showering

2606
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:32,800
the time there and then the showering
 

2607
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,630
the time there and then the showering
and it was putting a hole in my day

2608
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:34,640
and it was putting a hole in my day
 

2609
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,870
and it was putting a hole in my day
where i would have still a couple hours

2610
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
where i would have still a couple hours
 

2611
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,790
where i would have still a couple hours
after that and sometimes my best hours

2612
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:38,800
after that and sometimes my best hours
 

2613
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,390
after that and sometimes my best hours
were at night when nobody else is around

2614
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:40,400
were at night when nobody else is around
 

2615
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,950
were at night when nobody else is around
nobody's bothering me but that hole in

2616
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,960
nobody's bothering me but that hole in
 

2617
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,030
nobody's bothering me but that hole in
the day was a problem so just a couple

2618
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
the day was a problem so just a couple
 

2619
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,430
the day was a problem so just a couple
weeks ago i made the pin the change to

2620
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
weeks ago i made the pin the change to
 

2621
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,470
weeks ago i made the pin the change to
go ahead and say all right i'm going to

2622
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
go ahead and say all right i'm going to
 

2623
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,670
go ahead and say all right i'm going to
get up a little earlier i'm going to do

2624
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:49,680
get up a little earlier i'm going to do
 

2625
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,069
get up a little earlier i'm going to do
a walk or get out there first so i can

2626
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:52,079
a walk or get out there first so i can
 

2627
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,150
a walk or get out there first so i can
have more uninterrupted time so i'm

2628
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,160
have more uninterrupted time so i'm
 

2629
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,309
have more uninterrupted time so i'm
still playing with factors like this as

2630
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
still playing with factors like this as
 

2631
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,470
still playing with factors like this as
i kind of optimize my

00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:58,480
i kind of optimize my
 

2633
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,670
i kind of optimize my
my work efforts but it's always been

the programmers that would do these
 

2645
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,470
the programmers that would do these
marathon sessions and and i had like

2646
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,480
marathon sessions and and i had like
 

2647

classic hacker tropes about things and a
part of me was like i was a little

2658

2661
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,990
bothered that that wasn't me that i i
wouldn't go program

2662
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,000
wouldn't go program
 

2663
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,150
wouldn't go program
20 hours straight because i'm just i'm

2664
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,160
20 hours straight because i'm just i'm
 

2665

2669
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,150
effective after 12 hours i mean yeah 12
hour programming that's fine when you're

2670
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,160
hour programming that's fine when you're
 

2671
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,510
hour programming that's fine when you're
doing that but

2672
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
doing that but
 

2673
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,990
doing that but
it never you're not doing smart work

2674
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,000
it never you're not doing smart work
 

2675
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,990
it never you're not doing smart work
much after at least i'm not but there's

2676
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,000
much after at least i'm not but there's
 

2677
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,270
much after at least i'm not but there's
a range of people i mean that's

2678
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
a range of people i mean that's
 

2679
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,109
a range of people i mean that's
something that a lot of people don't

2680
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:43,119
something that a lot of people don't
 

2681
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,870
something that a lot of people don't
really get in their gut where there are

2682
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
really get in their gut where there are
 

2683
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,190
really get in their gut where there are

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,270
literally getting less done there is a
point where you start breaking things

point where you start breaking things
 

2769

00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,630
and getting worse
worse behavior and everything out of it

where you're literally going backwards
 

2775
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,430
where you're literally going backwards
but it's not at 8 or 10 or 12 hours and

but it's not at 8 or 10 or 12 hours and
the fictional example i would use was

00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
the fictional example i would use was
 

2779
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,230
the fictional example i would use was
imagine there's an asteroid coming to

that's going to uh to deflect the
 

2791
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,750
that's going to uh to deflect the
asteroid do you want them to clock out

2792
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:39,760
asteroid do you want them to clock out
 

2793
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,349
asteroid do you want them to clock out
at five because damn it they're just

2794
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:41,359
at five because damn it they're just
 

2795
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,270
at five because damn it they're just
going to go do worse work if they work

2796
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,280
going to go do worse work if they work
 

2797
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,430
going to go do worse work if they work
another couple hours and you know it

2798
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:45,440
another couple hours and you know it
 

2799
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,190
another couple hours and you know it
seems absurd

2800
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:47,200
seems absurd
 

2801
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,710
seems absurd
and that's a hypothetical though and

2802
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:48,720
and that's a hypothetical though and
 

2803
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,470
and that's a hypothetical though and
everyone can dismiss that but then when

2804
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:50,480
everyone can dismiss that but then when
 

2805
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,349
everyone can dismiss that but then when
coronavirus was hitting and you have all

coronavirus was hitting and you have all
 

2807
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,950
coronavirus was hitting and you have all
of these medical personnel that are

2808
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960
of these medical personnel that are
 

2809
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,349
of these medical personnel that are
clearly pushing themselves really really

2810

clearly pushing themselves really really
 

2811
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,150
clearly pushing themselves really really
hard and i'd say it's like okay do you

2812
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,160
hard and i'd say it's like okay do you
 

2813
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,710
hard and i'd say it's like okay do you
want all of these scientists working on

2814
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:02,720
want all of these scientists working on
 

2815

treatments and vaccines and caring for
all of these people are they really

all of these people are they really
 

2819
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,470
all of these people are they really
screwing everything up by working more

2820
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:08,480
screwing everything up by working more
 

2821
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,230
screwing everything up by working more
than eight hours a day and of course

2822
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:10,240
than eight hours a day and of course
 

2823
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,829
than eight hours a day and of course
people say i'm just an to say

2824

people say i'm just an to say
 

2825
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,390
people say i'm just an to say
something like that but it's i you know

something like that but it's i you know
 

2827
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,950
something like that but it's i you know
it's the truth working longer gets more

2828
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:16,960
it's the truth working longer gets more
 

2829
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,230
it's the truth working longer gets more
done well so that's kind of uh the layer

2830
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:20,240
done well so that's kind of uh the layer
 

2831
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,910
done well so that's kind of uh the layer
one but i'd like to also say that

2832
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:23,920
one but i'd like to also say that
 

2833
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,510
one but i'd like to also say that
at least i believe depending on the

at least i believe depending on the
 

2835
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,990
at least i believe depending on the
person depending on the task

2836

person depending on the task
 

2837
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,630
person depending on the task
working more and harder

2838
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640
working more and harder

debuggers and ides like so much of it is

00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:53,760
debuggers and ides like so much of it is
 

3309
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,710
debuggers and ides like so much of it is
like emacs bim for things and we just

00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:56,720
like emacs bim for things and we just
 

3311
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,109
like emacs bim for things and we just
assume that debuggers don't work most of

assume that debuggers don't work most of

3317
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,230

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,950
things where i did come up through the
the personal computers and then the dos

do you appreciate the buggers

3330
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
do you appreciate the buggers

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,390
do you appreciate the buggers
very much so i mean a debugger is how

00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:20,400
very much so i mean a debugger is how

very much so i mean a debugger is how
you get a view into a system that's too

3334
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:22,319
you get a view into a system that's too
 

3335
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,390
you get a view into a system that's too
complicated to understand i mean anybody

3336
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
complicated to understand i mean anybody
 

3337
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,990
complicated to understand i mean anybody
that thinks just read the code and think

3338
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,000
that thinks just read the code and think
 

3339
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,230
that thinks just read the code and think
about it that's an insane statement in

3340
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:28,240
about it that's an insane statement in
 

3341
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,230
about it that's an insane statement in
the you can't even read all the code on

3342
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,240
the you can't even read all the code on
 

3343

the you can't even read all the code on
a big system you have to do experiments

3344
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:32,799
a big system you have to do experiments
 

3345
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,910
a big system you have to do experiments
on the system and doing that by adding

3346
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:35,920
on the system and doing that by adding
 

3347
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,750
on the system and doing that by adding
log statements recompiling and

3348
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:37,760
log statements recompiling and
 

3349
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,829
log statements recompiling and
re-running it uh is an incredibly

3350
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:39,839
re-running it uh is an incredibly
 

3351
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,510
re-running it uh is an incredibly
inefficient way of doing it i mean yes

3352
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:41,520
inefficient way of doing it i mean yes

get it done
but

00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:53,280
but
 

3367
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,950
but
it's amazing what you can do with

it's amazing what you can do with
 

3369
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,589
it's amazing what you can do with

00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,390
people that will break out gdb when
they're at their wit's end and they just

they're at their wit's end and they just
 

3407
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,910
they're at their wit's end and they just
have beat their head against a problem

have beat their head against a problem
 

3409

of grew up in game dev it's like they
 

3413
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,990
of grew up in game dev it's like they
were running into the debugger anyways

3414
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:40,000
were running into the debugger anyways
 

3415

before they even knew there was a
 

3417
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,750
before they even knew there was a

3418
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:43,760
problem and you would just stop and see
 

3419
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,789
problem and you would just stop and see
you know what was happening and

00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:44,799
you know what was happening and
 

3421
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,549
you know what was happening and
sometimes you could fix things even

before you you know
even before you did one compile cycle

even before you did one compile cycle
 

3427
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,829
even before you did one compile cycle
you could be in the debugger and you

00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:57,440
and fix it and go on and for people who
 

3435
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,309
and fix it and go on and for people who
don't know gdb is a of popular i guess

that you can't figure out why by just

3462
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:23,680
that you can't figure out why by just
 

3463
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,430
that you can't figure out why by just
looking at the codes they have to find

3464
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
looking at the codes they have to find
 

3465
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,750
looking at the codes they have to find
it that's how i guess normal programmers

3466
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:27,760
it that's how i guess normal programmers
 

3467
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,670
it that's how i guess normal programmers
use it but you're saying there should be

3468
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:29,680
use it but you're saying there should be
 

3469
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,270
use it but you're saying there should be
tools that kind of

3470
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:31,280
tools that kind of
 

3471
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,510
tools that kind of
visualize and help you as part of the

3472
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,520
visualize and help you as part of the
 

3473
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,190
visualize and help you as part of the
programming process

3474
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:35,200
programming process
 

3475
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,750

just the normal programming process to

01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,160
to understand the code deeper yeah when
 

3479
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,349
to understand the code deeper yeah when
i'm working on like my cc plus code i'm

3480
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:43,359
i'm working on like my cc plus code i'm
 

3481
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,270
i'm working on like my cc plus code i'm
always running it from the debugger you

3482
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:45,280
always running it from the debugger you
 

3483
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,829
always running it from the debugger you
know just i type in the code i i run it

3484
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:47,839
know just i type in the code i i run it
 

3485
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,430
know just i type in the code i i run it
many times the first thing i do after

3486
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,440
many times the first thing i do after
 

3487
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,670
many times the first thing i do after
writing code is set a breakpoint and

3488
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:51,680
writing code is set a breakpoint and
 

3489
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,349
writing code is set a breakpoint and
step through the function now other

step through the function now other
 

3491
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:54,870
step through the function now other
people say it's like oh i do that in my

01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:54,880
people say it's like oh i do that in my

01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,630
step through that examine lots of things

analysis tools but i made a point to
 

3597
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,549
analysis tools but i made a point to
really go through and scrub the code

3598
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:40,559
really go through and scrub the code
 

3599
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,190
really go through and scrub the code
base using every tool that i could find

01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,309
hardware errors and then you have other
significant titles that just have

3620
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:02,319
significant titles that just have
 

3621
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,750
significant titles that just have
millions of faults that are getting

3622
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:03,760
millions of faults that are getting
 

3623
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,670
millions of faults that are getting
recorded all the time so i was proud of

3624
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:05,680
recorded all the time so i was proud of
 

3625
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,309
recorded all the time so i was proud of
our code on a lot of levels but when i

3626
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:08,319
our code on a lot of levels but when i
 

3627
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,029
our code on a lot of levels but when i
took this code analysis squeegee through

3628
01:03:11,029 --> 01:03:11,039
took this code analysis squeegee through
 

3629
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,069
took this code analysis squeegee through
everything

3630
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
everything
 

3631
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,270
everything
it was

3632
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:13,280
it was
 

3633
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,910
it was
it was shocking how many errors there

3634
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:15,920
it was shocking how many errors there
 

3635
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,670
it was shocking how many errors there
were in there things that you can say

3636
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:17,680
were in there things that you can say
 

3637
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,910
were in there things that you can say
okay this was this was a copy paste not

3638
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:19,920
okay this was this was a copy paste not
 

3639
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,150
okay this was this was a copy paste not
changing something right here lots of

3640
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:22,160
changing something right here lots of
 

3641
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,990
changing something right here lots of
things that were you know the most the

3642
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,000
things that were you know the most the
 

3643
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,470
things that were you know the most the
most common problem was something in a

3644
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
most common problem was something in a
 

3645
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,470
most common problem was something in a
printf format string that was the wrong

3646
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:28,480
printf format string that was the wrong
 

3647
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,390
printf format string that was the wrong
data type that could cause crashes there

3648
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:30,400
data type that could cause crashes there
 

3649
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,910
data type that could cause crashes there
and you know you really want the

3650
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:31,920
and you know you really want the
 

3651
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,430
and you know you really want the
warnings for things like that then the

3652
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:33,440
warnings for things like that then the
 

3653
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,829
warnings for things like that then the
next most common was missing a check for

3654
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:35,839
next most common was missing a check for
 

3655
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,349
next most common was missing a check for
null that could actually happen that

3656
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:37,359
null that could actually happen that
 

3657
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,029
null that could actually happen that
could blow things up and those are

3658
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,039
could blow things up and those are
 

3659
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,510
could blow things up and those are
obviously like top cc plus things

3660
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,520
obviously like top cc plus things
 

3661
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,670
obviously like top cc plus things
everybody has those problems but the

3662
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:43,680
everybody has those problems but the
 

3663
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,829
everybody has those problems but the
long tail of all of the different little

01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
long tail of all of the different little
 

3665
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,750
long tail of all of the different little
things that could go wrong there and we

3666
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:47,760
things that could go wrong there and we
 

3667
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,069
things that could go wrong there and we
had good programmers and my own codes

3668
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:50,079
had good programmers and my own codes
 

3669
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,510
had good programmers and my own codes
that i'd be looking at it's like oh i

3670
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:51,520
that i'd be looking at it's like oh i
 

3671
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,670
that i'd be looking at it's like oh i
wrote that code that's definitely wrong

3672
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:53,680
wrote that code that's definitely wrong
 

3673
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,710
wrote that code that's definitely wrong
we've been using this for a year and

3674
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:56,720
we've been using this for a year and
 

3675
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,109
we've been using this for a year and
it's this submarine you know this mine

3676
01:03:59,109 --> 01:03:59,119
it's this submarine you know this mine
 

3677

and
 

3681
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,109
and
it was humbling it was uh and i reached

it was humbling it was uh and i reached
 

3683

it was humbling it was uh and i reached
the conclusion that

the conclusion that
 

3685
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,789
the conclusion that
anything that can be syntactically

automated tools and guardrails for
 

3699
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,029
automated tools and guardrails for
things and those start with things like

01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,039
things and those start with things like
 

3701
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,430
things and those start with things like
static types and or even type hints in

am like wow this is great that it just

3716
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:40,319
am like wow this is great that it just
 

3717
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,309
am like wow this is great that it just
happened but yeah that's kind of sketchy

3718
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:42,319
happened but yeah that's kind of sketchy
 

3719
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:43,990
happened but yeah that's kind of sketchy
but it's working fine i don't care it

3720
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,000
but it's working fine i don't care it
 

3721
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,309
but it's working fine i don't care it
does come back to that that value

3722
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:46,319
does come back to that that value

not care

01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,910
not care
but when you do care if it's going to be

01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:51,920
but when you do care if it's going to be
 

3729

but when you do care if it's going to be
something that's going to live for years

something that's going to live for years

something that's going to live for years
and it's going to have other people

and it's going to have other people
 

3733
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,870
and it's going to have other people
working on it i and it's going to be

working on it i and it's going to be
 

3735
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,589
working on it i and it's going to be
deployed to millions of people then you

3736
01:04:59,589 --> 01:04:59,599
deployed to millions of people then you
 

3737
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,430
deployed to millions of people then you
want to use all of these tools you want

3738
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
want to use all of these tools you want
 

3739
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,190
want to use all of these tools you want
to be told it's like no you've screwed

3740
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
to be told it's like no you've screwed
 

3741
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,950
to be told it's like no you've screwed
up here here and here and that does

3742
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:04,960
up here here and here and that does
 

3743
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,109
up here here and here and that does
require kind of an ego check about

3744
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:07,119
require kind of an ego check about
 

3745
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,910
require kind of an ego check about
things where you have to

things where you have to
 

3747
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,589
things where you have to
to be open to the fact that everything

3748
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:11,599
to be open to the fact that everything
 

3749
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,109
to be open to the fact that everything
that you're doing is just littered with

that you're doing is just littered with
 

3751
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,430
that you're doing is just littered with
flaws it's not that oh you occasionally

3752
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:15,440
flaws it's not that oh you occasionally
 

3753
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,990
flaws it's not that oh you occasionally
have a bad day it's just whatever stream

3754
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
have a bad day it's just whatever stream

have a bad day it's just whatever stream
of code you output there is going to be

of code you output there is going to be
 

3757
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,750
of code you output there is going to be
a statistical regularity of things that

a statistical regularity of things that
 

3759
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,069
a statistical regularity of things that
you just make mistakes on

3760
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:24,079
you just make mistakes on
 

3761
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,870
you just make mistakes on
and i'm and i do think there's the whole

3762
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:26,880
and i'm and i do think there's the whole
 

3763
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,109
and i'm and i do think there's the whole
argument about test driven design and

3764
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:29,119
argument about test driven design and
 

3765
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,670
argument about test driven design and
unit testing versus kind of analysis and

3766
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
unit testing versus kind of analysis and
 

3767
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,870
unit testing versus kind of analysis and
different things

3768
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:32,880
different things
 

3769
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,510
different things
i am more in favor of the analysis and

3770
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
i am more in favor of the analysis and
 

3771
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,870
i am more in favor of the analysis and
the stuff that just like you can't run

3772
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:36,880
the stuff that just like you can't run
 

3773
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,950
the stuff that just like you can't run
your program until you fix this rather

3774
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
your program until you fix this rather
 

3775
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,109
your program until you fix this rather
than you can run it and hopefully a unit

3776
01:05:41,109 --> 01:05:41,119
than you can run it and hopefully a unit
 

3777
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,270
than you can run it and hopefully a unit
test will catch it in some way yeah in

3778
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:43,280
test will catch it in some way yeah in
 

3779
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,990
test will catch it in some way yeah in
my private code i have asserts

3780
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,000
my private code i have asserts
 

3781
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,549
my private code i have asserts
everywhere yeah uh it's just there's

3782
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:48,559
everywhere yeah uh it's just there's
 

3783
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,150
everywhere yeah uh it's just there's
something

3784
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:50,160
something
 

3785
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,630
something
pleasant to me pleasurable to me about

3786
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:52,640
pleasant to me pleasurable to me about
 

3787
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,270
pleasant to me pleasurable to me about
sort of the dictatorial rule of like

3788
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:55,280
sort of the dictatorial rule of like
 

3789
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,230
sort of the dictatorial rule of like
this should be true at this point

3790
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:58,240
this should be true at this point
 

3791
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,549
this should be true at this point
in too many times

3792
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:00,559
in too many times
 

3793
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:01,589
in too many times
i've

3794
01:06:01,589 --> 01:06:01,599
i've
 

3795
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,349
i've
made mistakes

3796
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:03,359
made mistakes
 

3797
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,670
made mistakes
that shouldn't have been made

3798
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:05,680
that shouldn't have been made
 

3799
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,750
that shouldn't have been made
and i would assume i would i wouldn't be

3800
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:07,760
and i would assume i would i wouldn't be
 

3801
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,870
and i would assume i would i wouldn't be
the kind of person that would make that

3802
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:08,880
the kind of person that would make that
 

3803
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,470
the kind of person that would make that
mistake but i keep making that mistake

3804
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:10,480
mistake but i keep making that mistake
 

3805
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,430
mistake but i keep making that mistake
therefore and assert really catches me

3806
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
therefore and assert really catches me
 

3807
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,390
therefore and assert really catches me
uh really helps all the time so my co i

3808
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:16,400
uh really helps all the time so my co i
 

3809
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,630
uh really helps all the time so my co i
would say like 10 to 20 of my private

they don't make any difference to the

01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,750

01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,789
world outside your program changes and
in fact that's that's one of the things

01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:42,799
in fact that's that's one of the things

01:06:58,710 --> 01:06:58,720
in the early days you get doom which had
 

3847
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,549
in the early days you get doom which had
some fixed limits on it then everybody

3848
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:00,559
some fixed limits on it then everybody
 

3849
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,150
some fixed limits on it then everybody
started making crazier and crazier

3850
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,160
started making crazier and crazier
 

3851
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,349
started making crazier and crazier
things and they kept bumping up the

3852
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:03,359
things and they kept bumping up the
 

3853
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,109
things and they kept bumping up the
different limits this many lines this

3854
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:05,119
different limits this many lines this
 

3855
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,309
different limits this many lines this
many sectors uh and it seemed like a

3856
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:08,319
many sectors uh and it seemed like a
 

3857
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,829
many sectors uh and it seemed like a
good idea well we should just make this

3858
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
good idea well we should just make this
 

3859
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,910
good idea well we should just make this
completely generic it can go kind of go

01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:11,920
completely generic it can go kind of go

01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,589
completely generic it can go kind of go

up to whatever

up to whatever
and

3864
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:14,799
and
 

3865
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,230
and
there's cases where that's the right

3866
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:16,240
there's cases where that's the right
 

3867
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,270
there's cases where that's the right
thing to do

3868
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:17,280
thing to do
 

3869
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,349
thing to do
but it also the other aspect of the

3870
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:19,359
but it also the other aspect of the
 

3871
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,910
but it also the other aspect of the
world changing around you is it's good

3872
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:21,920
world changing around you is it's good
 

3873
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,670
world changing around you is it's good
to be informed when the world has

01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:23,680
to be informed when the world has
 

3875
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,510
to be informed when the world has
changed more than you thought it would

3876
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:25,520
changed more than you thought it would
 

3877
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,510
changed more than you thought it would
and if you've got a continuously growing

3878
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
and if you've got a continuously growing
 

3879
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,190

out you might have this quadratic

slowdown on something where you thought
oh i'm only ever going to have a handful

3886
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:34,960
oh i'm only ever going to have a handful
 

3887
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,789
oh i'm only ever going to have a handful
of these but something changes and

3888
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:36,799
of these but something changes and
 

3889
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,390
of these but something changes and
there's a new design style and all of a

3890
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:38,400
there's a new design style and all of a
 

3891
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,710
there's a new design style and all of a
sudden you've got 10 000 of them

3892
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:40,720
sudden you've got 10 000 of them
 

3893
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,750
sudden you've got 10 000 of them
so i kind of like in many cases

01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:43,760
so i kind of like in many cases

01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,750
so i kind of like in many cases

written with this kind of world view
with this kind of set of constraints you

01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:06,400
with this kind of set of constraints you
 

3917
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,069
with this kind of set of constraints you
were you were thinking of the world in

this way
if something breaks that means you got

3922
01:08:11,029 --> 01:08:11,039
if something breaks that means you got
 

3923
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,349
if something breaks that means you got
to rethink the initial stuff and that's

01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:13,359
to rethink the initial stuff and that's
 

3925
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:15,910
to rethink the initial stuff and that's
it's nice for it to afford for it to do

it's nice for it to afford for it to do

it's nice for it to afford for it to do
that is there any stuff like uh keyboard

that is there any stuff like uh keyboard

3983
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,669
unix developer mode here and i worked
for

3984

now
screaming as they're listening to this

4006
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:38,560
screaming as they're listening to this
 

4007
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,149
screaming as they're listening to this
so again the out is that this was not

4008
01:09:40,149 --> 01:09:40,159
so again the out is that this was not
 

4009
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:43,669
so again the out is that this was not
modern vim but still i yes i was very

4010
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
modern vim but still i yes i was very
 

4011

exactly as you said i can understand the
 

4025
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,510
exactly as you said i can understand the
code i can navigate the code there's a

4026
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
code i can navigate the code there's a
 

4027
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,189
code i can navigate the code there's a
lot of stuff you could build within

4028
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
lot of stuff you could build within
 

4029
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,070
lot of stuff you could build within
emacs with using lisp you can customize

a lot of things for yourself to help you
 

4033
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,790
a lot of things for yourself to help you
uh introspect the code like to help you

4034
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:10,800
uh introspect the code like to help you
 

4035
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,990
uh introspect the code like to help you
understand the code and visualize

4036
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:12,000
understand the code and visualize
 

4037

understand the code and visualize
different aspects of the call you can

4038
01:10:13,189 --> 01:10:13,199
different aspects of the call you can
 

4039
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,550
different aspects of the call you can
even run debuggers but it's it's work

4040
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:16,560
even run debuggers but it's it's work
 

4041

better and better ideas are constantly
 

4045
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:24,229
better and better ideas are constantly
being built and that that puts a

4046
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:24,239
being built and that that puts a
 

4047
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,270

large chunk of the world is moving
 

4061
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,510
large chunk of the world is moving
towards visual studio code which is kind

4062
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:39,520
towards visual studio code which is kind
 

4063
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,709
towards visual studio code which is kind
of interesting to me against the

want to be infinitely fast you want them
 

4071
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,870
want to be infinitely fast you want them
to just kind of immediately respond

started next uh this computer did just
 

4185
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,870
started next uh this computer did just
seem like one of those amazing things

4186
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
seem like one of those amazing things
 

4187
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,350
seem like one of those amazing things
from the future where it had all of this

4188
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:49,360
from the future where it had all of this
 

4189
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,590
from the future where it had all of this
cool stuff in it and we were still back

4190
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:51,600
cool stuff in it and we were still back
 

4191
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,669
cool stuff in it and we were still back
in those days working on dos everything

4192
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:53,679
in those days working on dos everything
 

4193
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,669
in those days working on dos everything
blew up you had reset buttons because

4194
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:55,679
blew up you had reset buttons because
 

4195
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:56,950
blew up you had reset buttons because
your computer would just freeze if

4196
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:56,960
your computer would just freeze if
 

4197
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,790
your computer would just freeze if
you're doing development work literally

4198
01:12:58,790 --> 01:12:58,800
you're doing development work literally
 

4199
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,390
you're doing development work literally
dozens of times a day your computer was

4200
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
dozens of times a day your computer was
 

4201
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,310
dozens of times a day your computer was
just rebooting constantly

4202
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,320
just rebooting constantly
 

4203
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,270
just rebooting constantly
and so this idea of yes any of the the

4204
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:05,280
and so this idea of yes any of the the
 

4205
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,950
and so this idea of yes any of the the
unix workstations would have given a

4206
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:06,960
unix workstations would have given a
 

4207
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,350
unix workstations would have given a
stable development platform where you

4208
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,360
stable development platform where you
 

4209
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,910
stable development platform where you
don't crash and reboot all the time but

4210
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:11,920
don't crash and reboot all the time but
 

4211
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,310
don't crash and reboot all the time but
next also had this really amazing

4212
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:14,320
next also had this really amazing
 

4213
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,470
next also had this really amazing
graphical interface and it was great for

4214
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:16,480
graphical interface and it was great for
 

4215
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,270
graphical interface and it was great for
building tools and it used uh objective

4216
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280
building tools and it used uh objective
 

4217
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,070
building tools and it used uh objective
c as the kind of an interesting oh wow

4218
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:22,080
c as the kind of an interesting oh wow
 

4219
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,870
c as the kind of an interesting oh wow
dead interesting next was unix-based

4220
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:24,880
dead interesting next was unix-based
 

4221
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,709
dead interesting next was unix-based
it said objective-c so it has a lot of

4222
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:26,719
it said objective-c so it has a lot of
 

4223
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,870
it said objective-c so it has a lot of

the elements that became mac i mean the
 

4225
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,950
the elements that became mac i mean the
kind of reverse acquisition of apple by

kind of reverse acquisition of apple by
 

4227
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,270

5028
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:30,719
like me romero i'm tom hall was kind of
 

5029
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,030
like me romero i'm tom hall was kind of
helping us from from his side of things

5030
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:33,040
helping us from from his side of things
 

5031
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,790
helping us from from his side of things
jay would peek in and we had a few other

5032
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:34,800
jay would peek in and we had a few other
 

5033
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,149
jay would peek in and we had a few other
programmers

5034
01:27:36,149 --> 01:27:36,159
programmers
 

5035
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,390
programmers
uh working with us at the time and we

5036
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:38,400
uh working with us at the time and we
 

5037
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,189
uh working with us at the time and we
were going to to just start making games

5038
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:41,199
were going to to just start making games
 

5039
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,229
were going to to just start making games
just the same model i am and we dived in

5040
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:44,239
just the same model i am and we dived in
 

5041
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:46,470
just the same model i am and we dived in
and it was fantastic you have to make

5042
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:46,480
and it was fantastic you have to make
 

5043
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,669
and it was fantastic you have to make
new games every month every month yeah

5044
01:27:49,669 --> 01:27:49,679
new games every month every month yeah
 

5045
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:52,390
new games every month every month yeah
and this in retrospect looking back at

5046
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:52,400
and this in retrospect looking back at
 

5047
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,149
and this in retrospect looking back at
it that sense that i had done all this

5048
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:54,159
it that sense that i had done all this
 

5049
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:56,149
it that sense that i had done all this
contract programming and john romero had

5050
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:56,159
contract programming and john romero had
 

5051
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,470
contract programming and john romero had
done like far more of this where he had

5052
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:58,480
done like far more of this where he had
 

5053
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,709
done like far more of this where he had
done one of his teaching himself efforts

5054
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:00,719
done one of his teaching himself efforts
 

5055
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,310
done one of his teaching himself efforts
was he made a game for every letter of

5056
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:02,320
was he made a game for every letter of
 

5057
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,149
was he made a game for every letter of
the alphabet it's that sense of like i'm

5058
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:04,159
the alphabet it's that sense of like i'm
 

5059
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,070
the alphabet it's that sense of like i'm
just gonna go make 26 different games

5060
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:06,080
just gonna go make 26 different games
 

5061
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,390
just gonna go make 26 different games
give them a different theme and you

5062
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:08,400
give them a different theme and you
 

5063
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,310
give them a different theme and you
learn so much when you go through and

5064
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
learn so much when you go through and
 

5065
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,870
learn so much when you go through and
you cr crank these things out like on a

5066
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:12,880
you cr crank these things out like on a
 

5067
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,030
you cr crank these things out like on a
bi-weekly monthly basis something starts

5068
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:15,040
bi-weekly monthly basis something starts
 

5069
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,030

5077
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,070
it's done it has to be done there's no
delaying it's done and you've got

5078
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:26,080
delaying it's done and you've got
 

5079
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,350
delaying it's done and you've got
deadlines and that kind of uh rapid

5080
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:29,360
deadlines and that kind of uh rapid
 

5081
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,990
deadlines and that kind of uh rapid

5082
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:32,000
iteration pressure cooker environment
 

5083
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,070
iteration pressure cooker environment
was super important for all of us

5084
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
was super important for all of us
 

5085
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,229
was super important for all of us
developing the skills that i you know

5086
01:28:36,229 --> 01:28:36,239
developing the skills that i you know
 

5087
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,070
developing the skills that i you know
that brought us to where we eventually

5088
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:38,080
that brought us to where we eventually
 

5089
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,750
that brought us to where we eventually
went to i mean people would say like

5090
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:39,760
went to i mean people would say like
 

5091
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,270
went to i mean people would say like
like in the history of the beatles like

5092
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:41,280
like in the history of the beatles like
 

5093
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,270
like in the history of the beatles like
it wasn't them being the beatles it was

5094
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:43,280
it wasn't them being the beatles it was
 

5095
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,110
it wasn't them being the beatles it was
them playing all of these other uh you

5096
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
them playing all of these other uh you
 

5097
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,950
them playing all of these other uh you
know early works that that opportunity

5098
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:46,960
know early works that that opportunity
 

5099
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,709
know early works that that opportunity
to craft all of their skills before they

5100
01:28:48,709 --> 01:28:48,719
to craft all of their skills before they
 

5101
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:51,510
to craft all of their skills before they
were famous that was very critical to

5102
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:51,520
were famous that was very critical to
 

5103
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,590
were famous that was very critical to
their later successes and i think

5104
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:53,600
their later successes and i think
 

5105
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,990
their later successes and i think
there's a lot of that here where we did

5106
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,000
there's a lot of that here where we did
 

5107
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,709
there's a lot of that here where we did
these games that nobody remembers uh

5108
01:28:58,709 --> 01:28:58,719
these games that nobody remembers uh
 

5109
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,870
these games that nobody remembers uh
lots of little things that contributed

5110
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:00,880
lots of little things that contributed
 

5111
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,550
lots of little things that contributed
to building up the skill set for the

i had to write it in a month

5120
01:29:10,709 --> 01:29:10,719
i had to write it in a month
 

5121
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:12,310
i had to write it in a month
just make money

5122
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:12,320
just make money
 

5123
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,470
just make money
and nobody remembers that probably

5124
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:14,480
and nobody remembers that probably
 

5125
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,070
and nobody remembers that probably

he
he didn't have enough time to write it

5132
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:20,400
he didn't have enough time to write it
 

5133
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,550
he didn't have enough time to write it
fast enough so to come up with hacks

5134
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:22,560
fast enough so to come up with hacks
 

5135
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,550
fast enough so to come up with hacks
actually literally but it again comes

limitation of resources
 

5141
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:30,310
limitation of resources
is surprisingly important

01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:30,320
is surprisingly important
 

5143
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,229
is surprisingly important
and it's counter-intuitive in a lot of

5144
01:29:32,229 --> 01:29:32,239
and it's counter-intuitive in a lot of
 

5145
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,510
and it's counter-intuitive in a lot of
ways where you just think that if you've

01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:33,520
ways where you just think that if you've

course you're going to get something
 

5153
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,070
course you're going to get something
better but sometimes it really does work

5154
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:40,080
better but sometimes it really does work

i wouldn't make judgments like that

i wouldn't make judgments like that
about it but it was positioned in such a

01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:54,400
about it but it was positioned in such a
 

5349
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,229
about it but it was positioned in such a
way especially in the school systems

5350
01:32:56,229 --> 01:32:56,239
way especially in the school systems
 

5351
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:59,189
way especially in the school systems
that it impacted a whole lot of american

01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:13,600
the ibm ega cards worked um which was
 

5421
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,430
the ibm ega cards worked um which was
fun for me i hadn't had experience with

01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:15,440
fun for me i hadn't had experience with
 

5423
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,310
fun for me i hadn't had experience with
things at that level and back then you

5424
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:18,320
things at that level and back then you
 

5425
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,070
things at that level and back then you
could get hardware documentation just

5426
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:20,080
could get hardware documentation just
 

5427
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,990

01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,310
down at the register levels this is

where the crtc register is this is how
 

5431
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,310
where the crtc register is this is how
the the color registers work and how the

01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:26,320
the the color registers work and how the
 

5433
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,070
the the color registers work and how the
different things are applied and they

of things that would cause configuration
problems all the hardware was manually

5494
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
problems all the hardware was manually
 

5495
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,070
problems all the hardware was manually
configured in your auto exec so it was a

5496
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:38,080
configured in your auto exec so it was a
 

5497
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,910
configured in your auto exec so it was a
very different world but the code is

5498
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:39,920
very different world but the code is
 

5499
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,750
very different world but the code is
still the same similar you would say you

5500
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:41,760
still the same similar you would say you
 

5501
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,270
still the same similar you would say you
could still write it my earliest code

5502
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:43,280
could still write it my earliest code
 

5503
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,790
could still write it my earliest code
there was written in pascal that was

5504
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,800
there was written in pascal that was
 

5505
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,790
there was written in pascal that was
what i had learned i am kind of an

5506
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:46,800
what i had learned i am kind of an
 

5507
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,669
what i had learned i am kind of an
earlier point so between basic and c

5508
01:35:49,669 --> 01:35:49,679
earlier point so between basic and c
 

5509
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,910
earlier point so between basic and c
plus plus there's pascal so when basic

5510
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:51,920
plus plus there's pascal so when basic
 

5511
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,390
plus plus there's pascal so when basic
assembly language um some of my

5512
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:54,400
assembly language um some of my
 

5513
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,830
assembly language um some of my
yeah my intermediate stuff was well you

5514
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:55,840
yeah my intermediate stuff was well you
 

5515
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,669
yeah my intermediate stuff was well you
had to for performance basic was just

5516
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:57,679
had to for performance basic was just
 

5517
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:00,070
had to for performance basic was just
too slow so most of the work that i was

5518
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:00,080
too slow so most of the work that i was
 

5519
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,830
too slow so most of the work that i was
doing as a contract programmer in my

01:36:04,229 --> 01:36:04,239
teenage years was uh was assembly
 

5523
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,550

01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:33,840
outlier to use uh pascal a little bit
 

5551
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,590

where there was one famous program

5552
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:35,600
where there was one famous program
 

5553
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,510
where there was one famous program
called wizardry it was like one of the

5554
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:37,520
called wizardry it was like one of the
 

5555
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,750
called wizardry it was like one of the
great early role-playing games that was

5556
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:39,760
great early role-playing games that was
 

5557
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,830
great early role-playing games that was
written in pascal but it was almost

5558
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:41,840
written in pascal but it was almost
 

5559
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,830
written in pascal but it was almost
nothing used pascal there but i did

5560
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:43,840
nothing used pascal there but i did
 

5561
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,229
nothing used pascal there but i did
learn pascal and i remember doing all of

5562
01:36:46,229 --> 01:36:46,239
learn pascal and i remember doing all of
 

5563
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,629
learn pascal and i remember doing all of
my like to this day i sketch in data

5564
01:36:48,629 --> 01:36:48,639
my like to this day i sketch in data
 

5565
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,070
my like to this day i sketch in data
structures when i'm thinking about

5566
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:50,080
structures when i'm thinking about
 

5567
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,990
structures when i'm thinking about
something i'll you know i'll i'll open

5568
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:52,000
something i'll you know i'll i'll open
 

5569
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,830
something i'll you know i'll i'll open
up a file and i'll start writing struct

5570
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:53,840
up a file and i'll start writing struct
 

5571
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,990
up a file and i'll start writing struct
definitions for how data is going to be

5572
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:56,000
definitions for how data is going to be
 

5573
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,990
definitions for how data is going to be
laid out and pascal was kind of

5574
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:58,000
laid out and pascal was kind of
 

5575
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,590
laid out and pascal was kind of
formative to that because i remember

5576
01:36:59,590 --> 01:36:59,600
formative to that because i remember
 

5577
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,149
formative to that because i remember
designing my rpgs in pascal record

5578
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:02,159
designing my rpgs in pascal record
 

5579
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,470
designing my rpgs in pascal record
structures and things like that and so i

5580
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:04,480
structures and things like that and so i
 

5581
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,790
structures and things like that and so i
had i've gotten the pascal compiler for

5582
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:06,800
had i've gotten the pascal compiler for
 

5583
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,709
had i've gotten the pascal compiler for
the apple 2gs that i could work on and

5584
01:37:08,709 --> 01:37:08,719
the apple 2gs that i could work on and
 

5585
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:11,350
the apple 2gs that i could work on and
the first ibm game that i developed i

5586
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:11,360
the first ibm game that i developed i
 

5587
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,669
the first ibm game that i developed i
did in pascal and and that's actually

5588
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:13,679
did in pascal and and that's actually
 

5589
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,030
did in pascal and and that's actually
kind of an interesting story again

5590
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:15,040
kind of an interesting story again
 

5591
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,629
kind of an interesting story again
talking about the constraints and

5592
01:37:16,629 --> 01:37:16,639
talking about the constraints and
 

5593
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:19,990
talking about the constraints and
resources where i had an apple 2gs i

5594
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:20,000
resources where i had an apple 2gs i
 

5595
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,310
resources where i had an apple 2gs i
didn't have an ibm pc i wanted to port

5596
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:22,320
didn't have an ibm pc i wanted to port
 

5597
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,109
didn't have an ibm pc i wanted to port
my applications to ibm because i thought

5598
01:37:25,109 --> 01:37:25,119
my applications to ibm because i thought
 

5599
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,750
my applications to ibm because i thought
i could make more money on it so what i

5600
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:27,760
i could make more money on it so what i
 

5601
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,629
i could make more money on it so what i
wound up doing is i rented a pc for a

5602
01:37:30,629 --> 01:37:30,639
wound up doing is i rented a pc for a
 

5603
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:31,510
wound up doing is i rented a pc for a
week

5604
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:31,520
week
 

5605
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,229
week
and bought a copy of turbo pascal and so

5606
01:37:34,229 --> 01:37:34,239
and bought a copy of turbo pascal and so
 

5607
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:36,229
and bought a copy of turbo pascal and so
i had a hard one week and this was

5608
01:37:36,229 --> 01:37:36,239
i had a hard one week and this was
 

5609
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:38,149
i had a hard one week and this was
cutting into what minimal profit margin

5610
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:38,159
cutting into what minimal profit margin
 

5611
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:39,750
cutting into what minimal profit margin
i had there but i had this computer for

5612
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:39,760
i had there but i had this computer for
 

5613
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,149
i had there but i had this computer for
a week i had to get my program ported

5614
01:37:42,149 --> 01:37:42,159
a week i had to get my program ported
 

5615
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:44,390
a week i had to get my program ported
before i had to return the pc

5616
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:44,400
before i had to return the pc
 

5617
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,470
before i had to return the pc
yeah and that was kind of what the first

5618
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:46,480
yeah and that was kind of what the first
 

5619
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,550
yeah and that was kind of what the first
thing that i had done on the ibm pc and

5620
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:48,560
thing that i had done on the ibm pc and
 

5621
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,550
thing that i had done on the ibm pc and
what led me to the taking the job at

5622
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:50,560
what led me to the taking the job at
 

5623
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,270
what led me to the taking the job at
soft disk and turbo pascal

5624
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:53,280
soft disk and turbo pascal
 

5625
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,790
soft disk and turbo pascal
uh how's that different from regular

5626
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:54,800
uh how's that different from regular
 

5627
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,149
uh how's that different from regular
pascal is a different compiler or

5628
01:37:56,149 --> 01:37:56,159
pascal is a different compiler or
 

5629
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:57,510
pascal is a different compiler or
something like that so it was uh it was

5630
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:57,520
something like that so it was uh it was
 

5631
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,350
something like that so it was uh it was
a product of borland which before

5632
01:37:59,350 --> 01:37:59,360
a product of borland which before
 

5633
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,830
a product of borland which before
microsoft kind of killed them they were

5634
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:01,840
microsoft kind of killed them they were
 

5635
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,750
microsoft kind of killed them they were
they were the hot stuff developer tools

5636
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:03,760
they were the hot stuff developer tools
 

5637
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,750
they were the hot stuff developer tools
company yeah borland turbo pascal and

5638
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:05,760
company yeah borland turbo pascal and
 

5639
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,229
company yeah borland turbo pascal and
turbo c and turbo prologue i mean all

5640
01:38:08,229 --> 01:38:08,239
turbo c and turbo prologue i mean all
 

5641
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:10,709
turbo c and turbo prologue i mean all
the different things but what they did

5642
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:10,719
the different things but what they did
 

5643
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,709
the different things but what they did
was they took a supremely pragmatic

5644
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:12,719
was they took a supremely pragmatic
 

5645
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,470
was they took a supremely pragmatic
approach of making something useful it

5646
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:14,480
approach of making something useful it
 

5647
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,550
approach of making something useful it
was one of these great examples where

5648

pascal was an academic language and you

pascal was an academic language and you
 

5651
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,830
pascal was an academic language and you
had things like the ucsdp system that

pascal was it was called turbo because

benefits but so anyways that was the

5808
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:00,880
benefits but so anyways that was the
 

5809
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,950
benefits but so anyways that was the
next thing i had to learn c because c

5810
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:02,960
next thing i had to learn c because c
 

5811
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,510
next thing i had to learn c because c
was where it seemed like most of the

5812
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:05,520
was where it seemed like most of the
 

5813
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,270
was where it seemed like most of the
most of the things were going so i

5814
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:07,280
most of the things were going so i
 

5815
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,109
most of the things were going so i
abandoned pascal and i started working

5816
01:41:09,109 --> 01:41:09,119
abandoned pascal and i started working
 

5817
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:11,109
abandoned pascal and i started working
in c i started hacking on these hardware

5818
01:41:11,109 --> 01:41:11,119
in c i started hacking on these hardware
 

5819
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,189
in c i started hacking on these hardware
things dealing with uh you know the

5820
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:13,199
things dealing with uh you know the
 

5821
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:15,990
things dealing with uh you know the
graphics controllers and the ega systems

5822
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:16,000
graphics controllers and the ega systems
 

5823
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,709
graphics controllers and the ega systems
and what we most wanted to do so at that

5824
01:41:18,709 --> 01:41:18,719
and what we most wanted to do so at that
 

5825
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:20,229
and what we most wanted to do so at that
time we had

time we had
 

5827
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:21,750
time we had
uh we were sitting in our darkened

01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:25,360
console video games we're figuring out
 

5833
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,590
console video games we're figuring out
what do we want to kind of what games do

5834
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:27,600
what do we want to kind of what games do
 

5835
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,270
what do we want to kind of what games do
we want to make for our gamer's edge

5836
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:29,280
we want to make for our gamer's edge
 

5837
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,910
we want to make for our gamer's edge
product there and so we had one of the

5838
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:31,920
product there and so we had one of the
 

5839
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,750
product there and so we had one of the
one of the first super nintendos sitting

5840
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:33,760
one of the first super nintendos sitting
 

5841
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,990
one of the first super nintendos sitting
there and we had a an older nintendo

5842
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:36,000
there and we had a an older nintendo
 

5843
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,990

01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:39,760
thing that those consoles did that you
 

5847
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,229
thing that those consoles did that you
just didn't get on the pc games was this

5848
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:42,239
just didn't get on the pc games was this
 

5849
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:43,910
just didn't get on the pc games was this
ability to have a massive scrolling

world where most of the games that you
 

5853
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:48,629
world where most of the games that you
would make on the pc uh and early

5854
01:41:48,629 --> 01:41:48,639
would make on the pc uh and early
 

5855
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:50,629
would make on the pc uh and early
earlier personal computers would be a

5856
01:41:50,629 --> 01:41:50,639
earlier personal computers would be a
 

5857
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:52,310
earlier personal computers would be a
static screen you move little things

5858
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:52,320
static screen you move little things
 

5859
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,750
static screen you move little things
around on it

5860
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
around on it
 

5861
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,430
around on it
and you interact like that maybe you go

5862
01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:55,440
and you interact like that maybe you go
 

5863
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,430
and you interact like that maybe you go
to additional screens as you know as you

5864
01:41:57,430 --> 01:41:57,440
to additional screens as you know as you
 

5865
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,229

but arcade games and consoles had this

5868
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:00,880
but arcade games and consoles had this
 

5869
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,030
but arcade games and consoles had this
wonderful ability to just have a big

window through and that was for those
 

5875
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,189

exploration adventure games that was a
 

5879
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:13,030
exploration adventure games that was a
super super important thing

super super important thing
 

5881
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,149
super super important thing
and pc games just didn't do that

5882
01:42:16,149 --> 01:42:16,159
and pc games just didn't do that
 

5883
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:18,310
and pc games just didn't do that
and what i had had come across was a

5884
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:18,320
and what i had had come across was a
 

5885
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,310
and what i had had come across was a
couple different techniques for

5886
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
couple different techniques for
 

5887
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,470
couple different techniques for
implementing that on the pc and they're

5888
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:22,480
implementing that on the pc and they're
 

5889
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:23,270
implementing that on the pc and they're
not

5890
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:23,280
not
 

5891
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,750
not
hard complicated things when i explain

5892
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:25,760
hard complicated things when i explain
 

5893
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,430
hard complicated things when i explain
them now they're they're they're pretty

his five papers is pretty
 

5901
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,550
his five papers is pretty
straightforward i understand but it

5902
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:34,560
straightforward i understand but it
 

5903
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,149
straightforward i understand but it
they're nevertheless revolutionary so

5904
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:36,159
they're nevertheless revolutionary so
 

5905
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,709
they're nevertheless revolutionary so
side scrolling is a game changer yeah

5906
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:38,719
side scrolling is a game changer yeah
 

5907
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:41,510
side scrolling is a game changer yeah
it's scrolling genius invention vertical

5908
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:41,520
it's scrolling genius invention vertical
 

5909
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,870
it's scrolling genius invention vertical
and some of the consoles had different

5910
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:42,880
and some of the consoles had different
 

5911
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,550
and some of the consoles had different
limitations about you could do one but

5912
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:44,560
limitations about you could do one but
 

5913
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,390
limitations about you could do one but
not the other and i and there were

5914
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:46,400
not the other and i and there were
 

5915
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,310
not the other and i and there were
similar things going on as advancements

5916
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:48,320
similar things going on as advancements
 

5917
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,830
similar things going on as advancements
even in the console space where you'd

5918
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:49,840
even in the console space where you'd
 

5919
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,870
even in the console space where you'd
have like the original mario game was uh

5920
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:52,880
have like the original mario game was uh
 

5921
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,709
have like the original mario game was uh
like just horizontal scrolling and then

5922
01:42:54,709 --> 01:42:54,719
like just horizontal scrolling and then
 

5923
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,870
like just horizontal scrolling and then
later mario games added vertical aspects

5924
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:56,880
later mario games added vertical aspects
 

5925
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,790
later mario games added vertical aspects
to it and different things that uh that

5926
01:42:58,790 --> 01:42:58,800
to it and different things that uh that
 

5927
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,270
to it and different things that uh that
you were doing to explore you know kind

5928
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:01,280
you were doing to explore you know kind
 

5929
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,189
you were doing to explore you know kind
of expand the capabilities there and so

5930
01:43:03,189 --> 01:43:03,199
of expand the capabilities there and so
 

5931
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:04,870
of expand the capabilities there and so
much of the early game design for

5932
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:04,880
much of the early game design for
 

5933
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,830
much of the early game design for
decades was removing limitations letting

5934
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:07,840
decades was removing limitations letting
 

5935
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,430
decades was removing limitations letting
you do things that you envisioned as a

5936
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:09,440
you do things that you envisioned as a
 

5937
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,950
you do things that you envisioned as a
designer you wanted the player to

5938
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:10,960
designer you wanted the player to
 

5939
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,950
designer you wanted the player to
experience but the hardware just

5940
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:12,960
experience but the hardware just
 

5941
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,950
experience but the hardware just
couldn't really uh or you didn't know

5942
01:43:14,950 --> 01:43:14,960
couldn't really uh or you didn't know
 

5943
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,590
couldn't really uh or you didn't know
how to make it happen it felt impossible

5944
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:17,600
how to make it happen it felt impossible
 

5945
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,669
how to make it happen it felt impossible
you can imagine that you want to create

5946
01:43:19,669 --> 01:43:19,679
you can imagine that you want to create
 

5947
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:22,470
you can imagine that you want to create
a like this big world through which you

5948
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:22,480
a like this big world through which you
 

5949
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,550
a like this big world through which you
can side scroll like through which you

5950
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:24,560
can side scroll like through which you
 

5951
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,990
can side scroll like through which you
can walk

5952
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,000
can walk
 

5953
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,310
can walk
uh and then you ask yourself a question

5954
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:28,320
uh and then you ask yourself a question
 

5955
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,470
uh and then you ask yourself a question
how do i actually build that in a way

5956
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:30,480
how do i actually build that in a way
 

5957
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,830
how do i actually build that in a way
that's uh

5958
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:31,840
that's uh
 

5959
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,470
that's uh
like the latency is low enough

5960
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:34,480
like the latency is low enough
 

5961
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,390
like the latency is low enough
uh the hardware can actually deliver

5962
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:36,400
uh the hardware can actually deliver
 

5963
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,709
uh the hardware can actually deliver
that in such a way that's a compelling

5964
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:38,719
that in such a way that's a compelling
 

5965
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,310
that in such a way that's a compelling
yeah and we knew what we wanted to do

5966
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:40,320
yeah and we knew what we wanted to do
 

5967
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,590
yeah and we knew what we wanted to do
because we were we were playing all of

5968
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:41,600
because we were we were playing all of
 

5969
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,189
because we were we were playing all of
these console games playing all these

5970
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:43,199
these console games playing all these
 

5971
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,510
these console games playing all these
nintendo games and arcade games clearly

5972
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:45,520
nintendo games and arcade games clearly
 

5973
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:46,870
nintendo games and arcade games clearly
there was a whole world of awesome

5974
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:46,880
there was a whole world of awesome
 

5975
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,790
there was a whole world of awesome
things there that we just couldn't do on

5976
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:48,800
things there that we just couldn't do on
 

5977
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,270
things there that we just couldn't do on
the pc at least initially

5978
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:51,280
the pc at least initially
 

5979
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,870
the pc at least initially
because every programmer can tell it's

5980
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:52,880
because every programmer can tell it's
 

5981
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,149
because every programmer can tell it's
like if you want to scroll you can just

5982
01:43:54,149 --> 01:43:54,159
like if you want to scroll you can just
 

5983
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:55,830
like if you want to scroll you can just
redraw the whole screen but then it

5984
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:55,840
redraw the whole screen but then it
 

5985
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,510
redraw the whole screen but then it
turns out well you're going five frames

5986
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:57,520
turns out well you're going five frames
 

5987
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,990
turns out well you're going five frames
per second i that's not an interactive

5988
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:00,000
per second i that's not an interactive
 

5989
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,390
per second i that's not an interactive
fun experience you want to be going 30

5990
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:02,400
fun experience you want to be going 30
 

5991
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,870
fun experience you want to be going 30
or 60 frames per second or something and

5992
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:04,880
or 60 frames per second or something and
 

5993
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,390
or 60 frames per second or something and
it just didn't feel like that was

5994
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:06,400
it just didn't feel like that was
 

5995
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,709
it just didn't feel like that was
possible it felt like the pcs had to get

5996
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:08,719
possible it felt like the pcs had to get
 

5997
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:10,709
possible it felt like the pcs had to get
five times faster for you to make a

5998
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:10,719
five times faster for you to make a
 

5999
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:12,629
five times faster for you to make a
playable game there

6000
01:44:12,629 --> 01:44:12,639
playable game there
 

6001
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:13,350
playable game there
and

6002
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:13,360
and
 

6003
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,109
and
interestingly i wound up with two

6004
01:44:15,109 --> 01:44:15,119
interestingly i wound up with two
 

6005
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:17,270
interestingly i wound up with two
completely different solutions for the

6006
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:17,280
completely different solutions for the
 

6007
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:21,109
completely different solutions for the
scrolling problem and this is i'm

6008
01:44:21,109 --> 01:44:21,119
scrolling problem and this is i'm
 

6009
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:22,390
scrolling problem and this is i'm
this is a theme that runs through

6010
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:22,400
this is a theme that runs through
 

6011
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,990
this is a theme that runs through
everything where all of these big

6012
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:24,000
everything where all of these big
 

6013
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,669
everything where all of these big
technical advancements it turns out

6014
01:44:25,669 --> 01:44:25,679
technical advancements it turns out
 

6015
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:27,189
technical advancements it turns out
there's always a couple different ways

6016
01:44:27,189 --> 01:44:27,199
there's always a couple different ways
 

6017
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:29,590
there's always a couple different ways
of doing them and it's not like you

6018
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:29,600
of doing them and it's not like you
 

6019
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,990
of doing them and it's not like you
found the one true way of doing it and

6020
01:44:31,990 --> 01:44:32,000
found the one true way of doing it and
 

6021
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,910
found the one true way of doing it and
we'll see this as we go into 3d games

6022
01:44:33,910 --> 01:44:33,920
we'll see this as we go into 3d games
 

6023
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,709
we'll see this as we go into 3d games
and things later but so the scrolling

6024
01:44:36,709 --> 01:44:36,719
and things later but so the scrolling
 

6025
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,790
and things later but so the scrolling
the first set of scrolling tricks that i

6026
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:38,800
the first set of scrolling tricks that i
 

6027
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,470
the first set of scrolling tricks that i
got was

6028
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:40,480
got was
 

6029
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,790
got was
there was the hardware had this ability

6030
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:42,800
there was the hardware had this ability
 

6031
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,510
there was the hardware had this ability
to uh you could shift like inside the

6032
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:45,520
to uh you could shift like inside the
 

6033
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,629
to uh you could shift like inside the
window of memory i am so the ega cards

6034
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:48,639
window of memory i am so the ega cards
 

6035
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,910
window of memory i am so the ega cards
at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory

6036
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:51,920
at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory
 

6037
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,229
at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory
and it was awkwardly set up in this

6038
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:54,239
and it was awkwardly set up in this
 

6039
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:57,350
and it was awkwardly set up in this
planar format where uh instead of having

6040
01:44:57,350 --> 01:44:57,360
planar format where uh instead of having
 

6041
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,790
planar format where uh instead of having
256 or you know 24 million colors you

6042
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:00,800
256 or you know 24 million colors you
 

6043
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,590
256 or you know 24 million colors you
had 16 colors which is four bits so you

6044
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:03,600
had 16 colors which is four bits so you
 

6045
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,470
had 16 colors which is four bits so you
had four bit planes 64k apiece of course

6046
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:06,480
had four bit planes 64k apiece of course
 

6047
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:09,350
had four bit planes 64k apiece of course
64k is a nice round number for 16-bit

6048
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:09,360
64k is a nice round number for 16-bit
 

6049
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,070
64k is a nice round number for 16-bit
addressing so your graphics card had a

6050
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,080
addressing so your graphics card had a
 

6051
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,270
addressing so your graphics card had a
16-bit window that you could look at and

6052
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:15,280
16-bit window that you could look at and
 

6053
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,270
16-bit window that you could look at and
you could tell it to start the video

6054
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:17,280
you could tell it to start the video
 

6055
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,590
you could tell it to start the video
scan out anywhere inside there so there

6056
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:19,600
scan out anywhere inside there so there
 

6057
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,669
scan out anywhere inside there so there
were a couple games that had taken this

6058
01:45:21,669 --> 01:45:21,679
were a couple games that had taken this
 

6059
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:23,430
were a couple games that had taken this
approach if you could make a two by two

6060
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:23,440
approach if you could make a two by two
 

6061
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,910
approach if you could make a two by two
screen or a one by four screen and you

6062
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:25,920
screen or a one by four screen and you
 

6063
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,750
screen or a one by four screen and you
could do scrolling really easily like

6064
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:27,760
could do scrolling really easily like
 

6065
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,910
could do scrolling really easily like
that you could just lay it all out and

6066
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:29,920
that you could just lay it all out and
 

6067
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,270
that you could just lay it all out and
just pan around there but you just

6068
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:31,280
just pan around there but you just
 

6069
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,790
just pan around there but you just
couldn't make it any bigger because

6070
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:32,800
couldn't make it any bigger because
 

6071
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,950
couldn't make it any bigger because
that's all the memory that was there

6072
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:34,960
that's all the memory that was there
 

6073
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,030
that's all the memory that was there
uh the first insight to the scrolling

6074
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:37,040
uh the first insight to the scrolling
 

6075
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,149
uh the first insight to the scrolling
that i had was well if we make a screen

6076
01:45:40,149 --> 01:45:40,159
that i had was well if we make a screen
 

6077
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:42,229
that i had was well if we make a screen
that's just one tile larger you know in

6078
01:45:42,229 --> 01:45:42,239
that's just one tile larger you know in
 

6079
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,149
that's just one tile larger you know in
the we usually had tiles that were 16

6080
01:45:44,149 --> 01:45:44,159
the we usually had tiles that were 16
 

6081
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:46,629
the we usually had tiles that were 16
pixels by 16 pixels the little classic

mario block that you run into

6084
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:48,880
mario block that you run into
 

6085
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:51,109
mario block that you run into
lots of art gets drawn that way and your

6086
01:45:51,109 --> 01:45:51,119
lots of art gets drawn that way and your
 

6087
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:52,870
lots of art gets drawn that way and your
screen is a certain number of tiles but

6088
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:52,880
screen is a certain number of tiles but
 

6089
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,350
screen is a certain number of tiles but
if you had one little buffer region uh

6090
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:55,360
if you had one little buffer region uh
 

6091
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,669
if you had one little buffer region uh
outside of that you could easily pan

6092
01:45:57,669 --> 01:45:57,679
outside of that you could easily pan
 

6093
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,990
outside of that you could easily pan
around inside that 16 pixel region that

6094
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,000
around inside that 16 pixel region that
 

6095
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,310
around inside that 16 pixel region that
could be perfectly smooth but then what

6096
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:02,320
could be perfectly smooth but then what
 

6097
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,149
could be perfectly smooth but then what
happens if you get to the edge and you

6098
01:46:04,149 --> 01:46:04,159
happens if you get to the edge and you
 

6099
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:05,830
happens if you get to the edge and you
want to keep going

6100
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:05,840
want to keep going
 

6101
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,470
want to keep going
the first way we did scrolling was what

6102
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:08,480
the first way we did scrolling was what
 

6103
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,030
the first way we did scrolling was what
i called adaptive tile refresh which was

6104
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:11,040
i called adaptive tile refresh which was
 

6105
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,109
i called adaptive tile refresh which was
really just a matter of you get to the

6106
01:46:13,109 --> 01:46:13,119
really just a matter of you get to the
 

6107
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:15,189
really just a matter of you get to the
edge and then you go back to the

6108
01:46:15,189 --> 01:46:15,199
edge and then you go back to the
 

6109
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:17,430
edge and then you go back to the
original point and then only change the

6110
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:17,440
original point and then only change the
 

6111
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,590
original point and then only change the
tiles that have actually that are

6112
01:46:19,590 --> 01:46:19,600
tiles that have actually that are
 

6113
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,990
tiles that have actually that are
different between where it was in most

6114
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:22,000
different between where it was in most
 

6115
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,590
different between where it was in most
of the games at the time if you think

6116
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:23,600
of the games at the time if you think
 

6117
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,910
of the games at the time if you think
about sort of your classic super mario

6118
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:25,920
about sort of your classic super mario
 

6119
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,229
about sort of your classic super mario
brothers game you've got big fields of

6120
01:46:28,229 --> 01:46:28,239
brothers game you've got big fields of
 

6121
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:31,750
brothers game you've got big fields of
blue sky uh long rows of the same brick

6122
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:31,760
blue sky uh long rows of the same brick
 

6123
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,270
blue sky uh long rows of the same brick
texture

6124
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:33,280
texture
 

6125
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,030
texture
and there's a lot of commonality it's

6126
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:35,040
and there's a lot of commonality it's
 

6127
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,629
and there's a lot of commonality it's
kind of like a data compression thing if

6128
01:46:36,629 --> 01:46:36,639
kind of like a data compression thing if
 

6129
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,870
kind of like a data compression thing if
you take the screen and you set it down

6130
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:38,880
you take the screen and you set it down
 

6131
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,189
you take the screen and you set it down
on top of each other in general only

6132
01:46:41,189 --> 01:46:41,199
on top of each other in general only
 

6133
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:43,430
on top of each other in general only
about 10 percent of the tiles were

6134
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:43,440
about 10 percent of the tiles were
 

6135
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,750
about 10 percent of the tiles were
actually different there so this was a

6136
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:45,760
actually different there so this was a
 

6137
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,189
actually different there so this was a
way to

6138
01:46:47,189 --> 01:46:47,199
way to
 

6139
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:48,629
way to
go ahead and say well i'm going to move

6140
01:46:48,629 --> 01:46:48,639
go ahead and say well i'm going to move
 

6141
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:50,149
go ahead and say well i'm going to move
it back and then i'm only going to

6142
01:46:50,149 --> 01:46:50,159
it back and then i'm only going to
 

6143
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:52,870
it back and then i'm only going to
change those 10 20 uh whatever percent

6144
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:52,880
change those 10 20 uh whatever percent
 

6145
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,830
change those 10 20 uh whatever percent
tiles there and that meant that it was

6146
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:55,840
tiles there and that meant that it was
 

6147
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,669
tiles there and that meant that it was
essentially five times faster than if

6148
01:46:57,669 --> 01:46:57,679
essentially five times faster than if
 

6149
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,910
essentially five times faster than if
you were redrawing all of the tiles and

6150
01:46:59,910 --> 01:46:59,920
you were redrawing all of the tiles and
 

6151
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:01,669
you were redrawing all of the tiles and
that worked well enough for us to do a

6152
01:47:01,669 --> 01:47:01,679
that worked well enough for us to do a
 

6153
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,070
that worked well enough for us to do a
bunch of these games for i am for

6154
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:04,080
bunch of these games for i am for
 

6155
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,430
bunch of these games for i am for
gamer's edge we had a lot of these

6156
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:05,440
gamer's edge we had a lot of these
 

6157
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,430
gamer's edge we had a lot of these
scrolling games like slordax and shadow

6158
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:07,440
scrolling games like slordax and shadow
 

6159
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,390
scrolling games like slordax and shadow
knights and

6160
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:08,400
knights and
 

6161
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,149
knights and
things like that that we were cranking

6162
01:47:10,149 --> 01:47:10,159
things like that that we were cranking
 

6163
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:11,669
things like that that we were cranking
out at this high rate that had this

6164
01:47:11,669 --> 01:47:11,679
out at this high rate that had this
 

6165
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:13,510
out at this high rate that had this
scrolling effect on it

6166
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:13,520
scrolling effect on it
 

6167
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:14,790
scrolling effect on it
and it worked well enough there were

6168
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:14,800
and it worked well enough there were
 

6169
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,030
and it worked well enough there were
design challenges there where if you

6170
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:17,040
design challenges there where if you
 

6171
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,390
design challenges there where if you
made the worst case if you made a

6172
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:18,400
made the worst case if you made a
 

6173
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,550
made the worst case if you made a
checkerboard over the entire screen you

6174
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:20,560
checkerboard over the entire screen you
 

6175
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,629
checkerboard over the entire screen you
scroll over one and every single tile

6176
01:47:22,629 --> 01:47:22,639
scroll over one and every single tile
 

6177
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:24,229
scroll over one and every single tile
changes and your frame rate's now five

6178
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:24,239
changes and your frame rate's now five
 

6179
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:25,669
changes and your frame rate's now five
frames per second because it had to

6180
01:47:25,669 --> 01:47:25,679
frames per second because it had to
 

6181
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:28,149
frames per second because it had to
redraw everything so the designers had a

6182
01:47:28,149 --> 01:47:28,159
redraw everything so the designers had a
 

6183
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:29,669
redraw everything so the designers had a
little bit that they had to worry about

6184
01:47:29,669 --> 01:47:29,679
little bit that they had to worry about
 

6185
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:31,590
little bit that they had to worry about
they had to make these relatively plain

6186
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:31,600
they had to make these relatively plain
 

6187
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,229
they had to make these relatively plain
looking levels but it was still pretty

6188
01:47:34,229 --> 01:47:34,239
looking levels but it was still pretty
 

6189
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:35,910
looking levels but it was still pretty
magical it was something that we hadn't

6190
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:35,920
magical it was something that we hadn't
 

6191
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,430
magical it was something that we hadn't
seen before

6192
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:37,440
seen before
 

6193
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,629
seen before
and

6194
01:47:38,629 --> 01:47:38,639
and
 

6195
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:40,390
and
uh the first thing that we wound up

6196
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:40,400
uh the first thing that we wound up
 

6197
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,709
uh the first thing that we wound up
doing with that was i had just gotten

6198
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:42,719
doing with that was i had just gotten
 

6199
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:45,350
doing with that was i had just gotten
this working and tom hall was sitting

6200
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:45,360
this working and tom hall was sitting
 

6201
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,750
this working and tom hall was sitting
there with me and we were looking over

6202
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:47,760
there with me and we were looking over
 

6203
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,990
there with me and we were looking over
at our super nintendo on the side there

6204
01:47:49,990 --> 01:47:50,000
at our super nintendo on the side there
 

6205
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,510
at our super nintendo on the side there
with super mario 3 running and we had

6206
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:53,520
with super mario 3 running and we had
 

6207
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,669
with super mario 3 running and we had
the technology we had the tools set up

6208
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:55,679
the technology we had the tools set up
 

6209
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:58,229
the technology we had the tools set up
there and we stayed up all night and we

6210
01:47:58,229 --> 01:47:58,239
there and we stayed up all night and we
 

6211
01:47:58,239 --> 01:47:59,830
there and we stayed up all night and we
basically cloned the first level of

6212
01:47:59,830 --> 01:47:59,840
basically cloned the first level of
 

6213
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,070
basically cloned the first level of
super mario brothers performance wise as

6214
01:48:02,070 --> 01:48:02,080
super mario brothers performance wise as
 

6215
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:04,070
super mario brothers performance wise as
well yeah and so it and we had our

6216
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,080
well yeah and so it and we had our
 

6217
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,510
well yeah and so it and we had our
little character running and jumping in

6218
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:05,520
little character running and jumping in
 

6219
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,109
little character running and jumping in
there it was you know it wasn't

6220
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:07,119
there it was you know it wasn't
 

6221
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,950
there it was you know it wasn't
uh it was close to pixel accurate as far

6222
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:08,960
uh it was close to pixel accurate as far
 

6223
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,709
uh it was close to pixel accurate as far
as all the uh the backgrounds and

6224
01:48:10,709 --> 01:48:10,719
as all the uh the backgrounds and
 

6225
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:12,390
as all the uh the backgrounds and
everything but the gaming was just stuff

6226
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:12,400
everything but the gaming was just stuff
 

6227
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,390
everything but the gaming was just stuff
that we cobbled together from previous

6228
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,400
that we cobbled together from previous
 

6229
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,750
that we cobbled together from previous
games that i had written i just kind of

6230
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:15,760
games that i had written i just kind of
 

6231
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,510
games that i had written i just kind of
like really kit-bashed the whole thing

6232
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:17,520
like really kit-bashed the whole thing
 

6233
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,430
like really kit-bashed the whole thing
together to make this demo

6234
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:19,440
together to make this demo
 

6235
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,510
together to make this demo
and that was one of the rare cases when

6236
01:48:21,510 --> 01:48:21,520
and that was one of the rare cases when
 

6237
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,189
and that was one of the rare cases when
i said i i don't usually do these

6238
01:48:23,189 --> 01:48:23,199
i said i i don't usually do these
 

6239
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:24,950
i said i i don't usually do these
all-night programming things there's

6240
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:24,960
all-night programming things there's
 

6241
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,109
all-night programming things there's
probably only two memorable ones that i

6242
01:48:27,109 --> 01:48:27,119
probably only two memorable ones that i
 

6243
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:29,430
probably only two memorable ones that i
can think about you know one was the

6244
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:29,440
can think about you know one was the
 

6245
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:31,669
can think about you know one was the
all-nighter to go ahead and get i am to

6246
01:48:31,669 --> 01:48:31,679
all-nighter to go ahead and get i am to
 

6247
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:33,830
all-nighter to go ahead and get i am to
get our dangerous dave and copyright

6248
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:33,840
get our dangerous dave and copyright
 

6249
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,590
get our dangerous dave and copyright
infringement is how we titled it because

6250
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:35,600
infringement is how we titled it because
 

6251
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,189
infringement is how we titled it because
we had a game called dangerous dave was

6252
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:37,199
we had a game called dangerous dave was
 

6253
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:38,709
we had a game called dangerous dave was
you know running around with the shotgun

6254
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:38,719
you know running around with the shotgun
 

6255
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:41,030
you know running around with the shotgun
shooting things uh and we were just

6256
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:41,040
shooting things uh and we were just
 

6257
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:42,950
shooting things uh and we were just
taking our most beloved game at the time

6258
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:42,960
taking our most beloved game at the time
 

6259
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,270
taking our most beloved game at the time
there the super mario 3 and sort of

6260
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:45,280
there the super mario 3 and sort of
 

6261
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,510
there the super mario 3 and sort of
sticking dave inside that with this new

6262
01:48:47,510 --> 01:48:47,520
sticking dave inside that with this new
 

6263
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,510
sticking dave inside that with this new
scrolling technology that was going

6264
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:49,520
scrolling technology that was going
 

6265
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,510
scrolling technology that was going
perfectly smooth for

6266
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,520
perfectly smooth for
 

6267
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,430
perfectly smooth for
i am you know for them

i am you know for them
 

6269
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,910
i am you know for them
as it ran and tom and i just kind of

6270
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:55,920
as it ran and tom and i just kind of
 

6271
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,750
as it ran and tom and i just kind of
literally the next morning you know kind

01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:57,760
literally the next morning you know kind
 

6273
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,550
literally the next morning you know kind
of left and we left a disc on i you know

6274
01:49:00,550 --> 01:49:00,560

brainstorm about this where shareware
 

6377
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,310
brainstorm about this where shareware
was this idea that software doesn't have

was this idea that software doesn't have
 

6379
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,709
was this idea that software doesn't have
a fixed price if you use it you send out

6380
01:50:48,709 --> 01:50:48,719
a fixed price if you use it you send out

6391
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:00,950
it didn't really work you know there
wasn't much software in a pure shareware

6392

something call it shareware split it
 

6399
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:10,709
something call it shareware split it
into three pieces you always made a

6400
01:51:10,709 --> 01:51:10,719
into three pieces you always made a
 

6401
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:12,149
into three pieces you always made a
trilogy

6402
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:12,159
trilogy
 

6403
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:14,229
trilogy
and you would put the first piece out

6404
01:51:14,229 --> 01:51:14,239
and you would put the first piece out
 

6405
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:16,790
and you would put the first piece out
but then you buy the whole trilogy for

6406
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:16,800
but then you buy the whole trilogy for
 

6407
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,270
but then you buy the whole trilogy for
some shareware amount which in reality

6408
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:19,280
some shareware amount which in reality
 

6409
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,189
some shareware amount which in reality
it meant that the first part was a demo

6410
01:51:21,189 --> 01:51:21,199
it meant that the first part was a demo
 

6411

it meant that the first part was a demo
where you kind of like the demo went

6412
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:23,040
where you kind of like the demo went
 

6413
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,870
where you kind of like the demo went
everywhere for free and you paid money

6414

6417
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,189
to to get the whole set but it was still
played as shareware and we were happy to

6418
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:29,199
played as shareware and we were happy to
 

6419
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:31,189
played as shareware and we were happy to
have the first one go everywhere and it

wasn't a crippled demo where the first
 

6423
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,270

real complete game and probably 20 times
 

6427
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,750

01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,950
and this eventually did lead to some
legal problems and we had we had trouble

6588
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:30,960
legal problems and we had we had trouble
 

6589
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,189
legal problems and we had we had trouble
it all got worked out in the end but it

6590
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:33,199
it all got worked out in the end but it
 

6591
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:35,669
it all got worked out in the end but it
was not a good call at the time there

6592
01:54:35,669 --> 01:54:35,679
was not a good call at the time there
 

6593
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:38,149
was not a good call at the time there
and your legal mind at the time was not

6594
01:54:38,149 --> 01:54:38,159
and your legal mind at the time was not
 

6595
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:39,270
and your legal mind at the time was not
stellar

6596
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:39,280
stellar
 

6597
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,669
stellar
you you were not thinking uh in terms of

6598
01:54:41,669 --> 01:54:41,679
you you were not thinking uh in terms of
 

6599
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:44,149
you you were not thinking uh in terms of
in legal no i i definitely wasn't none

6600
01:54:44,149 --> 01:54:44,159
in legal no i i definitely wasn't none
 

6601

of us were uh

6602
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:46,000
of us were uh
 

6603
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,750
of us were uh
and in hindsight yeah it's like how did

6604
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:47,760
and in hindsight yeah it's like how did
 

6605
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,030
and in hindsight yeah it's like how did
we think we were gonna get away with

6606
01:54:49,030 --> 01:54:49,040
we think we were gonna get away with
 

6607
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,189
we think we were gonna get away with
like even using our work computers to

so the design process we would start

6618
01:55:03,669 --> 01:55:03,679
so the design process we would start
 

6619
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:05,430
so the design process we would start
from we had some idea of what we wanted

from we had some idea of what we wanted

it was going to be a side scroller i was
 

6625
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:12,470
it was going to be a side scroller i was
going to use the technology we we had

6626
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:12,480
going to use the technology we we had
 

6627
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,910
going to use the technology we we had
some sense of what it would have to look

6628
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:13,920
some sense of what it would have to look
 

6629
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,589
some sense of what it would have to look
like because of the limitations of this

adaptive tile refresh technology it had
 

6633
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,550
adaptive tile refresh technology it had
to have fields of relatively constant

to have fields of relatively constant
 

6635
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,550
to have fields of relatively constant
tiles you couldn't just paint up a

tiles you couldn't just paint up a
 

6637
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,270

all this that the background that we lay

6684
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:12,000
all this that the background that we lay
 

6685
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,709
all this that the background that we lay
the game inside of and there's not a

6686
01:56:14,709 --> 01:56:14,719
the game inside of and there's not a
 

6687
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:16,470
the game inside of and there's not a
whole lot to any of these things you

6688
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:16,480
whole lot to any of these things you
 

6689
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,550
whole lot to any of these things you
know design for us was always just what

6690
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:18,560
know design for us was always just what
 

6691
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,629
know design for us was always just what
we needed to do to make the game that

6692
01:56:20,629 --> 01:56:20,639
we needed to do to make the game that
 

6693
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:22,950
we needed to do to make the game that
was going to be so much fun to play

6694
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:22,960
was going to be so much fun to play
 

6695
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,189
was going to be so much fun to play
and we made our we laid out our first

6696
01:56:25,189 --> 01:56:25,199
and we made our we laid out our first
 

6697
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:27,189
and we made our we laid out our first
trilogy of games you know the shareware

6698
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:27,199
trilogy of games you know the shareware
 

6699
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:29,430
trilogy of games you know the shareware
formula is going to be three pieces we

6700
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:29,440
formula is going to be three pieces we
 

6701
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:32,070
formula is going to be three pieces we
make entertain one two and three and we

6702
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:32,080
make entertain one two and three and we
 

6703
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,910
make entertain one two and three and we
just really started

6704
01:56:33,910 --> 01:56:33,920
just really started
 

6705
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,310
just really started
uh busting on all that work and it went

6706
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:36,320
uh busting on all that work and it went
 

6707
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:37,990
uh busting on all that work and it went
together really quickly it was like

6708
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:38,000
together really quickly it was like
 

6709
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,149
together really quickly it was like
three months or something that while we

6710
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:40,159
three months or something that while we
 

6711
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:42,470
three months or something that while we
were still making games every month for

6712
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:42,480
were still making games every month for
 

6713
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,229
were still making games every month for
uh for gamer's edge we were sharing

6714
01:56:44,229 --> 01:56:44,239
uh for gamer's edge we were sharing
 

6715
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:45,669
uh for gamer's edge we were sharing
technology between that i'd write a

6716
01:56:45,669 --> 01:56:45,679
technology between that i'd write a
 

6717
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:47,109
technology between that i'd write a
bunch of code for this and we'd just

6718
01:56:47,109 --> 01:56:47,119
bunch of code for this and we'd just
 

6719
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:48,870
bunch of code for this and we'd just
kind of use it for both

6720
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:48,880
kind of use it for both
 

6721
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,709
kind of use it for both
again not a particularly good idea there

6722
01:56:50,709 --> 01:56:50,719
again not a particularly good idea there
 

6723
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:53,830
again not a particularly good idea there
that had consequences for us but

6724
01:56:53,830 --> 01:56:53,840
that had consequences for us but
 

6725
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,070
that had consequences for us but
in three months we got our first our

6726
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:56,080
in three months we got our first our
 

6727
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,550
in three months we got our first our
first game out and all of a sudden it

6728
01:56:58,550 --> 01:56:58,560
first game out and all of a sudden it
 

6729
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,709
first game out and all of a sudden it
was three times as successful as the

6730
01:57:00,709 --> 01:57:00,719
was three times as successful as the
 

6731
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:02,470
was three times as successful as the
most successful thing apogee had had

6732
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:02,480
most successful thing apogee had had
 

6733
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:04,149
most successful thing apogee had had
before and we were making like thirty

6734
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:04,159
before and we were making like thirty
 

6735
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:06,229
before and we were making like thirty
thousand dollars a month

6736
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:06,239
thousand dollars a month
 

6737
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:07,990
thousand dollars a month
immediately from the commander keen

6738
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:08,000
immediately from the commander keen
 

6739
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,030
immediately from the commander keen
stuff

6740
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:09,040
stuff
 

6741
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,669
stuff
and that was again a surprise to us it

6742
01:57:11,669 --> 01:57:11,679
and that was again a surprise to us it
 

6743
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:13,430
and that was again a surprise to us it
was more than we thought that was gonna

6744
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:13,440
was more than we thought that was gonna
 

6745
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,990
was more than we thought that was gonna
uh that that was gonna make and we said

6746
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:16,000
uh that that was gonna make and we said
 

6747
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,750
uh that that was gonna make and we said
well we're gonna certainly roll into

6748
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:17,760
well we're gonna certainly roll into
 

6749
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,310
well we're gonna certainly roll into
another set of titles from this and in

6750
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:20,320
another set of titles from this and in
 

6751
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,149
another set of titles from this and in
that three months i had come up with a

6752
01:57:22,149 --> 01:57:22,159
that three months i had come up with a
 

6753
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:24,070
that three months i had come up with a
much better way of doing the scrolling

6754
01:57:24,070 --> 01:57:24,080
much better way of doing the scrolling
 

6755
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:25,830
much better way of doing the scrolling
technology that was not the adaptive

6756
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:25,840
technology that was not the adaptive
 

6757
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,550
technology that was not the adaptive
tile refresh which in some ways was even

6758
01:57:28,550 --> 01:57:28,560
tile refresh which in some ways was even
 

6759
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,870
tile refresh which in some ways was even
simpler and these things

6760
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:30,880
simpler and these things
 

6761
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,350
simpler and these things
so many of the great ideas of technology

6762
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:33,360
so many of the great ideas of technology
 

6763
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,669
so many of the great ideas of technology
are things that are back of the envelope

6764
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
are things that are back of the envelope
 

6765
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:37,510
are things that are back of the envelope

simple little things they're not
super dense hard to understand

6778
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:50,000
super dense hard to understand
 

6779
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,550
super dense hard to understand
technologies and so the the second

6780
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
technologies and so the the second
 

6781
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,709

scrolling trick was just a matter of

6782
01:57:54,709 --> 01:57:54,719
scrolling trick was just a matter of
 

6783
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:57,510
scrolling trick was just a matter of
like okay we know we've got this 64k

6784
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:57,520
like okay we know we've got this 64k
 

6785
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,910
like okay we know we've got this 64k
window and the question was always like

6786
01:57:59,910 --> 01:57:59,920
window and the question was always like
 

6787
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:02,550
window and the question was always like
well you could make a two by two but you

6788
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:02,560
well you could make a two by two but you
 

6789
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:03,750
well you could make a two by two but you
can't go

6790
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:03,760
can't go
 

6791
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:06,550
can't go
off the edge uh but i finally asked well

6792
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:06,560
off the edge uh but i finally asked well
 

6793
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,709
off the edge uh but i finally asked well
what actually happens if you just go off

6794
01:58:08,709 --> 01:58:08,719
what actually happens if you just go off
 

6795
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:11,589
what actually happens if you just go off
the edge if you take your start and you

6796
01:58:11,589 --> 01:58:11,599
the edge if you take your start and you
 

6797
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:13,830
the edge if you take your start and you
say it's like okay i can move over i'm

6798
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:13,840
say it's like okay i can move over i'm
 

6799
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,430
say it's like okay i can move over i'm
scrolling i can move over i can move

6800
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:15,440
scrolling i can move over i can move
 

6801
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,669
scrolling i can move over i can move
down i'm scrolling i get to what should

6802
01:58:17,669 --> 01:58:17,679
down i'm scrolling i get to what should
 

6803
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:19,669
down i'm scrolling i get to what should
be the bottom of the memory window it's

6804
01:58:19,669 --> 01:58:19,679
be the bottom of the memory window it's
 

6805
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:21,589
be the bottom of the memory window it's
like well what if i just keep going and

6806
01:58:21,589 --> 01:58:21,599
like well what if i just keep going and
 

6807
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:23,830
like well what if i just keep going and
i say i'm going to start at i you know

6808
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:23,840
i say i'm going to start at i you know
 

6809
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,550
i say i'm going to start at i you know
what happens if i start at fffe at the

6810
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:26,560
what happens if i start at fffe at the
 

6811
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,510
what happens if i start at fffe at the
very end of the the 64k block and it

6812
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:29,520
very end of the the 64k block and it
 

6813
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,550
very end of the the 64k block and it
turns out

6814
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:30,560
turns out
 

6815
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,390
turns out
it just wraps back around to the top of

6816
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:32,400
it just wraps back around to the top of
 

6817
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,470
it just wraps back around to the top of
the block and i'm like oh well this

6818
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:34,480
the block and i'm like oh well this
 

6819
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,229
the block and i'm like oh well this
makes everything easy you can just

6820
01:58:36,229 --> 01:58:36,239
makes everything easy you can just
 

6821
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:37,830
makes everything easy you can just
scroll the screen everywhere and all you

6822
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:37,840
scroll the screen everywhere and all you
 

6823
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,589
scroll the screen everywhere and all you
have to draw is just one new line of

6824
01:58:39,589 --> 01:58:39,599
have to draw is just one new line of
 

6825
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:42,229
have to draw is just one new line of
tiles which everything you expose it

6826
01:58:42,229 --> 01:58:42,239
tiles which everything you expose it
 

6827
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:44,709
tiles which everything you expose it
might be unaligned off various parts of

6828
01:58:44,709 --> 01:58:44,719
might be unaligned off various parts of
 

6829
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:45,430
might be unaligned off various parts of
the

6830
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:45,440
the
 

6831
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,990
the
of the screen memory but it just works

6832
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:48,000
of the screen memory but it just works
 

6833
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,830
of the screen memory but it just works
that no longer had the problem of you

6834
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:49,840
that no longer had the problem of you
 

6835
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,149
that no longer had the problem of you
had to have fields of the similar colors

6836
01:58:52,149 --> 01:58:52,159
had to have fields of the similar colors
 

6837
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:52,950
had to have fields of the similar colors
because

6838
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:52,960
because
 

6839
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,229
because
it doesn't matter what you're doing you

6840
01:58:54,229 --> 01:58:54,239
it doesn't matter what you're doing you
 

6841
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:56,149
it doesn't matter what you're doing you
could be having a completely unique

6842
01:58:56,149 --> 01:58:56,159
could be having a completely unique
 

6843
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:57,990
could be having a completely unique
world and you're just drawing the new

6844
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:58,000
world and you're just drawing the new
 

6845
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,229
world and you're just drawing the new
strip as it comes on but it might be

6846
01:59:00,229 --> 01:59:00,239
strip as it comes on but it might be
 

6847
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:02,790
strip as it comes on but it might be
like you said unaligned so it can be all

6848
01:59:02,790 --> 01:59:02,800
like you said unaligned so it can be all
 

6849
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,229
like you said unaligned so it can be all
over the place yes and it turns out it

6850
01:59:04,229 --> 01:59:04,239
over the place yes and it turns out it
 

6851
01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:05,750
over the place yes and it turns out it
doesn't matter i would have two page

01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:05,760
doesn't matter i would have two page

01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:11,760
this uh two-dimensional window of
 

6859
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,149
this uh two-dimensional window of
graphics and that was one of those like

6860
01:59:14,149 --> 01:59:14,159
graphics and that was one of those like
 

6861
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:17,030
graphics and that was one of those like
well this is so simple this just i this

6862
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,040
well this is so simple this just i this
 

6863
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:19,510
well this is so simple this just i this
just works it's faster i'm there it

6864
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:19,520
just works it's faster i'm there it
 

6865
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,910
just works it's faster i'm there it
seemed like there was no downside funny

6866
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:21,920
seemed like there was no downside funny
 

6867
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,550
seemed like there was no downside funny
thing was i it turned out after we

6868
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:24,560
thing was i it turned out after we
 

6869
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:27,270
thing was i it turned out after we
shipped titles with this there were what

6870
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:27,280
shipped titles with this there were what
 

6871
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,990
shipped titles with this there were what
they called uh super vga cards the cards

6872
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,000
they called uh super vga cards the cards
 

6873
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,149
they called uh super vga cards the cards
that would allow higher resolutions and

6874
01:59:32,149 --> 01:59:32,159
that would allow higher resolutions and
 

6875
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:33,910
that would allow higher resolutions and
i and different features that the

6876
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:33,920
i and different features that the
 

6877
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,589
i and different features that the
standard ones didn't

6878
01:59:35,589 --> 01:59:35,599
standard ones didn't
 

6879
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:38,629
standard ones didn't
and on some of those cards uh this was a

6880
01:59:38,629 --> 01:59:38,639
and on some of those cards uh this was a
 

6881
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:40,390
and on some of those cards uh this was a
weird compatibility quark again because

6882
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:40,400
weird compatibility quark again because
 

6883
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,070
weird compatibility quark again because
nobody thought this was not what it was

6884

nobody thought this was not what it was
 

6885
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,470
nobody thought this was not what it was
designed to do and some of those cards

6886
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:44,480
designed to do and some of those cards
 

6887
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,669
designed to do and some of those cards
had more memory they had more than just

02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,669
exists there rather than wrapping back
around at the top

6900
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:01,679
around at the top
 

6901
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:02,629
around at the top
and

6902
02:00:02,629 --> 02:00:02,639
and
 

6903
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:04,390
and
then i was in the tough position of do i

6904
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:04,400
then i was in the tough position of do i
 

6905
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,070
then i was in the tough position of do i
have to track every single one of these

6906
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,080
have to track every single one of these
 

6907
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:08,229
have to track every single one of these
and it was a mad house back then with

6908
02:00:08,229 --> 02:00:08,239
and it was a mad house back then with
 

6909
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:10,070
and it was a mad house back then with
there were 20 different video card

6910
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:10,080
there were 20 different video card
 

6911
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,750
there were 20 different video card
vendors with all slightly different

6912
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:11,760
vendors with all slightly different
 

6913
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,510
vendors with all slightly different
implementations of their non-standard

6914
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:13,520
implementations of their non-standard
 

6915
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:16,229
implementations of their non-standard
functionality so either i needed to

6916
02:00:16,229 --> 02:00:16,239
functionality so either i needed to
 

6917
02:00:16,239 --> 02:00:19,109
functionality so either i needed to
natively program all of the the vga

6918
02:00:19,109 --> 02:00:19,119
natively program all of the the vga
 

6919
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:20,870
natively program all of the the vga
cards there to

6920
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:20,880
cards there to
 

6921
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,790
cards there to
map in that memory and keep scrolling

6922
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:22,800
map in that memory and keep scrolling
 

6923
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,109
map in that memory and keep scrolling
down through all of that or i kind of

6924
02:00:25,109 --> 02:00:25,119
down through all of that or i kind of
 

6925
02:00:25,119 --> 02:00:27,350
down through all of that or i kind of
punted and took the easy solution of

6926
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:27,360
punted and took the easy solution of
 

6927
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:29,189
punted and took the easy solution of
when you finally did run to the edge of

6928
02:00:29,189 --> 02:00:29,199
when you finally did run to the edge of
 

6929
02:00:29,199 --> 02:00:31,589
when you finally did run to the edge of
the screen i accepted a hitch and just

6930
02:00:31,589 --> 02:00:31,599
the screen i accepted a hitch and just
 

6931
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:34,149
the screen i accepted a hitch and just
copied the whole screen up there so on

6932
02:00:34,149 --> 02:00:34,159
copied the whole screen up there so on
 

6933
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:35,669
copied the whole screen up there so on
some of those

6934
02:00:35,669 --> 02:00:35,679
some of those
 

6935
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:37,669
some of those
uh those cards it was a compatibility

6936
02:00:37,669 --> 02:00:37,679
uh those cards it was a compatibility
 

6937
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:39,430
uh those cards it was a compatibility
mode in the normal ones when it all

6938
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:39,440
mode in the normal ones when it all
 

6939
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:40,709
mode in the normal ones when it all
worked fine everything was just

6940
02:00:40,709 --> 02:00:40,719
worked fine everything was just
 

6941
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:42,629
worked fine everything was just
beautifully smooth but if you had one of

6942
02:00:42,629 --> 02:00:42,639
beautifully smooth but if you had one of
 

6943
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:44,790
beautifully smooth but if you had one of
those cards where it did not wrap the

6944
02:00:44,790 --> 02:00:44,800
those cards where it did not wrap the
 

6945
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,430
those cards where it did not wrap the
way i wanted it to you'd be scrolling

6946
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:47,440
way i wanted it to you'd be scrolling
 

6947
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,030
way i wanted it to you'd be scrolling
around scrolling around and then

6948
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:49,040
around scrolling around and then
 

6949
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:50,470
around scrolling around and then
eventually you'd have a little hitch

6950
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:50,480
eventually you'd have a little hitch
 

6951
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:52,870
eventually you'd have a little hitch
where 200 milliseconds or something that

6952
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:52,880
where 200 milliseconds or something that
 

6953
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,709
where 200 milliseconds or something that
was not super smooth

6954
02:00:54,709 --> 02:00:54,719
was not super smooth
 

6955
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:56,470
was not super smooth
as it froze a little bit and this was

6956
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:56,480
as it froze a little bit and this was
 

6957
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,470
as it froze a little bit and this was
the binary thing is it one of the

6958
02:00:58,470 --> 02:00:58,480
the binary thing is it one of the
 

6959
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,310
the binary thing is it one of the
standard screens there's one of the

6960
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:00,320
standard screens there's one of the
 

6961
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,870
standard screens there's one of the
weird ones the super vga ones yeah okay

6962
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:02,880
weird ones the super vga ones yeah okay
 

6963
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,790
weird ones the super vga ones yeah okay
and so we would default to and i think

6964
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:04,800
and so we would default to and i think
 

6965
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:07,030
and so we would default to and i think
that was one of those that changed over

6966
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:07,040
that was one of those that changed over
 

6967
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,109
that was one of those that changed over
the kind of course of deployment where

6968
02:01:09,109 --> 02:01:09,119
the kind of course of deployment where
 

6969
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:10,950
the kind of course of deployment where
early on we would have a normal mode and

6970
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:10,960
early on we would have a normal mode and
 

6971
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,229
early on we would have a normal mode and
then you would have you would enable the

6972
02:01:12,229 --> 02:01:12,239
then you would have you would enable the
 

6973
02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:14,310
then you would have you would enable the
compatibility flag if your screen did

6974
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:14,320
compatibility flag if your screen did
 

6975
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,390
compatibility flag if your screen did
this crazy flickery thing when you got

6976
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:16,400
this crazy flickery thing when you got
 

6977
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,629
this crazy flickery thing when you got
to a certain point in the game uh and

6978
02:01:18,629 --> 02:01:18,639
to a certain point in the game uh and
 

6979
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:20,229
to a certain point in the game uh and
then later i think it probably got

6980
02:01:20,229 --> 02:01:20,239
then later i think it probably got
 

6981
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:22,149
then later i think it probably got
enabled by default as just more and more

6982
02:01:22,149 --> 02:01:22,159
enabled by default as just more and more
 

6983
02:01:22,159 --> 02:01:24,310
enabled by default as just more and more
of the cards i kind of did not do

6984
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:24,320
of the cards i kind of did not do
 

6985
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,550
of the cards i kind of did not do
exactly the right thing and that's the

6986
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:26,560
exactly the right thing and that's the
 

6987
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,950
exactly the right thing and that's the
two-edged sword of doing unconventional

6988
02:01:28,950 --> 02:01:28,960
two-edged sword of doing unconventional
 

6989
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:31,109
two-edged sword of doing unconventional
things with technology where you can

6990
02:01:31,109 --> 02:01:31,119
things with technology where you can
 

6991
02:01:31,119 --> 02:01:32,950
things with technology where you can
find something that nobody thought about

6992
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:32,960
find something that nobody thought about
 

6993
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,550
find something that nobody thought about
doing that kind of scrolling trick when

6994
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:34,560
doing that kind of scrolling trick when
 

6995
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,109
doing that kind of scrolling trick when
they set up those cards uh but the fact

6996
02:01:37,109 --> 02:01:37,119
they set up those cards uh but the fact
 

6997
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:38,629
they set up those cards uh but the fact
that nobody thought that was the primary

6998
02:01:38,629 --> 02:01:38,639
that nobody thought that was the primary
 

6999
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:41,030
that nobody thought that was the primary
reason when i was relying on that then i

7000
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:41,040
reason when i was relying on that then i
 

7001
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:42,790
reason when i was relying on that then i
wound up being broken on some of the

7002
02:01:42,790 --> 02:01:42,800
wound up being broken on some of the
 

7003
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,189
wound up being broken on some of the
later cards let me uh take a bit of a

7004
02:01:45,189 --> 02:01:45,199
later cards let me uh take a bit of a
 

7005
02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:47,910
later cards let me uh take a bit of a
tangent but uh

7006
02:01:47,910 --> 02:01:47,920
tangent but uh
 

7007
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:50,390
tangent but uh
ask about the hacker ethic because you

hacker ethic
 

7025
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,310
hacker ethic
you've been a man of the people

7026
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:08,320
you've been a man of the people
 

7027
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,790
you've been a man of the people
and you've embodied at least the part of

7028
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:10,800
and you've embodied at least the part of
 

7029
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,350
and you've embodied at least the part of
that ethic what does it mean what did it

hackers was a really formative book for

7036
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:19,840
hackers was a really formative book for
 

7037
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:22,470
hackers was a really formative book for
me uh as a teenager i mean i read it

7038
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:22,480
me uh as a teenager i mean i read it
 

7039
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:25,270
me uh as a teenager i mean i read it
several times and there was all of the

7040
02:02:25,270 --> 02:02:25,280
several times and there was all of the
 

7041
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:28,229
several times and there was all of the
great lore of the early mit era of

7042
02:02:28,229 --> 02:02:28,239
great lore of the early mit era of
 

7043
02:02:28,239 --> 02:02:29,830
great lore of the early mit era of
hackers and you know ending up at the

7044
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:29,840
hackers and you know ending up at the
 

7045
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:32,229
hackers and you know ending up at the
end with it kind of went through the

7046
02:02:32,229 --> 02:02:32,239
end with it kind of went through the
 

7047
02:02:32,239 --> 02:02:34,870
end with it kind of went through the
early mit hackers and the silicon valley

7048
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:34,880
early mit hackers and the silicon valley
 

7049
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:37,350
early mit hackers and the silicon valley
hardware hackers and then uh the game

7050
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:37,360
hardware hackers and then uh the game
 

7051
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:39,350
hardware hackers and then uh the game
hackers in part three

7052
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:39,360
hackers in part three
 

7053
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:41,589
hackers in part three
and at that time as a teenager

7054
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
and at that time as a teenager
 

7055
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:42,790
and at that time as a teenager
i really

7131
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:05,430
the big thing that i was able to do
through in software was uh this ability

7132
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:05,440
through in software was uh this ability
 

7133
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:07,030
through in software was uh this ability
to eventually release the source code

7134
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:07,040
to eventually release the source code
 

7135
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,950
to eventually release the source code
for most of our like all of our really

7136
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:08,960
for most of our like all of our really
 

7137

seminal game titles and that was a it

7138
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:11,840
seminal game titles and that was a it
 

7139
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:14,470
seminal game titles and that was a it
was a stepping stone process where

7140
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:14,480
was a stepping stone process where
 

7141
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:17,270
was a stepping stone process where
we were kind of surprised early on where

7142
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:17,280
we were kind of surprised early on where
 

7143
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,669
we were kind of surprised early on where
uh people were able to hack the existing

7144
02:04:19,669 --> 02:04:19,679
uh people were able to hack the existing
 

7145
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:21,109
uh people were able to hack the existing
games and of course i had experience

7146
02:04:21,109 --> 02:04:21,119
games and of course i had experience
 

7147
02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:22,709
games and of course i had experience
with that i remember hacking my copies

7148
02:04:22,709 --> 02:04:22,719
with that i remember hacking my copies
 

7149
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:25,589
with that i remember hacking my copies
of ultima so i give myself you know 999

3d
 

7167
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:44,149
3d
but i made the pitch

7168
02:04:44,149 --> 02:04:44,159
but i made the pitch
 

7169
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:45,910
but i made the pitch
internally that we should actually

7170
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:45,920
internally that we should actually
 

7171
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,229
internally that we should actually
release our own tools for like what we

7172
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:48,239
release our own tools for like what we
 

7173
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:51,270
release our own tools for like what we
did uh what we used to create the games

7174
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:51,280
did uh what we used to create the games
 

7175
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:53,270
did uh what we used to create the games
and that was you know that was a little

7176
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:53,280
and that was you know that was a little
 

7177
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:55,750
and that was you know that was a little
bit debatable about well you know will

7178
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:55,760
bit debatable about well you know will
 

7179
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:57,750
bit debatable about well you know will
this let other will give people leg up

7180
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:57,760
this let other will give people leg up
 

7181
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:58,950
this let other will give people leg up
it's always like what's that going to

7182
02:04:58,950 --> 02:04:58,960
it's always like what's that going to
 

7183
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:00,870
it's always like what's that going to
mean for the competition

7184
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:00,880
mean for the competition
 

7185
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:03,750
mean for the competition
but the really hard pitch was to

7186
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:03,760
but the really hard pitch was to
 

7187
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,589
but the really hard pitch was to
actually release the full source code

7188
02:05:05,589 --> 02:05:05,599
actually release the full source code
 

7189
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:08,470
actually release the full source code
for the games and it was a balancing act

7190
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:08,480
for the games and it was a balancing act
 

7191
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,709
for the games and it was a balancing act
with the the other people inside the

7192
02:05:10,709 --> 02:05:10,719
with the the other people inside the
 

7193
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:12,390
with the the other people inside the

it's interesting how the programmers

7196
02:05:15,109 --> 02:05:15,119
it's interesting how the programmers
 

7197
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:18,629
it's interesting how the programmers

7202
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:22,480
did kind of get that hacker ethic bit
 

7203
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,629
did kind of get that hacker ethic bit
where you wanted to share your code you

did
 

7521
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:55,830

of like gauntlet you're running around

7525
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:59,589
of like gauntlet you're running around
and you can open up doors pick up items

this exact same game experience just
 

7533
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:09,109
this exact same game experience just
presented in a different perspective it

7534
02:11:09,109 --> 02:11:09,119
presented in a different perspective it
 

7535
02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:11,589
presented in a different perspective it
could be literally the same game just

7536
02:11:11,589 --> 02:11:11,599
could be literally the same game just
 

7537
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:13,830
could be literally the same game just
with a different view into it would have

7538
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:13,840
with a different view into it would have
 

7539
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,669
with a different view into it would have
a dramatically different impact on the

7540
02:11:15,669 --> 02:11:15,679
a dramatically different impact on the
 

7541
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:16,790
a dramatically different impact on the
players

7542
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:16,800
players
 

7543
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,470
players
so it wasn't

7544
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:18,480
so it wasn't
 

7545
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:21,109
so it wasn't
it wasn't a true 3d you're saying that

7546
02:11:21,109 --> 02:11:21,119
it wasn't a true 3d you're saying that
 

7547
02:11:21,119 --> 02:11:23,109
it wasn't a true 3d you're saying that
you could kind of fake it you can like

7548
02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:23,119
you could kind of fake it you can like
 

7549
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:24,950
you could kind of fake it you can like
scale enemies meaning things that are

7550
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:24,960
scale enemies meaning things that are
 

7551
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:27,350
scale enemies meaning things that are
farther away you can make them smaller

7552
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:27,360
farther away you can make them smaller
 

7553
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:30,069
farther away you can make them smaller
so from the game was a 2d map like all

7554
02:11:30,069 --> 02:11:30,079
so from the game was a 2d map like all
 

7555
02:11:30,079 --> 02:11:32,149
so from the game was a 2d map like all
of our games use the same tool for

7556
02:11:32,149 --> 02:11:32,159
of our games use the same tool for
 

7557
02:11:32,159 --> 02:11:34,310
of our games use the same tool for
creation and we used the same map editor

7558
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,320
creation and we used the same map editor
 

7559
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,629
creation and we used the same map editor
for creating keen as wolfenstein and

7560
02:11:36,629 --> 02:11:36,639
for creating keen as wolfenstein and
 

7561
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:38,310
for creating keen as wolfenstein and
evertank and catacombs and all this

7562
02:11:38,310 --> 02:11:38,320
evertank and catacombs and all this
 

7563
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:41,990
evertank and catacombs and all this
stuff so the game was a 2d grid made out

7564
02:11:41,990 --> 02:11:42,000
stuff so the game was a 2d grid made out
 

7565
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,830
stuff so the game was a 2d grid made out
of blocks and you could say well these

7566
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:43,840
of blocks and you could say well these
 

7567
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,350
of blocks and you could say well these
are walls these are where the enemies

7568
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:45,360
are walls these are where the enemies
 

7569
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,910
are walls these are where the enemies
start then they start moving around and

7570
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:47,920
start then they start moving around and
 

7571
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:49,669
start then they start moving around and
these early games like catacombs you

7572
02:11:49,669 --> 02:11:49,679
these early games like catacombs you
 

7573
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:51,830
these early games like catacombs you
played it strictly in a 2d view it was a

7574
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:51,840
played it strictly in a 2d view it was a
 

7575
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:53,669
played it strictly in a 2d view it was a
scrolling 2d view and that was kind of

7576
02:11:53,669 --> 02:11:53,679
scrolling 2d view and that was kind of
 

7577
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:55,510
scrolling 2d view and that was kind of
using an adaptive tile refresh at the

7578
02:11:55,510 --> 02:11:55,520
using an adaptive tile refresh at the
 

7579
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,270
using an adaptive tile refresh at the
time to be able to do something like

7580
02:11:57,270 --> 02:11:57,280
time to be able to do something like
 

7581
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:58,390
time to be able to do something like
that

7582
02:11:58,390 --> 02:11:58,400
that
 

7583
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,589
that
and then

7584
02:11:59,589 --> 02:11:59,599
and then
 

7585
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:01,750
and then
the thought that these early games all

7586
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:01,760
the thought that these early games all
 

7587
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:03,990
the thought that these early games all
it did was take the same basic enemy

7588
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:04,000
it did was take the same basic enemy
 

7589
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,910
it did was take the same basic enemy
logic but instead of seeing it from the

7590
02:12:05,910 --> 02:12:05,920
logic but instead of seeing it from the
 

7591
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:08,790
logic but instead of seeing it from the
god's eye view on top you were inside it

7592
02:12:08,790 --> 02:12:08,800
god's eye view on top you were inside it
 

7593
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,790
god's eye view on top you were inside it
and turning from side to side yawing

7594
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:10,800
and turning from side to side yawing
 

7595
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:12,069
and turning from side to side yawing
your view and moving forwards and

7596
02:12:12,069 --> 02:12:12,079
your view and moving forwards and
 

7597
02:12:12,079 --> 02:12:15,350
your view and moving forwards and
backwards and side to side i and it's a

7598
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:15,360
backwards and side to side i and it's a
 

7599
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:16,790
backwards and side to side i and it's a
striking thing where you always talk

7600
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:16,800
striking thing where you always talk
 

7601
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,629
striking thing where you always talk
about wanting to isolate and factor

7602
02:12:18,629 --> 02:12:18,639
about wanting to isolate and factor
 

7603
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:20,709
about wanting to isolate and factor
changes in values and this was one of

7604
02:12:20,709 --> 02:12:20,719
changes in values and this was one of
 

7605
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:23,189
changes in values and this was one of
those most pure cases there where

7606
02:12:23,189 --> 02:12:23,199
those most pure cases there where
 

7607
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:24,870
those most pure cases there where
the rest of the game changed very little

7608
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:24,880
the rest of the game changed very little
 

7609
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:26,709
the rest of the game changed very little
it was our normal kind of change the

7610
02:12:26,709 --> 02:12:26,719
it was our normal kind of change the
 

7611
02:12:26,719 --> 02:12:28,390
it was our normal kind of change the
colors on something and draw a different

7612
02:12:28,390 --> 02:12:28,400
colors on something and draw a different
 

7613
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:30,069
colors on something and draw a different
picture for it but it's kind of the same

7614
02:12:30,069 --> 02:12:30,079
picture for it but it's kind of the same
 

7615
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:32,229
picture for it but it's kind of the same
thing but the perspective changed in a

7616
02:12:32,229 --> 02:12:32,239
thing but the perspective changed in a
 

7617
02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:35,030
thing but the perspective changed in a
really fundamental way and it was

7618
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:35,040
really fundamental way and it was
 

7619
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,109
really fundamental way and it was
dramatically different i can remember

7620
02:12:37,109 --> 02:12:37,119
dramatically different i can remember
 

7621
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:40,470
dramatically different i can remember
the reactions where the artist adrian

7622
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:40,480
the reactions where the artist adrian
 

7623
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:41,990
the reactions where the artist adrian
that had been drawing the pictures for

7624
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:42,000
that had been drawing the pictures for
 

7625
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,510
that had been drawing the pictures for
we had a cool big troll thing in

7626
02:12:43,510 --> 02:12:43,520
we had a cool big troll thing in
 

7627
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:46,629
we had a cool big troll thing in
catacombs 3d and we had uh these walls

7628
02:12:46,629 --> 02:12:46,639
catacombs 3d and we had uh these walls
 

7629
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:48,310
catacombs 3d and we had uh these walls
that you could get a key and you could

7630
02:12:48,310 --> 02:12:48,320
that you could get a key and you could
 

7631
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:50,229
that you could get a key and you could
make the blocks disappear get really

7632
02:12:50,229 --> 02:12:50,239
make the blocks disappear get really
 

7633
02:12:50,239 --> 02:12:51,830
make the blocks disappear get really
simple stuff blocks could either be

7634
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:51,840
simple stuff blocks could either be
 

7635
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,310
simple stuff blocks could either be
there or not there so our idea of a door

7636
02:12:54,310 --> 02:12:54,320
there or not there so our idea of a door
 

7637
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:55,910
there or not there so our idea of a door
was being able to make a set of blocks

7638
02:12:55,910 --> 02:12:55,920
was being able to make a set of blocks
 

7639
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:58,069
was being able to make a set of blocks
just disappear and i remember the

7640
02:12:58,069 --> 02:12:58,079
just disappear and i remember the
 

7641
02:12:58,079 --> 02:12:59,510
just disappear and i remember the
reaction where he had drawn these

7642
02:12:59,510 --> 02:12:59,520
reaction where he had drawn these
 

7643
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,109
reaction where he had drawn these
characters and he was slowly moving

7644
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
characters and he was slowly moving
 

7645
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:03,270
characters and he was slowly moving
around and like people had no experience

7646
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:03,280
around and like people had no experience
 

7647
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:04,950
around and like people had no experience
with 3d navigation it was all still

7648
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:04,960
with 3d navigation it was all still
 

7649
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:07,109
with 3d navigation it was all still
keyboard we didn't even have mice

7650
02:13:07,109 --> 02:13:07,119
keyboard we didn't even have mice
 

7651
02:13:07,119 --> 02:13:09,750
keyboard we didn't even have mice
set up at that time but slowly moving

7652
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:09,760
set up at that time but slowly moving
 

7653
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:12,149
set up at that time but slowly moving
going up picked up a key go to a wall

7654
02:13:12,149 --> 02:13:12,159
going up picked up a key go to a wall
 

7655
02:13:12,159 --> 02:13:13,669
going up picked up a key go to a wall
the wall disappears in a little

7656
02:13:13,669 --> 02:13:13,679
the wall disappears in a little
 

7657
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:15,350
the wall disappears in a little
animation and there's a monster like

7658
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
animation and there's a monster like
 

7659
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:17,350
animation and there's a monster like
right there and he practically fell out

7660
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:17,360
right there and he practically fell out
 

7661
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:19,189
right there and he practically fell out
of his chair it was just like ah

7662
02:13:19,189 --> 02:13:19,199
of his chair it was just like ah
 

7663
02:13:19,199 --> 02:13:20,149
of his chair it was just like ah
and

7664
02:13:20,149 --> 02:13:20,159
and
 

7665
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:22,470
and
games just didn't do that you know the

7666
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
games just didn't do that you know the
 

7667
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:24,550
games just didn't do that you know the
games were the god's eye view you were a

7668
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:24,560
games were the god's eye view you were a
 

7669
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:26,310
games were the god's eye view you were a
little invested in your little guy you

7670
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:26,320
little invested in your little guy you
 

7671
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:28,629
little invested in your little guy you
can be like you know happy or sad when

7672
02:13:28,629 --> 02:13:28,639
can be like you know happy or sad when
 

7673
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:30,709
can be like you know happy or sad when
things happen but you just did not get

7674
02:13:30,709 --> 02:13:30,719
things happen but you just did not get
 

7675
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:32,390
things happen but you just did not get
that kind of startle reaction you

7676
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:32,400
that kind of startle reaction you
 

7677
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:33,830
that kind of startle reaction you
weren't interested in your face

7678
02:13:33,830 --> 02:13:33,840
weren't interested in your face
 

7679
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,750
weren't interested in your face
something in the back of your brain some

7680
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:35,760
something in the back of your brain some
 

7681
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:37,830
something in the back of your brain some
reptile brain thing is just going oh

7682
02:13:37,830 --> 02:13:37,840
reptile brain thing is just going oh
 

7683
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,830
reptile brain thing is just going oh
 something just happened

7684
02:13:39,830 --> 02:13:39,840
something just happened
 

7685
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:41,750
something just happened
and that was one of those early points

7686
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:41,760
and that was one of those early points
 

7687
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,430
and that was one of those early points
where it's like yeah this is going to

7688
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:43,440

make a difference this is going to be
powerful and it's going to matter were

you able to imagine that in the idea

7694
02:13:49,510 --> 02:13:49,520
you able to imagine that in the idea

not that exact thing so again we had

not that exact thing so again we had
 

7699
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:57,030
not that exact thing so again we had
cases like the arcade games battlezone

cases like the arcade games battlezone
 

7701
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:59,109

a 3d world and things coming at you and
 

7705
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:04,470
a 3d world and things coming at you and
you get some sense of it but nothing had

7706
02:14:04,470 --> 02:14:04,480
you get some sense of it but nothing had
 

7707
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:05,910
you get some sense of it but nothing had
done the kind of worlds that we were

7708
02:14:05,910 --> 02:14:05,920
done the kind of worlds that we were
 

7709
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:07,669
done the kind of worlds that we were
doing and the sort of action based

really might have trended differently if

like was an extra life because you

tries but now more fun is had when you
 

7817
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,270
tries but now more fun is had when you
just let people kind of keep trying when

just let people kind of keep trying when
 

7819

7846
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:26,320
come back to the theme of deadlines and
 

7847
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:28,470
come back to the theme of deadlines and
resource constraints the the game

7848
02:16:28,470 --> 02:16:28,480
resource constraints the the game
 

7849
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:31,030
resource constraints the the game
catacombs 3d um

7850
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:31,040
catacombs 3d um
 

7851
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:32,549
catacombs 3d um
we shipped we were supposed to be

7852
02:16:32,549 --> 02:16:32,559
we shipped we were supposed to be
 

7853
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:33,990
we shipped we were supposed to be
shipping this for gamer's edge on a

7854
02:16:33,990 --> 02:16:34,000
shipping this for gamer's edge on a
 

7855
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,790
shipping this for gamer's edge on a
monthly cadence and i had slipped i was

7856
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:36,800
monthly cadence and i had slipped i was
 

7857
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:39,190
monthly cadence and i had slipped i was
actually late it slipped like six weeks

7858
02:16:39,190 --> 02:16:39,200
actually late it slipped like six weeks
 

7859
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,429
actually late it slipped like six weeks
because this was texture mapped walls

7860
02:16:41,429 --> 02:16:41,439
because this was texture mapped walls
 

7861
02:16:41,439 --> 02:16:44,709
because this was texture mapped walls
doing stuff that i hadn't done before

7862
02:16:44,709 --> 02:16:44,719
doing stuff that i hadn't done before
 

7863
02:16:44,719 --> 02:16:47,429
doing stuff that i hadn't done before
and at the six week point it was still

7864
02:16:47,429 --> 02:16:47,439
and at the six week point it was still
 

7865
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:49,190
and at the six week point it was still
kind of glitchy and buggy there were

7866
02:16:49,190 --> 02:16:49,200
kind of glitchy and buggy there were
 

7867
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,110
kind of glitchy and buggy there were
things that i knew that if you had a

7868
02:16:51,110 --> 02:16:51,120
things that i knew that if you had a
 

7869
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:53,190
things that i knew that if you had a
wall that was like almost edge on you

7870
02:16:53,190 --> 02:16:53,200
wall that was like almost edge on you
 

7871
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,950
wall that was like almost edge on you
could slide over to it and you could see

7872
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:54,960
could slide over to it and you could see
 

7873
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:57,190
could slide over to it and you could see
some things freak out or vanish or not

7874
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:57,200
some things freak out or vanish or not
 

7875
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,790
some things freak out or vanish or not
work and i hated that i i but i was up

7876
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:00,800
work and i hated that i i but i was up
 

7877
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:02,629
work and i hated that i i but i was up
against the wall we had to ship the game

7878
02:17:02,629 --> 02:17:02,639
against the wall we had to ship the game
 

7879
02:17:02,639 --> 02:17:04,549
against the wall we had to ship the game
uh it was still a lot of fun to play it

7880
02:17:04,549 --> 02:17:04,559
uh it was still a lot of fun to play it
 

7881
02:17:04,559 --> 02:17:06,309
uh it was still a lot of fun to play it
was novel nobody had seen it it gave you

7882
02:17:06,309 --> 02:17:06,319
was novel nobody had seen it it gave you
 

7883
02:17:06,319 --> 02:17:09,509
was novel nobody had seen it it gave you
that startle reflex uh reaction so it

7884
02:17:09,509 --> 02:17:09,519
that startle reflex uh reaction so it
 

7885
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:12,070
that startle reflex uh reaction so it
was worth shipping but it had these

7886
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:12,080
was worth shipping but it had these
 

7887
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:13,830
was worth shipping but it had these
things that i knew were kind of flaky

7888
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:13,840
things that i knew were kind of flaky
 

7889
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:16,309
things that i knew were kind of flaky
and janky and not not what i was really

7890
02:17:16,309 --> 02:17:16,319
and janky and not not what i was really
 

7891
02:17:16,319 --> 02:17:18,230
and janky and not not what i was really
proud of so

7892
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:18,240
proud of so
 

7893
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:19,990
proud of so
one of the the things that i did very

7894
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:20,000
one of the the things that i did very
 

7895
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,830
one of the the things that i did very
differently in wolfenstein i was i went

7896
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:23,840
differently in wolfenstein i was i went
 

7897
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:25,589
differently in wolfenstein i was i went
catacombs used

7898
02:17:25,589 --> 02:17:25,599
catacombs used
 

7899
02:17:25,599 --> 02:17:27,349
catacombs used
almost a conventional thing where you

7900
02:17:27,349 --> 02:17:27,359
almost a conventional thing where you
 

7901
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:29,509
almost a conventional thing where you
had segments that were one-dimensional

7902
02:17:29,509 --> 02:17:29,519
had segments that were one-dimensional
 

7903
02:17:29,519 --> 02:17:31,830
had segments that were one-dimensional
polygons basically that were clipped and

7904
02:17:31,830 --> 02:17:31,840
polygons basically that were clipped and
 

7905
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:34,389
polygons basically that were clipped and
uh and back-faced and done kind of like

7906
02:17:34,389 --> 02:17:34,399
uh and back-faced and done kind of like
 

7907
02:17:34,399 --> 02:17:36,469
uh and back-faced and done kind of like
a very crude 3d engine from the

7908
02:17:36,469 --> 02:17:36,479
a very crude 3d engine from the
 

7909
02:17:36,479 --> 02:17:38,709
a very crude 3d engine from the
professionals but i wasn't getting it

7910
02:17:38,709 --> 02:17:38,719
professionals but i wasn't getting it
 

7911
02:17:38,719 --> 02:17:41,030
professionals but i wasn't getting it
done right i was not doing a good enough

7912
02:17:41,030 --> 02:17:41,040
done right i was not doing a good enough
 

7913
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,190
done right i was not doing a good enough
job i didn't really have line of sight

7914
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:43,200
job i didn't really have line of sight
 

7915
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:43,990

7916
02:17:43,990 --> 02:17:44,000
to
 

7917
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,990
to
um to fix it right there's stuff that of

7918
02:17:45,990 --> 02:17:46,000
um to fix it right there's stuff that of
 

7919
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,349
um to fix it right there's stuff that of
course i look back it's like oh it's

7920
02:17:47,349 --> 02:17:47,359
course i look back it's like oh it's
 

7921
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:49,190
course i look back it's like oh it's
obvious how to do this and do the math

7922
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:49,200
obvious how to do this and do the math
 

7923
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:50,870
obvious how to do this and do the math
right do your clipping right

7924
02:17:50,870 --> 02:17:50,880
right do your clipping right
 

7925
02:17:50,880 --> 02:17:52,389
right do your clipping right
check all of this how you handle the

7926
02:17:52,389 --> 02:17:52,399
check all of this how you handle the
 

7927
02:17:52,399 --> 02:17:54,549
check all of this how you handle the
precision but i did not know how to do

7928
02:17:54,549 --> 02:17:54,559
precision but i did not know how to do
 

7929
02:17:54,559 --> 02:17:56,950
precision but i did not know how to do
that at that time the first 3d engine

7930
02:17:56,950 --> 02:17:56,960
that at that time the first 3d engine
 

7931
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:58,790
that at that time the first 3d engine
you wrote catacombs 3d

7932
02:17:58,790 --> 02:17:58,800
you wrote catacombs 3d
 

7933
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:00,230
you wrote catacombs 3d
and hover tank had been a little bit

7934
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:00,240
and hover tank had been a little bit
 

7935
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:01,910
and hover tank had been a little bit
before that but that had the flat shaded

7936
02:18:01,910 --> 02:18:01,920
before that but that had the flat shaded
 

7937
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:04,070
before that but that had the flat shaded
walls so the texture mapping on the

7938
02:18:04,070 --> 02:18:04,080
walls so the texture mapping on the
 

7939
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:05,669
walls so the texture mapping on the
walls was what was bringing in some of

7940
02:18:05,669 --> 02:18:05,679
walls was what was bringing in some of
 

7941
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:08,230
walls was what was bringing in some of
these challenges that was uh that was

7942
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:08,240
these challenges that was uh that was
 

7943
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:09,910
these challenges that was uh that was
hard for me and i couldn't solve it

7944
02:18:09,910 --> 02:18:09,920
hard for me and i couldn't solve it
 

7945
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,750
hard for me and i couldn't solve it
right at the time can you describe what

7946
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:11,760
right at the time can you describe what
 

7947
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:13,990
right at the time can you describe what
flat shading is in texture mapping so in

7948
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:14,000
flat shading is in texture mapping so in
 

7949
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,790
flat shading is in texture mapping so in
the the walls work solid color one of 16

7950
02:18:16,790 --> 02:18:16,800
the the walls work solid color one of 16
 

7951
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:20,150
the the walls work solid color one of 16
colors i'm in hover tank so that's easy

7952
02:18:20,150 --> 02:18:20,160
colors i'm in hover tank so that's easy
 

7953
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:22,389
colors i'm in hover tank so that's easy
it's fast you just draw the solid color

7954
02:18:22,389 --> 02:18:22,399
it's fast you just draw the solid color
 

7955
02:18:22,399 --> 02:18:24,549
it's fast you just draw the solid color
for everything texture mapping is what

7956
02:18:24,549 --> 02:18:24,559
for everything texture mapping is what
 

7957
02:18:24,559 --> 02:18:26,469
for everything texture mapping is what
we all see today where you have an image

7958
02:18:26,469 --> 02:18:26,479
we all see today where you have an image
 

7959
02:18:26,479 --> 02:18:28,629
we all see today where you have an image
that is stretched and distorted onto the

7960
02:18:28,629 --> 02:18:28,639
that is stretched and distorted onto the
 

7961
02:18:28,639 --> 02:18:30,070
that is stretched and distorted onto the
walls or the surfaces that you're

7962
02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:30,080
walls or the surfaces that you're
 

7963
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:33,429
walls or the surfaces that you're
working with um and it was you know it

7964
02:18:33,429 --> 02:18:33,439
working with um and it was you know it
 

7965
02:18:33,439 --> 02:18:35,030
working with um and it was you know it
was a long time for me to just figure

7966
02:18:35,030 --> 02:18:35,040
was a long time for me to just figure
 

7967
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,270
was a long time for me to just figure
out how to do that without it distorting

7968
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:37,280
out how to do that without it distorting
 

7969
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:39,429
out how to do that without it distorting
in the wrong ways and

7970
02:18:39,429 --> 02:18:39,439
in the wrong ways and
 

7971
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:41,509
in the wrong ways and
and i did not get it all exactly right

7972
02:18:41,509 --> 02:18:41,519
and i did not get it all exactly right
 

7973
02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:44,790
and i did not get it all exactly right
in catacombs and i i had these flaws

7974
02:18:44,790 --> 02:18:44,800
in catacombs and i i had these flaws
 

7975
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:46,870
in catacombs and i i had these flaws
so that was important enough to me that

7976
02:18:46,870 --> 02:18:46,880
so that was important enough to me that
 

7977
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:48,790
so that was important enough to me that
rather than continuing to bang my head

7978
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:48,800
rather than continuing to bang my head
 

7979
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:50,790
rather than continuing to bang my head
on that when i wasn't positive i was

7980
02:18:50,790 --> 02:18:50,800
on that when i wasn't positive i was
 

7981
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:52,629
on that when i wasn't positive i was
gonna get it i went with a completely

7982
02:18:52,629 --> 02:18:52,639
gonna get it i went with a completely
 

7983
02:18:52,639 --> 02:18:54,870
gonna get it i went with a completely
different approach for drawing for

7984
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:54,880
different approach for drawing for
 

7985
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:56,549
different approach for drawing for
figuring out where the walls were which

7986
02:18:56,549 --> 02:18:56,559
figuring out where the walls were which
 

7987
02:18:56,559 --> 02:18:59,270
figuring out where the walls were which
was a raycasting approach which i had

7988
02:18:59,270 --> 02:18:59,280
was a raycasting approach which i had
 

7989
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:02,150
was a raycasting approach which i had
done in catacombs 3d i had a bunch of c

7990
02:19:02,150 --> 02:19:02,160
done in catacombs 3d i had a bunch of c
 

7991
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:04,070
done in catacombs 3d i had a bunch of c
code trying to make this work right and

7992
02:19:04,070 --> 02:19:04,080
code trying to make this work right and
 

7993
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:06,870
code trying to make this work right and
it wasn't working right in wolfenstein i

7994
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:06,880
it wasn't working right in wolfenstein i
 

7995
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:10,150
it wasn't working right in wolfenstein i
wound up going to a very small amount of

7996
02:19:10,150 --> 02:19:10,160
wound up going to a very small amount of
 

7997
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:12,309
wound up going to a very small amount of
assembly code so in some ways there

7998
02:19:12,309 --> 02:19:12,319
assembly code so in some ways there
 

7999
02:19:12,319 --> 02:19:14,629
assembly code so in some ways there
should be a slower way of doing it but

8000
02:19:14,629 --> 02:19:14,639
should be a slower way of doing it but
 

8001
02:19:14,639 --> 02:19:16,389
should be a slower way of doing it but
by making it a smaller amount of work

8002
02:19:16,389 --> 02:19:16,399
by making it a smaller amount of work
 

8003
02:19:16,399 --> 02:19:18,549
by making it a smaller amount of work
that i could more tightly optimize it

8004
02:19:18,549 --> 02:19:18,559
that i could more tightly optimize it
 

8005
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:21,110
that i could more tightly optimize it
worked out and wolfenstein 3d was just

8006
02:19:21,110 --> 02:19:21,120
worked out and wolfenstein 3d was just
 

8007
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,509
worked out and wolfenstein 3d was just
absolutely rock solid you know it was

8008
02:19:23,509 --> 02:19:23,519
absolutely rock solid you know it was
 

8009
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:25,509
absolutely rock solid you know it was
you know nothing glitched in there the

8010
02:19:25,509 --> 02:19:25,519
you know nothing glitched in there the
 

8011
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:27,429
you know nothing glitched in there the
game just was pretty much flawless

8012
02:19:27,429 --> 02:19:27,439
game just was pretty much flawless
 

8013
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:28,870
game just was pretty much flawless
through all of that and i was super

8014
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:28,880
through all of that and i was super
 

8015
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:31,110
through all of that and i was super
proud of that i'm

8016
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,120
proud of that i'm
 

8017
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:33,270
proud of that i'm
but eventually like in the later games i

8018
02:19:33,270 --> 02:19:33,280
but eventually like in the later games i
 

8019
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:35,509
but eventually like in the later games i
went back to the more span based things

8020
02:19:35,509 --> 02:19:35,519
went back to the more span based things
 

8021
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:37,509
went back to the more span based things
where i could get more total efficiency

8022
02:19:37,509 --> 02:19:37,519
where i could get more total efficiency
 

8023
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:39,429
where i could get more total efficiency
once i really did figure out how to do

8024
02:19:39,429 --> 02:19:39,439
once i really did figure out how to do
 

8025
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:41,750
once i really did figure out how to do
it so there were two sort of key

8026
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:41,760
it so there were two sort of key
 

8027
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:43,990
it so there were two sort of key
technical things to wolfenstein one was

8028
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:44,000
technical things to wolfenstein one was
 

8029
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,790
technical things to wolfenstein one was
this raycasting approach which you still

8030
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:46,800
this raycasting approach which you still
 

8031
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:48,710
this raycasting approach which you still
to this day you see people go and say

8032
02:19:48,710 --> 02:19:48,720
to this day you see people go and say
 

8033
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:50,950
to this day you see people go and say
let's write a raycasting engine because

8034
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:50,960
let's write a raycasting engine because
 

8035
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:52,710
let's write a raycasting engine because
it's an understandable way of doing

8036
02:19:52,710 --> 02:19:52,720
it's an understandable way of doing
 

8037
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:54,870
it's an understandable way of doing
things that lets you make games very

8038
02:19:54,870 --> 02:19:54,880
things that lets you make games very
 

8039
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:56,870
things that lets you make games very
much like that so you see raycasters in

8040
02:19:56,870 --> 02:19:56,880
much like that so you see raycasters in
 

8041
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:59,110
much like that so you see raycasters in
javascript raycasters and python people

8042
02:19:59,110 --> 02:19:59,120
javascript raycasters and python people
 

8043
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,710
javascript raycasters and python people
that are are basically going and

8044
02:20:00,710 --> 02:20:00,720
that are are basically going and
 

8045
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:03,670
that are are basically going and
re-implementing that uh that approach to

8046
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:03,680
re-implementing that uh that approach to
 

8047
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:05,670
re-implementing that uh that approach to
taking a tiled world and casting out

8048
02:20:05,670 --> 02:20:05,680
taking a tiled world and casting out
 

8049
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:07,590
taking a tiled world and casting out
into it it works pretty well but it's

8050
02:20:07,590 --> 02:20:07,600
into it it works pretty well but it's
 

8051
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:09,349
into it it works pretty well but it's
not the fastest way of doing it can you

8052
02:20:09,349 --> 02:20:09,359
not the fastest way of doing it can you
 

8053
02:20:09,359 --> 02:20:11,270
not the fastest way of doing it can you
describe what raycasting is

8054
02:20:11,270 --> 02:20:11,280
describe what raycasting is
 

8055
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:12,950
describe what raycasting is
so you start off and you've got your

8056
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:12,960
so you start off and you've got your
 

8057
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:15,429
so you start off and you've got your
screen which is 320 pixels across at the

8058
02:20:15,429 --> 02:20:15,439
screen which is 320 pixels across at the
 

8059
02:20:15,439 --> 02:20:17,670
screen which is 320 pixels across at the
time if you haven't sized down in the

8060
02:20:17,670 --> 02:20:17,680
time if you haven't sized down in the
 

8061
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:20,550
time if you haven't sized down in the
window for for greater speed and at

8062
02:20:20,550 --> 02:20:20,560
window for for greater speed and at
 

8063
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:22,389
window for for greater speed and at
every pixel there's going to be an angle

8064
02:20:22,389 --> 02:20:22,399
every pixel there's going to be an angle
 

8065
02:20:22,399 --> 02:20:23,830
every pixel there's going to be an angle
from you've got your position in the

8066
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:23,840
from you've got your position in the
 

8067
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:25,750
from you've got your position in the
world and you're going to just run along

8068
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:25,760
world and you're going to just run along
 

8069
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:27,910
world and you're going to just run along
that angle and keep going until you hit

8070
02:20:27,910 --> 02:20:27,920
that angle and keep going until you hit
 

8071
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:29,110
that angle and keep going until you hit
a block

8072
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:29,120
a block
 

8073
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:32,070
a block
so up to 320 times across there it's

8074
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:32,080
so up to 320 times across there it's
 

8075
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:34,790
so up to 320 times across there it's
going to throw a cast array out into the

8076
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:34,800
going to throw a cast array out into the
 

8077
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:37,510
going to throw a cast array out into the
world from wherever your origin is until

8078
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:37,520
world from wherever your origin is until
 

8079
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:38,950
world from wherever your origin is until
it runs into a wall and then it can

8080
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:38,960
it runs into a wall and then it can
 

8081
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:41,270
it runs into a wall and then it can
figure out exactly where on the wall

8082
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:41,280
figure out exactly where on the wall
 

8083
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:43,270
figure out exactly where on the wall
it hits the performance challenge of

8084
02:20:43,270 --> 02:20:43,280
it hits the performance challenge of
 

8085
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:45,990
it hits the performance challenge of
that is as it's going out every block

8086
02:20:45,990 --> 02:20:46,000
that is as it's going out every block
 

8087
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,389
that is as it's going out every block
it's crossing it checks is this a solid

8088
02:20:48,389 --> 02:20:48,399
it's crossing it checks is this a solid
 

8089
02:20:48,399 --> 02:20:49,190
it's crossing it checks is this a solid
wall

8090
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:49,200
wall
 

8091
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:51,349
wall
so that means that in like the early

8092
02:20:51,349 --> 02:20:51,359
so that means that in like the early
 

8093
02:20:51,359 --> 02:20:53,270
so that means that in like the early
wolfenstein levels you're in a small

8094
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:53,280
wolfenstein levels you're in a small
 

8095
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:55,750
wolfenstein levels you're in a small
jail cell going out into a small hallway

8096
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:55,760
jail cell going out into a small hallway
 

8097
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:57,190
jail cell going out into a small hallway
it's super efficient for that because

8098
02:20:57,190 --> 02:20:57,200
it's super efficient for that because
 

8099
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:58,950
it's super efficient for that because
you're only stepping across three or

8100
02:20:58,950 --> 02:20:58,960
you're only stepping across three or
 

8101
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:01,349
you're only stepping across three or
four blocks but then if somebody makes a

8102
02:21:01,349 --> 02:21:01,359
four blocks but then if somebody makes a
 

8103
02:21:01,359 --> 02:21:03,270
four blocks but then if somebody makes a
room that covers our maps we're limited

8104
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:03,280
room that covers our maps we're limited
 

8105
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,950
room that covers our maps we're limited
to 64 by 64 blocks if you made one room

8106
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:06,960
to 64 by 64 blocks if you made one room
 

8107
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:09,110
to 64 by 64 blocks if you made one room
that was nothing but walls at the far

8108
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:09,120
that was nothing but walls at the far
 

8109
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:11,190
that was nothing but walls at the far
space it would go pretty slow because it

8110
02:21:11,190 --> 02:21:11,200
space it would go pretty slow because it
 

8111
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:13,190
space it would go pretty slow because it
would be stepping across

8112
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:13,200
would be stepping across
 

8113
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:15,830
would be stepping across
80 tile tests or something along the way

8114
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:15,840
80 tile tests or something along the way
 

8115
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:17,349
80 tile tests or something along the way
by the way the physics of our universe

8116
02:21:17,349 --> 02:21:17,359
by the way the physics of our universe
 

8117
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:19,030
by the way the physics of our universe
seems to be competing this very thing so

8118
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:19,040
seems to be competing this very thing so
 

8119
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:21,750
seems to be competing this very thing so
this maps nicely to the actual physics

8120
02:21:21,750 --> 02:21:21,760
this maps nicely to the actual physics
 

8121
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:24,150
this maps nicely to the actual physics
of our world yeah you get intuitive i

8122
02:21:24,150 --> 02:21:24,160
of our world yeah you get intuitive i
 

8123
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:25,510
of our world yeah you get intuitive i
follow a little bit of something like

8124
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:25,520
follow a little bit of something like
 

8125
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:27,750
follow a little bit of something like
stephen wolfram's work on i've you know

8126
02:21:27,750 --> 02:21:27,760
stephen wolfram's work on i've you know
 

8127
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:29,750
stephen wolfram's work on i've you know
interconnected network information

8128
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:29,760
interconnected network information
 

8129
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:31,750
interconnected network information
states of that and that's

8130
02:21:31,750 --> 02:21:31,760
states of that and that's
 

8131
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:33,990
states of that and that's
it's beyond what i can have an informed

8132
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:34,000
it's beyond what i can have an informed
 

8133
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,389
it's beyond what i can have an informed
opinion on but it's interesting that

8134
02:21:36,389 --> 02:21:36,399
opinion on but it's interesting that
 

8135
02:21:36,399 --> 02:21:38,550
opinion on but it's interesting that
people are considering things like that

8136
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:38,560
people are considering things like that
 

8137
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:40,710
people are considering things like that
and have uh and have things that can

8138
02:21:40,710 --> 02:21:40,720
and have uh and have things that can
 

8139
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:43,190
and have uh and have things that can
back it up yeah that's yeah there's

8140
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,200
back it up yeah that's yeah there's
 

8141
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,710
back it up yeah that's yeah there's
whole different sets of interesting

8142
02:21:44,710 --> 02:21:44,720
whole different sets of interesting
 

8143
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:47,510
whole different sets of interesting
stuff there so wolfenstein 3d had

8144
02:21:47,510 --> 02:21:47,520
stuff there so wolfenstein 3d had
 

8145
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:49,110
stuff there so wolfenstein 3d had
raycast something raycasting and then

8146
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:49,120
raycast something raycasting and then
 

8147
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:51,910
raycast something raycasting and then
the other kind of key aspect was what i

8148
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:51,920
the other kind of key aspect was what i
 

8149
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:55,429
the other kind of key aspect was what i
called compiled scalars where the idea

8150
02:21:55,429 --> 02:21:55,439
called compiled scalars where the idea
 

8151
02:21:55,439 --> 02:21:57,190
called compiled scalars where the idea
of

8152
02:21:57,190 --> 02:21:57,200

even for that so you would have the most

8270
02:23:48,790 --> 02:23:48,800
even for that so you would have the most
 

8271
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:51,349
even for that so you would have the most
optimized code so that in the normal

8272
02:23:51,349 --> 02:23:51,359
optimized code so that in the normal
 

8273
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:52,870
optimized code so that in the normal
case where

8274
02:23:52,870 --> 02:23:52,880
case where
 

8275
02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:55,510
case where
most of the world is fairly large i like

8276
02:23:55,510 --> 02:23:55,520
most of the world is fairly large i like
 

8277
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:57,270
most of the world is fairly large i like
the pixels are big you know we did not

8278
02:23:57,270 --> 02:23:57,280
the pixels are big you know we did not
 

8279
02:23:57,280 --> 02:24:00,070
the pixels are big you know we did not
have a lot of memory so in most cases

8280
02:24:00,070 --> 02:24:00,080
have a lot of memory so in most cases
 

8281
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:01,990
have a lot of memory so in most cases
that meant that you would load a pixel

8282
02:24:01,990 --> 02:24:02,000
that meant that you would load a pixel
 

8283
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,670
that meant that you would load a pixel
color and then you would store it

8284
02:24:03,670 --> 02:24:03,680
color and then you would store it
 

8285
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:05,190
color and then you would store it
multiple times

8286
02:24:05,190 --> 02:24:05,200
multiple times
 

8287
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:05,990
multiple times
so

8288
02:24:05,990 --> 02:24:06,000
so
 

8289
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,469
so
that was faster than even copying an

8290
02:24:08,469 --> 02:24:08,479
that was faster than even copying an
 

8291
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:10,630
that was faster than even copying an
image in a normal conventional case

8292
02:24:10,630 --> 02:24:10,640
image in a normal conventional case
 

8293
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:12,230
image in a normal conventional case
because most the time the image is

8294
02:24:12,230 --> 02:24:12,240
because most the time the image is
 

8295
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:14,550
because most the time the image is
expanded so instead of doing one read

8296
02:24:14,550 --> 02:24:14,560
expanded so instead of doing one read
 

8297
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:16,950
expanded so instead of doing one read
one write for a simple copy you might be

8298
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:16,960
one write for a simple copy you might be
 

8299
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:19,030
one write for a simple copy you might be
doing one read and three or four writes

8300
02:24:19,030 --> 02:24:19,040
doing one read and three or four writes
 

8301
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:21,190
doing one read and three or four writes
as it got really big and that had the

02:24:21,190 --> 02:24:21,200
as it got really big and that had the
 

8303
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,870

beneficial aspect of just when you

02:24:24,630 --> 02:24:24,640
needed the performance most when things
 

8307
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:26,389
needed the performance most when things

02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:31,270
you the most acceleration for that by
the way were you able to uh

8312
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:31,280
the way were you able to uh
 

8313
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:33,510
the way were you able to uh
understand this through thinking about

8314
02:24:33,510 --> 02:24:33,520
understand this through thinking about
 

8315
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:35,270
understand this through thinking about
it or were you testing like the right

8316
02:24:35,270 --> 02:24:35,280
it or were you testing like the right
 

8317
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:38,230
it or were you testing like the right
speed and like this again comes back to

8318
02:24:38,230 --> 02:24:38,240
speed and like this again comes back to
 

8319
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:40,550
speed and like this again comes back to
i can find the antecedents for things

8320
02:24:40,550 --> 02:24:40,560
i can find the antecedents for things
 

8321
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:42,790
i can find the antecedents for things
like this so in i'm

8322
02:24:42,790 --> 02:24:42,800
like this so in i'm
 

8323
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,429
like this so in i'm

graphics were

8326
02:24:47,190 --> 02:24:47,200
graphics were
 

8327
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:49,910
graphics were
essentially single bits at a time and if

8328
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:49,920
essentially single bits at a time and if
 

8329
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,670
essentially single bits at a time and if
you wanted to make your little spaceship

8330
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:51,680
you wanted to make your little spaceship
 

8331
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:53,590
you wanted to make your little spaceship
if you wanted to make it smoothly go

8332
02:24:53,590 --> 02:24:53,600
if you wanted to make it smoothly go
 

8333
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:55,590
if you wanted to make it smoothly go
across the world if you just took the

8334
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:55,600
across the world if you just took the
 

8335
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:57,030
across the world if you just took the
image and you drew it out at the next

8336
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:57,040
image and you drew it out at the next
 

8337
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,270
image and you drew it out at the next
location you would move by seven pixels

8338
02:24:59,270 --> 02:24:59,280
location you would move by seven pixels
 

8339
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:01,349
location you would move by seven pixels
at a time so it would go chunk chunk if

8340
02:25:01,349 --> 02:25:01,359
at a time so it would go chunk chunk if
 

8341
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:03,349
at a time so it would go chunk chunk if
you wanted to make it move smoothly you

8342
02:25:03,349 --> 02:25:03,359
you wanted to make it move smoothly you
 

8343
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:05,110
you wanted to make it move smoothly you
actually had to make seven versions of

8344
02:25:05,110 --> 02:25:05,120
actually had to make seven versions of
 

8345
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:07,510
actually had to make seven versions of
the ship that were pre-shifted you could

8346
02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:07,520
the ship that were pre-shifted you could
 

8347
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:09,110
the ship that were pre-shifted you could
write a program that would shift it

8348
02:25:09,110 --> 02:25:09,120
write a program that would shift it
 

8349
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,870
write a program that would shift it
dynamically but on a one megahertz

8350
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:10,880
dynamically but on a one megahertz
 

8351
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:13,030
dynamically but on a one megahertz
processor that's not going anywhere fast

8352
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:13,040
processor that's not going anywhere fast
 

8353
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:15,190
processor that's not going anywhere fast
so if you wanted to do a smooth moving

8354
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:15,200
so if you wanted to do a smooth moving
 

8355
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:17,510
so if you wanted to do a smooth moving
fast action game you made separate

8356
02:25:17,510 --> 02:25:17,520
fast action game you made separate
 

8357
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:20,469
fast action game you made separate
versions of each of these uh sprites now

8358
02:25:20,469 --> 02:25:20,479
versions of each of these uh sprites now
 

8359
02:25:20,479 --> 02:25:21,910
versions of each of these uh sprites now
there were a few more tricks you could

8360
02:25:21,910 --> 02:25:21,920
there were a few more tricks you could
 

8361
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:24,309
there were a few more tricks you could
pull that if it still wasn't fast enough

8362
02:25:24,309 --> 02:25:24,319
pull that if it still wasn't fast enough
 

8363
02:25:24,319 --> 02:25:27,429
pull that if it still wasn't fast enough
you could make a compiled shape where

8364
02:25:27,429 --> 02:25:27,439
you could make a compiled shape where
 

8365
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:30,070
you could make a compiled shape where
instead of this program that normally

8366
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:30,080
instead of this program that normally
 

8367
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,469
instead of this program that normally
copies an image and says like get this

8368
02:25:32,469 --> 02:25:32,479
copies an image and says like get this
 

8369
02:25:32,479 --> 02:25:33,990
copies an image and says like get this
byte from here store it here get this

8370
02:25:33,990 --> 02:25:34,000
byte from here store it here get this
 

8371
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,230
byte from here store it here get this
byte store this bite if you've got the

8372
02:25:36,230 --> 02:25:36,240
byte store this bite if you've got the
 

8373
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:38,790
byte store this bite if you've got the
memory space you could say i'm going to

8374
02:25:38,790 --> 02:25:38,800
memory space you could say i'm going to
 

8375
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:40,630
memory space you could say i'm going to
write the program that does nothing but

8376
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:40,640
write the program that does nothing but
 

8377
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:42,950
write the program that does nothing but
draw this shape it's going to be like

8378
02:25:42,950 --> 02:25:42,960
draw this shape it's going to be like
 

8379
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:46,309
draw this shape it's going to be like
i'm going to load the immediate value 25

8380
02:25:46,309 --> 02:25:46,319
i'm going to load the immediate value 25
 

8381
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:47,910
i'm going to load the immediate value 25
you know which is some bit pattern and

8382
02:25:47,910 --> 02:25:47,920
you know which is some bit pattern and
 

8383
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:49,830
you know which is some bit pattern and
then i'm going to store that at this

8384
02:25:49,830 --> 02:25:49,840
then i'm going to store that at this
 

8385
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:52,070
then i'm going to store that at this
location uh rather than loading

8386
02:25:52,070 --> 02:25:52,080
location uh rather than loading
 

8387
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:54,150
location uh rather than loading
something from memory that involved

8388
02:25:54,150 --> 02:25:54,160
something from memory that involved
 

8389
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:56,150
something from memory that involved
indexing registers and this other slow

8390
02:25:56,150 --> 02:25:56,160
indexing registers and this other slow
 

8391
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:57,990
indexing registers and this other slow
stuff you could go ahead and say no i'm

8392
02:25:57,990 --> 02:25:58,000
stuff you could go ahead and say no i'm
 

8393
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,990
stuff you could go ahead and say no i'm
going to hard code the exact values of

8394
02:25:59,990 --> 02:26:00,000
going to hard code the exact values of
 

8395
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,150
going to hard code the exact values of
all of the image right into the program

8396
02:26:02,150 --> 02:26:02,160
all of the image right into the program
 

8397
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:03,750
all of the image right into the program
now this was always a horrible trade-off

8398
02:26:03,750 --> 02:26:03,760
now this was always a horrible trade-off
 

8399
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:05,270
now this was always a horrible trade-off
there but you didn't have much memory

8400
02:26:05,270 --> 02:26:05,280
there but you didn't have much memory
 

8401
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:07,110
there but you didn't have much memory
and you didn't have much speed but if

8402
02:26:07,110 --> 02:26:07,120
and you didn't have much speed but if
 

8403
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:08,550
and you didn't have much speed but if
you had something that you wanted to go

8404
02:26:08,550 --> 02:26:08,560
you had something that you wanted to go
 

8405
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:10,630
you had something that you wanted to go
really fast you could turn it into a

8406
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:10,640
really fast you could turn it into a
 

8407
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:11,670
really fast you could turn it into a
program

8408
02:26:11,670 --> 02:26:11,680
program
 

8409
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:13,910
program
and that was you know knowing about that

8410
02:26:13,910 --> 02:26:13,920
and that was you know knowing about that
 

8411
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:15,830
and that was you know knowing about that
technique is what made me think about

8412
02:26:15,830 --> 02:26:15,840
technique is what made me think about
 

8413
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:18,469
technique is what made me think about
some of these unwinding it for the pc

8414
02:26:18,469 --> 02:26:18,479
some of these unwinding it for the pc
 

8415
02:26:18,479 --> 02:26:19,990
some of these unwinding it for the pc
where people that didn't come from that

8416
02:26:19,990 --> 02:26:20,000
where people that didn't come from that
 

8417
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,070
where people that didn't come from that
background were less likely to think

8418
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:22,080
background were less likely to think
 

8419
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,270
background were less likely to think
about that

8420
02:26:23,270 --> 02:26:23,280
about that
 

8421
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:25,110
about that
i mean there's some deep parallels

8422
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:25,120
i mean there's some deep parallels
 

8423
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:27,349
i mean there's some deep parallels
probably to human cognition as well

8424
02:26:27,349 --> 02:26:27,359
probably to human cognition as well
 

8425
02:26:27,359 --> 02:26:30,630
probably to human cognition as well
there's something about

8426
02:26:30,630 --> 02:26:30,640

 

8427
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:34,389

optimizing and compressing

the the processing of a new information

8430
02:26:36,630 --> 02:26:36,640
the the processing of a new information
 

8431
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:38,469
the the processing of a new information
that requires you to predict the

8432
02:26:38,469 --> 02:26:38,479
that requires you to predict the
 

8433
02:26:38,479 --> 02:26:41,030
that requires you to predict the
possible ways in which

8434
02:26:41,030 --> 02:26:41,040
possible ways in which
 

8435
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:44,389
possible ways in which
the game or the world might unroll and

8436
02:26:44,389 --> 02:26:44,399
the game or the world might unroll and
 

8437
02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:46,389
the game or the world might unroll and
you have something like compiled scalars

8438
02:26:46,389 --> 02:26:46,399
you have something like compiled scalars
 

8439
02:26:46,399 --> 02:26:50,070
you have something like compiled scalars
always there so if you have like optima

8440
02:26:50,070 --> 02:26:50,080
always there so if you have like optima
 

8441
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:51,670
always there so if you have like optima
like you have a prediction of how the

8442
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:51,680
like you have a prediction of how the
 

8443
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:53,670
like you have a prediction of how the
world will unroll and you have some kind

8444
02:26:53,670 --> 02:26:53,680
world will unroll and you have some kind
 

8445
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:56,150
world will unroll and you have some kind
of optimized

data structure for that prediction and
 

8449
02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:00,150
data structure for that prediction and
then you can modify if the world turns

8450
02:27:00,150 --> 02:27:00,160
then you can modify if the world turns
 

8451
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:01,670
then you can modify if the world turns
out to be different you can modify a

02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:03,270
out to be different you can modify a
slight way as far as building out

techniques so much of the brain is about
 

8457
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:07,670
techniques so much of the brain is about
the associative context you know they're

the associative context you know they're
 

8459
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:09,270
the associative context you know they're
just when you learn something it's in

just when you learn something it's in
the context of something else and you

8462
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:11,120
the context of something else and you
 

8463
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:13,510
the context of something else and you
can have faint tiny little hints of

deep things uh you know around like

8468
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:16,880
deep things uh you know around like
 

8469
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:18,710
deep things uh you know around like
sparse distributed memories and boosting

8470
02:27:18,710 --> 02:27:18,720
sparse distributed memories and boosting
 

8471
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:20,230
sparse distributed memories and boosting
that's like if you can just be slightly

8472
02:27:20,230 --> 02:27:20,240
that's like if you can just be slightly
 

8473
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:22,150
that's like if you can just be slightly
above the noise floor of having some

8474
02:27:22,150 --> 02:27:22,160
above the noise floor of having some
 

8475
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,070
above the noise floor of having some
hint of something you can have things

8476
02:27:24,070 --> 02:27:24,080
hint of something you can have things
 

8477
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:26,389
hint of something you can have things
refined into pulling the memory back up

8478
02:27:26,389 --> 02:27:26,399
refined into pulling the memory back up
 

8479
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:28,389
refined into pulling the memory back up
so having a being a programmer and

8480
02:27:28,389 --> 02:27:28,399
so having a being a programmer and
 

8481
02:27:28,399 --> 02:27:30,309
so having a being a programmer and
having a toolbox of like all of these

8482
02:27:30,309 --> 02:27:30,319
having a toolbox of like all of these
 

8483
02:27:30,319 --> 02:27:32,309
having a toolbox of like all of these
things that things that i did in all of

8484
02:27:32,309 --> 02:27:32,319
things that things that i did in all of
 

8485
02:27:32,319 --> 02:27:34,150
things that things that i did in all of
these previous lives of programming

8486
02:27:34,150 --> 02:27:34,160
these previous lives of programming
 

8487
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:36,630
these previous lives of programming
tasks that still matters to me about how

8488
02:27:36,630 --> 02:27:36,640
tasks that still matters to me about how
 

8489
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:38,389
tasks that still matters to me about how
i'm able to pull up some of these things

8490
02:27:38,389 --> 02:27:38,399
i'm able to pull up some of these things
 

8491
02:27:38,399 --> 02:27:40,230
i'm able to pull up some of these things
like in that case it was something i did

8492
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:40,240
like in that case it was something i did
 

8493
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:42,070
like in that case it was something i did
on the apple 2 then being relevant for

8494
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:42,080
on the apple 2 then being relevant for
 

8495
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:45,349
on the apple 2 then being relevant for
the pc and i have still cases when i

8496
02:27:45,349 --> 02:27:45,359
the pc and i have still cases when i
 

8497
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:46,950
the pc and i have still cases when i
would when i would work on mobile

8498
02:27:46,950 --> 02:27:46,960
would when i would work on mobile
 

8499
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:49,030
would when i would work on mobile
development then be like okay i did

8500
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:49,040
development then be like okay i did
 

8501
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:51,270
development then be like okay i did
something like this back in the the doom

8502
02:27:51,270 --> 02:27:51,280
something like this back in the the doom
 

8503
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:52,630
something like this back in the the doom
days but now it's a different

8504
02:27:52,630 --> 02:27:52,640
days but now it's a different
 

8505
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:54,550
days but now it's a different
environment but i have still had that

8506
02:27:54,550 --> 02:27:54,560
environment but i have still had that
 

8507
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:56,070
environment but i have still had that
tie i can bring it in and i can

8508
02:27:56,070 --> 02:27:56,080
tie i can bring it in and i can
 

8509
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:57,750
tie i can bring it in and i can
transform it into what the world needs

8510
02:27:57,750 --> 02:27:57,760
transform it into what the world needs
 

8511
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:58,950
transform it into what the world needs
right now

8512
02:27:58,950 --> 02:27:58,960
right now
 

8513
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:00,550
right now
and i i do think that's actually one of

8514
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:00,560
and i i do think that's actually one of
 

8515
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:02,469
and i i do think that's actually one of
the very core things with human

8516
02:28:02,469 --> 02:28:02,479
the very core things with human
 

8517
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:04,790
the very core things with human
cognition and brain like i you know

8518
02:28:04,790 --> 02:28:04,800
cognition and brain like i you know
 

8519
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:07,110
cognition and brain like i you know
brain like functioning is finding these

8520
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:07,120
brain like functioning is finding these
 

8521
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:09,030
brain like functioning is finding these
ways about you've got your brain is kind

8522
02:28:09,030 --> 02:28:09,040
ways about you've got your brain is kind
 

8523
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:10,710
ways about you've got your brain is kind

know it's it is just a set of all of
 

8527
02:28:12,479 --> 02:28:14,469
know it's it is just a set of all of

this stuff that is just fetched back by
 

8529
02:28:14,479 --> 02:28:16,710
this stuff that is just fetched back by
these queries that go into it and they

these queries that go into it and they
 

8531
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:18,469
these queries that go into it and they
can just be slightly above the noise

02:28:18,479 --> 02:28:20,309
can just be slightly above the noise
floor with random noise in your neurons

what gets pulled up so you're saying

8538
02:28:24,469 --> 02:28:24,479
what gets pulled up so you're saying
 

8539
02:28:24,479 --> 02:28:26,389
what gets pulled up so you're saying
some of these very specific solutions

8540
02:28:26,389 --> 02:28:26,399
some of these very specific solutions
 

8541
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:28,469
some of these very specific solutions
for different games

for different games
 

8543
02:28:28,479 --> 02:28:31,429

you find that there's a kernel of a deep

8544
02:28:31,429 --> 02:28:31,439
you find that there's a kernel of a deep
 

8545

02:28:35,510 --> 02:28:35,520
to other things yeah you can't predict
 

8549
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:37,429
to other things yeah you can't predict
what it's going to be but that idea of

8550
02:28:37,429 --> 02:28:37,439
what it's going to be but that idea of
 

8551
02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:39,590
what it's going to be but that idea of
like i called out that compiled shaders

8552
02:28:39,590 --> 02:28:39,600
like i called out that compiled shaders
 

8553
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:41,429
like i called out that compiled shaders
uh in the forward that i wrote for that

8554
02:28:41,429 --> 02:28:41,439
uh in the forward that i wrote for that
 

8555
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:43,750
uh in the forward that i wrote for that
uh the game engine black book as you

8556
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:43,760
uh the game engine black book as you
 

8557
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:46,550
uh the game engine black book as you
know this is it's kind of an endpoint of

8558
02:28:46,550 --> 02:28:46,560
know this is it's kind of an endpoint of
 

8559
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:48,950
know this is it's kind of an endpoint of
unrolling code but that's one of those

8560
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:48,960
unrolling code but that's one of those
 

8561
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:50,389
unrolling code but that's one of those
things that thinking about that and

8562
02:28:50,389 --> 02:28:50,399
things that thinking about that and
 

8563
02:28:50,399 --> 02:28:51,910
things that thinking about that and
having that in your mind and i'm sure

8564
02:28:51,910 --> 02:28:51,920
having that in your mind and i'm sure
 

8565
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:53,510
having that in your mind and i'm sure
there are some programmers that you know

8566
02:28:53,510 --> 02:28:53,520
there are some programmers that you know
 

8567
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:55,190
there are some programmers that you know
hear about that think about it a little

8568
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:55,200
hear about that think about it a little
 

8569
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:56,950
hear about that think about it a little
bit it's kind of the mind-blown moment

8570
02:28:56,950 --> 02:28:56,960
bit it's kind of the mind-blown moment
 

8571
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:58,790
bit it's kind of the mind-blown moment
it's like oh you can just turn all of

8572
02:28:58,790 --> 02:28:58,800
it's like oh you can just turn all of
 

8573
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:01,510
it's like oh you can just turn all of
that data into code and nowadays you

8574
02:29:01,510 --> 02:29:01,520
that data into code and nowadays you
 

8575
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:03,190
that data into code and nowadays you
know you have instruction cache issues

8576
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:03,200
know you have instruction cache issues
 

8577
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:05,429
know you have instruction cache issues
and that's not necessarily the best idea

8578
02:29:05,429 --> 02:29:05,439
and that's not necessarily the best idea
 

8579
02:29:05,439 --> 02:29:07,110
and that's not necessarily the best idea
but there are different

8580
02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:07,120
but there are different
 

8581
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:09,590
but there are different
it's an idea that has power and has

8582
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:09,600
it's an idea that has power and has
 

8583
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:11,349
it's an idea that has power and has
probably relevance in some other areas

8584
02:29:11,349 --> 02:29:11,359
probably relevance in some other areas
 

8585
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:12,950
probably relevance in some other areas
maybe it's in a hardware point of view

8586
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:12,960
maybe it's in a hardware point of view
 

8587
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:14,710
maybe it's in a hardware point of view
that there's a way you approach building

8588
02:29:14,710 --> 02:29:14,720
that there's a way you approach building
 

8589
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:16,950
that there's a way you approach building
hardware that has that same you don't

8590
02:29:16,950 --> 02:29:16,960
hardware that has that same you don't
 

8591
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:18,469
hardware that has that same you don't
even have to think about iterating you

8592
02:29:18,469 --> 02:29:18,479
even have to think about iterating you
 

8593
02:29:18,479 --> 02:29:20,630
even have to think about iterating you
just bake everything all the way into it

8594
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:20,640
just bake everything all the way into it
 

8595
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:23,270
just bake everything all the way into it
in one place what is the story of how

8596
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:23,280
in one place what is the story of how
 

8597
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:25,429
in one place what is the story of how
you came to program doom

8598
02:29:25,429 --> 02:29:25,439
you came to program doom
 

8599
02:29:25,439 --> 02:29:27,110
you came to program doom
what are some memorable technical

8600
02:29:27,110 --> 02:29:27,120
what are some memorable technical
 

8601
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:28,870
what are some memorable technical
challenges or innovations within that

8602
02:29:28,870 --> 02:29:28,880
challenges or innovations within that
 

8603
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:29,670
challenges or innovations within that
game

8604
02:29:29,670 --> 02:29:29,680
game
 

8605
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:32,070
game
so the path that we went after

8606
02:29:32,070 --> 02:29:32,080
so the path that we went after
 

8607
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:34,309
so the path that we went after
after wolfenstein got out and we were on

8608
02:29:34,309 --> 02:29:34,319
after wolfenstein got out and we were on
 

8609
02:29:34,319 --> 02:29:36,550
after wolfenstein got out and we were on
this crazy arc where keen one through

8610
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:36,560
this crazy arc where keen one through
 

8611
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:37,349
this crazy arc where keen one through
three

8612
02:29:37,349 --> 02:29:37,359
three
 

8613
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:39,190
three
more success than we thought king four

8614
02:29:39,190 --> 02:29:39,200
more success than we thought king four
 

8615
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:40,950
more success than we thought king four
through six even more success

8616
02:29:40,950 --> 02:29:40,960
through six even more success
 

8617
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:43,190
through six even more success
wolfenstein even more success so we were

8618
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:43,200
wolfenstein even more success so we were
 

8619
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:46,230
wolfenstein even more success so we were
on this this crazy trajectory for things

8620
02:29:46,230 --> 02:29:46,240
on this this crazy trajectory for things
 

8621
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:47,670
on this this crazy trajectory for things
so actually our first box commercial

8622
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:47,680
so actually our first box commercial
 

8623
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:50,469
so actually our first box commercial
project was the commander keen i am game

8624
02:29:50,469 --> 02:29:50,479
project was the commander keen i am game
 

8625
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:52,389
project was the commander keen i am game
but then wolfenstein was going to have a

8626
02:29:52,389 --> 02:29:52,399
but then wolfenstein was going to have a
 

8627
02:29:52,399 --> 02:29:54,870
but then wolfenstein was going to have a
game called spear of destiny which was a

8628
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:54,880
game called spear of destiny which was a
 

8629
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:57,750
game called spear of destiny which was a
commercial version 60 new levels so the

8630
02:29:57,750 --> 02:29:57,760
commercial version 60 new levels so the
 

8631
02:29:57,760 --> 02:29:59,349
commercial version 60 new levels so the
rest of the team took the game engine

8632
02:29:59,349 --> 02:29:59,359
rest of the team took the game engine
 

8633
02:29:59,359 --> 02:30:01,830
rest of the team took the game engine
pretty much as it was and started

8634
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:01,840
pretty much as it was and started
 

8635
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:04,389
pretty much as it was and started
working on that we got new monsters but

8636
02:30:04,389 --> 02:30:04,399
working on that we got new monsters but
 

8637
02:30:04,399 --> 02:30:05,270
working on that we got new monsters but
it's

8638
02:30:05,270 --> 02:30:05,280
it's
 

8639
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,429
it's
basically reskins of the things there

8640
02:30:07,429 --> 02:30:07,439
basically reskins of the things there
 

8641
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:08,870
basically reskins of the things there
and there's a really interesting aspect

8642
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:08,880
and there's a really interesting aspect
 

8643
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:10,389
and there's a really interesting aspect
about that that i didn't appreciate

8644
02:30:10,389 --> 02:30:10,399
about that that i didn't appreciate
 

8645
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:13,270
about that that i didn't appreciate
until much much later about how

8646
02:30:13,270 --> 02:30:13,280
until much much later about how
 

8647
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:16,150
until much much later about how
wolfenstein clearly did tap out its

do something crazy and different but it
 

8683
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:53,349
do something crazy and different but it
didn't take that much more capability to

02:30:53,349 --> 02:30:53,359
didn't take that much more capability to
 

8685
02:30:53,359 --> 02:30:55,670
didn't take that much more capability to

02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:07,830
completely tapped out the creativity how
did you how did you put it touring

8698
02:31:07,830 --> 02:31:07,840
did you how did you put it touring
 

8699
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,670
did you how did you put it touring
complete yeah i turned complete design

8700
02:31:09,670 --> 02:31:09,680
complete yeah i turned complete design
 

8701
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:11,030
complete yeah i turned complete design
space designs

8702
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:11,040
space designs
 

8703
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:12,469
space designs
like you know we have the kind of

8704
02:31:12,469 --> 02:31:12,479
like you know we have the kind of
 

8705
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:15,270
like you know we have the kind of

8708
02:31:17,349 --> 02:31:17,359
things and how difficult for creativity
 

8709
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:19,830
things and how difficult for creativity
but yeah there's things where a box can

8710
02:31:19,830 --> 02:31:19,840
but yeah there's things where a box can
 

8711
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:22,710
but yeah there's things where a box can
be too small but above a certain point

8712
02:31:22,710 --> 02:31:22,720
be too small but above a certain point
 

8713
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:24,790
be too small but above a certain point
you kind of are at the point where

8714
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:24,800
you kind of are at the point where
 

8715
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:27,030
you kind of are at the point where
you you really have almost unbounded

8716
02:31:27,030 --> 02:31:27,040
you you really have almost unbounded
 

8717
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:29,110
you you really have almost unbounded
creative ability there and doom is the

8718
02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:29,120
creative ability there and doom is the
 

8719
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:31,590
creative ability there and doom is the
first time you cross that line yeah

8720
02:31:31,590 --> 02:31:31,600
first time you cross that line yeah
 

8721
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:33,110
first time you cross that line yeah
where there were

8722
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:33,120
where there were
 

8723
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:35,110
where there were
thousands of doom levels created and

8724
02:31:35,110 --> 02:31:35,120
thousands of doom levels created and
 

8725
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:36,630
thousands of doom levels created and
some of them still have something new

8726
02:31:36,630 --> 02:31:36,640
some of them still have something new
 

8727
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:37,990
some of them still have something new
and interesting to say to the world

8728
02:31:37,990 --> 02:31:38,000
and interesting to say to the world
 

8729
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,550
and interesting to say to the world
about it is that line

8730
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:40,560
about it is that line
 

8731
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:43,349
about it is that line
can you introspect what that line was is

8732
02:31:43,349 --> 02:31:43,359
can you introspect what that line was is
 

8733
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:45,349
can you introspect what that line was is
in the design space is it something

8734
02:31:45,349 --> 02:31:45,359
in the design space is it something
 

8735
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:47,270
in the design space is it something
about the programming

8736
02:31:47,270 --> 02:31:47,280
about the programming
 

8737
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,030
about the programming
uh capabilities that you were able to

8738
02:31:49,030 --> 02:31:49,040
uh capabilities that you were able to
 

8739
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:50,870
uh capabilities that you were able to
add to the game

8740
02:31:50,870 --> 02:31:50,880
add to the game
 

8741
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:53,990
add to the game
so the graphics fidelity was a necessary

8742
02:31:53,990 --> 02:31:54,000
so the graphics fidelity was a necessary
 

8743
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,070
so the graphics fidelity was a necessary
part because the block limitations in

8744
02:31:56,070 --> 02:31:56,080
part because the block limitations in
 

8745
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:59,190
part because the block limitations in
wolfenstein uh what we had right there

8746
02:31:59,190 --> 02:31:59,200
wolfenstein uh what we had right there
 

8747
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:01,270
wolfenstein uh what we had right there
was uh was not enough the full-scale

8748
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:01,280
was uh was not enough the full-scale
 

8749
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:04,230
was uh was not enough the full-scale
blocks although minecraft i really did

8750
02:32:04,230 --> 02:32:04,240
blocks although minecraft i really did
 

8751
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:07,030
blocks although minecraft i really did
show that perhaps blocks uh stacked in

8752
02:32:07,030 --> 02:32:07,040
show that perhaps blocks uh stacked in
 

8753
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:09,750
show that perhaps blocks uh stacked in
3d and at one quarter the scale of that

8754
02:32:09,750 --> 02:32:09,760
3d and at one quarter the scale of that
 

8755
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:11,670
3d and at one quarter the scale of that
or one-eighth in volume is then

8756
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:11,680
or one-eighth in volume is then
 

8757
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:13,910
or one-eighth in volume is then
sufficient to have all of that but the

8758
02:32:13,910 --> 02:32:13,920
sufficient to have all of that but the
 

8759
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:15,990
sufficient to have all of that but the
the wall-sized blocks that we had in

8760
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:16,000
the wall-sized blocks that we had in
 

8761
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,830
the wall-sized blocks that we had in
wolfenstein was too much of a creative

8762
02:32:17,830 --> 02:32:17,840
wolfenstein was too much of a creative
 

8763
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:19,270
wolfenstein was too much of a creative
limitation you know we licensed the

8764
02:32:19,270 --> 02:32:19,280
limitation you know we licensed the
 

8765
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:21,830

8771
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:28,389

creative ability but a little bit more

8772
02:32:28,389 --> 02:32:28,399
creative ability but a little bit more
 

8773
02:32:28,399 --> 02:32:30,309
creative ability but a little bit more
whether it was the variable floors and

8774
02:32:30,309 --> 02:32:30,319
whether it was the variable floors and
 

8775
02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:33,429
whether it was the variable floors and

02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:38,550

02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:40,550
minecraft is then enough to open it up
to to just worlds and worlds of new

8782
02:32:40,550 --> 02:32:40,560
to to just worlds and worlds of new
 

8783
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:43,190
to to just worlds and worlds of new
capabilities what is binary space

8784
02:32:43,190 --> 02:32:43,200
capabilities what is binary space
 

8785
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:44,950
capabilities what is binary space
partitioning

8786
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:44,960
partitioning
 

8787
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:47,429
partitioning
so these are one one of the technologies

8788
02:32:47,429 --> 02:32:47,439
so these are one one of the technologies
 

8789
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:49,429
so these are one one of the technologies
yeah so jump around a little bit on the

8790
02:32:49,429 --> 02:32:49,439
yeah so jump around a little bit on the
 

8791
02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:51,429
yeah so jump around a little bit on the
on the story path there yes so while the

8792
02:32:51,429 --> 02:32:51,439
on the story path there yes so while the
 

8793
02:32:51,439 --> 02:32:53,190
on the story path there yes so while the
team was working on spirit destiny for

8794
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:53,200
team was working on spirit destiny for
 

8795
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:55,990
team was working on spirit destiny for
wolfenstein yes i am i had we had met

8796
02:32:55,990 --> 02:32:56,000
wolfenstein yes i am i had we had met
 

8797
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,150
wolfenstein yes i am i had we had met

while we were in wisconsin

8800
02:32:59,910 --> 02:32:59,920
while we were in wisconsin
 

8801
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:02,469
while we were in wisconsin
and um they were doing they had rpg

8802
02:33:02,469 --> 02:33:02,479
and um they were doing they had rpg
 

8803
02:33:02,479 --> 02:33:04,389
and um they were doing they had rpg
background and i i still kind of loved

8804
02:33:04,389 --> 02:33:04,399
background and i i still kind of loved
 

8805
02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:06,710
background and i i still kind of loved
that and i offered to do a game engine

8806
02:33:06,710 --> 02:33:06,720
that and i offered to do a game engine
 

8807
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:09,270
that and i offered to do a game engine
for for them to let them do a 3d

8808
02:33:09,270 --> 02:33:09,280
for for them to let them do a 3d
 

8809
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:11,750
for for them to let them do a 3d
rendered rpg instead of the

02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:11,760
rendered rpg instead of the
 

8811
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:13,590
rendered rpg instead of the
like most rpg games were kind of hand

8812
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:13,600
like most rpg games were kind of hand
 

8813
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:15,590
like most rpg games were kind of hand
drawn they made it look kind of 3d but

8814
02:33:15,590 --> 02:33:15,600
drawn they made it look kind of 3d but
 

8815
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:17,429
drawn they made it look kind of 3d but
it was done just all with artist work

8816
02:33:17,429 --> 02:33:17,439
it was done just all with artist work
 

8817
02:33:17,439 --> 02:33:19,670
it was done just all with artist work
rather than a real engine

8818
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:19,680
rather than a real engine
 

8819
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:20,550
rather than a real engine
and

8820
02:33:20,550 --> 02:33:20,560
and
 

8821
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:22,389
and
after wolfenstein this was still a

8822
02:33:22,389 --> 02:33:22,399
after wolfenstein this was still a
 

8823
02:33:22,399 --> 02:33:24,150
after wolfenstein this was still a
tile-based world but i added floors and

8824
02:33:24,150 --> 02:33:24,160
tile-based world but i added floors and
 

8825
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:25,830
tile-based world but i added floors and
ceilings and some lighting and the

8826
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:25,840
ceilings and some lighting and the
 

8827
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:27,590
ceilings and some lighting and the
ability to have some sloped floors in

8828
02:33:27,590 --> 02:33:27,600
ability to have some sloped floors in
 

8829
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:29,590
ability to have some sloped floors in
different areas that was my intermediate

8830
02:33:29,590 --> 02:33:29,600
different areas that was my intermediate
 

8831
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:32,230
different areas that was my intermediate
step for a game called shadowcaster

8832
02:33:32,230 --> 02:33:32,240
step for a game called shadowcaster
 

8833
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:35,030
step for a game called shadowcaster
and it had slowed down enough it was not

8834
02:33:35,030 --> 02:33:35,040
and it had slowed down enough it was not
 

8835
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:37,190
and it had slowed down enough it was not
fast enough to do our type of action

8836
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:37,200
fast enough to do our type of action
 

8837
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:38,630
fast enough to do our type of action
things so that they had the screen

8838
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:38,640
things so that they had the screen
 

8839
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:40,550
things so that they had the screen
cropped down a little bit so you

8840
02:33:40,550 --> 02:33:40,560
cropped down a little bit so you
 

8841
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:42,469
cropped down a little bit so you
couldn't go the full screen with like we

8842
02:33:42,469 --> 02:33:42,479
couldn't go the full screen with like we
 

8843
02:33:42,479 --> 02:33:45,510
couldn't go the full screen with like we
would try to do in wolfenstein i am but

8844
02:33:45,510 --> 02:33:45,520
would try to do in wolfenstein i am but
 

8845
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:46,950
would try to do in wolfenstein i am but
i learned a lot i got the floors and

8846
02:33:46,950 --> 02:33:46,960
i learned a lot i got the floors and
 

8847
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:48,309
i learned a lot i got the floors and
ceilings and lightings and it looked

8848
02:33:48,309 --> 02:33:48,319
ceilings and lightings and it looked
 

8849
02:33:48,319 --> 02:33:50,230
ceilings and lightings and it looked
great they were great artists up there

8850
02:33:50,230 --> 02:33:50,240
great they were great artists up there
 

8851
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:52,150
great they were great artists up there
and it was it was an inspiration for us

8852
02:33:52,150 --> 02:33:52,160
and it was it was an inspiration for us
 

8853
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:54,389
and it was it was an inspiration for us
to look at some of that stuff

8854
02:33:54,389 --> 02:33:54,399
to look at some of that stuff
 

8855
02:33:54,399 --> 02:33:57,030
to look at some of that stuff
but i had learned enough from that that

8856
02:33:57,030 --> 02:33:57,040
but i had learned enough from that that
 

8857
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:59,670
but i had learned enough from that that
i had the plan for i knew faster ways to

8858
02:33:59,670 --> 02:33:59,680
i had the plan for i knew faster ways to
 

8859
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:01,590
i had the plan for i knew faster ways to
do the the lighting and shadowing and i

8860
02:34:01,590 --> 02:34:01,600
do the the lighting and shadowing and i
 

8861
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:03,590
do the the lighting and shadowing and i
wanted to do this freeform geometry i

8862
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:03,600
wanted to do this freeform geometry i
 

8863
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:06,469
wanted to do this freeform geometry i
wanted to break out of this tile-based

8864
02:34:06,469 --> 02:34:06,479
wanted to break out of this tile-based
 

8865
02:34:06,479 --> 02:34:09,030
wanted to break out of this tile-based
90 degree world limitations

8866
02:34:09,030 --> 02:34:09,040
90 degree world limitations
 

8867
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:11,510
90 degree world limitations
so we had that was when we got our next

8868
02:34:11,510 --> 02:34:11,520
so we had that was when we got our next
 

8869
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:13,270
so we had that was when we got our next
stations and we were working with these

8870
02:34:13,270 --> 02:34:13,280
stations and we were working with these
 

8871
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:16,389
stations and we were working with these
higher powered systems and i

8872
02:34:16,389 --> 02:34:16,399
higher powered systems and i
 

8873
02:34:16,399 --> 02:34:18,389
higher powered systems and i
we built an editor that let us draw kind

8874
02:34:18,389 --> 02:34:18,399
we built an editor that let us draw kind
 

8875
02:34:18,399 --> 02:34:20,630
we built an editor that let us draw kind
of arbitrary line segments and i was

8876
02:34:20,630 --> 02:34:20,640
of arbitrary line segments and i was
 

8877
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:22,630
of arbitrary line segments and i was
working hard to try to make something

8878
02:34:22,630 --> 02:34:22,640
working hard to try to make something
 

8879
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:25,030
working hard to try to make something
that could render this fast enough

8880
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,040
that could render this fast enough
 

8881
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,270
that could render this fast enough
um you know i was pushing myself pretty

8882
02:34:27,270 --> 02:34:27,280
um you know i was pushing myself pretty
 

8883
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:28,630
um you know i was pushing myself pretty
hard i

8884
02:34:28,630 --> 02:34:28,640
hard i
 

8885
02:34:28,640 --> 02:34:31,030
hard i
and we were we were at a point where we

8886
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:31,040
and we were we were at a point where we
 

8887
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:32,550
and we were we were at a point where we
could see some things that looked

8888
02:34:32,550 --> 02:34:32,560
could see some things that looked
 

8889
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:34,870
could see some things that looked
amazingly cool but it wasn't really fast

8890
02:34:34,870 --> 02:34:34,880
amazingly cool but it wasn't really fast
 

8891
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:37,750
amazingly cool but it wasn't really fast
enough for the way i was doing it i for

8892
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:37,760
enough for the way i was doing it i for
 

8893
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:39,429
enough for the way i was doing it i for
this flexibility it was no longer i

8894
02:34:39,429 --> 02:34:39,439
this flexibility it was no longer i
 

8895
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:41,349
this flexibility it was no longer i
couldn't just raycast into it and i had

8896
02:34:41,349 --> 02:34:41,359
couldn't just raycast into it and i had
 

8897
02:34:41,359 --> 02:34:43,590
couldn't just raycast into it and i had
these very complex sets of lines and

8898
02:34:43,590 --> 02:34:43,600
these very complex sets of lines and
 

8899
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:45,590
these very complex sets of lines and
simple little worlds were okay but the

8900
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:45,600
simple little worlds were okay but the
 

8901
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:47,590
simple little worlds were okay but the
cool things that we wanted to do just

8902
02:34:47,590 --> 02:34:47,600
cool things that we wanted to do just
 

8903
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:49,590
cool things that we wanted to do just
weren't quite fast enough

8904
02:34:49,590 --> 02:34:49,600
weren't quite fast enough
 

8905
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,990
weren't quite fast enough
and i wound up taking a break at that

8906
02:34:51,990 --> 02:34:52,000
and i wound up taking a break at that
 

8907
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,950
and i wound up taking a break at that
point and i did the the port i did two

8908
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:54,960
point and i did the the port i did two
 

8909
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:56,469
point and i did the the port i did two
ports of

8910
02:34:56,469 --> 02:34:56,479
ports of
 

8911
02:34:56,479 --> 02:34:59,990
ports of
our games uh wolfenstein to the uh to

8912
02:34:59,990 --> 02:35:00,000
our games uh wolfenstein to the uh to
 

8913
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,230
our games uh wolfenstein to the uh to
the super nintendo it was uh it was a

8914
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:02,240
the super nintendo it was uh it was a
 

8915
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:04,389
the super nintendo it was uh it was a
crazy difficult thing to to do which was

8916
02:35:04,389 --> 02:35:04,399
crazy difficult thing to to do which was
 

8917
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:07,190
crazy difficult thing to to do which was
an even slower processor it's like two i

8918
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:07,200
an even slower processor it's like two i
 

8919
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:09,910
an even slower processor it's like two i
couple megahertz uh processor

8920
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:09,920
couple megahertz uh processor
 

8921
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:11,830
couple megahertz uh processor
and it had been this whole thing where

8922
02:35:11,830 --> 02:35:11,840
and it had been this whole thing where
 

8923
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:14,790
and it had been this whole thing where
we had farmed out the i am

8924
02:35:14,790 --> 02:35:14,800
we had farmed out the i am
 

8925
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:16,710
we had farmed out the i am
the work and it wasn't it wasn't going

8926
02:35:16,710 --> 02:35:16,720
the work and it wasn't it wasn't going
 

8927
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:18,790
the work and it wasn't it wasn't going
well and i took it back over

8928
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:18,800
well and i took it back over
 

8929
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:19,750
well and i took it back over
and

8930
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:19,760
and
 

8931
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:22,150
and
trying to make it go fast on there where

8932
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:22,160
trying to make it go fast on there where
 

8933
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:24,309
trying to make it go fast on there where
it really did not have much processing

8934
02:35:24,309 --> 02:35:24,319
it really did not have much processing
 

8935
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:26,230
it really did not have much processing
power the pixels were stretched up

8936
02:35:26,230 --> 02:35:26,240
power the pixels were stretched up
 

8937
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:28,230
power the pixels were stretched up
hugely and it's it was pretty ugly when

8938
02:35:28,230 --> 02:35:28,240
hugely and it's it was pretty ugly when
 

8939
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:30,070
hugely and it's it was pretty ugly when
you looked at it but in the end it did

8940
02:35:30,070 --> 02:35:30,080
you looked at it but in the end it did
 

8941
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:31,750
you looked at it but in the end it did
come out fast enough to play and still

8942
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:31,760
come out fast enough to play and still
 

8943
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:33,990
come out fast enough to play and still
be kind of fun from that but that was

8944
02:35:33,990 --> 02:35:34,000
be kind of fun from that but that was
 

8945
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,550
be kind of fun from that but that was
where i started using uh bsp trees or

8946
02:35:36,550 --> 02:35:36,560
where i started using uh bsp trees or
 

8947
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:38,389
where i started using uh bsp trees or
binary space partitioning trees it was

8948
02:35:38,389 --> 02:35:38,399
binary space partitioning trees it was
 

8949
02:35:38,399 --> 02:35:39,750
binary space partitioning trees it was
one of those things i had to make it

8950
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:39,760
one of those things i had to make it
 

8951
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:42,710
one of those things i had to make it
faster there it was a stepping stone

8952
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:42,720
faster there it was a stepping stone
 

8953
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,469
faster there it was a stepping stone
where it was reasonably easy to

8954
02:35:44,469 --> 02:35:44,479
where it was reasonably easy to
 

8955
02:35:44,479 --> 02:35:46,070
where it was reasonably easy to
understand in the grid world of

8956
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:46,080
understand in the grid world of
 

8957
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:48,070
understand in the grid world of
wolfenstein where it was all still 90

8958
02:35:48,070 --> 02:35:48,080
wolfenstein where it was all still 90
 

8959
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:49,910

02:35:53,030 --> 02:35:53,040
bsp trees were i eased myself into it
 

8963
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:56,070
bsp trees were i eased myself into it
with that and it was a big success i'm

8964
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,080
with that and it was a big success i'm
 

8965
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,550

then when i came back to working on doom

8966
02:35:58,550 --> 02:35:58,560
then when i came back to working on doom
 

8967
02:35:58,560 --> 02:36:00,790
then when i came back to working on doom
i had this new tool in my toolbox it was

8968
02:36:00,790 --> 02:36:00,800
i had this new tool in my toolbox it was
 

8969
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:02,230
i had this new tool in my toolbox it was
going to be a lot harder with the

8970
02:36:02,230 --> 02:36:02,240
going to be a lot harder with the
 

8971
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:04,710
going to be a lot harder with the
arbitrary angles of doom this was where

8972
02:36:04,710 --> 02:36:04,720
arbitrary angles of doom this was where
 

8973
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:07,030
arbitrary angles of doom this was where
i really started grappling with epsilon

8974
02:36:07,030 --> 02:36:07,040
i really started grappling with epsilon
 

8975
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:09,190
i really started grappling with epsilon
problems and just you know up until that

8976
02:36:09,190 --> 02:36:09,200
problems and just you know up until that
 

8977
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:10,790
problems and just you know up until that
point i hadn't really had to deal with

8978
02:36:10,790 --> 02:36:10,800
point i hadn't really had to deal with
 

8979
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:13,429
point i hadn't really had to deal with
the fact that i am so many numeric

8980
02:36:13,429 --> 02:36:13,439
the fact that i am so many numeric
 

8981
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:14,870
the fact that i am so many numeric
things this almost felt like a betrayal

8982
02:36:14,870 --> 02:36:14,880
things this almost felt like a betrayal
 

8983
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:16,469
things this almost felt like a betrayal
to me whereas people had told me that i

8984
02:36:16,469 --> 02:36:16,479
to me whereas people had told me that i
 

8985
02:36:16,479 --> 02:36:18,150
to me whereas people had told me that i
had mathematicians up on a bit of a

8986
02:36:18,150 --> 02:36:18,160
had mathematicians up on a bit of a
 

8987
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:19,670
had mathematicians up on a bit of a
pedestal where

8988
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:19,680
pedestal where
 

8989
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:22,070
pedestal where
i was people think i'm a math wizard and

8990
02:36:22,070 --> 02:36:22,080
i was people think i'm a math wizard and
 

8991
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:24,950
i was people think i'm a math wizard and
i'm not i really everything that i did

8992
02:36:24,950 --> 02:36:24,960
i'm not i really everything that i did
 

8993
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:27,429
i'm not i really everything that i did
was really done with a solid high school

8994
02:36:27,429 --> 02:36:27,439
was really done with a solid high school
 

8995
02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:30,070
was really done with a solid high school
math understanding i you know algebra 2

8996
02:36:30,070 --> 02:36:30,080
math understanding i you know algebra 2
 

8997
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:32,389
math understanding i you know algebra 2
trigonometry and i'm

8998
02:36:32,389 --> 02:36:32,399
trigonometry and i'm
 

8999
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:34,070
trigonometry and i'm
that was what got me all the way through

9000
02:36:34,070 --> 02:36:34,080
that was what got me all the way through
 

9001
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:35,830
that was what got me all the way through
doom and quake and all of that of just

9002
02:36:35,830 --> 02:36:35,840
doom and quake and all of that of just
 

9003
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:38,630
doom and quake and all of that of just
understanding basics of matrices and

9004
02:36:38,630 --> 02:36:38,640
understanding basics of matrices and
 

9005
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:40,230
understanding basics of matrices and
knowing it well enough to do something

9006
02:36:40,230 --> 02:36:40,240
knowing it well enough to do something
 

9007
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:42,309
knowing it well enough to do something
with it what's the epsilon problems you

9008
02:36:42,309 --> 02:36:42,319
with it what's the epsilon problems you
 

9009
02:36:42,319 --> 02:36:45,349
with it what's the epsilon problems you
run into so i when you wind up taking a

9010
02:36:45,349 --> 02:36:45,359
run into so i when you wind up taking a
 

9011
02:36:45,359 --> 02:36:47,429
run into so i when you wind up taking a
like a sloped line and you say i'm going

9012
02:36:47,429 --> 02:36:47,439
like a sloped line and you say i'm going
 

9013
02:36:47,439 --> 02:36:49,910
like a sloped line and you say i'm going
to intersect it with another sloped line

9014
02:36:49,910 --> 02:36:49,920
to intersect it with another sloped line
 

9015
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:51,990
to intersect it with another sloped line
i am then you wind up with something

9016
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:52,000
i am then you wind up with something
 

9017
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,429
i am then you wind up with something
that's not going to be on these nice

9018
02:36:53,429 --> 02:36:53,439
that's not going to be on these nice
 

9019
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:56,150
that's not going to be on these nice
grid boundaries with uh the wolfenstein

9020
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:56,160
grid boundaries with uh the wolfenstein
 

9021
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:57,990
grid boundaries with uh the wolfenstein
tile maps all you've got is horizontal

9022
02:36:57,990 --> 02:36:58,000
tile maps all you've got is horizontal
 

9023
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,590
tile maps all you've got is horizontal
and vertical lines looking at it from

9024
02:36:59,590 --> 02:36:59,600
and vertical lines looking at it from
 

9025
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:01,429
and vertical lines looking at it from
above and if you cut one of them it's

9026
02:37:01,429 --> 02:37:01,439
above and if you cut one of them it's
 

9027
02:37:01,439 --> 02:37:03,110
above and if you cut one of them it's
just obvious the other one gets cut

9028
02:37:03,110 --> 02:37:03,120
just obvious the other one gets cut
 

9029
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:05,590
just obvious the other one gets cut
exactly at that point but when you have

9030
02:37:05,590 --> 02:37:05,600
exactly at that point but when you have
 

9031
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:07,429
exactly at that point but when you have
angled lines you're doing a kind of a

9032
02:37:07,429 --> 02:37:07,439
angled lines you're doing a kind of a
 

9033
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:09,349
angled lines you're doing a kind of a
slope intercept problem and you wind up

9034
02:37:09,349 --> 02:37:09,359
slope intercept problem and you wind up
 

9035
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:12,070
slope intercept problem and you wind up
with rational numbers there where things

9036
02:37:12,070 --> 02:37:12,080
with rational numbers there where things
 

9037
02:37:12,080 --> 02:37:14,230
with rational numbers there where things
that are not going to evenly land on an

9038
02:37:14,230 --> 02:37:14,240
that are not going to evenly land on an
 

9039
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:16,389
that are not going to evenly land on an
integer or even on any fixed point value

9040
02:37:16,389 --> 02:37:16,399
integer or even on any fixed point value
 

9041
02:37:16,399 --> 02:37:18,550
integer or even on any fixed point value
that you've got so everything winds up

9042
02:37:18,550 --> 02:37:18,560
that you've got so everything winds up
 

9043
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:20,870
that you've got so everything winds up
having to snap to some fixed point value

9044
02:37:20,870 --> 02:37:20,880
having to snap to some fixed point value
 

9045
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:23,270
having to snap to some fixed point value
so the lines slightly change their angle

9046
02:37:23,270 --> 02:37:23,280
so the lines slightly change their angle
 

9047
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:25,110
so the lines slightly change their angle
you wind up if you cut something here

9048
02:37:25,110 --> 02:37:25,120
you wind up if you cut something here
 

9049
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:26,469
you wind up if you cut something here
this one's going to bend a little this

9050
02:37:26,469 --> 02:37:26,479
this one's going to bend a little this
 

9051
02:37:26,479 --> 02:37:28,070
this one's going to bend a little this
way and it's not going to be completely

9052
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:28,080
way and it's not going to be completely
 

9053
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:29,830
way and it's not going to be completely
straight and then you come down to all

9054
02:37:29,830 --> 02:37:29,840
straight and then you come down to all
 

9055
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:32,550
straight and then you come down to all
these questions of well this one is is

9056
02:37:32,550 --> 02:37:32,560
these questions of well this one is is
 

9057
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:35,510
these questions of well this one is is
is a point on an angled line you can't

9058
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:35,520
is a point on an angled line you can't
 

9059
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:38,150
is a point on an angled line you can't
answer that in finite precision unless

9060
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:38,160
answer that in finite precision unless
 

9061
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:39,510
answer that in finite precision unless
you're doing something with actual

9062
02:37:39,510 --> 02:37:39,520
you're doing something with actual
 

9063
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:41,910
you're doing something with actual
rational numbers and later on i did

9064
02:37:41,910 --> 02:37:41,920
rational numbers and later on i did
 

9065
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:43,750
rational numbers and later on i did
waste far too much time chasing things

9066
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:43,760
waste far too much time chasing things
 

9067
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:45,030
waste far too much time chasing things
like that how do you do precise

9068
02:37:45,030 --> 02:37:45,040
like that how do you do precise
 

9069
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:47,270
like that how do you do precise
arithmetic with rational numbers and it

9070
02:37:47,270 --> 02:37:47,280
arithmetic with rational numbers and it
 

9071
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:49,030
arithmetic with rational numbers and it
always blows up eventually you know

9072
02:37:49,030 --> 02:37:49,040
always blows up eventually you know
 

9073
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:51,030
always blows up eventually you know
exponentially as you do now so these are

9074
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:51,040
exponentially as you do now so these are
 

9075
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:52,469
exponentially as you do now so these are
these kind of things they're impossible

9076
02:37:52,469 --> 02:37:52,479
these kind of things they're impossible
 

9077
02:37:52,479 --> 02:37:53,990
these kind of things they're impossible
with computers so

9078
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:54,000
with computers so
 

9079
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,230
with computers so
they're possible again there are paths

9080
02:37:56,230 --> 02:37:56,240
they're possible again there are paths
 

9081
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:58,309
they're possible again there are paths
to do doing it but you can't fit them

9082
02:37:58,309 --> 02:37:58,319
to do doing it but you can't fit them
 

9083
02:37:58,319 --> 02:38:00,230
to do doing it but you can't fit them
conveniently and any of the numbers you

9084
02:38:00,230 --> 02:38:00,240
conveniently and any of the numbers you
 

9085
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:02,389
conveniently and any of the numbers you
need to start using big nums and

9086
02:38:02,389 --> 02:38:02,399
need to start using big nums and
 

9087
02:38:02,399 --> 02:38:04,230
need to start using big nums and
different factor trackings and different

9088
02:38:04,230 --> 02:38:04,240
different factor trackings and different
 

9089
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:06,309
different factor trackings and different
things so you uh you have to if you have

9090
02:38:06,309 --> 02:38:06,319
things so you uh you have to if you have
 

9091
02:38:06,319 --> 02:38:08,630
things so you uh you have to if you have
any elements of ocd and you want to do

9092
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:08,640
any elements of ocd and you want to do
 

9093
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:10,550
any elements of ocd and you want to do
something perfectly you're screwed if

9094
02:38:10,550 --> 02:38:10,560
something perfectly you're screwed if
 

9095
02:38:10,560 --> 02:38:12,790
something perfectly you're screwed if
you're working with floating point yeah

9096
02:38:12,790 --> 02:38:12,800
you're working with floating point yeah
 

9097
02:38:12,800 --> 02:38:14,710
you're working with floating point yeah
so so you had to deal with this for the

9098
02:38:14,710 --> 02:38:14,720
so so you had to deal with this for the
 

9099
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:16,309
so so you had to deal with this for the
first time yeah there was there were

9100
02:38:16,309 --> 02:38:16,319
first time yeah there was there were
 

9101
02:38:16,319 --> 02:38:18,710
first time yeah there was there were
lots of challenges there about like okay

9102
02:38:18,710 --> 02:38:18,720
lots of challenges there about like okay
 

9103
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:20,389
lots of challenges there about like okay
they built this cool thing and the way

9104
02:38:20,389 --> 02:38:20,399
they built this cool thing and the way
 

9105
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:23,349
they built this cool thing and the way
the bsp trees work is it basically takes

9106
02:38:23,349 --> 02:38:23,359
the bsp trees work is it basically takes
 

9107
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:25,510
the bsp trees work is it basically takes
the walls and it carves other walls by

9108
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:25,520
the walls and it carves other walls by
 

9109
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:27,750
the walls and it carves other walls by
those walls in this clever way that you

9110
02:38:27,750 --> 02:38:27,760
those walls in this clever way that you
 

9111
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:30,389
those walls in this clever way that you
can then take all of these fragments and

9112
02:38:30,389 --> 02:38:30,399
can then take all of these fragments and
 

9113
02:38:30,399 --> 02:38:32,550
can then take all of these fragments and
then you can for sure from any given

9114
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:32,560
then you can for sure from any given
 

9115
02:38:32,560 --> 02:38:34,550
then you can for sure from any given
point get an ordering of everything in

9116
02:38:34,550 --> 02:38:34,560
point get an ordering of everything in
 

9117
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:36,150
point get an ordering of everything in
the world and you can say this goes in

9118
02:38:36,150 --> 02:38:36,160
the world and you can say this goes in
 

9119
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:38,070
the world and you can say this goes in
front of this goes in front of this all

9120
02:38:38,070 --> 02:38:38,080
front of this goes in front of this all
 

9121
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:40,309
front of this goes in front of this all
the way back to the last thing and

9122
02:38:40,309 --> 02:38:40,319
the way back to the last thing and
 

9123
02:38:40,319 --> 02:38:42,950
the way back to the last thing and
that's super valuable for graphics where

9124
02:38:42,950 --> 02:38:42,960
that's super valuable for graphics where
 

9125
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:45,190
that's super valuable for graphics where
uh kind of a classic graphics algorithm

9126
02:38:45,190 --> 02:38:45,200
uh kind of a classic graphics algorithm
 

9127
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:47,030
uh kind of a classic graphics algorithm
would be painter's algorithm you paint

9128
02:38:47,030 --> 02:38:47,040
would be painter's algorithm you paint
 

9129
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:48,389
would be painter's algorithm you paint
the furthest thing first and then the

9130
02:38:48,389 --> 02:38:48,399
the furthest thing first and then the
 

9131
02:38:48,399 --> 02:38:49,990
the furthest thing first and then the
next thing and then the next thing and

9132
02:38:49,990 --> 02:38:50,000
next thing and then the next thing and
 

9133
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,670
next thing and then the next thing and
then it comes up and it's all perfect

9134
02:38:51,670 --> 02:38:51,680
then it comes up and it's all perfect
 

9135
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:53,670
then it comes up and it's all perfect
for you uh that's slow because you don't

9136
02:38:53,670 --> 02:38:53,680
for you uh that's slow because you don't
 

9137
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:55,270
for you uh that's slow because you don't
want to have to have drawn everything

9138
02:38:55,270 --> 02:38:55,280
want to have to have drawn everything
 

9139
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:57,030
want to have to have drawn everything
like that but you can also flip it

9140
02:38:57,030 --> 02:38:57,040
like that but you can also flip it
 

9141
02:38:57,040 --> 02:38:59,510
like that but you can also flip it
around and draw the closest thing to you

9142
02:38:59,510 --> 02:38:59,520
around and draw the closest thing to you
 

9143
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:01,429
around and draw the closest thing to you
and then if you're clever about it you

9144
02:39:01,429 --> 02:39:01,439
and then if you're clever about it you
 

9145
02:39:01,439 --> 02:39:03,349
and then if you're clever about it you
can figure out what you need to draw

9146
02:39:03,349 --> 02:39:03,359
can figure out what you need to draw
 

9147
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:05,590
can figure out what you need to draw
that's visible beyond that and that's

9148
02:39:05,590 --> 02:39:05,600
that's visible beyond that and that's
 

9149
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,990
that's visible beyond that and that's
what bsp trees allow you to do yeah so

9150
02:39:07,990 --> 02:39:08,000
what bsp trees allow you to do yeah so
 

9151
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,429
what bsp trees allow you to do yeah so
it's combined with

9152
02:39:09,429 --> 02:39:09,439
it's combined with
 

9153
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:11,030
it's combined with
a bunch of other things but it gives you

9154
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:11,040
a bunch of other things but it gives you
 

9155
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,270
a bunch of other things but it gives you
that ordering it's a clever way of doing

9156
02:39:13,270 --> 02:39:13,280
that ordering it's a clever way of doing
 

9157
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:15,429
that ordering it's a clever way of doing
things and i remember i had learned this

9158
02:39:15,429 --> 02:39:15,439
things and i remember i had learned this
 

9159
02:39:15,439 --> 02:39:18,230
things and i remember i had learned this
from i one of my my graphics bible at

9160
02:39:18,230 --> 02:39:18,240
from i one of my my graphics bible at
 

9161
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:19,830
from i one of my my graphics bible at
the time a book called foley and van

9162
02:39:19,830 --> 02:39:19,840
the time a book called foley and van
 

9163
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:21,670
the time a book called foley and van
damme and again it was a different world

9164
02:39:21,670 --> 02:39:21,680
damme and again it was a different world
 

9165
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:23,270

back there there was a small integer

9166
02:39:23,270 --> 02:39:23,280
back there there was a small integer
 

9167
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:24,550
back there there was a small integer
number of books

9168
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:24,560
number of books
 

9169
02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:27,270
number of books
and this book that yeah yeah this book

9170
02:39:27,270 --> 02:39:27,280
and this book that yeah yeah this book
 

9171
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:29,510
and this book that yeah yeah this book
that was it was big fat college textbook

9172
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:29,520
that was it was big fat college textbook
 

9173
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:32,469
that was it was big fat college textbook
that i had i'd read through many times i

9174
02:39:32,469 --> 02:39:32,479
that i had i'd read through many times i
 

9175
02:39:32,479 --> 02:39:34,230

didn't understand everything in it some

9176
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:34,240
didn't understand everything in it some
 

9177
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:36,550
didn't understand everything in it some
of it wasn't useful to me but they had

9178
02:39:36,550 --> 02:39:36,560
of it wasn't useful to me but they had
 

9179
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:38,870
of it wasn't useful to me but they had
the little thing about uh finite

9180
02:39:38,870 --> 02:39:38,880
the little thing about uh finite
 

9181
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:41,110
the little thing about uh finite
orderings of you draw a little t-shaped

9182
02:39:41,110 --> 02:39:41,120
orderings of you draw a little t-shaped
 

9183
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:43,030
orderings of you draw a little t-shaped
thing and you can say you can you can

9184
02:39:43,030 --> 02:39:43,040
thing and you can say you can you can
 

9185
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:44,790
thing and you can say you can you can
make a fixed ahead of time order from

9186
02:39:44,790 --> 02:39:44,800
make a fixed ahead of time order from
 

9187
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:46,950
make a fixed ahead of time order from
this and you can generalize this with

9188
02:39:46,950 --> 02:39:46,960
this and you can generalize this with
 

9189
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:49,349
this and you can generalize this with
the bsp trees and and i got a little bit

9190
02:39:49,349 --> 02:39:49,359
the bsp trees and and i got a little bit
 

9191
02:39:49,359 --> 02:39:51,030
the bsp trees and and i got a little bit
more information about that it was kind

9192
02:39:51,030 --> 02:39:51,040
more information about that it was kind
 

9193
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:52,630
more information about that it was kind
of fun later while i was working on

9194
02:39:52,630 --> 02:39:52,640
of fun later while i was working on
 

9195
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,790
of fun later while i was working on
quake i got to meet uh bruce naylor who

9196
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:54,800
quake i got to meet uh bruce naylor who
 

9197
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:56,630

9199
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:58,870
is one of the original researchers that
developed those technologies uh you know

9200
02:39:58,870 --> 02:39:58,880
developed those technologies uh you know
 

9201
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:01,110
developed those technologies uh you know
as for academic literature and that was

9202
02:40:01,110 --> 02:40:01,120
as for academic literature and that was
 

9203
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:02,950
as for academic literature and that was
kind of fun but i was very much just

9204
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:02,960
kind of fun but i was very much just
 

9205
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:05,030
kind of fun but i was very much just

in every way but eventually i did sort

9218
02:40:16,950 --> 02:40:16,960

9219
02:40:16,960 --> 02:40:19,429

when you got to something where it was

9230
02:40:28,950 --> 02:40:28,960
when you got to something where it was
 

9231
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:30,389
when you got to something where it was
messed up it was a hall of mirrors

9232
02:40:30,389 --> 02:40:30,399
messed up it was a hall of mirrors
 

9233
02:40:30,399 --> 02:40:32,389
messed up it was a hall of mirrors
effect because you'd sweep by and it

9234
02:40:32,389 --> 02:40:32,399
effect because you'd sweep by and it
 

9235
02:40:32,399 --> 02:40:33,750
effect because you'd sweep by and it
wouldn't draw something there and you

9236
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:33,760
wouldn't draw something there and you
 

9237
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:35,510
wouldn't draw something there and you
would just wind up with the leftover

9238
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:35,520
would just wind up with the leftover
 

9239
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:37,830
would just wind up with the leftover
remnants as you flipped between the the

9240
02:40:37,830 --> 02:40:37,840
remnants as you flipped between the the
 

9241
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:40,870
remnants as you flipped between the the
two pages but bsp trees were important

9242
02:40:40,870 --> 02:40:40,880
two pages but bsp trees were important
 

9243
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:43,990
two pages but bsp trees were important

for it but it's again worth noting that
uh after we did doom our major

there were critical things about to make

9264
02:41:05,830 --> 02:41:05,840
there were critical things about to make
 

9265
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:08,150
there were critical things about to make
any of those games fast you had you had

9266
02:41:08,150 --> 02:41:08,160
any of those games fast you had you had
 

9267
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:09,990
any of those games fast you had you had
to separate your drawing into you drew

9268
02:41:09,990 --> 02:41:10,000
to separate your drawing into you drew
 

9269
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:11,750
to separate your drawing into you drew
vertical lines and you drew horizontal

9270
02:41:11,750 --> 02:41:11,760
vertical lines and you drew horizontal
 

9271
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:14,389
vertical lines and you drew horizontal
lines just kind of changing exactly what

9272
02:41:14,389 --> 02:41:14,399
lines just kind of changing exactly what
 

9273
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:16,070
lines just kind of changing exactly what
you would draw with them that was

9274
02:41:16,070 --> 02:41:16,080
you would draw with them that was
 

9275
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:18,550
you would draw with them that was
critical for the technologies uh at that

9276
02:41:18,550 --> 02:41:18,560
critical for the technologies uh at that
 

9277
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:20,710
critical for the technologies uh at that
time and like all the games that were

9278
02:41:20,710 --> 02:41:20,720
time and like all the games that were
 

9279
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:22,150
time and like all the games that were
kind of like that wound up doing

9280
02:41:22,150 --> 02:41:22,160
kind of like that wound up doing
 

9281
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:23,990
kind of like that wound up doing
something similar but there were still a

9282
02:41:23,990 --> 02:41:24,000
something similar but there were still a
 

9283
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,990
something similar but there were still a
bunch of other decisions that could be

9284
02:41:25,990 --> 02:41:26,000
bunch of other decisions that could be
 

9285
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,790
bunch of other decisions that could be
made and we made good enough decisions

9286
02:41:28,790 --> 02:41:28,800
made and we made good enough decisions
 

9287
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:31,269
made and we made good enough decisions
on everything on doom we

9288

on everything on doom we

on everything on doom we
we brought in multiplayer significantly

9290
02:41:33,510 --> 02:41:33,520
we brought in multiplayer significantly
 

9291
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:34,790
we brought in multiplayer significantly
and it was our first game that was

and it was our first game that was
 

9293
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:36,950
and it was our first game that was

that people could could build with tools

02:41:43,510 --> 02:41:43,520
that people could could build with tools
 

9301
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:44,710
that people could could build with tools
that we released to them and they

9302
02:41:44,710 --> 02:41:44,720
that we released to them and they
 

9303
02:41:44,720 --> 02:41:46,230
that we released to them and they
eventually rewrote to be better than

02:41:46,230 --> 02:41:46,240
eventually rewrote to be better than
 

9305
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:48,309
eventually rewrote to be better than
what we released but they could build

9306
02:41:48,309 --> 02:41:48,319
what we released but they could build
 

9307
02:41:48,319 --> 02:41:50,230
what we released but they could build
things and you could add it to your game

9308
02:41:50,230 --> 02:41:50,240
things and you could add it to your game
 

9309
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:52,309
things and you could add it to your game
without destructively modifying it which

9310
02:41:52,309 --> 02:41:52,319
without destructively modifying it which
 

9311
02:41:52,319 --> 02:41:53,670
without destructively modifying it which
is what you had to do in all the early

9312
02:41:53,670 --> 02:41:53,680
is what you had to do in all the early
 

9313
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:55,670
is what you had to do in all the early
games you literally hacked the

9314
02:41:55,670 --> 02:41:55,680
games you literally hacked the
 

9315
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:57,990
games you literally hacked the
the data files or the executable before

9316
02:41:57,990 --> 02:41:58,000
the data files or the executable before
 

9317
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,150

while doom was set up in this flexible

9318
02:42:00,150 --> 02:42:00,160
while doom was set up in this flexible
 

9319
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:02,469
while doom was set up in this flexible
way so that you could just say run the

9320
02:42:02,469 --> 02:42:02,479
way so that you could just say run the
 

9321
02:42:02,479 --> 02:42:04,630
way so that you could just say run the
normal game with this added on on top

9322
02:42:04,630 --> 02:42:04,640
normal game with this added on on top
 

9323
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:06,790
normal game with this added on on top
and it would overlay just the things

9324
02:42:06,790 --> 02:42:06,800
and it would overlay just the things
 

9325
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:09,030
and it would overlay just the things
that you wanted to there

9326
02:42:09,030 --> 02:42:09,040
that you wanted to there
 

9327
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:10,790
that you wanted to there
would you say that doom was kind of the

9328
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:10,800
would you say that doom was kind of the
 

9329
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:14,230
would you say that doom was kind of the
first true 3d game that you created so

9330
02:42:14,230 --> 02:42:14,240
first true 3d game that you created so
 

9331
02:42:14,240 --> 02:42:16,230
first true 3d game that you created so
no it's still doom would usually be

9332
02:42:16,230 --> 02:42:16,240
no it's still doom would usually be
 

9333
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:18,309
no it's still doom would usually be
called a two and a half d game where it

9334
02:42:18,309 --> 02:42:18,319
called a two and a half d game where it
 

9335
02:42:18,319 --> 02:42:20,230
called a two and a half d game where it
had three dimensional points on it and

9336
02:42:20,230 --> 02:42:20,240
had three dimensional points on it and
 

9337
02:42:20,240 --> 02:42:21,429
had three dimensional points on it and
this is another one of these kind of

9338
02:42:21,429 --> 02:42:21,439
this is another one of these kind of
 

9339
02:42:21,439 --> 02:42:23,110
this is another one of these kind of
pedantic things that people love to

9340
02:42:23,110 --> 02:42:23,120
pedantic things that people love to
 

9341
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:25,030
pedantic things that people love to
argue about about what was the first 3d

9342
02:42:25,030 --> 02:42:25,040
argue about about what was the first 3d
 

9343
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:27,670
argue about about what was the first 3d
game i still like i'm like every month

9344
02:42:27,670 --> 02:42:27,680
game i still like i'm like every month
 

9345
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:29,750
game i still like i'm like every month
probably i hear from somebody about well

9346
02:42:29,750 --> 02:42:29,760
probably i hear from somebody about well
 

9347
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:32,950
probably i hear from somebody about well
was doom really a 3d game or something i

9348
02:42:32,950 --> 02:42:32,960
was doom really a 3d game or something i
 

9349
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:33,910
was doom really a 3d game or something i
and

9350
02:42:33,910 --> 02:42:33,920
and
 

9351
02:42:33,920 --> 02:42:36,309
and
you know i give the the point where

9352
02:42:36,309 --> 02:42:36,319
you know i give the the point where
 

9353
02:42:36,319 --> 02:42:38,790
you know i give the the point where
characters had three coordinates so you

9354
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:38,800
characters had three coordinates so you
 

9355
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:40,790
characters had three coordinates so you
had like an x y and z the cacademian

9356
02:42:40,790 --> 02:42:40,800
had like an x y and z the cacademian
 

9357
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:42,550
had like an x y and z the cacademian
could be coming in very high and come

9358
02:42:42,550 --> 02:42:42,560
could be coming in very high and come
 

9359
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:44,790
could be coming in very high and come
you know and come down towards you uh

9360
02:42:44,790 --> 02:42:44,800
you know and come down towards you uh
 

9361
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:47,269
you know and come down towards you uh
the walls had three coordinates on them

9362
02:42:47,269 --> 02:42:47,279
the walls had three coordinates on them
 

9363
02:42:47,279 --> 02:42:50,150
the walls had three coordinates on them
so on some sense it's a 3d game engine

9364
02:42:50,150 --> 02:42:50,160
so on some sense it's a 3d game engine
 

9365
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:52,630
so on some sense it's a 3d game engine
but it was not a fully general 3d game

9366
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:52,640
but it was not a fully general 3d game
 

9367
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:55,030
but it was not a fully general 3d game
engine you could not i you could not

9368
02:42:55,030 --> 02:42:55,040
engine you could not i you could not
 

9369
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:56,870
engine you could not i you could not
build a pyramid in doom because you

9370
02:42:56,870 --> 02:42:56,880
build a pyramid in doom because you
 

9371
02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:59,190
build a pyramid in doom because you
couldn't make a sloped wall

9372
02:42:59,190 --> 02:42:59,200
couldn't make a sloped wall
 

9373
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,630
couldn't make a sloped wall
which was slightly different where in

9374
02:43:00,630 --> 02:43:00,640
which was slightly different where in
 

9375
02:43:00,640 --> 02:43:02,230
which was slightly different where in
that previous shadow caster game i

9376
02:43:02,230 --> 02:43:02,240
that previous shadow caster game i
 

9377
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:04,230
that previous shadow caster game i
couldn't have vertexes and have a sloped

9378
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:04,240
couldn't have vertexes and have a sloped
 

9379
02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:06,550
couldn't have vertexes and have a sloped
floor there but the changes that i made

9380
02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:06,560
floor there but the changes that i made
 

9381
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:08,710
floor there but the changes that i made
for doom to get higher speed and a

9382
02:43:08,710 --> 02:43:08,720
for doom to get higher speed and a
 

9383
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:10,630
for doom to get higher speed and a
different set of flexibility traded away

9384
02:43:10,630 --> 02:43:10,640
different set of flexibility traded away
 

9385
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:12,469
different set of flexibility traded away
that ability but you literally couldn't

9386
02:43:12,469 --> 02:43:12,479
that ability but you literally couldn't
 

9387
02:43:12,479 --> 02:43:15,910
that ability but you literally couldn't
make that you could not i you could make

9388
02:43:15,910 --> 02:43:15,920
make that you could not i you could make
 

9389
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:17,990
make that you could not i you could make
different heights of uh passages but you

9390
02:43:17,990 --> 02:43:18,000
different heights of uh passages but you
 

9391
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,830
different heights of uh passages but you
could not make a bridge over another

9392
02:43:19,830 --> 02:43:19,840
could not make a bridge over another
 

9393
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:21,750
could not make a bridge over another
area you could not go over and above it

9394
02:43:21,750 --> 02:43:21,760
area you could not go over and above it
 

9395
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:24,550
area you could not go over and above it
so it still had some 2d limitations to

9396
02:43:24,550 --> 02:43:24,560
so it still had some 2d limitations to
 

9397
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:26,230
so it still had some 2d limitations to
it that's more about the building versus

9398
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:26,240

02:43:30,389 --> 02:43:30,399
it felt like things would come at you

02:43:30,399 --> 02:43:32,550
it felt like things would come at you

am right you know you could only pitch

it was four degrees of freedom rather

it was four degrees of freedom rather
 

9411
02:43:36,560 --> 02:43:38,630
it was four degrees of freedom rather
than six degrees of freedom you did not

what was the leap

9420
02:43:46,230 --> 02:43:46,240
what was the leap
 

9421
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:47,349
what was the leap
there

9422
02:43:47,349 --> 02:43:47,359
there
 

9423

what was some fascinating technical
 

9425
02:43:49,359 --> 02:43:51,590

come up with so quake was kind of the

9430
02:43:55,429 --> 02:43:55,439
come up with so quake was kind of the
 

9431
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:58,230
come up with so quake was kind of the
first thing where i did have to kind of

9432
02:43:58,230 --> 02:43:58,240
first thing where i did have to kind of
 

9433
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:01,110
first thing where i did have to kind of
come face to face with my limitations

9434
02:44:01,110 --> 02:44:01,120
come face to face with my limitations
 

9435
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:03,030
come face to face with my limitations
where it was the first thing where i

9436
02:44:03,030 --> 02:44:03,040
where it was the first thing where i
 

9437
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:04,630
where it was the first thing where i
really did kind of

9438
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:04,640
really did kind of
 

9439
02:44:04,640 --> 02:44:06,630
really did kind of
give it my all and still come up a

9440
02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:06,640
give it my all and still come up a
 

9441
02:44:06,640 --> 02:44:07,990
give it my all and still come up a
little you know come up a little bit

9442
02:44:07,990 --> 02:44:08,000
little you know come up a little bit
 

9443
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,389
little you know come up a little bit
short in terms of what and when i wanted

9444
02:44:10,389 --> 02:44:10,399
short in terms of what and when i wanted
 

9445
02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:13,429
short in terms of what and when i wanted
to to get it done and the company ran

the whole project and
 

9451
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:19,990
the whole project and
we uh we bit off a lot so the things

9452
02:44:19,990 --> 02:44:20,000
we uh we bit off a lot so the things
 

9453
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,230
we uh we bit off a lot so the things
that we set out to do was it was going

that we set out to do was it was going
 

9455
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:24,790
that we set out to do was it was going
to be really a true 3d engine where it

9456
02:44:24,790 --> 02:44:24,800
to be really a true 3d engine where it

starting to to do some things that they

02:44:55,830 --> 02:44:55,840
really change the game uh there were
 

9487
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:57,030
really change the game uh there were
still some people that were doing the

02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:02,630

02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:06,469
some early capture of the flag type
things by hacking the executable but it

9498
02:45:06,469 --> 02:45:06,479
things by hacking the executable but it
 

9499
02:45:06,479 --> 02:45:08,710

9502
02:45:10,790 --> 02:45:10,800
was going to have its own programming
 

9503
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:12,230
was going to have its own programming
language that the game was going to be

9504
02:45:12,230 --> 02:45:12,240
language that the game was going to be
 

9505
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:13,750
language that the game was going to be
implemented in it and that would be able

9506
02:45:13,750 --> 02:45:13,760
implemented in it and that would be able
 

9507
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:15,750
implemented in it and that would be able
to be overwritten just like any of the

9511
02:45:18,319 --> 02:45:20,550
media code was going to be data for that
and you would be able to have expansion

9512
02:45:20,550 --> 02:45:20,560

and quick trips because they had a
 

9881
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:11,670
and quick trips because they had a
spinner rack of comic books and they had

9882
02:52:11,670 --> 02:52:11,680
spinner rack of comic books and they had
 

9883
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:13,429
spinner rack of comic books and they had
a little side room with two or three

9884
02:52:13,429 --> 02:52:13,439
a little side room with two or three
 

9885
02:52:13,439 --> 02:52:16,309
a little side room with two or three
video games arcade games in it and that

video games arcade games in it and that
 

9887
02:52:16,319 --> 02:52:18,389
video games arcade games in it and that
was uh that was very much my happy place

9888
02:52:18,389 --> 02:52:18,399
was uh that was very much my happy place
 

9889
02:52:18,399 --> 02:52:20,710
was uh that was very much my happy place
you know if i could i get my comic books

9890
02:52:20,710 --> 02:52:20,720
you know if i could i get my comic books
 

9891
02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:22,710
you know if i could i get my comic books
and uh if i could go to a library and

9892
02:52:22,710 --> 02:52:22,720
and uh if i could go to a library and
 

9893
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:24,389
and uh if i could go to a library and
you know go through those the little

02:52:24,389 --> 02:52:24,399
you know go through those the little
 

9895
02:52:24,399 --> 02:52:26,150

books were supposed to be and there are
 

9899
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:29,349
books were supposed to be and there are
a few sad little books there but still

9900
02:52:29,349 --> 02:52:29,359
a few sad little books there but still
 

9901

high school was just sitting there with

9914
02:52:43,510 --> 02:52:43,520
high school was just sitting there with
 

9915
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:45,830
high school was just sitting there with
my nose in a book ignoring the class uh

9916
02:52:45,830 --> 02:52:45,840
my nose in a book ignoring the class uh
 

9917
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:47,510
my nose in a book ignoring the class uh
and through lots of it and teachers had

9918
02:52:47,510 --> 02:52:47,520
and through lots of it and teachers had
 

9919
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:49,990
and through lots of it and teachers had
a range of reactions to that some more

9920
02:52:49,990 --> 02:52:50,000
a range of reactions to that some more
 

9921
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:53,429
a range of reactions to that some more
uh more accepting of it than others

9922
02:52:53,429 --> 02:52:53,439
uh more accepting of it than others
 

9923
02:52:53,439 --> 02:52:55,510
uh more accepting of it than others
i'm with you on that so let us return to

9924
02:52:55,510 --> 02:52:55,520
i'm with you on that so let us return to
 

9925
02:52:55,520 --> 02:52:57,269
i'm with you on that so let us return to
quake for a bit with the technical

9926
02:52:57,269 --> 02:52:57,279
quake for a bit with the technical
 

9927
02:52:57,279 --> 02:53:00,309
quake for a bit with the technical
challenges what what um

9928
02:53:00,309 --> 02:53:00,319
challenges what what um
 

9929
02:53:00,319 --> 02:53:02,469
challenges what what um
everything together from the from the

9930
02:53:02,469 --> 02:53:02,479
everything together from the from the
 

9931
02:53:02,479 --> 02:53:05,670
everything together from the from the
networking to the the graphics what what

9932
02:53:05,670 --> 02:53:05,680
networking to the the graphics what what
 

9933
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:08,070
networking to the the graphics what what
are some things you remember that were

9934
02:53:08,070 --> 02:53:08,080
are some things you remember that were
 

9935
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:10,070
are some things you remember that were
that were innovations yet to come up

9936
02:53:10,070 --> 02:53:10,080
that were innovations yet to come up
 

9937
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:12,469
that were innovations yet to come up
with in order to make it all happen yeah

9938
02:53:12,469 --> 02:53:12,479
with in order to make it all happen yeah
 

9939
02:53:12,479 --> 02:53:14,790
with in order to make it all happen yeah
so there were a bunch of things on quake

9940
02:53:14,790 --> 02:53:14,800
so there were a bunch of things on quake
 

9941
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:17,510
so there were a bunch of things on quake
where on the one hand the idea that i

9942
02:53:17,510 --> 02:53:17,520
where on the one hand the idea that i
 

9943
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:19,269
where on the one hand the idea that i
built my own programming language to

9944
02:53:19,269 --> 02:53:19,279
built my own programming language to
 

9945
02:53:19,279 --> 02:53:21,990
built my own programming language to
implement the game in looking back and i

9946
02:53:21,990 --> 02:53:22,000
implement the game in looking back and i
 

9947
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,150
implement the game in looking back and i
try to tell people it's like every every

9948
02:53:24,150 --> 02:53:24,160
try to tell people it's like every every
 

9949
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:25,990
try to tell people it's like every every
high level programmer sometime in their

9950
02:53:25,990 --> 02:53:26,000
high level programmer sometime in their
 

9951
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:27,269
high level programmer sometime in their
career goes through and they invent

9952
02:53:27,269 --> 02:53:27,279
career goes through and they invent
 

9953
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:28,710
career goes through and they invent
their own language it just seems to be a

9954
02:53:28,710 --> 02:53:28,720
their own language it just seems to be a
 

9955
02:53:28,720 --> 02:53:30,550
their own language it just seems to be a
thing that's pretty broadly done people

9956
02:53:30,550 --> 02:53:30,560
thing that's pretty broadly done people
 

9957
02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:31,670
thing that's pretty broadly done people
they're like i'm going to go write a

9958
02:53:31,670 --> 02:53:31,680
they're like i'm going to go write a
 

9959
02:53:31,680 --> 02:53:34,070
they're like i'm going to go write a
computer programming language and

9960
02:53:34,070 --> 02:53:34,080
computer programming language and
 

9961
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:35,030
computer programming language and
i

9962
02:53:35,030 --> 02:53:35,040
i
 

9963
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:37,030
i
you know i don't regret having done it

9964
02:53:37,030 --> 02:53:37,040
you know i don't regret having done it
 

9965
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:40,070
you know i don't regret having done it
but after that i i switched from quake c

9966
02:53:40,070 --> 02:53:40,080
but after that i i switched from quake c
 

9967
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:42,630
but after that i i switched from quake c
my quirky little i am pseudo object

9968
02:53:42,630 --> 02:53:42,640
my quirky little i am pseudo object
 

9969
02:53:42,640 --> 02:53:45,190
my quirky little i am pseudo object
orienter entity oriented language there

9970
02:53:45,190 --> 02:53:45,200
orienter entity oriented language there
 

9971
02:53:45,200 --> 02:53:47,830
orienter entity oriented language there
quake 2 went back to using dlls with c

9972
02:53:47,830 --> 02:53:47,840
quake 2 went back to using dlls with c
 

9973
02:53:47,840 --> 02:53:49,990
quake 2 went back to using dlls with c
and then quake 3 i implemented my own c

9974
02:53:49,990 --> 02:53:50,000
and then quake 3 i implemented my own c
 

9975
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,309
and then quake 3 i implemented my own c
interpreter or compiler which was a much

9976
02:53:52,309 --> 02:53:52,319
interpreter or compiler which was a much
 

9977
02:53:52,319 --> 02:53:53,670
interpreter or compiler which was a much
smarter thing to do that i should have

9978
02:53:53,670 --> 02:53:53,680
smarter thing to do that i should have
 

9979
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:56,230
smarter thing to do that i should have
done originally for quake but building

9980
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:56,240
done originally for quake but building
 

9981
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:57,830
done originally for quake but building
my own language was an experience i

9982
02:53:57,830 --> 02:53:57,840
my own language was an experience i
 

9983
02:53:57,840 --> 02:53:59,830
my own language was an experience i
learned a lot from that i am and then

9984
02:53:59,830 --> 02:53:59,840
learned a lot from that i am and then
 

9985
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:01,590
learned a lot from that i am and then
there was a generation of game

9986
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:01,600
there was a generation of game
 

9987
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:03,510
there was a generation of game
programmers that learned programming

9988
02:54:03,510 --> 02:54:03,520
programmers that learned programming
 

9989
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:05,190
programmers that learned programming
with quake c which i feel kind of bad

9990
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:05,200
with quake c which i feel kind of bad
 

9991
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:07,349
with quake c which i feel kind of bad
about because you know i mean we give

9992
02:54:07,349 --> 02:54:07,359
about because you know i mean we give
 

9993
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:09,349
about because you know i mean we give
javascript a lot of crap but i'm you

9994
02:54:09,349 --> 02:54:09,359
javascript a lot of crap but i'm you
 

9995
02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:11,349
javascript a lot of crap but i'm you
know quake c was nothing to write home

9996
02:54:11,349 --> 02:54:11,359
know quake c was nothing to write home
 

9997
02:54:11,359 --> 02:54:12,550
know quake c was nothing to write home
about there

9998
02:54:12,550 --> 02:54:12,560
about there
 

9999
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:14,870
about there
uh but it was it allowed people to do

10000
02:54:14,870 --> 02:54:14,880
uh but it was it allowed people to do
 

10001
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:16,710
uh but it was it allowed people to do
magical things you get into programming

10002
02:54:16,710 --> 02:54:16,720
magical things you get into programming
 

10003
02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:19,269
magical things you get into programming
not because you love the

10004
02:54:19,269 --> 02:54:19,279
not because you love the
 

10005
02:54:19,279 --> 02:54:21,349
not because you love the
the bnf syntax of a language it's

10006
02:54:21,349 --> 02:54:21,359
the bnf syntax of a language it's
 

10007
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:22,870
the bnf syntax of a language it's
because the language lets you do

10008
02:54:22,870 --> 02:54:22,880
because the language lets you do
 

10009
02:54:22,880 --> 02:54:24,630
because the language lets you do
something that you cared about and

10010
02:54:24,630 --> 02:54:24,640
something that you cared about and
 

10011
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:26,870
something that you cared about and
here's very much you could do something

10012
02:54:26,870 --> 02:54:26,880
here's very much you could do something
 

10013
02:54:26,880 --> 02:54:29,110
here's very much you could do something
in a whole beautiful three-dimensional

10014
02:54:29,110 --> 02:54:29,120
in a whole beautiful three-dimensional
 

10015
02:54:29,120 --> 02:54:30,790
in a whole beautiful three-dimensional
world and the idea and the fact that the

10016
02:54:30,790 --> 02:54:30,800
world and the idea and the fact that the
 

10017
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:32,309
world and the idea and the fact that the
code for the game was out there you

10018
02:54:32,309 --> 02:54:32,319
code for the game was out there you
 

10019
02:54:32,319 --> 02:54:34,870
code for the game was out there you
could say i like the shotgun but i want

10020
02:54:34,870 --> 02:54:34,880
could say i like the shotgun but i want
 

10021
02:54:34,880 --> 02:54:36,790
could say i like the shotgun but i want
it to be more badass you go in there and

10022
02:54:36,790 --> 02:54:36,800
it to be more badass you go in there and
 

10023
02:54:36,800 --> 02:54:39,110
it to be more badass you go in there and
say okay now it does 200 points damage

10024
02:54:39,110 --> 02:54:39,120
say okay now it does 200 points damage
 

10025
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:40,870
say okay now it does 200 points damage
and then you go around with a big grin

10026
02:54:40,870 --> 02:54:40,880
and then you go around with a big grin
 

10027
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:42,710
and then you go around with a big grin
on your face blowing up monsters all

10028
02:54:42,710 --> 02:54:42,720
on your face blowing up monsters all
 

10029
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:43,910
on your face blowing up monsters all
over the game

10030
02:54:43,910 --> 02:54:43,920
over the game
 

10031
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:46,950
over the game
so yeah it's i you know it is not uh

10032
02:54:46,950 --> 02:54:46,960
so yeah it's i you know it is not uh
 

10033
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:48,790
so yeah it's i you know it is not uh
what i would do today going back with

10034
02:54:48,790 --> 02:54:48,800
what i would do today going back with
 

10035
02:54:48,800 --> 02:54:50,469
what i would do today going back with
that language but that was a big part of

10036
02:54:50,469 --> 02:54:50,479
that language but that was a big part of
 

10037
02:54:50,479 --> 02:54:51,190
that language but that was a big part of
it

10038
02:54:51,190 --> 02:54:51,200
it
 

10039
02:54:51,200 --> 02:54:53,990
it
learning about the networking stuff i

10040
02:54:53,990 --> 02:54:54,000
learning about the networking stuff i
 

10041
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,309
learning about the networking stuff i
because it's interesting where i learned

10042
02:54:56,309 --> 02:54:56,319
because it's interesting where i learned
 

10043
02:54:56,319 --> 02:54:57,830
because it's interesting where i learned
these things by reading books so i would

10044
02:54:57,830 --> 02:54:57,840
these things by reading books so i would
 

10045
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:59,510
these things by reading books so i would
get a book on networking and find

10046
02:54:59,510 --> 02:54:59,520
get a book on networking and find
 

10047
02:54:59,520 --> 02:55:01,750
get a book on networking and find
something i read all about and learn

10048
02:55:01,750 --> 02:55:01,760
something i read all about and learn
 

10049
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:03,990
something i read all about and learn
okay packets they can be you know out of

10050
02:55:03,990 --> 02:55:04,000
okay packets they can be you know out of
 

10051
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,630
okay packets they can be you know out of
order or lost or duplicated these are

10052
02:55:06,630 --> 02:55:06,640
order or lost or duplicated these are
 

10053
02:55:06,640 --> 02:55:07,990
order or lost or duplicated these are
all the things that can theoretically

10054
02:55:07,990 --> 02:55:08,000
all the things that can theoretically
 

10055
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,389
all the things that can theoretically
happen to packets so i wind up spending

10056
02:55:10,389 --> 02:55:10,399
happen to packets so i wind up spending
 

10057
02:55:10,399 --> 02:55:11,750
happen to packets so i wind up spending
all this time thinking about how do we

10058
02:55:11,750 --> 02:55:11,760
all this time thinking about how do we
 

10059
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:13,830
all this time thinking about how do we
deal about all that and it turns out of

10060
02:55:13,830 --> 02:55:13,840
deal about all that and it turns out of
 

10061
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:15,349
deal about all that and it turns out of
course in the real world those are

10062
02:55:15,349 --> 02:55:15,359
course in the real world those are
 

10063
02:55:15,359 --> 02:55:17,030
course in the real world those are
things that yes theoretically can happen

10064
02:55:17,030 --> 02:55:17,040
things that yes theoretically can happen
 

10065
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:19,030
things that yes theoretically can happen
with multiple routes but they really

10066
02:55:19,030 --> 02:55:19,040
with multiple routes but they really
 

10067
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:21,990
with multiple routes but they really
aren't things that you're 99.999

10068
02:55:21,990 --> 02:55:22,000
aren't things that you're 99.999
 

10069
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:25,030
aren't things that you're 99.999
of your packets have to deal with i am

10070
02:55:25,030 --> 02:55:25,040
of your packets have to deal with i am
 

10071
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:27,190
of your packets have to deal with i am
so there was learning experiences about

10072
02:55:27,190 --> 02:55:27,200
so there was learning experiences about
 

10073
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:30,389
so there was learning experiences about
uh lots of that and like why when tcp is

10074
02:55:30,389 --> 02:55:30,399
uh lots of that and like why when tcp is
 

10075
02:55:30,399 --> 02:55:33,030
uh lots of that and like why when tcp is
appropriate versus udp and and how if

10076
02:55:33,030 --> 02:55:33,040
appropriate versus udp and and how if
 

10077
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:34,550
appropriate versus udp and and how if
you do things in udp you wind up

10078
02:55:34,550 --> 02:55:34,560
you do things in udp you wind up
 

10079
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:37,030
you do things in udp you wind up
reinventing tcp badly in almost all

10080
02:55:37,030 --> 02:55:37,040
reinventing tcp badly in almost all
 

10081
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:39,590
reinventing tcp badly in almost all
cases so you know there's there's good

10082
02:55:39,590 --> 02:55:39,600
cases so you know there's there's good
 

10083
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:41,990
cases so you know there's there's good

there
 

10101
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:57,429
there
and it was a while before you know there

02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:19,349
and this was right when microsoft was
starting to take off and i did

10182
02:57:19,349 --> 02:57:19,359
starting to take off and i did
 

10183
02:57:19,359 --> 02:57:21,830
starting to take off and i did
eventually you know convince him that

10184
02:57:21,830 --> 02:57:21,840
eventually you know convince him that
 

10185
02:57:21,840 --> 02:57:23,269
eventually you know convince him that
what we were doing was going to be

10186
02:57:23,269 --> 02:57:23,279
what we were doing was going to be
 

10187
02:57:23,279 --> 02:57:25,030
what we were doing was going to be
really amazing with quake it was going

10188
02:57:25,030 --> 02:57:25,040
really amazing with quake it was going
 

10189
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:26,950
really amazing with quake it was going
to it was going to be something nobody

10190
02:57:26,950 --> 02:57:26,960
to it was going to be something nobody
 

10191
02:57:26,960 --> 02:57:30,070
to it was going to be something nobody
had seen before it had these aspects of

10192
02:57:30,070 --> 02:57:30,080
had seen before it had these aspects of
 

10193
02:57:30,080 --> 02:57:31,750
had seen before it had these aspects of
what we were talking about and we had

10194
02:57:31,750 --> 02:57:31,760
what we were talking about and we had
 

10195
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:33,590
what we were talking about and we had
metaverse talk back then we you know we

10196
02:57:33,590 --> 02:57:33,600
metaverse talk back then we you know we
 

10197
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:35,910
metaverse talk back then we you know we
had read snow crash and we were we knew

10198
02:57:35,910 --> 02:57:35,920
had read snow crash and we were we knew
 

10199
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:38,870
had read snow crash and we were we knew
about this and uh michael was i was big

10200
02:57:38,870 --> 02:57:38,880
about this and uh michael was i was big
 

10201
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:40,469
about this and uh michael was i was big
into the science fiction and we would

10202
02:57:40,469 --> 02:57:40,479
into the science fiction and we would
 

10203
02:57:40,479 --> 02:57:42,230
into the science fiction and we would
talk about all that and kind of spin

10204
02:57:42,230 --> 02:57:42,240
talk about all that and kind of spin
 

10205
02:57:42,240 --> 02:57:44,309
talk about all that and kind of spin
this tale and it was some of the same

10206
02:57:44,309 --> 02:57:44,319
this tale and it was some of the same
 

10207
02:57:44,319 --> 02:57:46,150
this tale and it was some of the same
conversations that we have today about

10208
02:57:46,150 --> 02:57:46,160
conversations that we have today about
 

10209
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:48,150
conversations that we have today about
the metaverse about how you could have

10210
02:57:48,150 --> 02:57:48,160
the metaverse about how you could have
 

10211
02:57:48,160 --> 02:57:49,670
the metaverse about how you could have
different areas linked together by

10212
02:57:49,670 --> 02:57:49,680
different areas linked together by
 

10213
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:51,110
different areas linked together by
portals and you could have user

10214
02:57:51,110 --> 02:57:51,120
portals and you could have user
 

10215
02:57:51,120 --> 02:57:53,429
portals and you could have user
generated content and changing out all

10216
02:57:53,429 --> 02:57:53,439
generated content and changing out all
 

10217
02:57:53,439 --> 02:57:55,429
generated content and changing out all
these things so you really were creating

10218
02:57:55,429 --> 02:57:55,439
these things so you really were creating
 

10219
02:57:55,439 --> 02:57:57,670
these things so you really were creating
the metaverse with quake and we we

10220
02:57:57,670 --> 02:57:57,680
the metaverse with quake and we we
 

10221
02:57:57,680 --> 02:57:59,190
the metaverse with quake and we we
talked about things like philosophy you

10222
02:57:59,190 --> 02:57:59,200
talked about things like philosophy you
 

10223
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:01,030
talked about things like philosophy you
used to be advertised as a virtual

10224
02:58:01,030 --> 02:58:01,040
used to be advertised as a virtual
 

10225
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:03,429
used to be advertised as a virtual
reality experience you know that was the

10226
02:58:03,429 --> 02:58:03,439
reality experience you know that was the
 

10227
02:58:03,439 --> 02:58:06,070
reality experience you know that was the
first wave of virtual reality was in the

10228
02:58:06,070 --> 02:58:06,080
first wave of virtual reality was in the
 

10229
02:58:06,080 --> 02:58:08,230
first wave of virtual reality was in the
late 80s and early 90s you had like the

10230
02:58:08,230 --> 02:58:08,240
late 80s and early 90s you had like the
 

10231
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:09,750
late 80s and early 90s you had like the
lawn mower man

10232
02:58:09,750 --> 02:58:09,760
lawn mower man
 

10233
02:58:09,760 --> 02:58:11,349
lawn mower man
you know movie and you had time in

10234
02:58:11,349 --> 02:58:11,359
you know movie and you had time in
 

10235
02:58:11,359 --> 02:58:13,510
you know movie and you had time in
newsweek talking about the early vpl

10236
02:58:13,510 --> 02:58:13,520
newsweek talking about the early vpl
 

10237
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:16,389
newsweek talking about the early vpl
headsets and of course that cratered so

10238
02:58:16,389 --> 02:58:16,399
headsets and of course that cratered so
 

10239
02:58:16,399 --> 02:58:17,830
headsets and of course that cratered so
hard that people didn't want to look at

10240
02:58:17,830 --> 02:58:17,840
hard that people didn't want to look at
 

10241
02:58:17,840 --> 02:58:20,070
hard that people didn't want to look at
virtual reality for decades afterwards

10242
02:58:20,070 --> 02:58:20,080
virtual reality for decades afterwards
 

10243
02:58:20,080 --> 02:58:22,710
virtual reality for decades afterwards
where uh it was just it was spoken

10244
02:58:22,710 --> 02:58:22,720
where uh it was just it was spoken
 

10245
02:58:22,720 --> 02:58:24,710
where uh it was just it was spoken
mirrors it was not real in the sense

10246
02:58:24,710 --> 02:58:24,720
mirrors it was not real in the sense
 

10247
02:58:24,720 --> 02:58:26,710
mirrors it was not real in the sense
that you could actually do something

10248
02:58:26,710 --> 02:58:26,720
that you could actually do something
 

10249
02:58:26,720 --> 02:58:29,190
that you could actually do something
real and valuable with it but uh but

10250
02:58:29,190 --> 02:58:29,200
real and valuable with it but uh but
 

10251
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:31,349
real and valuable with it but uh but
still we had that kind of common set of

10252
02:58:31,349 --> 02:58:31,359
still we had that kind of common set of
 

10253
02:58:31,359 --> 02:58:33,590
still we had that kind of common set of
talking points and we were talking about

10254
02:58:33,590 --> 02:58:33,600
talking points and we were talking about
 

10255
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:36,230
talking points and we were talking about
what these games could uh could become

10256
02:58:36,230 --> 02:58:36,240
what these games could uh could become
 

10257
02:58:36,240 --> 02:58:37,830
what these games could uh could become
and how you'd like to see people

10258
02:58:37,830 --> 02:58:37,840
and how you'd like to see people
 

10259
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:39,510
and how you'd like to see people
building all of these creative things

10260
02:58:39,510 --> 02:58:39,520
building all of these creative things
 

10261
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:41,110
building all of these creative things
because we were seeing an explosion of

10262
02:58:41,110 --> 02:58:41,120
because we were seeing an explosion of
 

10263
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:43,510
because we were seeing an explosion of
work with doom at that time where people

10264
02:58:43,510 --> 02:58:43,520
work with doom at that time where people
 

10265
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:46,070
work with doom at that time where people
were doing amazingly cool things like we

10266
02:58:46,070 --> 02:58:46,080
were doing amazingly cool things like we
 

10267
02:58:46,080 --> 02:58:47,990
were doing amazingly cool things like we
saw cooler levels than we had built

10268
02:58:47,990 --> 02:58:48,000
saw cooler levels than we had built
 

10269
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,750
saw cooler levels than we had built
coming out of the user community and

10270
02:58:49,750 --> 02:58:49,760
coming out of the user community and
 

10271
02:58:49,760 --> 02:58:52,070
coming out of the user community and
then people finding ways to you know

10272
02:58:52,070 --> 02:58:52,080
then people finding ways to you know
 

10273
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:53,670
then people finding ways to you know
change the the characters in different

10274
02:58:53,670 --> 02:58:53,680
change the the characters in different
 

10275
02:58:53,680 --> 02:58:55,590
change the the characters in different
ways and it was great and we knew what

10276
02:58:55,590 --> 02:58:55,600
ways and it was great and we knew what
 

10277
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:57,670
ways and it was great and we knew what
we were doing in quake was removing

10278
02:58:57,670 --> 02:58:57,680
we were doing in quake was removing
 

10279
02:58:57,680 --> 02:58:59,990
we were doing in quake was removing
those last things there was some quirky

10280
02:58:59,990 --> 02:59:00,000
those last things there was some quirky
 

10281
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,910
those last things there was some quirky
things with a couple of the data types

10282
02:59:01,910 --> 02:59:01,920
things with a couple of the data types
 

10283
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:03,830
things with a couple of the data types
that didn't work right for overriding

10284
02:59:03,830 --> 02:59:03,840
that didn't work right for overriding
 

10285
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:05,510
that didn't work right for overriding
and then and then the core thing about

10286
02:59:05,510 --> 02:59:05,520
and then and then the core thing about
 

10287
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,269
and then and then the core thing about
the programming model

10288
02:59:07,269 --> 02:59:07,279
the programming model
 

10289
02:59:07,279 --> 02:59:08,790
the programming model
and i was definitely going to hit all of

10290
02:59:08,790 --> 02:59:08,800
and i was definitely going to hit all of
 

10291
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:10,790
and i was definitely going to hit all of
those in quake um

10292
02:59:10,790 --> 02:59:10,800
those in quake um
 

10293
02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:14,309
those in quake um
but the the graphics side of it was i

10294
02:59:14,309 --> 02:59:14,319
but the the graphics side of it was i
 

10295
02:59:14,319 --> 02:59:15,349
but the the graphics side of it was i
was still

10296
02:59:15,349 --> 02:59:15,359
was still
 

10297
02:59:15,359 --> 02:59:17,830
was still
i knew what i wanted to do and it was

10298
02:59:17,830 --> 02:59:17,840
i knew what i wanted to do and it was
 

10299
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:19,190
i knew what i wanted to do and it was
one of these

10300
02:59:19,190 --> 02:59:19,200
one of these
 

10301
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:21,190
one of these
hubris things where it's like well so

10302
02:59:21,190 --> 02:59:21,200
hubris things where it's like well so
 

10303
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:23,269
hubris things where it's like well so
far i've been able to kind of

10304
02:59:23,269 --> 02:59:23,279
far i've been able to kind of
 

10305
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:26,469
far i've been able to kind of
kick everything that i set out to go do

10306
02:59:26,469 --> 02:59:26,479
kick everything that i set out to go do
 

10307
02:59:26,479 --> 02:59:29,030
kick everything that i set out to go do
but quake was definitely a little bit

10308
02:59:29,030 --> 02:59:29,040
but quake was definitely a little bit
 

10309
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:31,030
but quake was definitely a little bit
more than could be comfortably chewed at

10310
02:59:31,030 --> 02:59:31,040
more than could be comfortably chewed at
 

10311
02:59:31,040 --> 02:59:34,309
more than could be comfortably chewed at
that point and i but michael was one of

10312
02:59:34,309 --> 02:59:34,319
that point and i but michael was one of
 

10313
02:59:34,319 --> 02:59:35,269
that point and i but michael was one of
the

10314
02:59:35,269 --> 02:59:35,279
the
 

10315
02:59:35,279 --> 02:59:36,790
the
one of the strongest programmers and

10316
02:59:36,790 --> 02:59:36,800
one of the strongest programmers and
 

10317
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:39,269
one of the strongest programmers and
graphics programmers that i knew he was

10318
02:59:39,269 --> 02:59:39,279
graphics programmers that i knew he was
 

10319
02:59:39,279 --> 02:59:41,429
graphics programmers that i knew he was
one of the people that i trusted to to

10320
02:59:41,429 --> 02:59:41,439
one of the people that i trusted to to
 

10321
02:59:41,439 --> 02:59:43,590
one of the people that i trusted to to
write assembly code you know better than

10322
02:59:43,590 --> 02:59:43,600
write assembly code you know better than
 

10323
02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:45,750
write assembly code you know better than
i could and there's there's a few people

10324
02:59:45,750 --> 02:59:45,760
i could and there's there's a few people
 

10325
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:47,349
i could and there's there's a few people
that i can point to about things like

10326
02:59:47,349 --> 02:59:47,359
that i can point to about things like
 

10327
02:59:47,359 --> 02:59:49,910
that i can point to about things like
this where i'm a world-class optimizer i

10328
02:59:49,910 --> 02:59:49,920
this where i'm a world-class optimizer i
 

10329
02:59:49,920 --> 02:59:52,469
this where i'm a world-class optimizer i
mean i make things go fast but i

10330
02:59:52,469 --> 02:59:52,479
mean i make things go fast but i
 

10331
02:59:52,479 --> 02:59:54,550
mean i make things go fast but i
recognize there's a number of people

10332
02:59:54,550 --> 02:59:54,560
recognize there's a number of people
 

10333
02:59:54,560 --> 02:59:56,710
recognize there's a number of people
that can write tighter assembly code

10334

that can write tighter assembly code
 

10335
02:59:56,720 --> 02:59:59,269
that can write tighter assembly code
tighter sim decode or tighter cuda code

tighter sim decode or tighter cuda code
then you know then i can write i'm you

know my best strengths are a little bit

10340
03:00:04,150 --> 03:00:04,160
know my best strengths are a little bit
 

10341
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:06,070
know my best strengths are a little bit
more at the system level i mean i'm good

10342
03:00:06,070 --> 03:00:06,080
more at the system level i mean i'm good
 

10343
03:00:06,080 --> 03:00:07,750
more at the system level i mean i'm good
at all of that but

10344
03:00:07,750 --> 03:00:07,760
at all of that but
 

10345
03:00:07,760 --> 03:00:09,670
at all of that but
the most leverage comes from making the

your large scale problems so that these
 

10353
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:18,070
your large scale problems so that these
lower level problems are easier to do or

lower level problems are easier to do or
 

10355
03:00:18,080 --> 03:00:21,030
lower level problems are easier to do or
it makes it possible to do them in a

making a sacrifice in one place you can
get big advantages in another place is

capable of and then with this
 

10419
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:31,750

the ecosystem around it all the people

10422
03:01:33,830 --> 03:01:33,840
the ecosystem around it all the people
 

10423
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:36,309
the ecosystem around it all the people
that are that are working on it so there

10424
03:01:36,309 --> 03:01:36,319
that are that are working on it so there
 

10425
03:01:36,319 --> 03:01:38,790
that are that are working on it so there
are there are all these decisions and

10426
03:01:38,790 --> 03:01:38,800
are there are all these decisions and
 

10427
03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:40,790
are there are all these decisions and
they're never made in a globally optimal

they're never made in a globally optimal
 

10429
03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:43,269
they're never made in a globally optimal
way but sometimes you can drive a thread

10430
03:01:43,269 --> 03:01:43,279
way but sometimes you can drive a thread
 

10431
03:01:43,279 --> 03:01:45,110
way but sometimes you can drive a thread
of global optimality through it you

10432
03:01:45,110 --> 03:01:45,120
of global optimality through it you
 

10433
03:01:45,120 --> 03:01:46,550
of global optimality through it you
can't look at everything it's too

10434
03:01:46,550 --> 03:01:46,560
can't look at everything it's too
 

10435
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:49,030
can't look at everything it's too
complicated but sometimes you can step

10436
03:01:49,030 --> 03:01:49,040
complicated but sometimes you can step
 

10437
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:51,429
complicated but sometimes you can step
back up and make a different decision

10438
03:01:51,429 --> 03:01:51,439
back up and make a different decision
 

10439
03:01:51,439 --> 03:01:52,630
back up and make a different decision
and we kind of went through this on the

10440
03:01:52,630 --> 03:01:52,640
and we kind of went through this on the
 

10441
03:01:52,640 --> 03:01:55,429
and we kind of went through this on the

10485
03:02:41,600 --> 03:02:43,750
the end it was it was the right thing to
do where we wound up changing that

10486
03:02:43,750 --> 03:02:43,760
do where we wound up changing that
 

10487
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:45,590
do where we wound up changing that
rasterization approach and we wound up

10488
03:02:45,590 --> 03:02:45,600
rasterization approach and we wound up
 

10489
03:02:45,600 --> 03:02:48,790
rasterization approach and we wound up
with a super optimized assembly language

10490
03:02:48,790 --> 03:02:48,800
with a super optimized assembly language
 

10491
03:02:48,800 --> 03:02:51,429
with a super optimized assembly language
core loop and then a good system around

10492
03:02:51,429 --> 03:02:51,439
core loop and then a good system around
 

10493
03:02:51,439 --> 03:02:53,190
core loop and then a good system around
it which minimized how much that had to

10494
03:02:53,190 --> 03:02:53,200
it which minimized how much that had to
 

10495
03:02:53,200 --> 03:02:55,510
it which minimized how much that had to
be called and so in order to be able to

10496
03:02:55,510 --> 03:02:55,520
be called and so in order to be able to
 

10497
03:02:55,520 --> 03:02:58,070
be called and so in order to be able to
do this kind of system level thinking

10498
03:02:58,070 --> 03:02:58,080
do this kind of system level thinking
 

10499
03:02:58,080 --> 03:03:00,630
do this kind of system level thinking
whether we're talking about

10500
03:03:00,630 --> 03:03:00,640
whether we're talking about
 

10501
03:03:00,640 --> 03:03:02,469
whether we're talking about
game development

10519
03:03:18,479 --> 03:03:20,389

that's where a lot of these things

10520
03:03:20,389 --> 03:03:20,399
that's where a lot of these things
 

10521
03:03:20,399 --> 03:03:22,230
that's where a lot of these things
become possible when you're really when

10522
03:03:22,230 --> 03:03:22,240
become possible when you're really when
 

10523
03:03:22,240 --> 03:03:23,830
become possible when you're really when
you're bringing the future forward i

10524
03:03:23,830 --> 03:03:23,840
you're bringing the future forward i
 

10525
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:25,190
you're bringing the future forward i
mean there's a pace that everything just

10526
03:03:25,190 --> 03:03:25,200
mean there's a pace that everything just
 

10527
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:26,950
mean there's a pace that everything just
kind of glides towards where we have a

10528
03:03:26,950 --> 03:03:26,960
kind of glides towards where we have a
 

10529
03:03:26,960 --> 03:03:28,710
kind of glides towards where we have a
lot of progress that's happening at such

10530
03:03:28,710 --> 03:03:28,720
lot of progress that's happening at such
 

10531
03:03:28,720 --> 03:03:30,710
lot of progress that's happening at such
a dif so many different ways you kind of

10532
03:03:30,710 --> 03:03:30,720
a dif so many different ways you kind of
 

10533
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:32,870
a dif so many different ways you kind of
slide towards progress just left your

it wasn't clear if they were going to

10538
03:03:36,469 --> 03:03:36,479
it wasn't clear if they were going to
 

10539
03:03:36,479 --> 03:03:38,550
it wasn't clear if they were going to
get fatter more than they get quicker

10540
03:03:38,550 --> 03:03:38,560
get fatter more than they get quicker
 

10541
03:03:38,560 --> 03:03:40,550
get fatter more than they get quicker
than they get faster and it cancels out

10542
03:03:40,550 --> 03:03:40,560
than they get faster and it cancels out
 

10543
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:42,469
than they get faster and it cancels out
but it is clear now in retrospect no

10544
03:03:42,469 --> 03:03:42,479
but it is clear now in retrospect no
 

10545
03:03:42,479 --> 03:03:44,550
but it is clear now in retrospect no
programs just get faster and have gotten

03:03:44,550 --> 03:03:44,560
programs just get faster and have gotten
 

10547
03:03:44,560 --> 03:03:47,110
programs just get faster and have gotten
faster for a long time but if you want

10548
03:03:47,110 --> 03:03:47,120
faster for a long time but if you want
 

10549
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:48,630
faster for a long time but if you want
to do something like back at that

10550
03:03:48,630 --> 03:03:48,640
to do something like back at that
 

10551
03:03:48,640 --> 03:03:49,750

scrolling games say what this needs to
be five times faster well we can wait

03:03:55,910 --> 03:03:55,920
be five times faster well we can wait
 

10559
03:03:55,920 --> 03:03:58,469
be five times faster well we can wait
six years and just it'll naturally get

03:03:58,469 --> 03:03:58,479
six years and just it'll naturally get
 

10561
03:03:58,479 --> 03:04:01,110
six years and just it'll naturally get
that much faster at that time or you

10562
03:04:01,110 --> 03:04:01,120
that much faster at that time or you
 

10563
03:04:01,120 --> 03:04:02,790
that much faster at that time or you
come up with some really clever way of

03:04:02,790 --> 03:04:02,800
come up with some really clever way of
 

10565
03:04:02,800 --> 03:04:04,630
come up with some really clever way of
doing it so there are those

doing it so there are those

opportunities like that in a whole bunch
 

10569

everyone's work a day type stuff so
 

10581
03:04:17,279 --> 03:04:19,349
everyone's work a day type stuff so
everyone doesn't have to know how all

10582
03:04:19,349 --> 03:04:19,359
everyone doesn't have to know how all
 

10583
03:04:19,359 --> 03:04:20,790
everyone doesn't have to know how all
these things work they don't have to

10584
03:04:20,790 --> 03:04:20,800
these things work they don't have to
 

10585
03:04:20,800 --> 03:04:23,190
these things work they don't have to
know how their compiler works how you

10586
03:04:23,190 --> 03:04:23,200
know how their compiler works how you
 

10587
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:25,429
know how their compiler works how you
know the processor chip manages cache

10588

but
 

10593
03:04:28,880 --> 03:04:30,389

sometimes there are powerful

03:04:30,389 --> 03:04:30,399
sometimes there are powerful
 

10595
03:04:30,399 --> 03:04:32,469
sometimes there are powerful
opportunities that you can look at and

10596
03:04:32,469 --> 03:04:32,479
opportunities that you can look at and
 

10597
03:04:32,479 --> 03:04:36,150
opportunities that you can look at and
say we can bring the future five years

10598
03:04:36,150 --> 03:04:36,160
say we can bring the future five years
 

10599
03:04:36,160 --> 03:04:38,230
say we can bring the future five years
faster you know we can do something that

10600
03:04:38,230 --> 03:04:38,240
faster you know we can do something that
 

10601
03:04:38,240 --> 03:04:40,150
faster you know we can do something that
wouldn't it be great if we could do this

10602
03:04:40,150 --> 03:04:40,160
wouldn't it be great if we could do this
 

10603
03:04:40,160 --> 03:04:42,550
wouldn't it be great if we could do this
well we can do it today if we make a

10604
03:04:42,550 --> 03:04:42,560
well we can do it today if we make a
 

10605
03:04:42,560 --> 03:04:45,590
well we can do it today if we make a
certain set of decisions and it is in

10606
03:04:45,590 --> 03:04:45,600
certain set of decisions and it is in
 

10607
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:47,429
certain set of decisions and it is in
some ways smoke and mirrors where you

10608
03:04:47,429 --> 03:04:47,439
some ways smoke and mirrors where you
 

10609
03:04:47,439 --> 03:04:49,830
some ways smoke and mirrors where you
say it's like doom was a lot of smoke

10610
03:04:49,830 --> 03:04:49,840
say it's like doom was a lot of smoke
 

10611
03:04:49,840 --> 03:04:51,349
say it's like doom was a lot of smoke
and mirrors where people thought it was

10612
03:04:51,349 --> 03:04:51,359
and mirrors where people thought it was
 

10613
03:04:51,359 --> 03:04:53,830
and mirrors where people thought it was
more capable than it actually was but we

10614
03:04:53,830 --> 03:04:53,840
more capable than it actually was but we
 

10615
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:55,990
more capable than it actually was but we
picked the right smoke and mirrors to

10616
03:04:55,990 --> 03:04:56,000
picked the right smoke and mirrors to
 

10617
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,070
picked the right smoke and mirrors to
deploy in the game where

10618
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,080
deploy in the game where
 

10619
03:04:58,080 --> 03:04:59,830
deploy in the game where
by doing this people will think that

10620
03:04:59,830 --> 03:04:59,840
by doing this people will think that
 

10621
03:04:59,840 --> 03:05:01,429
by doing this people will think that
it's more general if we're going to

10622
03:05:01,429 --> 03:05:01,439
it's more general if we're going to
 

10623
03:05:01,439 --> 03:05:03,269
it's more general if we're going to
amaze them with what they've got here

10624
03:05:03,269 --> 03:05:03,279
amaze them with what they've got here
 

10625
03:05:03,279 --> 03:05:04,870
amaze them with what they've got here
and they won't notice

10626
03:05:04,870 --> 03:05:04,880
and they won't notice
 

10627
03:05:04,880 --> 03:05:07,910
and they won't notice
that it doesn't do these other things so

10628
03:05:07,910 --> 03:05:07,920
that it doesn't do these other things so
 

10629
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:09,750
that it doesn't do these other things so
smart decision making at that point

10630
03:05:09,750 --> 03:05:09,760
smart decision making at that point
 

10631
03:05:09,760 --> 03:05:11,110
smart decision making at that point
that's where that

10632
03:05:11,110 --> 03:05:11,120
that's where that
 

10633
03:05:11,120 --> 03:05:12,230
that's where that
that kind of

10634
03:05:12,230 --> 03:05:12,240
that kind of
 

10635
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:15,910
that kind of
global holistic top-down view uh can

10636
03:05:15,910 --> 03:05:15,920
global holistic top-down view uh can
 

10637
03:05:15,920 --> 03:05:17,190
global holistic top-down view uh can
work and

10638
03:05:17,190 --> 03:05:17,200
work and
 

10639
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:18,389
work and
i'm

03:05:18,389 --> 03:05:18,399
i'm

03:05:18,399 --> 03:05:20,309
i'm
i'm really a strong believer that

03:05:20,309 --> 03:05:20,319
i'm really a strong believer that
 

10643
03:05:20,319 --> 03:05:21,590
i'm really a strong believer that
technology

10644
03:05:21,590 --> 03:05:21,600
technology
 

10645
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:22,790
technology
should be

10646
03:05:22,790 --> 03:05:22,800
should be
 

10647
03:05:22,800 --> 03:05:24,309
should be
sitting at that table having those

10648
03:05:24,309 --> 03:05:24,319
sitting at that table having those
 

10649
03:05:24,319 --> 03:05:26,070
sitting at that table having those
discussions because you do have cases

10650
03:05:26,070 --> 03:05:26,080
discussions because you do have cases
 

10651
03:05:26,080 --> 03:05:27,190
discussions because you do have cases
where you say well you want to be the

10652
03:05:27,190 --> 03:05:27,200
where you say well you want to be the
 

10653
03:05:27,200 --> 03:05:29,429
where you say well you want to be the
jonathan ivy or whatever where it's a a

10654
03:05:29,429 --> 03:05:29,439
jonathan ivy or whatever where it's a a
 

10655
03:05:29,439 --> 03:05:32,870
jonathan ivy or whatever where it's a a
pure design solution and

10656
03:05:32,870 --> 03:05:32,880
pure design solution and
 

10657
03:05:32,880 --> 03:05:35,429
pure design solution and
that's i in some cases now where you

10658
03:05:35,429 --> 03:05:35,439
that's i in some cases now where you
 

10659
03:05:35,439 --> 03:05:37,670
that's i in some cases now where you
truly have almost infinite resources

10660
03:05:37,670 --> 03:05:37,680
truly have almost infinite resources
 

10661
03:05:37,680 --> 03:05:39,670
truly have almost infinite resources
like if you're trying to do a a

10662
03:05:39,670 --> 03:05:39,680
like if you're trying to do a a
 

10663
03:05:39,680 --> 03:05:41,590
like if you're trying to do a a
scrolling game on the pc now you don't

10664
03:05:41,590 --> 03:05:41,600
scrolling game on the pc now you don't
 

10665
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:43,510
scrolling game on the pc now you don't
even have to talk to a technology person

10666
03:05:43,510 --> 03:05:43,520
even have to talk to a technology person
 

10667
03:05:43,520 --> 03:05:45,990
even have to talk to a technology person
you can just have i you know any intern

10668
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:46,000
you can just have i you know any intern
 

10669
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:47,910
you can just have i you know any intern
can make that go run as fast as it needs

10670
03:05:47,910 --> 03:05:47,920
can make that go run as fast as it needs
 

10671

to there and it can be completely design

10672
03:05:49,910 --> 03:05:49,920
to there and it can be completely design
 

10673
03:05:49,920 --> 03:05:51,510
to there and it can be completely design
based but if you're trying to do

10674
03:05:51,510 --> 03:05:51,520
based but if you're trying to do
 

10675
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:54,389
based but if you're trying to do
something that's hard either that can't

10676
03:05:54,389 --> 03:05:54,399
something that's hard either that can't
 

10677
03:05:54,399 --> 03:05:56,630
something that's hard either that can't
be done for resources like vr on a

general intelligence it's probably going
 

10685
03:06:02,960 --> 03:06:04,790
general intelligence it's probably going
to be a matter of coming at it from an

10689
03:06:06,880 --> 03:06:08,389

some of the there are theoretical ways

03:06:12,710 --> 03:06:12,720
some of the there are theoretical ways
 

10697
03:06:12,720 --> 03:06:14,309
some of the there are theoretical ways
that you can say this is the optimal

learning algorithm that can solve
 

10701
03:06:15,760 --> 03:06:17,429

everything but it's completely

10702
03:06:17,429 --> 03:06:17,439
everything but it's completely
 

10703
03:06:17,439 --> 03:06:19,510
everything but it's completely
impractical you know you just can't do

10704
03:06:19,510 --> 03:06:19,520
impractical you know you just can't do
 

10705
03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:22,150
impractical you know you just can't do
that so clearly you have to make some

10706
03:06:22,150 --> 03:06:22,160
that so clearly you have to make some
 

10707
03:06:22,160 --> 03:06:25,269
that so clearly you have to make some
concessions for general intelligence and

10708
03:06:25,269 --> 03:06:25,279
concessions for general intelligence and
 

10709
03:06:25,279 --> 03:06:27,190

nobody knows what the right ones are yet

to come up with in that space

10716
03:06:33,910 --> 03:06:33,920
to come up with in that space
 

10717
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:36,150
to come up with in that space
it's been surprising to me and i think

10718
03:06:36,150 --> 03:06:36,160
it's been surprising to me and i think
 

10719
03:06:36,160 --> 03:06:38,710
it's been surprising to me and i think
perhaps it is a principle of progress

10720
03:06:38,710 --> 03:06:38,720
perhaps it is a principle of progress

perhaps it is a principle of progress
that smoke and mirrors somehow is the

that smoke and mirrors somehow is the
 

10723
03:06:40,800 --> 03:06:42,630

you kind of

10726
03:06:44,230 --> 03:06:44,240
you kind of
 

10727
03:06:44,240 --> 03:06:46,389
you kind of
you kind of fake it till you make it and

10728
03:06:46,389 --> 03:06:46,399
you kind of fake it till you make it and
 

10729
03:06:46,399 --> 03:06:47,990
you kind of fake it till you make it and
you almost always make it and i think

10730
03:06:47,990 --> 03:06:48,000
you almost always make it and i think
 

10731
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:49,590
you almost always make it and i think
that's going to be the way we achieve

there's you know philosophers debate

about the touring test

03:06:59,760 --> 03:07:01,910
about the touring test
is essentially about faking it till you

10742
03:07:01,910 --> 03:07:01,920
is essentially about faking it till you
 

10743
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:05,349
is essentially about faking it till you
make it you start by faking it and i

10744
03:07:05,349 --> 03:07:05,359
make it you start by faking it and i

03:16:02,950 --> 03:16:02,960
oculus was acquired by facebook now meta
 

11261
03:16:02,960 --> 03:16:04,710
oculus was acquired by facebook now meta
in 2014.

11262
03:16:04,710 --> 03:16:04,720
in 2014.
 

11263
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:06,550
in 2014.
you've spoken brilliantly about both the

11264
03:16:06,550 --> 03:16:06,560
you've spoken brilliantly about both the
 

11265
03:16:06,560 --> 03:16:08,389
you've spoken brilliantly about both the
low-level details the experimental

11266
03:16:08,389 --> 03:16:08,399
low-level details the experimental
 

11267
03:16:08,399 --> 03:16:10,150
low-level details the experimental
design and the big picture vision of

11268
03:16:10,150 --> 03:16:10,160
design and the big picture vision of
 

11269
03:16:10,160 --> 03:16:11,910
design and the big picture vision of
virtual reality

11270
03:16:11,910 --> 03:16:11,920
virtual reality
 

11271
03:16:11,920 --> 03:16:13,510
virtual reality
let me ask you about the uh the

11272
03:16:13,510 --> 03:16:13,520
let me ask you about the uh the
 

11273
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:15,750
let me ask you about the uh the
metaverse the big question here both

11274
03:16:15,750 --> 03:16:15,760
metaverse the big question here both
 

11275
03:16:15,760 --> 03:16:17,910
metaverse the big question here both
philosophically and technically

11276
03:16:17,910 --> 03:16:17,920
philosophically and technically
 

11277
03:16:17,920 --> 03:16:20,070
philosophically and technically
how hard is it to build the metaverse

11278
03:16:20,070 --> 03:16:20,080
how hard is it to build the metaverse
 

11279
03:16:20,080 --> 03:16:22,710
how hard is it to build the metaverse
what is the metaverse in your view you

11280
03:16:22,710 --> 03:16:22,720
what is the metaverse in your view you
 

11281
03:16:22,720 --> 03:16:24,150
what is the metaverse in your view you
started with discussing and thinking

11282
03:16:24,150 --> 03:16:24,160
started with discussing and thinking
 

11283
03:16:24,160 --> 03:16:27,110
started with discussing and thinking
about quake as a kind of a metaverse

11284
03:16:27,110 --> 03:16:27,120
about quake as a kind of a metaverse
 

11285
03:16:27,120 --> 03:16:29,670
about quake as a kind of a metaverse
as you think about it today what is the

11286
03:16:29,670 --> 03:16:29,680
as you think about it today what is the
 

11287
03:16:29,680 --> 03:16:31,190
as you think about it today what is the
metaverse

11288
03:16:31,190 --> 03:16:31,200
metaverse
 

11289
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:32,630
metaverse
the thing that could create this

11290
03:16:32,630 --> 03:16:32,640
the thing that could create this
 

11291
03:16:32,640 --> 03:16:35,190
the thing that could create this
compelling user value this experience

11292
03:16:35,190 --> 03:16:35,200
compelling user value this experience
 

11293
03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:37,429
compelling user value this experience
that will change the world and how hard

11294
03:16:37,429 --> 03:16:37,439
that will change the world and how hard
 

11295
03:16:37,439 --> 03:16:38,870
that will change the world and how hard
is it to build it

11296
03:16:38,870 --> 03:16:38,880
is it to build it
 

11297
03:16:38,880 --> 03:16:40,950
is it to build it
so the term comes from neil stephenson's

11298
03:16:40,950 --> 03:16:40,960
so the term comes from neil stephenson's
 

11299
03:16:40,960 --> 03:16:43,269
so the term comes from neil stephenson's
book snow crash which many of us had

11300
03:16:43,269 --> 03:16:43,279
book snow crash which many of us had
 

11301
03:16:43,279 --> 03:16:45,670
book snow crash which many of us had
read back in the 90s it was one of those

11302
03:16:45,670 --> 03:16:45,680
read back in the 90s it was one of those
 

11303
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:48,389
read back in the 90s it was one of those
kind of formative books and there was

11304
03:16:48,389 --> 03:16:48,399
kind of formative books and there was
 

11305
03:16:48,399 --> 03:16:49,910
kind of formative books and there was
this sense that

11306
03:16:49,910 --> 03:16:49,920
this sense that
 

11307
03:16:49,920 --> 03:16:51,910
this sense that
the

11308
03:16:51,910 --> 03:16:51,920
the
 

11309
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:53,750
the
the possibilities and kind of the the

11310
03:16:53,750 --> 03:16:53,760
the possibilities and kind of the the
 

11311
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:56,229
the possibilities and kind of the the
freedom and unlimited capabilities to

11312
03:16:56,229 --> 03:16:56,239
freedom and unlimited capabilities to
 

11313
03:16:56,239 --> 03:16:58,469
freedom and unlimited capabilities to
build a virtual world that that does

11314
03:16:58,469 --> 03:16:58,479
build a virtual world that that does
 

11315
03:16:58,479 --> 03:17:00,870
build a virtual world that that does
whatever you want whatever you ask of it

11316
03:17:00,870 --> 03:17:00,880
whatever you want whatever you ask of it
 

11317
03:17:00,880 --> 03:17:03,110
whatever you want whatever you ask of it
has been a powerful draw for generations

11318
03:17:03,110 --> 03:17:03,120
has been a powerful draw for generations
 

11319
03:17:03,120 --> 03:17:04,790
has been a powerful draw for generations
of developers you know game developers

11320
03:17:04,790 --> 03:17:04,800
of developers you know game developers
 

11321
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:06,389
of developers you know game developers
specifically and people that are

11322
03:17:06,389 --> 03:17:06,399
specifically and people that are
 

11323
03:17:06,399 --> 03:17:07,830
specifically and people that are
thinking about more

11324
03:17:07,830 --> 03:17:07,840
thinking about more
 

11325
03:17:07,840 --> 03:17:10,150
thinking about more
more general purpose applications

11326
03:17:10,150 --> 03:17:10,160
more general purpose applications
 

11327
03:17:10,160 --> 03:17:12,389
more general purpose applications
so we were talking about that back in

11328
03:17:12,389 --> 03:17:12,399
so we were talking about that back in
 

11329
03:17:12,399 --> 03:17:14,550
so we were talking about that back in
the doom and quake days about how do you

11330
03:17:14,550 --> 03:17:14,560
the doom and quake days about how do you
 

11331
03:17:14,560 --> 03:17:16,469
the doom and quake days about how do you
wind up with an interconnected set of

11332
03:17:16,469 --> 03:17:16,479
wind up with an interconnected set of
 

11333
03:17:16,479 --> 03:17:18,309
wind up with an interconnected set of
worlds that you kind of visit from one

11334
03:17:18,309 --> 03:17:18,319
worlds that you kind of visit from one
 

11335
03:17:18,319 --> 03:17:20,550
worlds that you kind of visit from one
to another and as web pages were

11336
03:17:20,550 --> 03:17:20,560
to another and as web pages were
 

11337
03:17:20,560 --> 03:17:22,070
to another and as web pages were
becoming a thing you start thinking

11338
03:17:22,070 --> 03:17:22,080
becoming a thing you start thinking
 

11339
03:17:22,080 --> 03:17:25,110
becoming a thing you start thinking
about how what is the interactive kind

11340
03:17:25,110 --> 03:17:25,120
about how what is the interactive kind
 

11341
03:17:25,120 --> 03:17:27,750
about how what is the interactive kind
of 3d based equivalent of this and there

11342
03:17:27,750 --> 03:17:27,760
of 3d based equivalent of this and there
 

11343
03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:30,070
of 3d based equivalent of this and there
were a lot of really bad takes you had

11344
03:17:30,070 --> 03:17:30,080
were a lot of really bad takes you had
 

11345
03:17:30,080 --> 03:17:32,229
were a lot of really bad takes you had
like verbal then

11346
03:17:32,229 --> 03:17:32,239
like verbal then
 

11347
03:17:32,239 --> 03:17:34,150
like verbal then
virtual reality markup languages and

11348
03:17:34,150 --> 03:17:34,160
virtual reality markup languages and
 

11349
03:17:34,160 --> 03:17:36,790
virtual reality markup languages and
there's aspects like that that

11350
03:17:36,790 --> 03:17:36,800
there's aspects like that that
 

11351
03:17:36,800 --> 03:17:38,630
there's aspects like that that
that came from people saying well what

11352
03:17:38,630 --> 03:17:38,640
that came from people saying well what
 

11353
03:17:38,640 --> 03:17:40,469
that came from people saying well what
would what kind of capabilities should

11354
03:17:40,469 --> 03:17:40,479
would what kind of capabilities should
 

11355
03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:42,070
would what kind of capabilities should
we develop to

11356
03:17:42,070 --> 03:17:42,080
we develop to
 

11357
03:17:42,080 --> 03:17:44,229
we develop to
to enable this and that kind of

11358
03:17:44,229 --> 03:17:44,239
to enable this and that kind of
 

11359
03:17:44,239 --> 03:17:46,710
to enable this and that kind of
capability first work has usually not

11360
03:17:46,710 --> 03:17:46,720
capability first work has usually not
 

11361
03:17:46,720 --> 03:17:48,870
capability first work has usually not
panned out very well

11362
03:17:48,870 --> 03:17:48,880
panned out very well
 

11363
03:17:48,880 --> 03:17:50,950
panned out very well
on the other hand we have successful

11364
03:17:50,950 --> 03:17:50,960
on the other hand we have successful
 

11365
03:17:50,960 --> 03:17:53,030
on the other hand we have successful
games that started with things like doom

11366
03:17:53,030 --> 03:17:53,040
games that started with things like doom
 

11367
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:54,710
games that started with things like doom
and quake and communities that formed

11368
03:17:54,710 --> 03:17:54,720
and quake and communities that formed
 

11369
03:17:54,720 --> 03:17:56,870
and quake and communities that formed
around those and uh whether it was

11370
03:17:56,870 --> 03:17:56,880
around those and uh whether it was
 

11371
03:17:56,880 --> 03:17:58,870
around those and uh whether it was
server lists in the early days or you

11372
03:17:58,870 --> 03:17:58,880
server lists in the early days or you
 

11373
03:17:58,880 --> 03:18:00,710
server lists in the early days or you
know literal portaling between different

11374
03:18:00,710 --> 03:18:00,720
know literal portaling between different
 

11375
03:18:00,720 --> 03:18:03,830
know literal portaling between different
games and then modern things that are on

11376
03:18:03,830 --> 03:18:03,840
games and then modern things that are on
 

11377
03:18:03,840 --> 03:18:05,349
games and then modern things that are on
completely different order of magnitude

11378
03:18:05,349 --> 03:18:05,359
completely different order of magnitude
 

11379
03:18:05,359 --> 03:18:07,670
completely different order of magnitude
like minecraft and fortnite that have

11380
03:18:07,670 --> 03:18:07,680
like minecraft and fortnite that have
 

11381
03:18:07,680 --> 03:18:10,150
like minecraft and fortnite that have
100 million plus users

11382
03:18:10,150 --> 03:18:10,160
100 million plus users
 

11383
03:18:10,160 --> 03:18:11,429
100 million plus users
um

11384
03:18:11,429 --> 03:18:11,439
um
 

11385
03:18:11,439 --> 03:18:12,950
um
you know i still think that that's the

11386
03:18:12,950 --> 03:18:12,960
you know i still think that that's the
 

11387
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:15,110
you know i still think that that's the
right way to go to build the metaverse

11388
03:18:15,110 --> 03:18:15,120
right way to go to build the metaverse
 

11389
03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:17,269
right way to go to build the metaverse
is you build something that's amazing

11390
03:18:17,269 --> 03:18:17,279
is you build something that's amazing
 

11391
03:18:17,279 --> 03:18:18,870
is you build something that's amazing
that people love and people wind up

11392
03:18:18,870 --> 03:18:18,880
that people love and people wind up
 

11393
03:18:18,880 --> 03:18:20,790
that people love and people wind up
spending all their time in

11394
03:18:20,790 --> 03:18:20,800
spending all their time in
 

11395
03:18:20,800 --> 03:18:22,710
spending all their time in
because it's awesome and you expand the

11396
03:18:22,710 --> 03:18:22,720
because it's awesome and you expand the
 

11397
03:18:22,720 --> 03:18:24,870
because it's awesome and you expand the
capabilities of that so yeah even if

11398
03:18:24,870 --> 03:18:24,880
capabilities of that so yeah even if
 

11399
03:18:24,880 --> 03:18:27,429
capabilities of that so yeah even if
it's a very basic experience

11400
03:18:27,429 --> 03:18:27,439
it's a very basic experience
 

11401
03:18:27,439 --> 03:18:29,670
it's a very basic experience
minecraft is minecraft is an amazing

11402
03:18:29,670 --> 03:18:29,680
minecraft is minecraft is an amazing
 

11403
03:18:29,680 --> 03:18:31,750
minecraft is minecraft is an amazing
case study in so many things

11404
03:18:31,750 --> 03:18:31,760
case study in so many things
 

11405
03:18:31,760 --> 03:18:33,510
case study in so many things
basically what's going on

11406
03:18:33,510 --> 03:18:33,520
basically what's going on
 

11407
03:18:33,520 --> 03:18:36,790
basically what's going on

so maybe there's a historian
 

11563
03:21:26,080 --> 03:21:27,670
so maybe there's a historian
out there that could really identify

11564
03:21:27,670 --> 03:21:27,680
out there that could really identify
 

11565
03:21:27,680 --> 03:21:29,429
out there that could really identify
that moment

11566
03:21:29,429 --> 03:21:29,439
that moment
 

11567
03:21:29,439 --> 03:21:31,990
that moment
data-driven way it could be like myspace

11568
03:21:31,990 --> 03:21:32,000
data-driven way it could be like myspace
 

11569
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:33,510
data-driven way it could be like myspace
or something like that

11570
03:21:33,510 --> 03:21:33,520
or something like that
 

11571
03:21:33,520 --> 03:21:36,070
or something like that
maybe the first major social network

11572
03:21:36,070 --> 03:21:36,080
maybe the first major social network
 

11573
03:21:36,080 --> 03:21:39,429
maybe the first major social network
that really reached into

11574
03:21:39,429 --> 03:21:39,439
that really reached into
 

11575
03:21:39,439 --> 03:21:42,389
that really reached into
non-geek world or something like that i

11576
03:21:42,389 --> 03:21:42,399
non-geek world or something like that i
 

11577
03:21:42,399 --> 03:21:43,990
non-geek world or something like that i
think that's kind of the fallacy of

11578
03:21:43,990 --> 03:21:44,000
think that's kind of the fallacy of
 

11579
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:46,309
think that's kind of the fallacy of
historians though looking for some of

11580
03:21:46,309 --> 03:21:46,319
historians though looking for some of
 

11581
03:21:46,319 --> 03:21:48,630
historians though looking for some of
those kind of primary dominant causes

11582
03:21:48,630 --> 03:21:48,640
those kind of primary dominant causes
 

11583
03:21:48,640 --> 03:21:51,429
those kind of primary dominant causes
where so many of these things are like

11584
03:21:51,429 --> 03:21:51,439
where so many of these things are like
 

11585
03:21:51,439 --> 03:21:53,590
where so many of these things are like
we see an exponential curve but it's not

11586
03:21:53,590 --> 03:21:53,600
we see an exponential curve but it's not
 

11587
03:21:53,600 --> 03:21:55,110
we see an exponential curve but it's not
because like one thing is going

11588
03:21:55,110 --> 03:21:55,120
because like one thing is going
 

11589
03:21:55,120 --> 03:21:57,269
because like one thing is going
exponential it's because we have

11590
03:21:57,269 --> 03:21:57,279
exponential it's because we have
 

11591
03:21:57,279 --> 03:21:59,030
exponential it's because we have
hundreds of little sigmoid curves

11592
03:21:59,030 --> 03:21:59,040
hundreds of little sigmoid curves
 

11593
03:21:59,040 --> 03:22:00,950
hundreds of little sigmoid curves
overlapped on top of each other and they

you've got something kind of going

03:22:04,479 --> 03:22:06,870
you've got something kind of going

historians will also write books about

03:22:40,160 --> 03:22:41,990
historians will also write books about

so people will go back and they will

11640
03:22:48,469 --> 03:22:48,479
so people will go back and they will
 

11641
03:22:48,479 --> 03:22:50,710
so people will go back and they will
name firsts and critical moments but

11642
03:22:50,710 --> 03:22:50,720
name firsts and critical moments but
 

11643
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:52,229
name firsts and critical moments but
it's probably going to be a poor

it's probably going to be a poor

and we've already seen like in the vr

03:22:56,950 --> 03:22:56,960
and we've already seen like in the vr
 

11649

it didn't play out the way we thought it
 

11653

it didn't play out the way we thought it
would in terms of what was going to be

would in terms of what was going to be
 

11655
03:23:02,080 --> 03:23:03,269
would in terms of what was going to be
like when

11656
03:23:03,269 --> 03:23:03,279
like when

the modern era of vr basically started

the modern era of vr basically started
 

11659
03:23:05,359 --> 03:23:07,670

right
 

11667
03:23:12,800 --> 03:23:15,429
right
and that didn't work out that way at all

11668
03:23:15,429 --> 03:23:15,439
and that didn't work out that way at all
 

11669

what's that make you
 

11679
03:23:26,160 --> 03:23:27,510
what's that make you

actually makes very clear sense when you

11688
03:23:37,830 --> 03:23:37,840
actually makes very clear sense when you
 

11689
03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:40,309
actually makes very clear sense when you
when you analyze it from from hindsight

11690

when you analyze it from from hindsight
 

11691
03:23:40,319 --> 03:23:41,830
when you analyze it from from hindsight
and look at the engineering reasons

11692
03:23:41,830 --> 03:23:41,840
and look at the engineering reasons
 

11693
03:23:41,840 --> 03:23:43,510
and look at the engineering reasons
where it's not just that it was a

where it's not just that it was a
 

11695
03:23:43,520 --> 03:23:45,910
where it's not just that it was a
magical quirky idea it was something

11696
03:23:45,910 --> 03:23:45,920
magical quirky idea it was something
 

11697
03:23:45,920 --> 03:23:47,990
magical quirky idea it was something

underestimated importance in vr was the
 

11705
03:23:54,319 --> 03:23:55,990
underestimated importance in vr was the
importance of the controllers you know i

was still thinking we could do a lot

11708
03:23:57,349 --> 03:23:57,359
was still thinking we could do a lot

was still thinking we could do a lot
more with uh with the gamepad and just

03:23:59,590 --> 03:23:59,600
more with uh with the gamepad and just
 

11711
03:23:59,600 --> 03:24:01,510
more with uh with the gamepad and just
the amazingness of taking any existing

03:28:24,309 --> 03:28:24,319
there is real value in the you know the
 

11959

there is real value in the you know the

it's all the little things that we need
 

11965
03:28:29,279 --> 03:28:31,269
it's all the little things that we need
to sort out but those are things that we

11966
03:28:31,269 --> 03:28:31,279
to sort out but those are things that we
 

11967
03:28:31,279 --> 03:28:33,670
to sort out but those are things that we
have line of sight on people you know

11968
03:28:33,670 --> 03:28:33,680
have line of sight on people you know
 

11969
03:28:33,680 --> 03:28:35,990
have line of sight on people you know
that have been in like a good vr meeting

11970
03:28:35,990 --> 03:28:36,000
that have been in like a good vr meeting

03:28:38,150 --> 03:28:38,160
using workrooms where you can say oh
 

11973
03:28:38,160 --> 03:28:40,469

that was better than a zoom meeting but

11974
03:28:40,469 --> 03:28:40,479
that was better than a zoom meeting but
 

11975
03:28:40,479 --> 03:28:42,389
that was better than a zoom meeting but
of course it's more of a hassle to get

11976
03:28:42,389 --> 03:28:42,399
of course it's more of a hassle to get
 

11977
03:28:42,399 --> 03:28:44,309
of course it's more of a hassle to get
into it not everyone has a headset

11978
03:28:44,309 --> 03:28:44,319
into it not everyone has a headset
 

11979
03:28:44,319 --> 03:28:47,030
into it not everyone has a headset
interoperability is worse you can't have

11980
03:28:47,030 --> 03:28:47,040
interoperability is worse you can't have
 

11981
03:28:47,040 --> 03:28:48,710
interoperability is worse you can't have
you cap out at a certain number there's

11982
03:28:48,710 --> 03:28:48,720
you cap out at a certain number there's
 

11983
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:50,550
you cap out at a certain number there's
all these things that need to be fixed

11984
03:28:50,550 --> 03:28:50,560
all these things that need to be fixed
 

11985
03:28:50,560 --> 03:28:51,750
all these things that need to be fixed
but that's one of those things you can

11986
03:28:51,750 --> 03:28:51,760
but that's one of those things you can
 

11987
03:28:51,760 --> 03:28:53,590
but that's one of those things you can
look at and say we know there's value

11988
03:28:53,590 --> 03:28:53,600
look at and say we know there's value
 

11989
03:28:53,600 --> 03:28:55,990
look at and say we know there's value
there we just need to really grind hard

11990
03:28:55,990 --> 03:28:56,000
there we just need to really grind hard
 

11991
03:28:56,000 --> 03:28:58,309
there we just need to really grind hard
to file off all the rough edges and make

11992
03:28:58,309 --> 03:28:58,319
to file off all the rough edges and make
 

11993
03:28:58,319 --> 03:29:00,389
to file off all the rough edges and make
that possible so you do think we have

11994
03:29:00,389 --> 03:29:00,399
that possible so you do think we have
 

11995
03:29:00,399 --> 03:29:01,990
that possible so you do think we have
line of sight

11996
03:29:01,990 --> 03:29:02,000
line of sight
 

11997
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:03,990
line of sight
because

11998
03:29:03,990 --> 03:29:04,000
because
 

11999
03:29:04,000 --> 03:29:06,870
because
there's a there's a reason like

12000
03:29:06,870 --> 03:29:06,880
there's a there's a reason like
 

12001
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:08,710
there's a there's a reason like
i i do this podcast in person for

i i do this podcast in person for
 

12003
03:29:08,720 --> 03:29:11,110
i i do this podcast in person for
example

12004
03:29:11,110 --> 03:29:11,120
example
 

12005
03:29:11,120 --> 03:29:12,710
example
doing it remotely

12006
03:29:12,710 --> 03:29:12,720
doing it remotely
 

12007
03:29:12,720 --> 03:29:14,950
doing it remotely
it's not the same and if you if somebody

12008
03:29:14,950 --> 03:29:14,960
it's not the same and if you if somebody
 

12009
03:29:14,960 --> 03:29:16,870
it's not the same and if you if somebody
were to ask me why it's not the same i

12010
03:29:16,870 --> 03:29:16,880
were to ask me why it's not the same i
 

12011
03:29:16,880 --> 03:29:18,830
were to ask me why it's not the same i
wouldn't be able to write down exactly

12012
03:29:18,830 --> 03:29:18,840
wouldn't be able to write down exactly
 

12013
03:29:18,840 --> 03:29:21,990
wouldn't be able to write down exactly
why um but you're saying

12014
03:29:21,990 --> 03:29:22,000
why um but you're saying
 

12015
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:24,550
why um but you're saying
that it's possible whatever the magic is

12016
03:29:24,550 --> 03:29:24,560
that it's possible whatever the magic is
 

12017
03:29:24,560 --> 03:29:26,950
that it's possible whatever the magic is
for in-person interaction

12018
03:29:26,950 --> 03:29:26,960
for in-person interaction
 

12019
03:29:26,960 --> 03:29:30,469
for in-person interaction
that immersiveness of the experience

12020
03:29:30,469 --> 03:29:30,479
that immersiveness of the experience
 

12021
03:29:30,479 --> 03:29:33,670
that immersiveness of the experience
we are almost there yes so the idea of

12022
03:29:33,670 --> 03:29:33,680
we are almost there yes so the idea of
 

12023
03:29:33,680 --> 03:29:35,269
we are almost there yes so the idea of
like i'm

12024
03:29:35,269 --> 03:29:35,279
like i'm
 

12025
03:29:35,279 --> 03:29:37,750
like i'm
doing a vr interview with someone i'm

12026
03:29:37,750 --> 03:29:37,760
doing a vr interview with someone i'm
 

12027
03:29:37,760 --> 03:29:39,990
doing a vr interview with someone i'm
not saying it's here right now but you

12028
03:29:39,990 --> 03:29:40,000
not saying it's here right now but you
 

12029
03:29:40,000 --> 03:29:42,630
not saying it's here right now but you
can see glimmers of what it should be

12030
03:29:42,630 --> 03:29:42,640
can see glimmers of what it should be
 

12031
03:29:42,640 --> 03:29:45,030
can see glimmers of what it should be
and we largely know what would need to

12032
03:29:45,030 --> 03:29:45,040
and we largely know what would need to
 

12033
03:29:45,040 --> 03:29:47,990
and we largely know what would need to
be fixed and improved to like you say

12034
03:29:47,990 --> 03:29:48,000
be fixed and improved to like you say
 

12035
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:50,070
be fixed and improved to like you say
there's a difference between a remote

12036
03:29:50,070 --> 03:29:50,080
there's a difference between a remote
 

12037
03:29:50,080 --> 03:29:51,990
there's a difference between a remote
interview doing a podcast over zoom or

03:29:51,990 --> 03:29:52,000
interview doing a podcast over zoom or
 

12039
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:54,469
interview doing a podcast over zoom or
something and face to face there's that

12040
03:29:54,469 --> 03:29:54,479
something and face to face there's that
 

12041
03:29:54,479 --> 03:29:56,710
something and face to face there's that
sense of presence that immediacy the

12042
03:29:56,710 --> 03:29:56,720
sense of presence that immediacy the
 

12043
03:29:56,720 --> 03:29:59,190
sense of presence that immediacy the

where
 

12095
03:30:52,239 --> 03:30:53,990
where
there was a lot of people that

there was a lot of people that
 

12097
03:30:54,000 --> 03:30:56,070
there was a lot of people that
especially rich people that would look

especially rich people that would look
 

12099
03:30:56,080 --> 03:30:58,550
especially rich people that would look
at vr and say it's like oh this just

12100
03:30:58,550 --> 03:30:58,560
at vr and say it's like oh this just
 

12101
03:30:58,560 --> 03:31:00,469
at vr and say it's like oh this just
isn't that good and i'd say it's like

12102
03:31:00,469 --> 03:31:00,479
isn't that good and i'd say it's like
 

12103
03:31:00,479 --> 03:31:02,870
isn't that good and i'd say it's like
well you've already been courtside

12104
03:31:02,870 --> 03:31:02,880
well you've already been courtside
 

12105
03:31:02,880 --> 03:31:05,110
well you've already been courtside
backstage and you know on pit row and

12106
03:31:05,110 --> 03:31:05,120
backstage and you know on pit row and
 

12107
03:31:05,120 --> 03:31:06,870
backstage and you know on pit row and
you've done all of these experiences

12108
03:31:06,870 --> 03:31:06,880
you've done all of these experiences
 

12109
03:31:06,880 --> 03:31:08,630
you've done all of these experiences
because you get to do them in real life

12110
03:31:08,630 --> 03:31:08,640
because you get to do them in real life
 

12111
03:31:08,640 --> 03:31:11,269
because you get to do them in real life
but most people don't get to and even if

12112
03:31:11,269 --> 03:31:11,279
but most people don't get to and even if
 

12113
03:31:11,279 --> 03:31:13,429
but most people don't get to and even if
the experience is only half as good if

12114
03:31:13,429 --> 03:31:13,439
the experience is only half as good if
 

12115
03:31:13,439 --> 03:31:14,550
the experience is only half as good if
it's something that they never would

12116
03:31:14,550 --> 03:31:14,560
it's something that they never would
 

12117
03:31:14,560 --> 03:31:16,630
it's something that they never would
have gotten to do before it's still a

03:31:16,630 --> 03:31:16,640
have gotten to do before it's still a
 

12119
03:31:16,640 --> 03:31:18,710
have gotten to do before it's still a
very good thing and as we can just we

12120
03:31:18,710 --> 03:31:18,720
very good thing and as we can just we
 

12121
03:31:18,720 --> 03:31:21,190
very good thing and as we can just we
can push that number up over time it has

12122
03:31:21,190 --> 03:31:21,200
can push that number up over time it has
 

12123
03:31:21,200 --> 03:31:22,550
can push that number up over time it has
a minimum

12124
03:31:22,550 --> 03:31:22,560
a minimum
 

12125
03:31:22,560 --> 03:31:25,110
a minimum

viable value level when it does
 

12127

viable value level when it does
something that is valuable enough to

03:31:26,790 --> 03:31:26,800
something that is valuable enough to
 

12129
03:31:26,800 --> 03:31:28,469
something that is valuable enough to
people as long as it's better inside the

12134
03:31:32,790 --> 03:31:32,800
and people choose to go there we're on
 

12135
03:31:32,800 --> 03:31:34,950
and people choose to go there we're on
the right path and we have a value

12136
03:31:34,950 --> 03:31:34,960
the right path and we have a value
 

12137
03:31:34,960 --> 03:31:36,870
the right path and we have a value
gradient that i'm just always hammering

03:31:36,870 --> 03:31:36,880
gradient that i'm just always hammering
 

12139
03:31:36,880 --> 03:31:38,550

on we can just follow this value

12140
03:31:38,550 --> 03:31:38,560
on we can just follow this value
 

12141
03:31:38,560 --> 03:31:40,950

rather than going for that one

12144
03:31:43,750 --> 03:31:43,760

03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:46,229
rather than going for that one
close your eyes swing for the fences

12146
03:31:46,229 --> 03:31:46,239
close your eyes swing for the fences
 

12147
03:31:46,239 --> 03:31:47,190
close your eyes swing for the fences
kind of

12148
03:31:47,190 --> 03:31:47,200
kind of
 

12149
03:31:47,200 --> 03:31:49,269
kind of
silver bullet approach well i wonder if

12150
03:31:49,269 --> 03:31:49,279
silver bullet approach well i wonder if
 

12151
03:31:49,279 --> 03:31:51,030
silver bullet approach well i wonder if
there's a value gradient for in-person

12152
03:31:51,030 --> 03:31:51,040
there's a value gradient for in-person
 

12153
03:31:51,040 --> 03:31:53,349
there's a value gradient for in-person
meetings because if you get that right

12154
03:31:53,349 --> 03:31:53,359
meetings because if you get that right
 

12155
03:31:53,359 --> 03:31:55,269
meetings because if you get that right
i mean that would change the world yeah

12156
03:31:55,269 --> 03:31:55,279
i mean that would change the world yeah
 

12157
03:31:55,279 --> 03:31:56,870
i mean that would change the world yeah
it doesn't need to

12158
03:31:56,870 --> 03:31:56,880
it doesn't need to
 

12159
03:31:56,880 --> 03:31:58,550
it doesn't need to
i mean you don't need uh ready player

12160
03:31:58,550 --> 03:31:58,560
i mean you don't need uh ready player
 

12161
03:31:58,560 --> 03:32:00,389
i mean you don't need uh ready player
one i but

12162
03:32:00,389 --> 03:32:00,399
one i but
 

12163
03:32:00,399 --> 03:32:02,710
one i but
i wonder if there's that value gradient

12164
03:32:02,710 --> 03:32:02,720
i wonder if there's that value gradient
 

12165
03:32:02,720 --> 03:32:05,110
i wonder if there's that value gradient
you can follow along

12166
03:32:05,110 --> 03:32:05,120
you can follow along
 

12167
03:32:05,120 --> 03:32:05,990
you can follow along
because

12168
03:32:05,990 --> 03:32:06,000
because
 

12169
03:32:06,000 --> 03:32:09,030
because
if there is and you follow it then uh

12170
03:32:09,030 --> 03:32:09,040
if there is and you follow it then uh
 

12171
03:32:09,040 --> 03:32:11,349
if there is and you follow it then uh
there will be a certain like phase shift

12172
03:32:11,349 --> 03:32:11,359
there will be a certain like phase shift
 

12173
03:32:11,359 --> 03:32:14,150
there will be a certain like phase shift
that's a certain point where people will

12174
03:32:14,150 --> 03:32:14,160
that's a certain point where people will
 

12175
03:32:14,160 --> 03:32:15,910
that's a certain point where people will
shift from um

12176
03:32:15,910 --> 03:32:15,920
shift from um
 

12177
03:32:15,920 --> 03:32:18,550
shift from um
from zoom to this

12178
03:32:18,550 --> 03:32:18,560
from zoom to this
 

12179
03:32:18,560 --> 03:32:21,429
from zoom to this
uh i wonder

12180
03:32:21,429 --> 03:32:21,439

 

12181
03:32:21,439 --> 03:32:23,510

what what are the bottlenecks is it

12182
03:32:23,510 --> 03:32:23,520
what what are the bottlenecks is it
 

12183
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:26,150
what what are the bottlenecks is it
software is it hardware is it like is it

12184
03:32:26,150 --> 03:32:26,160
software is it hardware is it like is it
 

12185
03:32:26,160 --> 03:32:29,110
software is it hardware is it like is it
is it all about latency so i have big

12186
03:32:29,110 --> 03:32:29,120
is it all about latency so i have big
 

12187
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:31,750
is it all about latency so i have big
arguments internally about strategic

12188
03:32:31,750 --> 03:32:31,760
arguments internally about strategic
 

12189
03:32:31,760 --> 03:32:34,309
arguments internally about strategic
things like that where i

12190
03:32:34,309 --> 03:32:34,319
things like that where i
 

12191
03:32:34,319 --> 03:32:36,469
things like that where i
like the next headset that's coming out

12192
03:32:36,469 --> 03:32:36,479
like the next headset that's coming out
 

12193
03:32:36,479 --> 03:32:38,150
like the next headset that's coming out
and that we've made various

12194
03:32:38,150 --> 03:32:38,160
and that we've made various
 

12195
03:32:38,160 --> 03:32:39,269
and that we've made various
announcements about is going to be a

12196
03:32:39,269 --> 03:32:39,279
announcements about is going to be a
 

12197
03:32:39,279 --> 03:32:41,269
announcements about is going to be a
higher end headset more expensive more

12198
03:32:41,269 --> 03:32:41,279
higher end headset more expensive more
 

12199
03:32:41,279 --> 03:32:42,950
higher end headset more expensive more
features lots of people want to make

12200
03:32:42,950 --> 03:32:42,960
features lots of people want to make
 

12201
03:32:42,960 --> 03:32:45,670
features lots of people want to make
those those trade-offs i you know we'll

12202
03:32:45,670 --> 03:32:45,680
those those trade-offs i you know we'll
 

12203
03:32:45,680 --> 03:32:47,830
those those trade-offs i you know we'll
see what the market has to say about the

12204
03:32:47,830 --> 03:32:47,840
see what the market has to say about the
 

12205
03:32:47,840 --> 03:32:49,910
see what the market has to say about the
exact trade-offs we've made here but if

12206
03:32:49,910 --> 03:32:49,920
exact trade-offs we've made here but if
 

12207
03:32:49,920 --> 03:32:51,670
exact trade-offs we've made here but if
you want to replace zoom you need to

12208
03:32:51,670 --> 03:32:51,680
you want to replace zoom you need to
 

12209
03:32:51,680 --> 03:32:54,630
you want to replace zoom you need to
have something that everybody has i'm

12210
03:32:54,630 --> 03:32:54,640
have something that everybody has i'm
 

12211
03:32:54,640 --> 03:32:57,429
have something that everybody has i'm
and so you like cheaper i like cheaper

12212
03:32:57,429 --> 03:32:57,439
and so you like cheaper i like cheaper
 

12213
03:32:57,439 --> 03:32:58,790
and so you like cheaper i like cheaper
because also

12214
03:32:58,790 --> 03:32:58,800
because also
 

12215
03:32:58,800 --> 03:33:01,830
because also
lighter and cheaper wind up being uh a

12216
03:33:01,830 --> 03:33:01,840
lighter and cheaper wind up being uh a
 

12217
03:33:01,840 --> 03:33:04,710
lighter and cheaper wind up being uh a
virtuous cycle there where expensive and

12218
03:33:04,710 --> 03:33:04,720
virtuous cycle there where expensive and
 

12219
03:33:04,720 --> 03:33:06,630
virtuous cycle there where expensive and
more features tends to also lead towards

12220
03:33:06,630 --> 03:33:06,640
more features tends to also lead towards
 

12221
03:33:06,640 --> 03:33:08,229
more features tends to also lead towards
heavier and it just kind of goes it's

12222
03:33:08,229 --> 03:33:08,239
heavier and it just kind of goes it's
 

12223
03:33:08,239 --> 03:33:09,590
heavier and it just kind of goes it's
like let's add more features the

12224
03:33:09,590 --> 03:33:09,600
like let's add more features the
 

12225
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:11,349
like let's add more features the
features are not uh

12226
03:33:11,349 --> 03:33:11,359
features are not uh
 

12227
03:33:11,359 --> 03:33:13,349
features are not uh
you know they have physical presence and

12228
03:33:13,349 --> 03:33:13,359
you know they have physical presence and
 

12229
03:33:13,359 --> 03:33:15,349
you know they have physical presence and
weight and draw from batteries and all

12230
03:33:15,349 --> 03:33:15,359
weight and draw from batteries and all
 

12231
03:33:15,359 --> 03:33:17,670
weight and draw from batteries and all
of those things so i've always favored a

12232
03:33:17,670 --> 03:33:17,680
of those things so i've always favored a
 

12233
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:21,269
of those things so i've always favored a
lower end uh cheaper faster approach

12234
03:33:21,269 --> 03:33:21,279
lower end uh cheaper faster approach
 

12235
03:33:21,279 --> 03:33:23,030
lower end uh cheaper faster approach
that's why i was always behind the

12236
03:33:23,030 --> 03:33:23,040
that's why i was always behind the
 

12237
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:25,030
that's why i was always behind the
mobile side of vr rather than the higher

12238
03:33:25,030 --> 03:33:25,040
mobile side of vr rather than the higher
 

12239
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:27,510
mobile side of vr rather than the higher
end pc headsets and i think that's you

12240
03:33:27,510 --> 03:33:27,520
end pc headsets and i think that's you
 

12241
03:33:27,520 --> 03:33:29,349
end pc headsets and i think that's you
know that's proven out well

12242
03:33:29,349 --> 03:33:29,359
know that's proven out well
 

12243
03:33:29,359 --> 03:33:31,670
know that's proven out well
but there's i you always ideally we have

12244
03:33:31,670 --> 03:33:31,680
but there's i you always ideally we have
 

12245
03:33:31,680 --> 03:33:33,349
but there's i you always ideally we have
a whole range of things but if you've

12246
03:33:33,349 --> 03:33:33,359
a whole range of things but if you've
 

12247
03:33:33,359 --> 03:33:35,510
a whole range of things but if you've
only got one or two things it's

12248
03:33:35,510 --> 03:33:35,520
only got one or two things it's
 

12249
03:33:35,520 --> 03:33:37,110
only got one or two things it's
important that those two things cover

12250
03:33:37,110 --> 03:33:37,120
important that those two things cover
 

12251
03:33:37,120 --> 03:33:37,750
important that those two things cover
the

12252
03:33:37,750 --> 03:33:37,760
the
 

12253
03:33:37,760 --> 03:33:39,349
the
uh you know the scope that you think is

12254
03:33:39,349 --> 03:33:39,359
uh you know the scope that you think is
 

12255
03:33:39,359 --> 03:33:41,190
uh you know the scope that you think is
most important when we're in a world

12256
03:33:41,190 --> 03:33:41,200
most important when we're in a world
 

12257
03:33:41,200 --> 03:33:42,710
most important when we're in a world
when it's like cell phones and there's

12258
03:33:42,710 --> 03:33:42,720
when it's like cell phones and there's
 

12259
03:33:42,720 --> 03:33:44,550
when it's like cell phones and there's
50 of them on the market covering every

12260
03:33:44,550 --> 03:33:44,560
50 of them on the market covering every
 

12261
03:33:44,560 --> 03:33:46,870
50 of them on the market covering every
conceivable ecological niche you want

12262
03:33:46,870 --> 03:33:46,880
conceivable ecological niche you want
 

12263
03:33:46,880 --> 03:33:48,389
conceivable ecological niche you want
that's going to be great but we're not

12264
03:33:48,389 --> 03:33:48,399
that's going to be great but we're not
 

12265
03:33:48,399 --> 03:33:50,070
that's going to be great but we're not
going to be there for a while where are

12266
03:33:50,070 --> 03:33:50,080
going to be there for a while where are
 

12267
03:33:50,080 --> 03:33:51,510
going to be there for a while where are
the bottlenecks

12268
03:33:51,510 --> 03:33:51,520
the bottlenecks
 

12269
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:53,670
the bottlenecks
is it the hardware the software yeah so

12270
03:33:53,670 --> 03:33:53,680
is it the hardware the software yeah so
 

12271
03:33:53,680 --> 03:33:55,510
is it the hardware the software yeah so
right now i

12272
03:33:55,510 --> 03:33:55,520
right now i
 

12273
03:33:55,520 --> 03:33:58,309
right now i
you can play you can get uh workrooms on

12274
03:33:58,309 --> 03:33:58,319
you can play you can get uh workrooms on
 

12275
03:33:58,319 --> 03:34:00,229
you can play you can get uh workrooms on
quest and you can set up these things

12276
03:34:00,229 --> 03:34:00,239
quest and you can set up these things
 

12277
03:34:00,239 --> 03:34:01,750
quest and you can set up these things
and it's a pretty good experience it's

12278
03:34:01,750 --> 03:34:01,760
and it's a pretty good experience it's
 

12279
03:34:01,760 --> 03:34:03,590
and it's a pretty good experience it's
surprisingly good i haven't tried it

12280
03:34:03,590 --> 03:34:03,600
surprisingly good i haven't tried it
 

12281
03:34:03,600 --> 03:34:05,750
surprisingly good i haven't tried it
it's surprisingly good

12282
03:34:05,750 --> 03:34:05,760
it's surprisingly good
 

12283
03:34:05,760 --> 03:34:08,309
it's surprisingly good
the voice latency is better on that than

12284
03:34:08,309 --> 03:34:08,319
the voice latency is better on that than
 

12285
03:34:08,319 --> 03:34:10,550
the voice latency is better on that than
a lot better than a zoom meeting so

12286
03:34:10,550 --> 03:34:10,560
a lot better than a zoom meeting so
 

12287
03:34:10,560 --> 03:34:12,070
a lot better than a zoom meeting so
you've got a more a better sense of

12288
03:34:12,070 --> 03:34:12,080
you've got a more a better sense of
 

12289
03:34:12,080 --> 03:34:15,030
you've got a more a better sense of
immediacy there the expressions that you

12290
03:34:15,030 --> 03:34:15,040
immediacy there the expressions that you
 

12291
03:34:15,040 --> 03:34:17,269
immediacy there the expressions that you
get from the the current hardware with

12292
03:34:17,269 --> 03:34:17,279
get from the the current hardware with
 

12293
03:34:17,279 --> 03:34:19,269
get from the the current hardware with
just kind of your controllers and your

12294
03:34:19,269 --> 03:34:19,279
just kind of your controllers and your
 

12295
03:34:19,279 --> 03:34:21,590
just kind of your controllers and your
head is pretty realistic feeling you've

12296
03:34:21,590 --> 03:34:21,600
head is pretty realistic feeling you've
 

12297
03:34:21,600 --> 03:34:23,190
head is pretty realistic feeling you've
got a pretty good sense of being there

12298
03:34:23,190 --> 03:34:23,200
got a pretty good sense of being there
 

12299
03:34:23,200 --> 03:34:26,150
got a pretty good sense of being there
with someone with are these like uh

12300
03:34:26,150 --> 03:34:26,160
with someone with are these like uh
 

12301
03:34:26,160 --> 03:34:28,710
with someone with are these like uh
avatars of people like do you do do you

12302
03:34:28,710 --> 03:34:28,720
avatars of people like do you do do you
 

12303
03:34:28,720 --> 03:34:30,870
avatars of people like do you do do you
get to see their body yeah

12304
03:34:30,870 --> 03:34:30,880
get to see their body yeah
 

12305
03:34:30,880 --> 03:34:33,190
get to see their body yeah
and they're sitting around a table yeah

12306
03:34:33,190 --> 03:34:33,200
and they're sitting around a table yeah
 

12307
03:34:33,200 --> 03:34:35,269
and they're sitting around a table yeah
and it feel it feels it's better than

12308
03:34:35,269 --> 03:34:35,279
and it feel it feels it's better than
 

12309
03:34:35,279 --> 03:34:36,710
and it feel it feels it's better than
zooming better than you yeah better than

12310
03:34:36,710 --> 03:34:36,720
zooming better than you yeah better than
 

12311
03:34:36,720 --> 03:34:40,150
zooming better than you yeah better than
you'd expect for that it is definitely

12312
03:34:40,150 --> 03:34:40,160
you'd expect for that it is definitely
 

12313
03:34:40,160 --> 03:34:41,830
you'd expect for that it is definitely
yeah i'd say it's it's quite a bit

12314
03:34:41,830 --> 03:34:41,840
yeah i'd say it's it's quite a bit
 

12315
03:34:41,840 --> 03:34:43,030
yeah i'd say it's it's quite a bit
better than zoom when everything's

12316
03:34:43,030 --> 03:34:43,040
better than zoom when everything's
 

12317
03:34:43,040 --> 03:34:45,269
better than zoom when everything's
working right but there's still all the

12318
03:34:45,269 --> 03:34:45,279
working right but there's still all the
 

12319
03:34:45,279 --> 03:34:47,590
working right but there's still all the
rough edges of the reason zoom became so

12320
03:34:47,590 --> 03:34:47,600
rough edges of the reason zoom became so
 

12321
03:34:47,600 --> 03:34:49,269
rough edges of the reason zoom became so
successful is because they just nailed

12322
03:34:49,269 --> 03:34:49,279
successful is because they just nailed
 

12323
03:34:49,279 --> 03:34:51,429
successful is because they just nailed
the usability of everything it's high

12324
03:34:51,429 --> 03:34:51,439
the usability of everything it's high
 

12325
03:34:51,439 --> 03:34:53,750
the usability of everything it's high
quality with a absolutely first-rate

12326
03:34:53,750 --> 03:34:53,760
quality with a absolutely first-rate
 

12327
03:34:53,760 --> 03:34:56,790
quality with a absolutely first-rate
experience and we are not there yet with

12328

03:43:32,870 --> 03:43:32,880
obviously startups really empower that
 

12817
03:43:32,880 --> 03:43:34,710
obviously startups really empower that
but big companies could too and that's

12818
03:43:34,710 --> 03:43:34,720
but big companies could too and that's
 

12819
03:43:34,720 --> 03:43:36,469
but big companies could too and that's
that's the design challenge for

12820
03:43:36,469 --> 03:43:36,479
that's the design challenge for
 

12821
03:43:36,479 --> 03:43:38,469
that's the design challenge for
companies for big companies to see how

12822
03:43:38,469 --> 03:43:38,479
companies for big companies to see how
 

12823
03:43:38,479 --> 03:43:40,790
companies for big companies to see how
can you enable that how can you power

12824
03:43:40,790 --> 03:43:40,800
can you enable that how can you power
 

12825
03:43:40,800 --> 03:43:42,229
can you enable that how can you power
the big company there are so many

resources there and they do
amazing things do get accomplished but

amazing things do get accomplished but
 

12831
03:43:47,279 --> 03:43:48,950
amazing things do get accomplished but
there's so much more that could come out

interesting problems that the two of you

12880
03:44:39,830 --> 03:44:39,840
interesting problems that the two of you
 

12881
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:41,110
interesting problems that the two of you
think about

12882
03:44:41,110 --> 03:44:41,120
think about
 

12883
03:44:41,120 --> 03:44:42,550
think about
you come from different worlds maybe

12884
03:44:42,550 --> 03:44:42,560
you come from different worlds maybe
 

12885
03:44:42,560 --> 03:44:44,950
you come from different worlds maybe
there's some intersection in the in

12886
03:44:44,950 --> 03:44:44,960
there's some intersection in the in
 

12887
03:44:44,960 --> 03:44:46,550
there's some intersection in the in
aerospace maybe there's some

12888
03:44:46,550 --> 03:44:46,560
aerospace maybe there's some
 

12889
03:44:46,560 --> 03:44:48,070

intelligence in terms of thinking is

12894
03:44:53,510 --> 03:44:53,520
intelligence in terms of thinking is
 

12895
03:44:53,520 --> 03:44:54,790

there something interesting you could

12896
03:44:54,790 --> 03:44:54,800
there something interesting you could
 

12897
03:44:54,800 --> 03:44:56,630
there something interesting you could
say about sort of the debates the two of

12898
03:44:56,630 --> 03:44:56,640
say about sort of the debates the two of
 

12899
03:44:56,640 --> 03:44:59,189
say about sort of the debates the two of
you have so i think in some ways we do

12900
03:44:59,189 --> 03:44:59,199
you have so i think in some ways we do
 

12901
03:44:59,199 --> 03:45:01,269
you have so i think in some ways we do
have a kind of similar background where

12902
03:45:01,269 --> 03:45:01,279
have a kind of similar background where
 

12903
03:45:01,279 --> 03:45:03,910
have a kind of similar background where
we're almost exactly the same age and we

12904
03:45:03,910 --> 03:45:03,920
we're almost exactly the same age and we
 

12905
03:45:03,920 --> 03:45:05,590
we're almost exactly the same age and we
had kind of similar programming

12906
03:45:05,590 --> 03:45:05,600
had kind of similar programming
 

12907
03:45:05,600 --> 03:45:07,670
had kind of similar programming
backgrounds on the personal computers

12908
03:45:07,670 --> 03:45:07,680
backgrounds on the personal computers
 

12909
03:45:07,680 --> 03:45:09,670
backgrounds on the personal computers
and you know even some of the the books

12910
03:45:09,670 --> 03:45:09,680
and you know even some of the the books
 

12911
03:45:09,680 --> 03:45:11,670
and you know even some of the the books
that we would read and things that would

12912
03:45:11,670 --> 03:45:11,680
that we would read and things that would
 

12913
03:45:11,680 --> 03:45:13,269
that we would read and things that would
kind of turn us into the people that we

12914
03:45:13,269 --> 03:45:13,279
kind of turn us into the people that we
 

12915
03:45:13,279 --> 03:45:14,550
kind of turn us into the people that we
are today

12916
03:45:14,550 --> 03:45:14,560
are today
 

12917
03:45:14,560 --> 03:45:17,750
are today
and i think there is a degree of

12918
03:45:17,750 --> 03:45:17,760
and i think there is a degree of
 

12919
03:45:17,760 --> 03:45:20,309
and i think there is a degree of
sensibility similarities where you know

12920
03:45:20,309 --> 03:45:20,319
sensibility similarities where you know
 

12921
03:45:20,319 --> 03:45:22,309
sensibility similarities where you know
we kind of call on the same

12922
03:45:22,309 --> 03:45:22,319
we kind of call on the same
 

12923
03:45:22,319 --> 03:45:24,389
we kind of call on the same
things and kind of see the same

12924
03:45:24,389 --> 03:45:24,399
things and kind of see the same
 

12925
03:45:24,399 --> 03:45:27,030
things and kind of see the same
opportunities in different technology

12926
03:45:27,030 --> 03:45:27,040
opportunities in different technology
 

12927
03:45:27,040 --> 03:45:28,950
opportunities in different technology
and there's that sense of you know i

12928
03:45:28,950 --> 03:45:28,960
and there's that sense of you know i
 

12929
03:45:28,960 --> 03:45:30,229
and there's that sense of you know i
always talk about the speed of light

12930
03:45:30,229 --> 03:45:30,239
always talk about the speed of light
 

12931
03:45:30,239 --> 03:45:32,070
always talk about the speed of light
solutions for things and he's thinking

12932
03:45:32,070 --> 03:45:32,080
solutions for things and he's thinking
 

12933
03:45:32,080 --> 03:45:34,870
solutions for things and he's thinking
about kind of minimum manufacturing and

12934
03:45:34,870 --> 03:45:34,880
about kind of minimum manufacturing and
 

12935
03:45:34,880 --> 03:45:36,150
about kind of minimum manufacturing and
engineering and

12936
03:45:36,150 --> 03:45:36,160
engineering and
 

12937
03:45:36,160 --> 03:45:38,870
engineering and
operational standpoints for things

12938
03:45:38,870 --> 03:45:38,880
operational standpoints for things
 

12939
03:45:38,880 --> 03:45:42,309
operational standpoints for things
and so i mean i first met elon right at

12940
03:45:42,309 --> 03:45:42,319
and so i mean i first met elon right at
 

12941
03:45:42,319 --> 03:45:44,309
and so i mean i first met elon right at
the start of the aerospace era where i

12942
03:45:44,309 --> 03:45:44,319
the start of the aerospace era where i
 

12943
03:45:44,319 --> 03:45:46,229
the start of the aerospace era where i

oxidizer for this and i
 

13107
03:48:43,199 --> 03:48:44,469
oxidizer for this and i
you know and like the the times that

this possible stuff i
 

13231
03:50:56,960 --> 03:50:58,630
this possible stuff i
seems likely that it's going to go that

13232

seems likely that it's going to go that
 

13233
03:50:58,640 --> 03:51:02,630
seems likely that it's going to go that
way and i said no i think less than 50

13234
03:51:02,630 --> 03:51:02,640
way and i said no i think less than 50
 

13235

chance that it's going to make it there
 

13237
03:51:05,359 --> 03:51:07,189
chance that it's going to make it there
and people you know we're kind of like

at almost everything but for me to be
 

13245
03:51:12,720 --> 03:51:15,030
at almost everything but for me to be
the the one kind of outlier saying no i

13246
03:51:15,030 --> 03:51:15,040
the the one kind of outlier saying no i
 

13247
03:51:15,040 --> 03:51:18,389
the the one kind of outlier saying no i
don't think so um then i started saying

13248
03:51:18,389 --> 03:51:18,399
don't think so um then i started saying
 

13249
03:51:18,399 --> 03:51:20,150

13271
03:51:41,120 --> 03:51:42,710
are people much better off than i was
there's a spectrum but

13272
03:51:42,710 --> 03:51:42,720
there's a spectrum but
 

13273
03:51:42,720 --> 03:51:44,950
there's a spectrum but
i am you know as soon as they started

13274
03:51:44,950 --> 03:51:44,960
i am you know as soon as they started
 

13275
03:51:44,960 --> 03:51:47,269
i am you know as soon as they started
think it's like oh i could lose money by

03:51:51,429 --> 03:51:51,439
and
 

13283
03:51:51,439 --> 03:51:52,950
and
all these engineers they engaged their

13284
03:51:52,950 --> 03:51:52,960
all these engineers they engaged their
 

13285
03:51:52,960 --> 03:51:54,309
all these engineers they engaged their
brain they started thinking it's like

13286
03:51:54,309 --> 03:51:54,319
brain they started thinking it's like
 

13287
03:51:54,319 --> 03:51:55,110
brain they started thinking it's like
okay

13288
03:51:55,110 --> 03:51:55,120
okay
 

13289
03:51:55,120 --> 03:51:58,309
okay
launch windows uh launch delays like how

13290
03:51:58,309 --> 03:51:58,319
launch windows uh launch delays like how
 

13291
03:51:58,319 --> 03:51:59,910
launch windows uh launch delays like how
many times would it take to get this

13292
03:51:59,910 --> 03:51:59,920
many times would it take to get this
 

13293
03:51:59,920 --> 03:52:01,830
many times would it take to get this
right what historical precedence do we

13294
03:52:01,830 --> 03:52:01,840
right what historical precedence do we
 

13295
03:52:01,840 --> 03:52:04,950
right what historical precedence do we
have and i and then it mostly came down

13296
03:52:04,950 --> 03:52:04,960
have and i and then it mostly came down
 

13297
03:52:04,960 --> 03:52:06,950
have and i and then it mostly came down
to it's like well what about in transit

13298
03:52:06,950 --> 03:52:06,960
to it's like well what about in transit
 

13299
03:52:06,960 --> 03:52:09,429
to it's like well what about in transit
by 2030 and then i've you know what

13300
03:52:09,429 --> 03:52:09,439
by 2030 and then i've you know what
 

13301
03:52:09,439 --> 03:52:11,349
by 2030 and then i've you know what
about i you know different things or

13302
03:52:11,349 --> 03:52:11,359
about i you know different things or
 

13303
03:52:11,359 --> 03:52:14,150
about i you know different things or
would you hand would you go for 2032 but

13304
03:52:14,150 --> 03:52:14,160
would you hand would you go for 2032 but
 

13305
03:52:14,160 --> 03:52:16,389
would you hand would you go for 2032 but
one of the people did go ahead and was

13306
03:52:16,389 --> 03:52:16,399
one of the people did go ahead and was
 

13307
03:52:16,399 --> 03:52:18,150
one of the people did go ahead and was
optimistic enough to make a bet with me

13308
03:52:18,150 --> 03:52:18,160
optimistic enough to make a bet with me
 

13309
03:52:18,160 --> 03:52:20,630
optimistic enough to make a bet with me
so i have a ten thousand dollar bet that

13310
03:52:20,630 --> 03:52:20,640
so i have a ten thousand dollar bet that
 

13311
03:52:20,640 --> 03:52:22,870
so i have a ten thousand dollar bet that
by 2030. i think it's going to happen

13312
03:52:22,870 --> 03:52:22,880
by 2030. i think it's going to happen
 

13313
03:52:22,880 --> 03:52:24,790
by 2030. i think it's going to happen
shortly thereafter i think there will

13314
03:52:24,790 --> 03:52:24,800
shortly thereafter i think there will
 

13315
03:52:24,800 --> 03:52:26,469
shortly thereafter i think there will
probably be infrastructure on mars by

13316
03:52:26,469 --> 03:52:26,479
probably be infrastructure on mars by
 

13317
03:52:26,479 --> 03:52:29,269
probably be infrastructure on mars by
2030 but i don't think that we'll have

13318
03:52:29,269 --> 03:52:29,279
2030 but i don't think that we'll have
 

13319
03:52:29,279 --> 03:52:31,429
2030 but i don't think that we'll have
humans on mars on 23rd i think it's

13320
03:52:31,429 --> 03:52:31,439
humans on mars on 23rd i think it's
 

13321
03:52:31,439 --> 03:52:34,229
humans on mars on 23rd i think it's
possible but i think it's less than a 50

13322
03:52:34,229 --> 03:52:34,239
possible but i think it's less than a 50
 

13323
03:52:34,239 --> 03:52:36,630
possible but i think it's less than a 50
chance so i felt safe making that bet

13324
03:52:36,630 --> 03:52:36,640
chance so i felt safe making that bet
 

13325
03:52:36,640 --> 03:52:38,870
chance so i felt safe making that bet

that should perhaps help people

13332
03:52:46,630 --> 03:52:46,640
that should perhaps help people

now and i think it will you think it

13388
03:53:48,870 --> 03:53:48,880
now and i think it will you think it
 

13389
03:53:48,880 --> 03:53:50,469
now and i think it will you think it
will and i think and the difference is

13390
03:53:50,469 --> 03:53:50,479
will and i think and the difference is
 

13391
03:53:50,479 --> 03:53:52,070
will and i think and the difference is
everybody looks at this it's like oh but

yet and the reason this is different
 

13399
03:53:58,560 --> 03:54:02,070

13401
03:54:02,080 --> 03:54:04,630
than the bet with mars is mars
really is more than as comfortable a bet

13402
03:54:04,630 --> 03:54:04,640
really is more than as comfortable a bet
 

13403
03:54:04,640 --> 03:54:07,750
really is more than as comfortable a bet
on elon musk i am you know that is you

13404
03:54:07,750 --> 03:54:07,760
on elon musk i am you know that is you
 

13405
03:54:07,760 --> 03:54:10,389
on elon musk i am you know that is you
know that is his thing and he is really

13406
03:54:10,389 --> 03:54:10,399
know that is his thing and he is really
 

13407
03:54:10,399 --> 03:54:12,389
know that is his thing and he is really
going to move heaven and earth to try to

13408
03:54:12,389 --> 03:54:12,399
going to move heaven and earth to try to
 

13409
03:54:12,399 --> 03:54:14,229
going to move heaven and earth to try to
to make that happen and perhaps not even

13410
03:54:14,229 --> 03:54:14,239
to make that happen and perhaps not even
 

13411
03:54:14,239 --> 03:54:15,990
to make that happen and perhaps not even
spacex yeah perhaps

13412
03:54:15,990 --> 03:54:16,000
spacex yeah perhaps
 

13413
03:54:16,000 --> 03:54:19,670
spacex yeah perhaps
just elon musk yeah because if if elon

13414
03:54:19,670 --> 03:54:19,680
just elon musk yeah because if if elon
 

13415
03:54:19,680 --> 03:54:21,990
just elon musk yeah because if if elon
went away and spacex went public and got

13416
03:54:21,990 --> 03:54:22,000
went away and spacex went public and got
 

13417
03:54:22,000 --> 03:54:23,910
went away and spacex went public and got
a board of directors i

13418
03:54:23,910 --> 03:54:23,920
a board of directors i
 

13419
03:54:23,920 --> 03:54:25,590
a board of directors i
there are more profitable things they

13420
03:54:25,590 --> 03:54:25,600
there are more profitable things they
 

13421
03:54:25,600 --> 03:54:27,910
there are more profitable things they
could be doing than focusing on human

13422
03:54:27,910 --> 03:54:27,920
could be doing than focusing on human
 

13423
03:54:27,920 --> 03:54:30,710
could be doing than focusing on human
presence on mars so this really is a

13424
03:54:30,710 --> 03:54:30,720
presence on mars so this really is a
 

13425
03:54:30,720 --> 03:54:32,710
presence on mars so this really is a
sort of personal thing there

13426
03:54:32,710 --> 03:54:32,720
sort of personal thing there
 

13427
03:54:32,720 --> 03:54:35,429
sort of personal thing there
and in contrast with that self-driving

13428
03:54:35,429 --> 03:54:35,439
and in contrast with that self-driving
 

13429
03:54:35,439 --> 03:54:38,790

03:54:41,750 --> 03:54:41,760
working really hard and while
 

13433
03:54:41,760 --> 03:54:44,150

yes it's going slower than most people

03:54:44,150 --> 03:54:44,160
yes it's going slower than most people
 

13435
03:54:44,160 --> 03:54:45,510
yes it's going slower than most people
thought it would

03:54:45,510 --> 03:54:45,520
thought it would
 

13437
03:54:45,520 --> 03:54:47,510
thought it would
betting against that is a bet against

13438
03:54:47,510 --> 03:54:47,520
betting against that is a bet against
 

13439
03:54:47,520 --> 03:54:50,070
betting against that is a bet against
almost the entire world in terms of all

13440
03:54:50,070 --> 03:54:50,080
almost the entire world in terms of all

13446
03:54:57,510 --> 03:54:57,520
you know one guy's passion project i
 

13447
03:54:57,520 --> 03:54:59,750
you know one guy's passion project i
and i do think that it is solvable i

13448
03:54:59,750 --> 03:54:59,760
and i do think that it is solvable i
 

13449
03:54:59,760 --> 03:55:01,429
and i do think that it is solvable i
although there's i recognize it's not

13450
03:55:01,429 --> 03:55:01,439
although there's i recognize it's not
 

13451
03:55:01,439 --> 03:55:03,910
although there's i recognize it's not
100 chance because it's possible the

13452
03:55:03,910 --> 03:55:03,920
100 chance because it's possible the
 

13453
03:55:03,920 --> 03:55:05,990
100 chance because it's possible the
long tail of self-driving problems winds

13454
03:55:05,990 --> 03:55:06,000
long tail of self-driving problems winds

03:55:06,000 --> 03:55:08,630
long tail of self-driving problems winds
up being an agi complete problem uh i

13456
03:55:08,630 --> 03:55:08,640
up being an agi complete problem uh i
 

13457
03:55:08,640 --> 03:55:10,229
up being an agi complete problem uh i
think there's plenty of value to mine

13458
03:55:10,229 --> 03:55:10,239
think there's plenty of value to mine
 

13459
03:55:10,239 --> 03:55:12,229
think there's plenty of value to mine
out of it with narrow ai and i think

13460
03:55:12,229 --> 03:55:12,239
out of it with narrow ai and i think
 

13461
03:55:12,239 --> 03:55:14,150
out of it with narrow ai and i think
that it's you know it's going to happen

13462
03:55:14,150 --> 03:55:14,160
that it's you know it's going to happen
 

13463
03:55:14,160 --> 03:55:16,550
that it's you know it's going to happen
probably more so than people expect but

13464
03:55:16,550 --> 03:55:16,560
probably more so than people expect but
 

13465
03:55:16,560 --> 03:55:18,870
probably more so than people expect but
it's that whole sigmoid curve where you

13466
03:55:18,870 --> 03:55:18,880
it's that whole sigmoid curve where you
 

13467
03:55:18,880 --> 03:55:20,630
it's that whole sigmoid curve where you
over you know you overestimate the

13468
03:55:20,630 --> 03:55:20,640
over you know you overestimate the
 

13469
03:55:20,640 --> 03:55:22,389
over you know you overestimate the
near-term progress and you underestimate

13470
03:55:22,389 --> 03:55:22,399
near-term progress and you underestimate
 

13471
03:55:22,399 --> 03:55:24,309
near-term progress and you underestimate
the long-term progress and i think

13472
03:55:24,309 --> 03:55:24,319
the long-term progress and i think
 

13473
03:55:24,319 --> 03:55:26,469
the long-term progress and i think
self-driving is going to be like that

13474
03:55:26,469 --> 03:55:26,479
self-driving is going to be like that
 

13475
03:55:26,479 --> 03:55:28,630
self-driving is going to be like that
and i think 2030 is still a pretty good

13476
03:55:28,630 --> 03:55:28,640
and i think 2030 is still a pretty good
 

13477
03:55:28,640 --> 03:55:29,830
and i think 2030 is still a pretty good
bet

13478
03:55:29,830 --> 03:55:29,840
bet
 

13479
03:55:29,840 --> 03:55:32,389
bet
yeah unfortunately

13480
03:55:32,389 --> 03:55:32,399
yeah unfortunately
 

13481
03:55:32,399 --> 03:55:36,710
yeah unfortunately
um self driving is a problem that uh

13482
03:55:36,710 --> 03:55:36,720
um self driving is a problem that uh
 

13483
03:55:36,720 --> 03:55:39,429
um self driving is a problem that uh
is safety critical meaning that

13484
03:55:39,429 --> 03:55:39,439
is safety critical meaning that
 

13485
03:55:39,439 --> 03:55:41,910
is safety critical meaning that
if if you don't do it well people get

13486
03:55:41,910 --> 03:55:41,920
if if you don't do it well people get
 

13487
03:55:41,920 --> 03:55:43,110
if if you don't do it well people get
hurt

13488
03:55:43,110 --> 03:55:43,120
hurt
 

13489
03:55:43,120 --> 03:55:45,030
hurt
but the other side of that is people are

13490
03:55:45,030 --> 03:55:45,040
but the other side of that is people are
 

13491
03:55:45,040 --> 03:55:47,189
but the other side of that is people are
terrible drivers so

13492
03:55:47,189 --> 03:55:47,199
terrible drivers so
 

13493
03:55:47,199 --> 03:55:48,630
terrible drivers so
it is not going to be that's probably

13494
03:55:48,630 --> 03:55:48,640
it is not going to be that's probably
 

13495
03:55:48,640 --> 03:55:49,990
it is not going to be that's probably
going to be the argument that gets it

13496
03:55:49,990 --> 03:55:50,000
going to be the argument that gets it
 

13497
03:55:50,000 --> 03:55:53,189
going to be the argument that gets it
through is like we can save 10 000 lives

13498
03:55:53,189 --> 03:55:53,199
through is like we can save 10 000 lives
 

13499
03:55:53,199 --> 03:55:55,990
through is like we can save 10 000 lives
a year by taking imperfect self-driving

13500
03:55:55,990 --> 03:55:56,000
a year by taking imperfect self-driving
 

13501
03:55:56,000 --> 03:55:58,070
a year by taking imperfect self-driving
cars and letting them take over a lot of

13502
03:55:58,070 --> 03:55:58,080
cars and letting them take over a lot of
 

13503
03:55:58,080 --> 03:56:00,469
cars and letting them take over a lot of
driving responsibilities it's like was

13504
03:56:00,469 --> 03:56:00,479
driving responsibilities it's like was
 

13505
03:56:00,479 --> 03:56:02,790
driving responsibilities it's like was
it 30 000 people a year die in auto

13506
03:56:02,790 --> 03:56:02,800
it 30 000 people a year die in auto
 

13507
03:56:02,800 --> 03:56:05,429
it 30 000 people a year die in auto
accidents right now in america and a lot

13508
03:56:05,429 --> 03:56:05,439
accidents right now in america and a lot
 

13509
03:56:05,439 --> 03:56:07,349
accidents right now in america and a lot
of those are preventable and the problem

13510
03:56:07,349 --> 03:56:07,359
of those are preventable and the problem
 

13511
03:56:07,359 --> 03:56:09,510
of those are preventable and the problem
is you'll have people that every time a

13512
03:56:09,510 --> 03:56:09,520
is you'll have people that every time a
 

13513
03:56:09,520 --> 03:56:11,429
is you'll have people that every time a
tesla crashes into something you've got

13514
03:56:11,429 --> 03:56:11,439
tesla crashes into something you've got
 

13515
03:56:11,439 --> 03:56:13,110
tesla crashes into something you've got
a bunch of people that literally have

13516
03:56:13,110 --> 03:56:13,120
a bunch of people that literally have
 

13517
03:56:13,120 --> 03:56:15,189
a bunch of people that literally have
vested interest shorting tesla to come

13518
03:56:15,189 --> 03:56:15,199
vested interest shorting tesla to come
 

13519
03:56:15,199 --> 03:56:16,550
vested interest shorting tesla to come
out and make it the worst thing in the

13520
03:56:16,550 --> 03:56:16,560
out and make it the worst thing in the
 

13521
03:56:16,560 --> 03:56:18,630
out and make it the worst thing in the
world and people will be fighting

13522
03:56:18,630 --> 03:56:18,640
world and people will be fighting
 

13523
03:56:18,640 --> 03:56:21,429
world and people will be fighting
against that but optimist in me again i

13524
03:56:21,429 --> 03:56:21,439
against that but optimist in me again i
 

13525
03:56:21,439 --> 03:56:23,429
against that but optimist in me again i
think that we will have systems that are

13526
03:56:23,429 --> 03:56:23,439
think that we will have systems that are
 

13527
03:56:23,439 --> 03:56:26,150
think that we will have systems that are
statistically safer than human drivers

13528
03:56:26,150 --> 03:56:26,160
statistically safer than human drivers
 

13529
03:56:26,160 --> 03:56:27,990
statistically safer than human drivers
and we will be saving

13530
03:56:27,990 --> 03:56:28,000
and we will be saving
 

13531
03:56:28,000 --> 03:56:30,229
and we will be saving
thousands and thousands of lives every

13532
03:56:30,229 --> 03:56:30,239
thousands and thousands of lives every
 

13533
03:56:30,239 --> 03:56:32,429
thousands and thousands of lives every
year when we can hand over more of those

13534
03:56:32,429 --> 03:56:32,439
year when we can hand over more of those
 

13535
03:56:32,439 --> 03:56:35,349
year when we can hand over more of those
responsibilities to it i do still think

13536
03:56:35,349 --> 03:56:35,359
responsibilities to it i do still think
 

13537
03:56:35,359 --> 03:56:37,030
responsibilities to it i do still think

it's still an open problem how good

at driving
 

13561
03:56:56,800 --> 03:56:58,070
at driving
but i

13562
03:56:58,070 --> 03:56:58,080
but i
 

13563
03:56:58,080 --> 03:57:01,110
but i
after really studying it i i think you

13564
03:57:01,110 --> 03:57:01,120
after really studying it i i think you
 

13565
03:57:01,120 --> 03:57:02,870
after really studying it i i think you
start to notice

13566
03:57:02,870 --> 03:57:02,880
start to notice
 

13567
03:57:02,880 --> 03:57:04,630
start to notice
you know because i've watched uh

skill of common sense reasoning this is
 

13615
03:57:51,040 --> 03:57:52,630
skill of common sense reasoning this is
one of those interesting things that

13616
03:57:52,630 --> 03:57:52,640
one of those interesting things that
 

13617
03:57:52,640 --> 03:57:54,150
one of those interesting things that
there have been a lot of studies about

13618
03:57:54,150 --> 03:57:54,160
there have been a lot of studies about
 

13619
03:57:54,160 --> 03:57:56,870
there have been a lot of studies about
how experts in their field usually

13620
03:57:56,870 --> 03:57:56,880
how experts in their field usually
 

13621
03:57:56,880 --> 03:57:58,950
how experts in their field usually
underestimate the progress that's going

13622
03:57:58,950 --> 03:57:58,960
underestimate the progress that's going
 

13623
03:57:58,960 --> 03:58:01,349
underestimate the progress that's going
to happen because an expert thinks about

13624
03:58:01,349 --> 03:58:01,359
to happen because an expert thinks about
 

13625
03:58:01,359 --> 03:58:03,030
to happen because an expert thinks about
all the problems they deal with and

13626
03:58:03,030 --> 03:58:03,040
all the problems they deal with and
 

13627
03:58:03,040 --> 03:58:04,550
all the problems they deal with and
they're like damn i'm going to have a

13628
03:58:04,550 --> 03:58:04,560
they're like damn i'm going to have a
 

13629
03:58:04,560 --> 03:58:06,710
they're like damn i'm going to have a
hard time solving all of this and they

13630
03:58:06,710 --> 03:58:06,720
hard time solving all of this and they
 

13631
03:58:06,720 --> 03:58:08,309
hard time solving all of this and they
filter out the fact that they are one

13632
03:58:08,309 --> 03:58:08,319
filter out the fact that they are one
 

13633
03:58:08,319 --> 03:58:11,110
filter out the fact that they are one
expert in a field of thousands and you

13634
03:58:11,110 --> 03:58:11,120
expert in a field of thousands and you
 

13635
03:58:11,120 --> 03:58:12,950
expert in a field of thousands and you
know you think about yeah i can't do all

13636
03:58:12,950 --> 03:58:12,960
know you think about yeah i can't do all
 

13637
03:58:12,960 --> 03:58:14,710
know you think about yeah i can't do all
of that and you sometimes forget about

13638
03:58:14,710 --> 03:58:14,720
of that and you sometimes forget about
 

13639
03:58:14,720 --> 03:58:16,710
of that and you sometimes forget about
the scope of the the ecosystem that

13640
03:58:16,710 --> 03:58:16,720
the scope of the the ecosystem that
 

13641
03:58:16,720 --> 03:58:19,030
the scope of the the ecosystem that
you're embedded in and if you think back

13642
03:58:19,030 --> 03:58:19,040
you're embedded in and if you think back
 

13643
03:58:19,040 --> 03:58:20,870
you're embedded in and if you think back
eight years very specifically the state

13644
03:58:20,870 --> 03:58:20,880
eight years very specifically the state
 

13645
03:58:20,880 --> 03:58:23,349
eight years very specifically the state
of ai and machine learning where was

13646
03:58:23,349 --> 03:58:23,359
of ai and machine learning where was
 

13647
03:58:23,359 --> 03:58:25,110
of ai and machine learning where was
that we we had just gotten resnets

13648
03:58:25,110 --> 03:58:25,120
that we we had just gotten resnets
 

13649
03:58:25,120 --> 03:58:27,510
that we we had just gotten resnets
probably at that point and you look at

13650
03:58:27,510 --> 03:58:27,520
probably at that point and you look at
 

13651
03:58:27,520 --> 03:58:29,910
probably at that point and you look at
all the amazing magical things that have

13652
03:58:29,910 --> 03:58:29,920
all the amazing magical things that have
 

13653
03:58:29,920 --> 03:58:32,389
all the amazing magical things that have
happened in eight years and they do kind

13654
03:58:32,389 --> 03:58:32,399
happened in eight years and they do kind
 

13655
03:58:32,399 --> 03:58:34,309
happened in eight years and they do kind
of seem to be happening a little faster

13656
03:58:34,309 --> 03:58:34,319
of seem to be happening a little faster
 

13657
03:58:34,319 --> 03:58:36,630
of seem to be happening a little faster
in recent years also and you project

13658
03:58:36,630 --> 03:58:36,640
in recent years also and you project
 

13659
03:58:36,640 --> 03:58:38,950
in recent years also and you project
that eight more years into the future

13660
03:58:38,950 --> 03:58:38,960
that eight more years into the future
 

13661
03:58:38,960 --> 03:58:41,030
that eight more years into the future
where again i think there's a 50 chance

13662
03:58:41,030 --> 03:58:41,040
where again i think there's a 50 chance
 

13663
03:58:41,040 --> 03:58:43,429
where again i think there's a 50 chance
we're gonna have signs of life of agi

13664
03:58:43,429 --> 03:58:43,439
we're gonna have signs of life of agi
 

13665
03:58:43,439 --> 03:58:44,790
we're gonna have signs of life of agi
you know which we can put through

13666
03:58:44,790 --> 03:58:44,800
you know which we can put through
 

13667
03:58:44,800 --> 03:58:46,870
you know which we can put through
driver's ed if we need to to actually

13668
03:58:46,870 --> 03:58:46,880
driver's ed if we need to to actually
 

13669
03:58:46,880 --> 03:58:49,349
driver's ed if we need to to actually
build self-driving cars and i think that

13670
03:58:49,349 --> 03:58:49,359
build self-driving cars and i think that
 

13671
03:58:49,359 --> 03:58:51,590
build self-driving cars and i think that
the narrow systems are going to to have

13672
03:58:51,590 --> 03:58:51,600
the narrow systems are going to to have
 

13673
03:58:51,600 --> 03:58:54,790
the narrow systems are going to to have
real value demonstrated well before then

13674
03:58:54,790 --> 03:58:54,800
real value demonstrated well before then
 

13675
03:58:54,800 --> 03:58:56,790
real value demonstrated well before then
so signs of life

13676
03:58:56,790 --> 03:58:56,800
so signs of life
 

13677
03:58:56,800 --> 03:59:00,630
so signs of life
in agi you've mentioned that

13678
03:59:00,630 --> 03:59:00,640
in agi you've mentioned that
 

13679
03:59:00,640 --> 03:59:02,389
in agi you've mentioned that
okay first of all

13680

on this earth you could be solving a

13684
03:59:06,710 --> 03:59:06,720
on this earth you could be solving a
 

13685
03:59:06,720 --> 03:59:08,389
on this earth you could be solving a
number of different problems as you've

13686

the metaverse is something you could
 

13695
03:59:15,199 --> 03:59:16,950
the metaverse is something you could
have a tremendous impact on so i do want

13696
03:59:16,950 --> 03:59:16,960
have a tremendous impact on so i do want
 

13697
03:59:16,960 --> 03:59:18,630
have a tremendous impact on so i do want
to say a quick thing about nuclear

13698
03:59:18,630 --> 03:59:18,640
to say a quick thing about nuclear
 

13699
03:59:18,640 --> 03:59:20,389
to say a quick thing about nuclear
energy where i

13700
03:59:20,389 --> 03:59:20,399
energy where i
 

13701
03:59:20,399 --> 03:59:22,710
energy where i
you know this is something that i re

this so precisely feels like aerospace

13704
03:59:25,990 --> 03:59:26,000
this so precisely feels like aerospace
 

13705
03:59:26,000 --> 03:59:28,550
this so precisely feels like aerospace
before spacex where from everything that

03:59:36,710 --> 03:59:36,720
reasons why things are expensive now are
 

13713
03:59:36,720 --> 03:59:38,710
reasons why things are expensive now are
not fundamental

04:00:13,189 --> 04:00:13,199
day to make something hot so that you
 

13743
04:00:13,199 --> 04:00:15,189
day to make something hot so that you
can then turn into energy through a

can then turn into energy through a
 

13745
04:00:15,199 --> 04:00:17,750
can then turn into energy through a
conventional power plant and all of that

13746
04:00:17,750 --> 04:00:17,760
conventional power plant and all of that
 

13747
04:00:17,760 --> 04:00:19,590
conventional power plant and all of that
work which we think we've got line of

04:00:19,590 --> 04:00:19,600
work which we think we've got line of
 

13749
04:00:19,600 --> 04:00:22,469
work which we think we've got line of
sight on but even if it comes out then

13750
04:00:22,469 --> 04:00:22,479
sight on but even if it comes out then
 

13751
04:00:22,479 --> 04:00:24,309
sight on but even if it comes out then
you have to do all of that immensely

13752
04:00:24,309 --> 04:00:24,319
you have to do all of that immensely
 

13753
04:00:24,319 --> 04:00:26,550
you have to do all of that immensely
complex expensive stuff just to make

something hot where nuclear fission is
 

13757
04:00:28,880 --> 04:00:30,389
something hot where nuclear fission is
basically you put these two rocks

13758
04:00:30,389 --> 04:00:30,399
basically you put these two rocks
 

13759
04:00:30,399 --> 04:00:32,070
basically you put these two rocks
together and they get hot all by

13760
04:00:32,070 --> 04:00:32,080
together and they get hot all by
 

13761
04:00:32,080 --> 04:00:34,630
together and they get hot all by
themselves that is just that much

13762
04:00:34,630 --> 04:00:34,640
themselves that is just that much
 

13763
04:00:34,640 --> 04:00:37,110
themselves that is just that much
simpler it's just orders of magnitude

13764
04:00:37,110 --> 04:00:37,120
simpler it's just orders of magnitude
 

13765
04:00:37,120 --> 04:00:39,750
simpler it's just orders of magnitude
simpler and the actual rocks the refined

13766
04:00:39,750 --> 04:00:39,760
simpler and the actual rocks the refined
 

13767
04:00:39,760 --> 04:00:42,150

uranium is not very expensive it's a

13768
04:00:42,150 --> 04:00:42,160
uranium is not very expensive it's a
 

13769
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:43,990
uranium is not very expensive it's a
couple percent of the the cost of

13770
04:00:43,990 --> 04:00:44,000
couple percent of the the cost of
 

13771
04:00:44,000 --> 04:00:46,150
couple percent of the the cost of
electricity that's why i made that point

13772
04:00:46,150 --> 04:00:46,160
electricity that's why i made that point
 

13773
04:00:46,160 --> 04:00:48,630
electricity that's why i made that point
where you could have something which was

13774
04:00:48,630 --> 04:00:48,640
where you could have something which was
 

13775
04:00:48,640 --> 04:00:51,189
where you could have something which was
five times less efficient than current

13776
04:00:51,189 --> 04:00:51,199
five times less efficient than current
 

13777
04:00:51,199 --> 04:00:53,269
five times less efficient than current
systems and if the rest of the plant was

13778
04:00:53,269 --> 04:00:53,279
systems and if the rest of the plant was
 

13779
04:00:53,279 --> 04:00:55,349
systems and if the rest of the plant was
a whole bunch cheaper you could still be

13780
04:00:55,349 --> 04:00:55,359
a whole bunch cheaper you could still be
 

13781
04:00:55,359 --> 04:00:58,229
a whole bunch cheaper you could still be
super super valuable so how much of the

13782
04:00:58,229 --> 04:00:58,239
super super valuable so how much of the
 

13783
04:00:58,239 --> 04:01:01,110
super super valuable so how much of the
pie do you think

13784
04:01:01,110 --> 04:01:01,120
pie do you think
 

13785
04:01:01,120 --> 04:01:03,189
pie do you think
could be solved by nuclear energy by

13786
04:01:03,189 --> 04:01:03,199
could be solved by nuclear energy by
 

13787
04:01:03,199 --> 04:01:04,389
could be solved by nuclear energy by
fission

13788
04:01:04,389 --> 04:01:04,399
fission
 

13789
04:01:04,399 --> 04:01:06,550
fission
so how how much could it become the

13790
04:01:06,550 --> 04:01:06,560
so how how much could it become the
 

13791
04:01:06,560 --> 04:01:08,710
so how how much could it become the
primary source of energy on earth

13792
04:01:08,710 --> 04:01:08,720
primary source of energy on earth
 

13793
04:01:08,720 --> 04:01:10,630
primary source of energy on earth
it could be most of it like the reserves

13794
04:01:10,630 --> 04:01:10,640
it could be most of it like the reserves
 

13795
04:01:10,640 --> 04:01:12,389
it could be most of it like the reserves
of uranium as it stands now could not

13796
04:01:12,389 --> 04:01:12,399
of uranium as it stands now could not
 

13797
04:01:12,399 --> 04:01:14,710
of uranium as it stands now could not
power the whole earth but i am you know

13798
04:01:14,710 --> 04:01:14,720
power the whole earth but i am you know
 

13799
04:01:14,720 --> 04:01:16,229
power the whole earth but i am you know
you get into breeder reactors and

13800
04:01:16,229 --> 04:01:16,239
you get into breeder reactors and
 

13801
04:01:16,239 --> 04:01:17,910
you get into breeder reactors and
thorium and things like that that you do

13802
04:01:17,910 --> 04:01:17,920
thorium and things like that that you do
 

13803
04:01:17,920 --> 04:01:20,150
thorium and things like that that you do
for conventional fission uh there is

13804
04:01:20,150 --> 04:01:20,160
for conventional fission uh there is
 

13805
04:01:20,160 --> 04:01:22,229
for conventional fission uh there is
enough fur for everything

13806
04:01:22,229 --> 04:01:22,239
enough fur for everything
 

13807

really should be at the the cornerstone
of all of the world's concerns with

13866
04:02:23,189 --> 04:02:23,199
of all of the world's concerns with
 

13867
04:02:23,199 --> 04:02:25,910
of all of the world's concerns with
energy it's interesting how the

13868
04:02:25,910 --> 04:02:25,920
energy it's interesting how the
 

13869
04:02:25,920 --> 04:02:27,830
energy it's interesting how the
non-technical factors have really

13870
04:02:27,830 --> 04:02:27,840
non-technical factors have really
 

13871
04:02:27,840 --> 04:02:29,670
non-technical factors have really
dominated something that is so

13872
04:02:29,670 --> 04:02:29,680
dominated something that is so
 

13873
04:02:29,680 --> 04:02:31,910
dominated something that is so
fundamental to kind of the existence of

13874
04:02:31,910 --> 04:02:31,920
fundamental to kind of the existence of
 

13875
04:02:31,920 --> 04:02:34,630
fundamental to kind of the existence of
the human race as we know it today

13876
04:02:34,630 --> 04:02:34,640
the human race as we know it today
 

13877
04:02:34,640 --> 04:02:36,389
the human race as we know it today
and much of the troubles of the world

13878
04:02:36,389 --> 04:02:36,399
and much of the troubles of the world
 

13879
04:02:36,399 --> 04:02:37,750
and much of the troubles of the world
including

13880

including
 

13881
04:02:37,760 --> 04:02:39,510
including
wars in different parts of the world

13882
04:02:39,510 --> 04:02:39,520
wars in different parts of the world
 

13883

like ukraine is energy based and

13884
04:02:42,950 --> 04:02:42,960
like ukraine is energy based and
 

13885
04:02:42,960 --> 04:02:44,790
like ukraine is energy based and
yeah it's just sitting right there to be

13886
04:02:44,790 --> 04:02:44,800
yeah it's just sitting right there to be
 

13887
04:02:44,800 --> 04:02:47,429
yeah it's just sitting right there to be
solved

13888
04:02:47,429 --> 04:02:47,439

 

13889
04:02:47,439 --> 04:02:48,950

that said

13890
04:02:48,950 --> 04:02:48,960
that said
 

13891
04:02:48,960 --> 04:02:51,269
that said
uh i mean to me personally i think it's

13892
04:02:51,269 --> 04:02:51,279
uh i mean to me personally i think it's
 

13893
04:02:51,279 --> 04:02:53,830
uh i mean to me personally i think it's
clear that if agi were to be achieved

13894
04:02:53,830 --> 04:02:53,840
clear that if agi were to be achieved
 

13895
04:02:53,840 --> 04:02:55,590
clear that if agi were to be achieved
that would change the course of human

13896
04:02:55,590 --> 04:02:55,600
that would change the course of human
 

13897
04:02:55,600 --> 04:02:56,389
that would change the course of human

you know i was making this decision

13902
04:02:59,990 --> 04:03:00,000
you know i was making this decision
 

13903
04:03:00,000 --> 04:03:03,030
you know i was making this decision
about what do i want to focus on after

13904
04:03:03,030 --> 04:03:03,040
about what do i want to focus on after
 

13905
04:03:03,040 --> 04:03:05,590
about what do i want to focus on after
vr and i'm still working on vr

13906

regularly i spend a day a week kind of

regularly i spend a day a week kind of
 

13909
04:03:07,920 --> 04:03:11,269
regularly i spend a day a week kind of
consulting with meta and i you know baz

styles me the consulting cto is kind of

13912
04:03:13,830 --> 04:03:13,840
styles me the consulting cto is kind of
 

13913
04:03:13,840 --> 04:03:15,750
styles me the consulting cto is kind of
like the sherlock holmes that comes in

13914
04:03:15,750 --> 04:03:15,760
like the sherlock holmes that comes in
 

13915

like the sherlock holmes that comes in

and consults on some of the specific
 

13917
04:03:17,920 --> 04:03:19,910
and consults on some of the specific
tough issues and i'm still pretty

13918
04:03:19,910 --> 04:03:19,920
tough issues and i'm still pretty
 

13919
04:03:19,920 --> 04:03:22,389
tough issues and i'm still pretty
passionate about all of that but i have

13920
04:03:22,389 --> 04:03:22,399
passionate about all of that but i have
 

13921
04:03:22,399 --> 04:03:23,110
passionate about all of that but i have
been

13922
04:03:23,110 --> 04:03:23,120
been
 

13923
04:03:23,120 --> 04:03:25,590
been
figuring out how to compartmentalize and

13924
04:03:25,590 --> 04:03:25,600
figuring out how to compartmentalize and
 

13925
04:03:25,600 --> 04:03:28,070
figuring out how to compartmentalize and
force that into a smaller box to work on

13926
04:03:28,070 --> 04:03:28,080
force that into a smaller box to work on
 

13927
04:03:28,080 --> 04:03:30,070
force that into a smaller box to work on
some other things and i did come down to

13928
04:03:30,070 --> 04:03:30,080
some other things and i did come down to
 

13929
04:03:30,080 --> 04:03:32,870
some other things and i did come down to
this decision between working on

04:03:32,870 --> 04:03:32,880
this decision between working on
 

13931
04:03:32,880 --> 04:03:35,269

and uh the vision side of things i've

13936
04:03:39,510 --> 04:03:39,520
and uh the vision side of things i've
 

13937
04:03:39,520 --> 04:03:41,110
and uh the vision side of things i've
i've got a bunch of interesting things

i've got a bunch of interesting things
 

13939
04:03:41,120 --> 04:03:42,950
i've got a bunch of interesting things
going that way but

13940
04:03:42,950 --> 04:03:42,960
going that way but
 

13941
04:03:42,960 --> 04:03:44,950
going that way but
it would take that would be a fairly big

13942
04:03:44,950 --> 04:03:44,960
it would take that would be a fairly big
 

13943
04:03:44,960 --> 04:03:47,030
it would take that would be a fairly big
project thing to do i don't think it

13944
04:03:47,030 --> 04:03:47,040
project thing to do i don't think it
 

13945
04:03:47,040 --> 04:03:49,269
project thing to do i don't think it
needs to be as big as people expect i do

needs to be as big as people expect i do

13952
04:03:56,630 --> 04:03:56,640
it and then the government i think will
 

13953
04:03:56,640 --> 04:03:59,429
it and then the government i think will
come around to what you need to is

13954
04:03:59,429 --> 04:03:59,439
come around to what you need to is

doing this but it's going to involve
some politics it's going to involve

some politics it's going to involve

04:04:06,800 --> 04:04:08,710
some politics it's going to involve
decent sized teams and a bunch of this

that we don't know
are relatively simple there's probably a

14024
04:05:09,510 --> 04:05:09,520
are relatively simple there's probably a
 

14025
04:05:09,520 --> 04:05:12,950
are relatively simple there's probably a
handful of things and my bet is that

14026
04:05:12,950 --> 04:05:12,960
handful of things and my bet is that
 

14027
04:05:12,960 --> 04:05:14,309
handful of things and my bet is that
i think there's

14028
04:05:14,309 --> 04:05:14,319
i think there's
 

14029
04:05:14,319 --> 04:05:16,950
i think there's
less than six key insights that need to

14030
04:05:16,950 --> 04:05:16,960
less than six key insights that need to
 

14031
04:05:16,960 --> 04:05:18,950
less than six key insights that need to
be made each one of them can probably be

14032
04:05:18,950 --> 04:05:18,960
be made each one of them can probably be
 

14033
04:05:18,960 --> 04:05:20,950
be made each one of them can probably be
written on the back of an envelope we

14034
04:05:20,950 --> 04:05:20,960
written on the back of an envelope we
 

14035
04:05:20,960 --> 04:05:22,550
written on the back of an envelope we
don't know what they are but when

14036
04:05:22,550 --> 04:05:22,560
don't know what they are but when
 

14037
04:05:22,560 --> 04:05:24,630
don't know what they are but when
they're put together in concert with

they're put together in concert with
 

14039
04:05:24,640 --> 04:05:27,349
they're put together in concert with
gpus at scale and the data that we all

14040
04:05:27,349 --> 04:05:27,359
gpus at scale and the data that we all
 

14041
04:05:27,359 --> 04:05:29,429
gpus at scale and the data that we all
have access to that we can make

14042
04:05:29,429 --> 04:05:29,439
have access to that we can make
 

14043
04:05:29,439 --> 04:05:32,389
have access to that we can make
something that behaves like a human

14044
04:05:32,389 --> 04:05:32,399
something that behaves like a human
 

14045
04:05:32,399 --> 04:05:35,110
something that behaves like a human
being or like a living creature and that

14046
04:05:35,110 --> 04:05:35,120
being or like a living creature and that
 

14047
04:05:35,120 --> 04:05:37,830
being or like a living creature and that
can then be educated in whatever ways

14048
04:05:37,830 --> 04:05:37,840
can then be educated in whatever ways
 

14049
04:05:37,840 --> 04:05:39,910
can then be educated in whatever ways
that we need to get to the point where

14050
04:05:39,910 --> 04:05:39,920
that we need to get to the point where
 

14051
04:05:39,920 --> 04:05:42,229
that we need to get to the point where
we can have universal remote workers

14052
04:05:42,229 --> 04:05:42,239
we can have universal remote workers
 

14053
04:05:42,239 --> 04:05:44,469
we can have universal remote workers
where anything that somebody does

14054
04:05:44,469 --> 04:05:44,479
where anything that somebody does
 

14055
04:05:44,479 --> 04:05:46,150
where anything that somebody does
mediated by a computer and doesn't

require physical interaction uh that an

04:05:51,279 --> 04:05:53,110

simulate the you know the equivalent of

04:05:53,110 --> 04:05:53,120
simulate the you know the equivalent of
 

14063
04:05:53,120 --> 04:05:54,070
simulate the you know the equivalent of
the zoom

14064
04:05:54,070 --> 04:05:54,080
the zoom
 

14065
04:05:54,080 --> 04:05:56,870

synthetic deep fakes and whatnot we can

14068
04:05:59,110 --> 04:05:59,120
synthetic deep fakes and whatnot we can
 

14069
04:05:59,120 --> 04:06:01,830
synthetic deep fakes and whatnot we can
definitely do that uh we have super

human capabilities on any narrow thing

14072
04:06:03,990 --> 04:06:04,000
human capabilities on any narrow thing
 

14073
04:06:04,000 --> 04:06:06,389
human capabilities on any narrow thing
that we can uh that we can formalize and

14074
04:06:06,389 --> 04:06:06,399
that we can uh that we can formalize and
 

14075
04:06:06,399 --> 04:06:08,229
that we can uh that we can formalize and
make a loss function for but there's

14076
04:06:08,229 --> 04:06:08,239
make a loss function for but there's
 

14077
04:06:08,239 --> 04:06:10,309
make a loss function for but there's
things we don't know how to do now

14078
04:06:10,309 --> 04:06:10,319
things we don't know how to do now
 

14079
04:06:10,319 --> 04:06:12,070
things we don't know how to do now
but i don't think they are

14080
04:06:12,070 --> 04:06:12,080
but i don't think they are
 

14081
04:06:12,080 --> 04:06:13,750
but i don't think they are
unapproachably hard now that's

14082
04:06:13,750 --> 04:06:13,760
unapproachably hard now that's
 

14083
04:06:13,760 --> 04:06:16,229
unapproachably hard now that's
incredibly hubristic to say that it's

14084
04:06:16,229 --> 04:06:16,239
incredibly hubristic to say that it's
 

14085
04:06:16,239 --> 04:06:18,630
incredibly hubristic to say that it's
like but i think that what i said a

14086
04:06:18,630 --> 04:06:18,640
like but i think that what i said a
 

14087
04:06:18,640 --> 04:06:21,110
like but i think that what i said a
couple years ago is a 50 chance that

14088
04:06:21,110 --> 04:06:21,120
couple years ago is a 50 chance that
 

14089
04:06:21,120 --> 04:06:23,670
couple years ago is a 50 chance that
somewhere there will be signs of life of

14090
04:06:23,670 --> 04:06:23,680
somewhere there will be signs of life of
 

14091
04:06:23,680 --> 04:06:27,030
somewhere there will be signs of life of
agi in 2030 and i've probably increased

14092
04:06:27,030 --> 04:06:27,040
agi in 2030 and i've probably increased
 

14093
04:06:27,040 --> 04:06:30,469
agi in 2030 and i've probably increased
that slightly i may be at 55 60 now

14094
04:06:30,469 --> 04:06:30,479
that slightly i may be at 55 60 now
 

14095
04:06:30,479 --> 04:06:31,750
that slightly i may be at 55 60 now
because i do think there's a little

14096
04:06:31,750 --> 04:06:31,760
because i do think there's a little
 

14097
04:06:31,760 --> 04:06:34,550
because i do think there's a little
sense of acceleration there

14098
04:06:34,550 --> 04:06:34,560
sense of acceleration there
 

14099
04:06:34,560 --> 04:06:36,550
sense of acceleration there
so i wonder what the and by the way you

14100
04:06:36,550 --> 04:06:36,560
so i wonder what the and by the way you
 

14101
04:06:36,560 --> 04:06:39,510
so i wonder what the and by the way you
also written that i i bet with hindsight

14102
04:06:39,510 --> 04:06:39,520
also written that i i bet with hindsight
 

14103
04:06:39,520 --> 04:06:42,229
also written that i i bet with hindsight
we will find that clear antecedents of

04:06:42,229 --> 04:06:42,239
we will find that clear antecedents of
 

14105
04:06:42,239 --> 04:06:44,950
we will find that clear antecedents of
all the critical remaining steps for agi

14106
04:06:44,950 --> 04:06:44,960
all the critical remaining steps for agi
 

14107
04:06:44,960 --> 04:06:47,189
all the critical remaining steps for agi
are already buried somewhere in the vast

14108
04:06:47,189 --> 04:06:47,199
are already buried somewhere in the vast
 

14109
04:06:47,199 --> 04:06:49,510
are already buried somewhere in the vast
literature of today so the ideas are

14110
04:06:49,510 --> 04:06:49,520
literature of today so the ideas are
 

14111
04:06:49,520 --> 04:06:50,950
literature of today so the ideas are
already there

14112
04:06:50,950 --> 04:06:50,960
already there

04:06:50,960 --> 04:06:52,550

i think that's likely the case one of

04:06:52,550 --> 04:06:52,560
i think that's likely the case one of
 

14115
04:06:52,560 --> 04:06:54,070
i think that's likely the case one of
the things that appeals to so many

14116
04:06:54,070 --> 04:06:54,080
the things that appeals to so many
 

14117
04:06:54,080 --> 04:06:56,070
the things that appeals to so many
people including me about the promise of

04:06:56,070 --> 04:06:56,080
people including me about the promise of

out all the time you can't go back and

read all the clever things that people

04:07:14,479 --> 04:07:16,469
read all the clever things that people
did in the 90s or earlier that people

did in the 90s or earlier that people
 

14137
04:07:16,479 --> 04:07:18,070

i am

i am
 

14145
04:07:22,880 --> 04:07:25,269
i am
so that this idea that yeah i think

14146
04:07:25,269 --> 04:07:25,279
so that this idea that yeah i think
 

14147
04:07:25,279 --> 04:07:27,590
so that this idea that yeah i think
there are gems buried in some of the

04:07:27,590 --> 04:07:27,600
there are gems buried in some of the
 

14149
04:07:27,600 --> 04:07:29,750
there are gems buried in some of the
older literature that was not the path

14150
04:07:29,750 --> 04:07:29,760
older literature that was not the path
 

14151
04:07:29,760 --> 04:07:31,910
older literature that was not the path
taken by everything and you can see a

14152
04:07:31,910 --> 04:07:31,920
taken by everything and you can see a
 

14153
04:07:31,920 --> 04:07:33,990
taken by everything and you can see a
kind of herd mentality on the things

14154
04:07:33,990 --> 04:07:34,000
kind of herd mentality on the things
 

14155
04:07:34,000 --> 04:07:35,910
kind of herd mentality on the things
that happen right now it's almost funny

14156
04:07:35,910 --> 04:07:35,920
that happen right now it's almost funny
 

14157
04:07:35,920 --> 04:07:37,990
that happen right now it's almost funny
to see like oh google does something and

14158
04:07:37,990 --> 04:07:38,000
to see like oh google does something and
 

14159
04:07:38,000 --> 04:07:39,910
to see like oh google does something and
open ai does something meta does

14160
04:07:39,910 --> 04:07:39,920
open ai does something meta does
 

14161
04:07:39,920 --> 04:07:41,910
open ai does something meta does
something and you know they're the same

14162
04:07:41,910 --> 04:07:41,920
something and you know they're the same
 

14163
04:07:41,920 --> 04:07:43,429
something and you know they're the same
people that all talk to each other and

14164
04:07:43,429 --> 04:07:43,439
people that all talk to each other and
 

14165
04:07:43,439 --> 04:07:45,110
people that all talk to each other and
they're all one-upping each other and

14166
04:07:45,110 --> 04:07:45,120
they're all one-upping each other and
 

14167
04:07:45,120 --> 04:07:47,030
they're all one-upping each other and
they're all capable of implementing each

14168
04:07:47,030 --> 04:07:47,040
they're all capable of implementing each
 

14169
04:07:47,040 --> 04:07:49,590
they're all capable of implementing each
other's work given a month or two after

14170
04:07:49,590 --> 04:07:49,600
other's work given a month or two after

somebody has an announcement of that

somebody has an announcement of that
 

14173
04:07:51,920 --> 04:07:54,389
somebody has an announcement of that

but there's a there's a whole world of
 

14175
04:07:54,399 --> 04:07:57,189
but there's a there's a whole world of
possible approaches to machine learning

14176
04:07:57,189 --> 04:07:57,199
possible approaches to machine learning
 

14177
04:07:57,199 --> 04:07:59,590
possible approaches to machine learning
and i think that we probably will in

14178
04:07:59,590 --> 04:07:59,600
and i think that we probably will in
 

14179
04:07:59,600 --> 04:08:01,510
and i think that we probably will in
hindsight go back and see it's like yeah

14180
04:08:01,510 --> 04:08:01,520
hindsight go back and see it's like yeah
 

14181
04:08:01,520 --> 04:08:03,990
hindsight go back and see it's like yeah
that was kind of clearly predicted by

14182
04:08:03,990 --> 04:08:04,000
that was kind of clearly predicted by
 

14183
04:08:04,000 --> 04:08:06,469
that was kind of clearly predicted by
this early paper here i you know and

14184
04:08:06,469 --> 04:08:06,479
this early paper here i you know and
 

14185
04:08:06,479 --> 04:08:08,070
this early paper here i you know and
this turns out that if you do this and

14186
04:08:08,070 --> 04:08:08,080
this turns out that if you do this and
 

14187
04:08:08,080 --> 04:08:10,149
this turns out that if you do this and
this and take this result from

14188
04:08:10,149 --> 04:08:10,159
this and take this result from
 

14189
04:08:10,159 --> 04:08:11,830
this and take this result from
from animal training and this thing from

14190
04:08:11,830 --> 04:08:11,840
from animal training and this thing from
 

14191
04:08:11,840 --> 04:08:13,990
from animal training and this thing from
neuroscience over here and put it

14192
04:08:13,990 --> 04:08:14,000
neuroscience over here and put it
 

14193
04:08:14,000 --> 04:08:16,070
neuroscience over here and put it
together and set up this curriculum for

14194
04:08:16,070 --> 04:08:16,080
together and set up this curriculum for
 

14195
04:08:16,080 --> 04:08:18,389
together and set up this curriculum for
them to learn in that that's kind of

14196
04:08:18,389 --> 04:08:18,399
them to learn in that that's kind of
 

14197
04:08:18,399 --> 04:08:19,670
them to learn in that that's kind of
what it took

14198
04:08:19,670 --> 04:08:19,680
what it took
 

14199
04:08:19,680 --> 04:08:21,510
what it took
you don't have too many people now that

14200
04:08:21,510 --> 04:08:21,520
you don't have too many people now that
 

14201
04:08:21,520 --> 04:08:23,590
you don't have too many people now that
are still saying it's not possible or

14202
04:08:23,590 --> 04:08:23,600
are still saying it's not possible or
 

14203
04:08:23,600 --> 04:08:25,510
are still saying it's not possible or
it's going to take hundreds of years and

14204
04:08:25,510 --> 04:08:25,520
it's going to take hundreds of years and
 

14205
04:08:25,520 --> 04:08:27,189
it's going to take hundreds of years and
10 years ago you would get you would

14206
04:08:27,189 --> 04:08:27,199
10 years ago you would get you would
 

14207
04:08:27,199 --> 04:08:29,189
10 years ago you would get you would
collect get a collection of experts and

04:08:29,189 --> 04:08:29,199
collect get a collection of experts and
 

14209
04:08:29,199 --> 04:08:30,550
collect get a collection of experts and
you would have a decent chunk on the

14210
04:08:30,550 --> 04:08:30,560
you would have a decent chunk on the
 

14211
04:08:30,560 --> 04:08:34,309
you would have a decent chunk on the
margin that either say not possible or

14212
04:08:34,309 --> 04:08:34,319
margin that either say not possible or
 

14213
04:08:34,319 --> 04:08:35,670
margin that either say not possible or
a couple hundred years might be

14214
04:08:35,670 --> 04:08:35,680
a couple hundred years might be
 

14215
04:08:35,680 --> 04:08:37,990
a couple hundred years might be
centuries and the median estimate would

14216
04:08:37,990 --> 04:08:38,000
centuries and the median estimate would
 

14217
04:08:38,000 --> 04:08:41,269
centuries and the median estimate would
be like 50 70 years and it's been coming

14218
04:08:41,269 --> 04:08:41,279
be like 50 70 years and it's been coming
 

14219
04:08:41,279 --> 04:08:43,189
be like 50 70 years and it's been coming
down and i know with me saying eight

14220
04:08:43,189 --> 04:08:43,199
down and i know with me saying eight
 

14221
04:08:43,199 --> 04:08:44,790
down and i know with me saying eight
years for something that still puts me

14222
04:08:44,790 --> 04:08:44,800
years for something that still puts me
 

14223
04:08:44,800 --> 04:08:47,030
years for something that still puts me
on the optimistic side but it's not

14224
04:08:47,030 --> 04:08:47,040
on the optimistic side but it's not
 

14225
04:08:47,040 --> 04:08:49,750
on the optimistic side but it's not
crazy out in the fringes and just being

04:08:49,750 --> 04:08:49,760
crazy out in the fringes and just being
 

14227
04:08:49,760 --> 04:08:51,910
crazy out in the fringes and just being
able to look at that at a a meta level

14228
04:08:51,910 --> 04:08:51,920
able to look at that at a a meta level
 

14229
04:08:51,920 --> 04:08:54,630
able to look at that at a a meta level
about the trend of the the uh the trend

14230
04:08:54,630 --> 04:08:54,640
about the trend of the the uh the trend

know that's one of the safety issues
 

14243
04:09:06,000 --> 04:09:07,110
know that's one of the safety issues
that people say it's like oh it's going

14244
04:09:07,110 --> 04:09:07,120
that people say it's like oh it's going
 

14245

14251
04:09:14,239 --> 04:09:16,710
i don't think that's a credible position
and i think that we will go from a point

14252
04:09:16,710 --> 04:09:16,720
and i think that we will go from a point
 

14253
04:09:16,720 --> 04:09:19,189
and i think that we will go from a point
where we start seeing things that that

04:09:19,189 --> 04:09:19,199
where we start seeing things that that

04:09:34,319 --> 04:09:35,830
learning human words i i think that you
know i think animal intelligence is

14270
04:09:35,830 --> 04:09:35,840
know i think animal intelligence is
 

14271
04:09:35,840 --> 04:09:37,349
know i think animal intelligence is
closer to human intelligence than a lot

14272

closer to human intelligence than a lot
 

14273
04:09:37,359 --> 04:09:39,990
closer to human intelligence than a lot
of people like to think and i think that

of people like to think and i think that

14327
04:10:40,960 --> 04:10:42,389
can do rollbacks and a b testing and you
can find a golden path through a

14328
04:10:42,389 --> 04:10:42,399
can find a golden path through a
 

14329
04:10:42,399 --> 04:10:44,389
can find a golden path through a
curriculum of different things

14330
04:10:44,389 --> 04:10:44,399
curriculum of different things
 

14331
04:10:44,399 --> 04:10:46,070
curriculum of different things
if you get to that point learning

14332
04:10:46,070 --> 04:10:46,080
if you get to that point learning
 

14333
04:10:46,080 --> 04:10:49,030
if you get to that point learning
disabled toddler i think that it's uh

14334
04:10:49,030 --> 04:10:49,040
disabled toddler i think that it's uh
 

14335
04:10:49,040 --> 04:10:51,030
disabled toddler i think that it's uh
it's going to be a done deal but do you

14336
04:10:51,030 --> 04:10:51,040
it's going to be a done deal but do you
 

14337
04:10:51,040 --> 04:10:53,510
it's going to be a done deal but do you
think we'll we'll know it when we see it

14338
04:10:53,510 --> 04:10:53,520
think we'll we'll know it when we see it
 

14339
04:10:53,520 --> 04:10:55,990
think we'll we'll know it when we see it
so uh there's there's been a lot of

14340
04:10:55,990 --> 04:10:56,000
so uh there's there's been a lot of
 

14341
04:10:56,000 --> 04:10:58,229
so uh there's there's been a lot of
really interesting general learning

14342
04:10:58,229 --> 04:10:58,239
really interesting general learning
 

14343
04:10:58,239 --> 04:11:00,229
really interesting general learning
progress from deep mind

14344
04:11:00,229 --> 04:11:00,239
progress from deep mind
 

14345
04:11:00,239 --> 04:11:02,469
progress from deep mind
uh open the eye a little bit too

14346
04:11:02,469 --> 04:11:02,479
uh open the eye a little bit too
 

14347
04:11:02,479 --> 04:11:06,469
uh open the eye a little bit too
i tend to believe that tesla autopilot

14348
04:11:06,469 --> 04:11:06,479
i tend to believe that tesla autopilot
 

14349
04:11:06,479 --> 04:11:08,149
i tend to believe that tesla autopilot
deserves a lot more credit than is

14350
04:11:08,149 --> 04:11:08,159
deserves a lot more credit than is
 

14351
04:11:08,159 --> 04:11:09,030
deserves a lot more credit than is
getting

14352
04:11:09,030 --> 04:11:09,040
getting
 

14353
04:11:09,040 --> 04:11:09,990
getting

04:11:10,000 --> 04:11:12,070
for
making progress on the general

04:11:12,070 --> 04:11:12,080
making progress on the general
 

14357
04:11:12,080 --> 04:11:13,830
making progress on the general
yeah on sort of on the doing the

14358
04:11:13,830 --> 04:11:13,840
yeah on sort of on the doing the
 

14359
04:11:13,840 --> 04:11:15,990
yeah on sort of on the doing the
multitask learning thing and increasing

14360
04:11:15,990 --> 04:11:16,000
multitask learning thing and increasing
 

14361
04:11:16,000 --> 04:11:19,510
multitask learning thing and increasing
the number of tasks and automating that

14362
04:11:19,510 --> 04:11:19,520
the number of tasks and automating that
 

14363
04:11:19,520 --> 04:11:21,269
the number of tasks and automating that
process of

14364
04:11:21,269 --> 04:11:21,279
process of
 

14365
04:11:21,279 --> 04:11:23,110
process of
uh sort of

14366
04:11:23,110 --> 04:11:23,120
uh sort of
 

14367
04:11:23,120 --> 04:11:24,550
uh sort of
learning from the edge discovering the

14368
04:11:24,550 --> 04:11:24,560
learning from the edge discovering the
 

14369
04:11:24,560 --> 04:11:25,910
learning from the edge discovering the
edge cases and learning from the edge

14370
04:11:25,910 --> 04:11:25,920
edge cases and learning from the edge
 

14371
04:11:25,920 --> 04:11:27,910
edge cases and learning from the edge
cases that is

14372
04:11:27,910 --> 04:11:27,920
cases that is
 

14373
04:11:27,920 --> 04:11:29,750
cases that is
it's really approaching from a different

14374
04:11:29,750 --> 04:11:29,760
it's really approaching from a different
 

14375
04:11:29,760 --> 04:11:32,309
it's really approaching from a different
angle the general learning problem of

14376
04:11:32,309 --> 04:11:32,319
angle the general learning problem of
 

14377
04:11:32,319 --> 04:11:35,189
angle the general learning problem of
agi but the more clear approach comes

14378
04:11:35,189 --> 04:11:35,199
agi but the more clear approach comes
 

14379
04:11:35,199 --> 04:11:36,790
agi but the more clear approach comes
from deep mind where you have these kind

14380
04:11:36,790 --> 04:11:36,800
from deep mind where you have these kind
 

14381
04:11:36,800 --> 04:11:38,790
from deep mind where you have these kind
of game situations and you

14382
04:11:38,790 --> 04:11:38,800
of game situations and you
 

14383
04:11:38,800 --> 04:11:40,630
of game situations and you
uh build systems

14384
04:11:40,630 --> 04:11:40,640
uh build systems
 

14385
04:11:40,640 --> 04:11:43,189
uh build systems
there but i i don't know

14386
04:11:43,189 --> 04:11:43,199
there but i i don't know
 

14387
04:11:43,199 --> 04:11:46,149
there but i i don't know
um people seem to be quite

14388
04:11:46,149 --> 04:11:46,159
um people seem to be quite
 

14389
04:11:46,159 --> 04:11:47,349
um people seem to be quite
um

14390
04:11:47,349 --> 04:11:47,359
um
 

14391
04:11:47,359 --> 04:11:48,950
um
yeah there will always be people that

14392
04:11:48,950 --> 04:11:48,960
yeah there will always be people that
 

14393
04:11:48,960 --> 04:11:50,469
yeah there will always be people that
just won't believe it and i

14394
04:11:50,469 --> 04:11:50,479
just won't believe it and i
 

14395
04:11:50,479 --> 04:11:52,790
just won't believe it and i
fundamentally don't care i mean i don't

14396
04:11:52,790 --> 04:11:52,800
fundamentally don't care i mean i don't
 

14397
04:11:52,800 --> 04:11:55,110
fundamentally don't care i mean i don't
care if they don't believe it i you know

14398
04:11:55,110 --> 04:11:55,120
care if they don't believe it i you know
 

14399
04:11:55,120 --> 04:11:57,750
care if they don't believe it i you know
when it starts doing people's jobs and i

14400
04:11:57,750 --> 04:11:57,760
when it starts doing people's jobs and i
 

14401
04:11:57,760 --> 04:11:58,790
when it starts doing people's jobs and i
mean like i don't care about the

14402
04:11:58,790 --> 04:11:58,800
mean like i don't care about the
 

14403
04:11:58,800 --> 04:12:00,950
mean like i don't care about the
philosophical zombie argument absolutely

14404
04:12:00,950 --> 04:12:00,960
philosophical zombie argument absolutely
 

14405
04:12:00,960 --> 04:12:03,429
philosophical zombie argument absolutely
absolutely but will you do you think you

14406
04:12:03,429 --> 04:12:03,439
absolutely but will you do you think you
 

14407
04:12:03,439 --> 04:12:05,429
absolutely but will you do you think you
will notice that something special has

14408
04:12:05,429 --> 04:12:05,439
will notice that something special has
 

14409
04:12:05,439 --> 04:12:07,670
will notice that something special has
happened here and or

14410
04:12:07,670 --> 04:12:07,680
happened here and or
 

14411
04:12:07,680 --> 04:12:09,030
happened here and or
um

14412
04:12:09,030 --> 04:12:09,040
um
 

14413
04:12:09,040 --> 04:12:11,670
um
because to me i've been noticing a lot

14414
04:12:11,670 --> 04:12:11,680
because to me i've been noticing a lot
 

14415
04:12:11,680 --> 04:12:13,670
because to me i've been noticing a lot
of special things i think

14416
04:12:13,670 --> 04:12:13,680
of special things i think
 

14417
04:12:13,680 --> 04:12:16,229
of special things i think
a lot of credit should go to deep bind

14418
04:12:16,229 --> 04:12:16,239
a lot of credit should go to deep bind
 

14419
04:12:16,239 --> 04:12:18,710
a lot of credit should go to deep bind
for alpha's zero

14420
04:12:18,710 --> 04:12:18,720
for alpha's zero
 

14421
04:12:18,720 --> 04:12:21,349
for alpha's zero
that was truly special so self-play

14422
04:12:21,349 --> 04:12:21,359
that was truly special so self-play
 

14423
04:12:21,359 --> 04:12:23,349
that was truly special so self-play
mechanisms achieve

14424
04:12:23,349 --> 04:12:23,359
mechanisms achieve
 

14425
04:12:23,359 --> 04:12:25,830
mechanisms achieve
sort of solve problems that used to be

14426
04:12:25,830 --> 04:12:25,840
sort of solve problems that used to be
 

14427
04:12:25,840 --> 04:12:28,630
sort of solve problems that used to be
thought unsolvable like the game of go

14428
04:12:28,630 --> 04:12:28,640
thought unsolvable like the game of go
 

14429
04:12:28,640 --> 04:12:31,269
thought unsolvable like the game of go
also i mean protein folding starting to

14430
04:12:31,269 --> 04:12:31,279
also i mean protein folding starting to
 

14431
04:12:31,279 --> 04:12:33,510
also i mean protein folding starting to
get into that space where learning is

14432
04:12:33,510 --> 04:12:33,520
get into that space where learning is
 

14433
04:12:33,520 --> 04:12:34,870
get into that space where learning is
doing

14434
04:12:34,870 --> 04:12:34,880
doing
 

14435
04:12:34,880 --> 04:12:36,950
doing
at first there's not it wasn't entirely

14436
04:12:36,950 --> 04:12:36,960
at first there's not it wasn't entirely
 

14437
04:12:36,960 --> 04:12:38,870
at first there's not it wasn't entirely
learning and so and now it's end-to-end

14438
04:12:38,870 --> 04:12:38,880
learning and so and now it's end-to-end
 

14439
04:12:38,880 --> 04:12:39,830
learning and so and now it's end-to-end
learning

14440
04:12:39,830 --> 04:12:39,840
learning
 

14441
04:12:39,840 --> 04:12:42,309
learning
of the of a very difficult previously

14442
04:12:42,309 --> 04:12:42,319
of the of a very difficult previously
 

14443
04:12:42,319 --> 04:12:44,229
of the of a very difficult previously
thought unsolvable problem of protein

14444
04:12:44,229 --> 04:12:44,239
thought unsolvable problem of protein
 

14445
04:12:44,239 --> 04:12:45,269

folding

14446
04:12:45,269 --> 04:12:45,279
folding
 

14447
04:12:45,279 --> 04:12:47,429
folding
and so um

14448
04:12:47,429 --> 04:12:47,439
and so um
 

14449
04:12:47,439 --> 04:12:49,830
and so um
yeah it would do where where do you

14450
04:12:49,830 --> 04:12:49,840
yeah it would do where where do you
 

14451
04:12:49,840 --> 04:12:51,910
yeah it would do where where do you
think would be a

14452
04:12:51,910 --> 04:12:51,920
think would be a
 

14453
04:12:51,920 --> 04:12:54,550
think would be a
really magical moment for you

14454
04:12:54,550 --> 04:12:54,560
really magical moment for you
 

14455
04:12:54,560 --> 04:12:56,229
really magical moment for you
there have been incredible things

14456
04:12:56,229 --> 04:12:56,239
there have been incredible things
 

14457
04:12:56,239 --> 04:12:57,910
there have been incredible things
happening in recent years like you say

14458
04:12:57,910 --> 04:12:57,920
happening in recent years like you say
 

14459
04:12:57,920 --> 04:12:59,590
happening in recent years like you say
all of the the things from deepmind and

14460
04:12:59,590 --> 04:12:59,600
all of the the things from deepmind and
 

14461
04:12:59,600 --> 04:13:01,670
all of the the things from deepmind and
open ai that have been

14462
04:13:01,670 --> 04:13:01,680
open ai that have been
 

14463
04:13:01,680 --> 04:13:03,510
open ai that have been
huge showpiece things but when you

14464
04:13:03,510 --> 04:13:03,520
huge showpiece things but when you
 

14465
04:13:03,520 --> 04:13:04,950
huge showpiece things but when you
really get down to it and you read the

14466
04:13:04,950 --> 04:13:04,960
really get down to it and you read the
 

14467
04:13:04,960 --> 04:13:06,630
really get down to it and you read the
papers and you look at the way the

14468
04:13:06,630 --> 04:13:06,640
papers and you look at the way the
 

14469
04:13:06,640 --> 04:13:09,030
papers and you look at the way the
models are going you know it's it's

14470
04:13:09,030 --> 04:13:09,040
models are going you know it's it's
 

14471
04:13:09,040 --> 04:13:10,790
models are going you know it's it's
still like a feed forward you push

14472
04:13:10,790 --> 04:13:10,800
still like a feed forward you push
 

14473
04:13:10,800 --> 04:13:13,030
still like a feed forward you push
something in something comes out i on

14474
04:13:13,030 --> 04:13:13,040
something in something comes out i on
 

14475
04:13:13,040 --> 04:13:14,870
something in something comes out i on
the end i mean maybe there's diffusion

14476
04:13:14,870 --> 04:13:14,880
the end i mean maybe there's diffusion
 

14477
04:13:14,880 --> 04:13:17,429
the end i mean maybe there's diffusion
models or monte carlo tree rollouts and

14478
04:13:17,429 --> 04:13:17,439
models or monte carlo tree rollouts and
 

14479
04:13:17,439 --> 04:13:19,990
models or monte carlo tree rollouts and
different things going on but it's not a

14480
04:13:19,990 --> 04:13:20,000
different things going on but it's not a
 

14481
04:13:20,000 --> 04:13:22,790
different things going on but it's not a
being it's not close to a being i am

14482
04:13:22,790 --> 04:13:22,800
being it's not close to a being i am
 

14483
04:13:22,800 --> 04:13:25,349
being it's not close to a being i am
that's that's going through a you know a

14484
04:13:25,349 --> 04:13:25,359
that's that's going through a you know a
 

14485
04:13:25,359 --> 04:13:27,510
that's that's going through a you know a
lifelong learning process do you want

14486
04:13:27,510 --> 04:13:27,520
lifelong learning process do you want
 

14487
04:13:27,520 --> 04:13:30,469
lifelong learning process do you want
something that kind of gives signs of a

04:13:30,469 --> 04:13:30,479
something that kind of gives signs of a
 

14489
04:13:30,479 --> 04:13:32,630
something that kind of gives signs of a
being like what's the difference

14490
04:13:32,630 --> 04:13:32,640
being like what's the difference
 

14491
04:13:32,640 --> 04:13:34,229
being like what's the difference
between

04:13:46,149 --> 04:13:46,159
action policy i mean it's implemented on
 

14505
04:13:46,159 --> 04:13:48,149
action policy i mean it's implemented on
a biological substrate and it's

14506
04:13:48,149 --> 04:13:48,159
a biological substrate and it's
 

14507
04:13:48,159 --> 04:13:49,429
a biological substrate and it's
interesting thinking about things like

14508
04:13:49,429 --> 04:13:49,439
interesting thinking about things like
 

14509
04:13:49,439 --> 04:13:51,110
interesting thinking about things like
that where we know fundamentally the

specialized things that are very
 

14517
04:13:57,600 --> 04:13:59,030
specialized things that are very
valuable for what we're doing but it's

14518
04:13:59,030 --> 04:13:59,040
valuable for what we're doing but it's
 

14519
04:13:59,040 --> 04:14:01,110
valuable for what we're doing but it's
not the way the brain's doing now i do

14520
04:14:01,110 --> 04:14:01,120
not the way the brain's doing now i do
 

14521
04:14:01,120 --> 04:14:04,149
not the way the brain's doing now i do
think consciousness and ai in general is

14522
04:14:04,149 --> 04:14:04,159
think consciousness and ai in general is
 

14523
04:14:04,159 --> 04:14:07,030
think consciousness and ai in general is
a substrate independent mechanism where

14524
04:14:07,030 --> 04:14:07,040
a substrate independent mechanism where
 

14525
04:14:07,040 --> 04:14:08,309
a substrate independent mechanism where
it doesn't have to be implemented the

14526
04:14:08,309 --> 04:14:08,319
it doesn't have to be implemented the
 

14527
04:14:08,319 --> 04:14:10,550
it doesn't have to be implemented the
way the brain is but if you've only got

14528
04:14:10,550 --> 04:14:10,560
way the brain is but if you've only got
 

14529
04:14:10,560 --> 04:14:12,710
way the brain is but if you've only got
one existence proof there's certainly

14530
04:14:12,710 --> 04:14:12,720
one existence proof there's certainly
 

14531
04:14:12,720 --> 04:14:14,790
one existence proof there's certainly
some value in caring about what it says

14532
04:14:14,790 --> 04:14:14,800
some value in caring about what it says
 

14533
04:14:14,800 --> 04:14:15,990
some value in caring about what it says
and does

14534
04:14:15,990 --> 04:14:16,000
and does

and so the the idea that anything that

14538
04:14:19,670 --> 04:14:19,680
and so the the idea that anything that
 

14539
04:14:19,680 --> 04:14:21,670
and so the the idea that anything that
can be done with a narrow ai that you

14540
04:14:21,670 --> 04:14:21,680
can be done with a narrow ai that you
 

14541
04:14:21,680 --> 04:14:24,229
can be done with a narrow ai that you
can quantify up a loss function for or

14542
04:14:24,229 --> 04:14:24,239
can quantify up a loss function for or
 

14543
04:14:24,239 --> 04:14:26,389
can quantify up a loss function for or
reward mechanism you're almost certainly

14544
04:14:26,389 --> 04:14:26,399
reward mechanism you're almost certainly
 

14545
04:14:26,399 --> 04:14:28,149
reward mechanism you're almost certainly
going to be able to produce something

14546
04:14:28,149 --> 04:14:28,159
going to be able to produce something
 

14547
04:14:28,159 --> 04:14:30,790
going to be able to produce something
that's more resource effective to train

14548
04:14:30,790 --> 04:14:30,800
that's more resource effective to train
 

14549
04:14:30,800 --> 04:14:32,950
that's more resource effective to train
and deploy and use in an inference mode

14550
04:14:32,950 --> 04:14:32,960
and deploy and use in an inference mode
 

14551
04:14:32,960 --> 04:14:34,389
and deploy and use in an inference mode
you know train a whole lot using an

14552
04:14:34,389 --> 04:14:34,399
you know train a whole lot using an
 

14553
04:14:34,399 --> 04:14:37,110
you know train a whole lot using an
inference but uh a living being is going

14554
04:14:37,110 --> 04:14:37,120
inference but uh a living being is going
 

14555
04:14:37,120 --> 04:14:39,189
inference but uh a living being is going
to be something that's a continuous

14556
04:14:39,189 --> 04:14:39,199
to be something that's a continuous
 

14557
04:14:39,199 --> 04:14:42,790
to be something that's a continuous
lifelong learned task agnostic thing

14558
04:14:42,790 --> 04:14:42,800
lifelong learned task agnostic thing
 

14559
04:14:42,800 --> 04:14:44,630
lifelong learned task agnostic thing
and

14560
04:14:44,630 --> 04:14:44,640
and
 

14561
04:14:44,640 --> 04:14:47,030
and
learning is really important too and the

14562
04:14:47,030 --> 04:14:47,040
learning is really important too and the
 

14563
04:14:47,040 --> 04:14:48,630
learning is really important too and the
long-term memory

14564
04:14:48,630 --> 04:14:48,640
long-term memory
 

14565
04:14:48,640 --> 04:14:50,870
long-term memory
so memories is a big

14566
04:14:50,870 --> 04:14:50,880
so memories is a big
 

14567
04:14:50,880 --> 04:14:52,870
so memories is a big
part of that we've got

14568
04:14:52,870 --> 04:14:52,880
part of that we've got
 

14569
04:14:52,880 --> 04:14:54,630
part of that we've got
you know again i have all the respect in

04:14:54,630 --> 04:14:54,640
you know again i have all the respect in

04:14:54,640 --> 04:14:56,229
you know again i have all the respect in
the world for the amazing things that

04:14:56,229 --> 04:14:56,239
the world for the amazing things that
 

14573
04:14:56,239 --> 04:14:58,149
the world for the amazing things that
are being done now but sometimes they

14574
04:14:58,149 --> 04:14:58,159
are being done now but sometimes they
 

14575
04:14:58,159 --> 04:15:00,389
are being done now but sometimes they
can be taken a little bit out of context

14576
04:15:00,389 --> 04:15:00,399
can be taken a little bit out of context
 

14577
04:15:00,399 --> 04:15:01,670
can be taken a little bit out of context
with things like

14578
04:15:01,670 --> 04:15:01,680
with things like
 

14579
04:15:01,680 --> 04:15:03,349
with things like
like there's some smoke and mirrors

14580
04:15:03,349 --> 04:15:03,359
like there's some smoke and mirrors
 

14581
04:15:03,359 --> 04:15:05,510
like there's some smoke and mirrors
going on like the gato the recent work

14582
04:15:05,510 --> 04:15:05,520
going on like the gato the recent work
 

14583
04:15:05,520 --> 04:15:07,510
going on like the gato the recent work
the multi-task learning stuff you know

14584
04:15:07,510 --> 04:15:07,520
the multi-task learning stuff you know
 

14585
04:15:07,520 --> 04:15:09,830
the multi-task learning stuff you know
it's amazing that it's the one it's one

14586
04:15:09,830 --> 04:15:09,840
it's amazing that it's the one it's one
 

14587
04:15:09,840 --> 04:15:12,149
it's amazing that it's the one it's one
model that plays all the atari games i

14588
04:15:12,149 --> 04:15:12,159
model that plays all the atari games i
 

14589
04:15:12,159 --> 04:15:13,910
model that plays all the atari games i
am as well as doing all these other

04:15:13,910 --> 04:15:13,920
am as well as doing all these other
 

14591
04:15:13,920 --> 04:15:16,550
am as well as doing all these other
things but i of course it didn't learn

14592
04:15:16,550 --> 04:15:16,560
things but i of course it didn't learn
 

14593
04:15:16,560 --> 04:15:18,790
things but i of course it didn't learn
to do all of those it was instructed in

04:15:18,790 --> 04:15:18,800
to do all of those it was instructed in
 

14595
04:15:18,800 --> 04:15:20,790
to do all of those it was instructed in
doing that by other reinforcement

doing that by other reinforcement
 

14597
04:15:20,800 --> 04:15:22,950
doing that by other reinforcement
learners going through and doing that

14599
04:15:22,960 --> 04:15:24,950

and even in the case of all the games

14600
04:15:24,950 --> 04:15:24,960
and even in the case of all the games
 

14601
04:15:24,960 --> 04:15:27,110
and even in the case of all the games
it's still going with a specific

04:15:27,110 --> 04:15:27,120
it's still going with a specific
 

14603
04:15:27,120 --> 04:15:29,349
it's still going with a specific

those atari games where it's not that
 

14607
04:15:32,000 --> 04:15:33,590
those atari games where it's not that
you know how does it just wants to spend

14608
04:15:33,590 --> 04:15:33,600
you know how does it just wants to spend
 

14609
04:15:33,600 --> 04:15:35,349
you know how does it just wants to spend
its summer afternoon playing atari

14610
04:15:35,349 --> 04:15:35,359
its summer afternoon playing atari
 

14611
04:15:35,359 --> 04:15:36,790
its summer afternoon playing atari
because that's the most interesting

14612
04:15:36,790 --> 04:15:36,800
because that's the most interesting
 

14613
04:15:36,800 --> 04:15:39,750
because that's the most interesting
thing for it so it's again not a general

14614
04:15:39,750 --> 04:15:39,760
thing for it so it's again not a general
 

14615
04:15:39,760 --> 04:15:41,990
thing for it so it's again not a general
it's not learning the way humans learn

14616
04:15:41,990 --> 04:15:42,000
it's not learning the way humans learn
 

14617
04:15:42,000 --> 04:15:44,149
it's not learning the way humans learn
and there's i believe a lot of things

14618
04:15:44,149 --> 04:15:44,159
and there's i believe a lot of things
 

14619
04:15:44,159 --> 04:15:46,149
and there's i believe a lot of things
that are challenging to make a loss

14620
04:15:46,149 --> 04:15:46,159
that are challenging to make a loss
 

14621
04:15:46,159 --> 04:15:48,630
that are challenging to make a loss
function for that you can train uh

14622
04:15:48,630 --> 04:15:48,640
function for that you can train uh
 

14623
04:15:48,640 --> 04:15:50,229
function for that you can train uh

but there's still going to be a set of

but there's still going to be a set of

things and we've got questionable cases
 

14643
04:16:07,199 --> 04:16:09,910
things and we've got questionable cases
like the self-driving car where it's

see i i still think that uh self-driving

14700
04:17:06,550 --> 04:17:06,560
see i i still think that uh self-driving
 

14701

see i i still think that uh self-driving
cars solving that problem will take us

very far towards agi you might not need

agi
 

14707
04:17:11,600 --> 04:17:14,630
agi
but i am really inspired by what

14708
04:17:14,630 --> 04:17:14,640
but i am really inspired by what

autopilot is doing uh waymo

14710
04:17:17,830 --> 04:17:17,840

14711
04:17:17,840 --> 04:17:19,349
autopilot is doing uh waymo
so these some of the other companies i

14712
04:17:19,349 --> 04:17:19,359
so these some of the other companies i
 

14713
04:17:19,359 --> 04:17:22,070
so these some of the other companies i
think waymo leads the way there

14714
04:17:22,070 --> 04:17:22,080
think waymo leads the way there
 

14715
04:17:22,080 --> 04:17:23,590
think waymo leads the way there
is also really interesting but they

14716
04:17:23,590 --> 04:17:23,600
is also really interesting but they
 

14717
04:17:23,600 --> 04:17:25,830
is also really interesting but they
don't have quite as ambitious of an

don't have quite as ambitious of an

sort of data-hungry approach to driving

14722
04:17:31,990 --> 04:17:32,000
sort of data-hungry approach to driving
 

14723
04:17:32,000 --> 04:17:34,149
sort of data-hungry approach to driving
which i think is very close to the kind

14724
04:17:34,149 --> 04:17:34,159
which i think is very close to the kind
 

14725
04:17:34,159 --> 04:17:36,389
which i think is very close to the kind
of thing that would take us far

14726
04:17:36,389 --> 04:17:36,399
of thing that would take us far
 

14727
04:17:36,399 --> 04:17:38,630
of thing that would take us far
towards agi yeah and it's a it's a funny

14728
04:17:38,630 --> 04:17:38,640
towards agi yeah and it's a it's a funny
 

14729
04:17:38,640 --> 04:17:40,950
towards agi yeah and it's a it's a funny
thing because as far as i can tell elon

14730
04:17:40,950 --> 04:17:40,960
thing because as far as i can tell elon
 

14731

tried to draw him out to talk about ai

14738
04:17:48,870 --> 04:17:48,880

14739
04:17:48,880 --> 04:17:51,269
tried to draw him out to talk about ai
and he just didn't want to and i think

14740
04:17:51,269 --> 04:17:51,279
and he just didn't want to and i think
 

14741
04:17:51,279 --> 04:17:52,950
and he just didn't want to and i think
that you know i get that little

that you know i get that little
 

14743

needs to have a body
 

14793
04:18:40,960 --> 04:18:42,870
needs to have a body
to start to

14794
04:18:42,870 --> 04:18:42,880
to start to
 

14795
04:18:42,880 --> 04:18:45,429
to start to
notice the signs of life and to develop

14796
04:18:45,429 --> 04:18:45,439
notice the signs of life and to develop
 

14797
04:18:45,439 --> 04:18:47,750
notice the signs of life and to develop
the kind of system that's able

14798
04:18:47,750 --> 04:18:47,760
the kind of system that's able
 

14799
04:18:47,760 --> 04:18:50,229
the kind of system that's able
to reason perceive the world in the way

14800
04:18:50,229 --> 04:18:50,239
to reason perceive the world in the way
 

14801
04:18:50,239 --> 04:18:52,229
to reason perceive the world in the way
that an agi should and

14802
04:18:52,229 --> 04:18:52,239
that an agi should and
 

14803
04:18:52,239 --> 04:18:54,149
that an agi should and
act in the world so should we be

14804
04:18:54,149 --> 04:18:54,159
act in the world so should we be
 

14805
04:18:54,159 --> 04:18:55,910
act in the world so should we be
thinking about robots or can this be

14806
04:18:55,910 --> 04:18:55,920
thinking about robots or can this be
 

14807
04:18:55,920 --> 04:18:58,630
thinking about robots or can this be
achieved in a purely digital so i have a

14808
04:18:58,630 --> 04:18:58,640
achieved in a purely digital so i have a
 

14809
04:18:58,640 --> 04:19:01,429
achieved in a purely digital so i have a
clear opinion on that and that's that no

14810
04:19:01,429 --> 04:19:01,439
clear opinion on that and that's that no
 

14811
04:19:01,439 --> 04:19:03,349
clear opinion on that and that's that no
it does not need to be embodied in the

14812
04:19:03,349 --> 04:19:03,359
it does not need to be embodied in the
 

14813
04:19:03,359 --> 04:19:05,670
it does not need to be embodied in the
physical world where you could say most

14814
04:19:05,670 --> 04:19:05,680
physical world where you could say most
 

14815
04:19:05,680 --> 04:19:08,469
physical world where you could say most
of my career is about making simulated

14816
04:19:08,469 --> 04:19:08,479
of my career is about making simulated
 

14817
04:19:08,479 --> 04:19:10,469
of my career is about making simulated
virtual worlds you know in games or

14818
04:19:10,469 --> 04:19:10,479
virtual worlds you know in games or
 

14819
04:19:10,479 --> 04:19:13,429
virtual worlds you know in games or
virtual reality and so on a fundamental

14820
04:19:13,429 --> 04:19:13,439
virtual reality and so on a fundamental
 

14821
04:19:13,439 --> 04:19:14,950
virtual reality and so on a fundamental
level i believe that you can make a

14822
04:19:14,950 --> 04:19:14,960
level i believe that you can make a
 

14823
04:19:14,960 --> 04:19:17,030
level i believe that you can make a
simulated environment that provides much

14824
04:19:17,030 --> 04:19:17,040
simulated environment that provides much
 

14825
04:19:17,040 --> 04:19:18,710
simulated environment that provides much
of the value of what the real

14826
04:19:18,710 --> 04:19:18,720
of the value of what the real
 

14827
04:19:18,720 --> 04:19:20,790
of the value of what the real
environment does and restricting

14828
04:19:20,790 --> 04:19:20,800
environment does and restricting
 

14829
04:19:20,800 --> 04:19:22,149
environment does and restricting
yourself to

14830
04:19:22,149 --> 04:19:22,159
yourself to
 

14831
04:19:22,159 --> 04:19:23,910
yourself to
operating at real time in the physical

14832
04:19:23,910 --> 04:19:23,920
operating at real time in the physical
 

14833
04:19:23,920 --> 04:19:25,910
operating at real time in the physical
world with physical objects i think is

14834
04:19:25,910 --> 04:19:25,920
world with physical objects i think is
 

14835
04:19:25,920 --> 04:19:28,469
world with physical objects i think is
an enormous handicap i mean that's one

14836
04:19:28,469 --> 04:19:28,479
an enormous handicap i mean that's one
 

14837
04:19:28,479 --> 04:19:30,229
an enormous handicap i mean that's one
of the real lessons driven home by all

14838
04:19:30,229 --> 04:19:30,239
of the real lessons driven home by all
 

14839
04:19:30,239 --> 04:19:33,910
of the real lessons driven home by all
my aerospace work is that i've you know

14840
04:19:33,910 --> 04:19:33,920
my aerospace work is that i've you know
 

14841
04:19:33,920 --> 04:19:36,070
my aerospace work is that i've you know
reality is a in so many ways there

14842
04:19:36,070 --> 04:19:36,080
reality is a in so many ways there
 

14843
04:19:36,080 --> 04:19:37,670
reality is a in so many ways there
we're dealing with all the mechanical

14844
04:19:37,670 --> 04:19:37,680
we're dealing with all the mechanical
 

14845
04:19:37,680 --> 04:19:39,510
we're dealing with all the mechanical
components like everything fails

14846
04:19:39,510 --> 04:19:39,520
components like everything fails
 

14847
04:19:39,520 --> 04:19:41,030
components like everything fails
murphy's law even if you've done it

14848
04:19:41,030 --> 04:19:41,040
murphy's law even if you've done it
 

14849
04:19:41,040 --> 04:19:42,790
murphy's law even if you've done it
right before on your fifth one it might

14850
04:19:42,790 --> 04:19:42,800
right before on your fifth one it might
 

14851
04:19:42,800 --> 04:19:45,510
right before on your fifth one it might
come out differently so yeah i think

14852
04:19:45,510 --> 04:19:45,520
come out differently so yeah i think
 

14853
04:19:45,520 --> 04:19:47,510
come out differently so yeah i think
that anybody that

14854
04:19:47,510 --> 04:19:47,520
that anybody that
 

14855
04:19:47,520 --> 04:19:49,910
that anybody that
that is all in on the embodied aspect of

14856
04:19:49,910 --> 04:19:49,920
that is all in on the embodied aspect of
 

14857
04:19:49,920 --> 04:19:52,550
that is all in on the embodied aspect of
it they are tying a huge weight to their

14858
04:19:52,550 --> 04:19:52,560
it they are tying a huge weight to their
 

14859
04:19:52,560 --> 04:19:54,870
it they are tying a huge weight to their
ankles and i think that

14860
04:19:54,870 --> 04:19:54,880
ankles and i think that
 

14861
04:19:54,880 --> 04:19:56,149
ankles and i think that
i i would

14862
04:19:56,149 --> 04:19:56,159
i i would
 

14863
04:19:56,159 --> 04:19:57,910
i i would
almost count them out anybody that's

14864
04:19:57,910 --> 04:19:57,920
almost count them out anybody that's
 

14865
04:19:57,920 --> 04:19:59,189
almost count them out anybody that's
making that a cornerstone of their

14866
04:19:59,189 --> 04:19:59,199
making that a cornerstone of their
 

14867
04:19:59,199 --> 04:20:00,870
making that a cornerstone of their
belief about it i would almost write

14868
04:20:00,870 --> 04:20:00,880
belief about it i would almost write
 

14869
04:20:00,880 --> 04:20:02,870
belief about it i would almost write
them off as being worried about them

14870
04:20:02,870 --> 04:20:02,880
them off as being worried about them
 

14871
04:20:02,880 --> 04:20:05,269
them off as being worried about them
getting to agi first i was very

14872
04:20:05,269 --> 04:20:05,279
getting to agi first i was very
 

14873
04:20:05,279 --> 04:20:07,750
getting to agi first i was very
surprised that elon's big on the uh the

14874
04:20:07,750 --> 04:20:07,760
surprised that elon's big on the uh the
 

14875
04:20:07,760 --> 04:20:09,830
surprised that elon's big on the uh the
humanoid robots i mean like the nasa

14876
04:20:09,830 --> 04:20:09,840
humanoid robots i mean like the nasa
 

14877
04:20:09,840 --> 04:20:12,309
humanoid robots i mean like the nasa
robonaut stuff was always almost a gag

14878
04:20:12,309 --> 04:20:12,319
robonaut stuff was always almost a gag
 

14879
04:20:12,319 --> 04:20:14,630
robonaut stuff was always almost a gag
line like what are you doing people well

14880
04:20:14,630 --> 04:20:14,640
line like what are you doing people well
 

14881
04:20:14,640 --> 04:20:16,229
line like what are you doing people well
that's very interesting because i he has

14882
04:20:16,229 --> 04:20:16,239
that's very interesting because i he has
 

14883
04:20:16,239 --> 04:20:18,389
that's very interesting because i he has
a very pragmatic view of that that's

14884
04:20:18,389 --> 04:20:18,399
a very pragmatic view of that that's
 

14885
04:20:18,399 --> 04:20:20,070
a very pragmatic view of that that's
just the

14886
04:20:20,070 --> 04:20:20,080
just the
 

14887
04:20:20,080 --> 04:20:22,630
just the
um a way to solve a particular problem

14888
04:20:22,630 --> 04:20:22,640
um a way to solve a particular problem
 

14889
04:20:22,640 --> 04:20:24,870
um a way to solve a particular problem
in a factory now i do think that once

14890
04:20:24,870 --> 04:20:24,880
in a factory now i do think that once
 

14891
04:20:24,880 --> 04:20:27,590
in a factory now i do think that once
you have an agi robotic bodies humanoid

14892
04:20:27,590 --> 04:20:27,600
you have an agi robotic bodies humanoid
 

14893
04:20:27,600 --> 04:20:29,030
you have an agi robotic bodies humanoid
bodies are going to be enormously

14894
04:20:29,030 --> 04:20:29,040
bodies are going to be enormously
 

14895
04:20:29,040 --> 04:20:30,630
bodies are going to be enormously
valuable i just don't think they're

14896
04:20:30,630 --> 04:20:30,640
valuable i just don't think they're
 

14897
04:20:30,640 --> 04:20:33,110
valuable i just don't think they're
helpful getting to agi well here's a

14898
04:20:33,110 --> 04:20:33,120
helpful getting to agi well here's a
 

14899
04:20:33,120 --> 04:20:35,269
helpful getting to agi well here's a
very sort of practical view which i

14900
04:20:35,269 --> 04:20:35,279
very sort of practical view which i
 

14901
04:20:35,279 --> 04:20:37,670
very sort of practical view which i
disagree with and i argue with him but

14902
04:20:37,670 --> 04:20:37,680
disagree with and i argue with him but
 

14903
04:20:37,680 --> 04:20:39,590
disagree with and i argue with him but
it's a practical view that there's

14904
04:20:39,590 --> 04:20:39,600
it's a practical view that there's
 

14905
04:20:39,600 --> 04:20:41,910
it's a practical view that there's
you know you could transfer the the

14906
04:20:41,910 --> 04:20:41,920
you know you could transfer the the
 

14907
04:20:41,920 --> 04:20:44,630
you know you could transfer the the
problem of driving to the problem of

14908
04:20:44,630 --> 04:20:44,640
problem of driving to the problem of
 

14909
04:20:44,640 --> 04:20:48,149
problem of driving to the problem of
uh robotic manipulation because so much

14910
04:20:48,149 --> 04:20:48,159
uh robotic manipulation because so much
 

14911
04:20:48,159 --> 04:20:50,790
uh robotic manipulation because so much
of it is perception it's perception and

14912
04:20:50,790 --> 04:20:50,800
of it is perception it's perception and
 

14913
04:20:50,800 --> 04:20:53,189
of it is perception it's perception and
action and it's just a different context

14914
04:20:53,189 --> 04:20:53,199
action and it's just a different context
 

14915
04:20:53,199 --> 04:20:55,189
action and it's just a different context
and so you can apply all the same kind

14916
04:20:55,189 --> 04:20:55,199
and so you can apply all the same kind
 

14917
04:20:55,199 --> 04:20:57,189
and so you can apply all the same kind
of data engine

14918
04:20:57,189 --> 04:20:57,199
of data engine
 

14919
04:20:57,199 --> 04:20:59,189
of data engine
learning processes to a different

14920
04:20:59,189 --> 04:20:59,199
learning processes to a different
 

14921
04:20:59,199 --> 04:21:01,750
learning processes to a different
environment and so why not apply to the

14922
04:21:01,750 --> 04:21:01,760
environment and so why not apply to the
 

14923
04:21:01,760 --> 04:21:05,990
environment and so why not apply to the
humanoid robot environment but

14924
04:21:05,990 --> 04:21:06,000

 

14925
04:21:06,000 --> 04:21:07,429

i think

14926
04:21:07,429 --> 04:21:07,439
i think
 

14927
04:21:07,439 --> 04:21:09,349
i think
i i do think that there's a certain

14928
04:21:09,349 --> 04:21:09,359
i i do think that there's a certain
 

14929
04:21:09,359 --> 04:21:12,710
i i do think that there's a certain
magic to the embodied robot

14930
04:21:12,710 --> 04:21:12,720
magic to the embodied robot
 

14931
04:21:12,720 --> 04:21:14,070
magic to the embodied robot
that may be the thing that finally

14932
04:21:14,070 --> 04:21:14,080
that may be the thing that finally
 

14933
04:21:14,080 --> 04:21:16,309
that may be the thing that finally
convinces people yes but again i don't

14934
04:21:16,309 --> 04:21:16,319
convinces people yes but again i don't
 

14935
04:21:16,319 --> 04:21:18,070
convinces people yes but again i don't
really care that much about convincing

14936
04:21:18,070 --> 04:21:18,080
really care that much about convincing
 

14937
04:21:18,080 --> 04:21:19,830
really care that much about convincing
people you know the the world that i'm

14938
04:21:19,830 --> 04:21:19,840
people you know the the world that i'm
 

14939
04:21:19,840 --> 04:21:22,550
people you know the the world that i'm
looking towards is you know you i

14940
04:21:22,550 --> 04:21:22,560
looking towards is you know you i
 

14941
04:21:22,560 --> 04:21:24,870
looking towards is you know you i
you you go to the website and say i want

14942
04:21:24,870 --> 04:21:24,880
you you go to the website and say i want
 

14943
04:21:24,880 --> 04:21:27,110
you you go to the website and say i want
five frank one a's to you know to work

14944
04:21:27,110 --> 04:21:27,120
five frank one a's to you know to work
 

14945
04:21:27,120 --> 04:21:29,030
five frank one a's to you know to work
on my team today and they all spin up

14946

on my team today and they all spin up
and they start showing up in your zoom

14948
04:21:30,469 --> 04:21:30,479
and they start showing up in your zoom
 

14949
04:21:30,479 --> 04:21:31,269
and they start showing up in your zoom
meetings

14950
04:21:31,269 --> 04:21:31,279
meetings
 

14951
04:21:31,279 --> 04:21:33,189
meetings
to push to push back but also to agree

14952
04:21:33,189 --> 04:21:33,199
to push to push back but also to agree
 

14953
04:21:33,199 --> 04:21:34,790
to push to push back but also to agree
with you but first to push back i do

14954
04:21:34,790 --> 04:21:34,800
with you but first to push back i do
 

14955
04:21:34,800 --> 04:21:37,030
with you but first to push back i do
think you need to convince people

14956
04:21:37,030 --> 04:21:37,040
think you need to convince people
 

14957
04:21:37,040 --> 04:21:39,110
think you need to convince people
for them to welcome that thing into your

14958
04:21:39,110 --> 04:21:39,120
for them to welcome that thing into your
 

14959
04:21:39,120 --> 04:21:41,189
for them to welcome that thing into your
life into their life i think there's

14960
04:21:41,189 --> 04:21:41,199
life into their life i think there's
 

14961
04:21:41,199 --> 04:21:43,510
life into their life i think there's
enough businesses that operate on an

14962
04:21:43,510 --> 04:21:43,520
enough businesses that operate on an
 

14963
04:21:43,520 --> 04:21:45,750
enough businesses that operate on an
objective kind of profit loss sort of

14964
04:21:45,750 --> 04:21:45,760
objective kind of profit loss sort of
 

14965
04:21:45,760 --> 04:21:47,750
objective kind of profit loss sort of
basis that i mean if you look at how

14966
04:21:47,750 --> 04:21:47,760
basis that i mean if you look at how
 

14967
04:21:47,760 --> 04:21:49,030
basis that i mean if you look at how
many things

14968
04:21:49,030 --> 04:21:49,040
many things
 

14969
04:21:49,040 --> 04:21:50,790
many things
again talking about the the world as an

again talking about the the world as an
 

14971
04:21:50,800 --> 04:21:53,110
again talking about the the world as an
evolutionary space there when you do

14972
04:21:53,110 --> 04:21:53,120
evolutionary space there when you do
 

14973
04:21:53,120 --> 04:21:54,950
evolutionary space there when you do
have free markets and you have

14974
04:21:54,950 --> 04:21:54,960
have free markets and you have
 

14975
04:21:54,960 --> 04:21:57,030
have free markets and you have
entrepreneurs uh you're going to have

14976
04:21:57,030 --> 04:21:57,040
entrepreneurs uh you're going to have
 

14977
04:21:57,040 --> 04:21:58,149
entrepreneurs uh you're going to have
people that are going to be willing to

14978
04:21:58,149 --> 04:21:58,159
people that are going to be willing to
 

14979
04:21:58,159 --> 04:22:01,030
people that are going to be willing to
go out and try whatever crazy things and

14980
04:22:01,030 --> 04:22:01,040
go out and try whatever crazy things and
 

14981
04:22:01,040 --> 04:22:03,110
go out and try whatever crazy things and
when it proves to be beneficial you know

14982
04:22:03,110 --> 04:22:03,120
when it proves to be beneficial you know
 

14983
04:22:03,120 --> 04:22:04,870
when it proves to be beneficial you know
there's fast followers in all sorts of

14984
04:22:04,870 --> 04:22:04,880
there's fast followers in all sorts of
 

14985
04:22:04,880 --> 04:22:05,990
there's fast followers in all sorts of

14987
04:22:06,000 --> 04:22:08,630
places
yeah and and you're saying that i mean

14988
04:22:08,630 --> 04:22:08,640
yeah and and you're saying that i mean
 

14989
04:22:08,640 --> 04:22:10,630
yeah and and you're saying that i mean
you know quake in vr

14990
04:22:10,630 --> 04:22:10,640
you know quake in vr
 

14991
04:22:10,640 --> 04:22:12,710
you know quake in vr
is a kind of embodiment but just in a

04:22:12,710 --> 04:22:12,720
is a kind of embodiment but just in a
 

14993
04:22:12,720 --> 04:22:15,349
is a kind of embodiment but just in a
digital world and if if you're able to

14994
04:22:15,349 --> 04:22:15,359
digital world and if if you're able to
 

14995
04:22:15,359 --> 04:22:17,110
digital world and if if you're able to
demonstrate if you're able to do

14996
04:22:17,110 --> 04:22:17,120
demonstrate if you're able to do
 

14997
04:22:17,120 --> 04:22:18,950
demonstrate if you're able to do
something productive in that kind of

14998
04:22:18,950 --> 04:22:18,960
something productive in that kind of
 

14999
04:22:18,960 --> 04:22:20,070
something productive in that kind of
digital

uh
 

15005
04:22:22,960 --> 04:22:25,429
uh
then then agi doesn't need to have a

04:22:25,429 --> 04:22:25,439
then then agi doesn't need to have a
 

15007
04:22:25,439 --> 04:22:26,950
then then agi doesn't need to have a
body yeah it's like one of the really

15008
04:22:26,950 --> 04:22:26,960
body yeah it's like one of the really
 

15009
04:22:26,960 --> 04:22:28,710
body yeah it's like one of the really
practical technical questions that i

15010
04:22:28,710 --> 04:22:28,720
practical technical questions that i
 

15011
04:22:28,720 --> 04:22:31,670
practical technical questions that i
kind of keep arguing with myself over if

15012
04:22:31,670 --> 04:22:31,680
kind of keep arguing with myself over if
 

15013
04:22:31,680 --> 04:22:33,750
kind of keep arguing with myself over if
you're doing a training and learning and

15014
04:22:33,750 --> 04:22:33,760
you're doing a training and learning and
 

15015
04:22:33,760 --> 04:22:35,510
you're doing a training and learning and
you've got like you can watch sesame

15016
04:22:35,510 --> 04:22:35,520
you've got like you can watch sesame
 

15017
04:22:35,520 --> 04:22:37,349
you've got like you can watch sesame
street you can play master system games

15018
04:22:37,349 --> 04:22:37,359
street you can play master system games
 

15019
04:22:37,359 --> 04:22:39,750
street you can play master system games
or something is it enough to have just a

or something is it enough to have just a
 

15021
04:22:39,760 --> 04:22:41,990
or something is it enough to have just a
video feed that that is that video

15022
04:22:41,990 --> 04:22:42,000
video feed that that is that video
 

15023
04:22:42,000 --> 04:22:45,030
video feed that that is that video
coming in or should it literally be on a

coming in or should it literally be on a
 

15025
04:22:45,040 --> 04:22:47,750

15026
04:22:47,750 --> 04:22:47,760
virtual tv set in a virtual room even if
 

15027
04:22:47,760 --> 04:22:49,830
virtual tv set in a virtual room even if
it's you know a simple room just to have

15028
04:22:49,830 --> 04:22:49,840
it's you know a simple room just to have
 

15029
04:22:49,840 --> 04:22:51,670
it's you know a simple room just to have
that sense of you're looking at a 2d

04:22:57,760 --> 04:22:59,349
and i
you know i think it's possible to maybe

04:22:59,349 --> 04:22:59,359
you know i think it's possible to maybe
 

15039
04:22:59,359 --> 04:23:01,590
you know i think it's possible to maybe
get past some of these signs of life of

04:23:01,590 --> 04:23:01,600
get past some of these signs of life of
 

15041
04:23:01,600 --> 04:23:03,429
get past some of these signs of life of
things with the uh just kind of

15042
04:23:03,429 --> 04:23:03,439
things with the uh just kind of

04:23:03,439 --> 04:23:05,110
things with the uh just kind of

15061
04:23:23,359 --> 04:23:25,429
other self-play i do think is one of the
critical things where socialization wise

it's nice you can always slow down time

15072
04:23:37,349 --> 04:23:37,359
it's nice you can always slow down time
 

15073

15102
04:24:09,510 --> 04:24:09,520
i come back to the value of constraints
 

15103
04:24:09,520 --> 04:24:11,189
i come back to the value of constraints
in a lot of ways and if i say well one

15104
04:24:11,189 --> 04:24:11,199
in a lot of ways and if i say well one
 

15105

of my constraints is real-time operation

15106

of my constraints is real-time operation
 

15107
04:24:13,840 --> 04:24:16,070
of my constraints is real-time operation
i mean it might still be a huge data

15108
04:24:16,070 --> 04:24:16,080
i mean it might still be a huge data
 

15109
04:24:16,080 --> 04:24:18,630
i mean it might still be a huge data

15137
04:24:48,319 --> 04:24:50,309
and learned i think that you know i
think that that's a valuable thing so i

15138
04:24:50,309 --> 04:24:50,319
think that that's a valuable thing so i
 

15139
04:24:50,319 --> 04:24:52,950
think that that's a valuable thing so i
do keep all of my eyes on on things that

04:24:52,950 --> 04:24:52,960
do keep all of my eyes on on things that

do you think the most compelling

15148
04:25:00,389 --> 04:25:00,399
do you think the most compelling
 

15149
04:25:00,399 --> 04:25:03,830
do you think the most compelling
experience is that first will be

15150
04:25:03,830 --> 04:25:03,840
experience is that first will be
 

15151
04:25:03,840 --> 04:25:06,469

in airports
so uh meaning is is it if it's

15156
04:25:11,510 --> 04:25:11,520
so uh meaning is is it if it's
 

15157
04:25:11,520 --> 04:25:13,990
so uh meaning is is it if it's
interacting with

15158
04:25:13,990 --> 04:25:14,000
interacting with
 

15159
04:25:14,000 --> 04:25:16,630
interacting with
ai agents will it be

15160
04:25:16,630 --> 04:25:16,640
ai agents will it be
 

15161
04:25:16,640 --> 04:25:19,510
ai agents will it be
sort of uh like friends

15162
04:25:19,510 --> 04:25:19,520
sort of uh like friends
 

15163
04:25:19,520 --> 04:25:20,710
sort of uh like friends
um

15164
04:25:20,710 --> 04:25:20,720
um

almost like a therapist or whatever that

04:25:25,269 --> 04:25:25,279
almost like a therapist or whatever that
 

15169
04:25:25,279 --> 04:25:27,670
almost like a therapist or whatever that
kind of interaction or is it in the

15170
04:25:27,670 --> 04:25:27,680
kind of interaction or is it in the
 

15171
04:25:27,680 --> 04:25:29,590
kind of interaction or is it in the
business setting something like you said

15172
04:25:29,590 --> 04:25:29,600
business setting something like you said
 

15173
04:25:29,600 --> 04:25:31,830

brainstorming different ideas

15174

brainstorming different ideas
 

15175
04:25:31,840 --> 04:25:32,630
brainstorming different ideas
so

15176
04:25:32,630 --> 04:25:32,640
so
 

15177
04:25:32,640 --> 04:25:34,389
so
this is all a different formulation of

15178
04:25:34,389 --> 04:25:34,399
this is all a different formulation of
 

15179
04:25:34,399 --> 04:25:36,309
this is all a different formulation of
kind of a touring test or the spirit of

15180
04:25:36,309 --> 04:25:36,319
kind of a touring test or the spirit of
 

15181
04:25:36,319 --> 04:25:37,910
kind of a touring test or the spirit of
the original touring test where do you

15182
04:25:37,910 --> 04:25:37,920
the original touring test where do you
 

15183
04:25:37,920 --> 04:25:39,189
the original touring test where do you
think the biggest

15184
04:25:39,189 --> 04:25:39,199
think the biggest
 

15185
04:25:39,199 --> 04:25:41,030
think the biggest
benefit will first come so it's going to

15186
04:25:41,030 --> 04:25:41,040
benefit will first come so it's going to
 

15187
04:25:41,040 --> 04:25:43,189

but still if you've got thousands of
 

15255
04:26:48,640 --> 04:26:51,910
but still if you've got thousands of
gpus uh necessary to run these things

15256
04:26:51,910 --> 04:26:51,920
gpus uh necessary to run these things
 

15257
04:26:51,920 --> 04:26:54,309
gpus uh necessary to run these things
it's going to be kind of expensive where

15258
04:26:54,309 --> 04:26:54,319
it's going to be kind of expensive where
 

15259
04:26:54,319 --> 04:26:56,630
it's going to be kind of expensive where
it might start off i'm a thousand

15260
04:26:56,630 --> 04:26:56,640
it might start off i'm a thousand
 

15261
04:26:56,640 --> 04:26:58,469
it might start off i'm a thousand
dollars an hour for your you know even

15262
04:26:58,469 --> 04:26:58,479
dollars an hour for your you know even
 

15263
04:26:58,479 --> 04:27:00,710
dollars an hour for your you know even
post development or something for that

04:27:00,710 --> 04:27:00,720
post development or something for that
 

15265
04:27:00,720 --> 04:27:02,149
post development or something for that
which would be something that you would

15266
04:27:02,149 --> 04:27:02,159
which would be something that you would
 

15267
04:27:02,159 --> 04:27:04,630
which would be something that you would
only use for a business uh you know

15268
04:27:04,630 --> 04:27:04,640
only use for a business uh you know
 

15269
04:27:04,640 --> 04:27:05,590
only use for a business uh you know
something where you think they're gonna

15270
04:27:05,590 --> 04:27:05,600
something where you think they're gonna
 

15271
04:27:05,600 --> 04:27:07,910
something where you think they're gonna
help you make a strategic decision or

15272
04:27:07,910 --> 04:27:07,920
help you make a strategic decision or
 

15273
04:27:07,920 --> 04:27:10,469
help you make a strategic decision or
point out something super important but

15274
04:27:10,469 --> 04:27:10,479
point out something super important but
 

15275
04:27:10,479 --> 04:27:13,189
point out something super important but
i also am completely confident that we

15276
04:27:13,189 --> 04:27:13,199
i also am completely confident that we
 

15277
04:27:13,199 --> 04:27:14,630
i also am completely confident that we
will have another

15278
04:27:14,630 --> 04:27:14,640
will have another
 

15279
04:27:14,640 --> 04:27:17,590
will have another
factor of a thousand in cost performance

15280
04:27:17,590 --> 04:27:17,600
factor of a thousand in cost performance
 

15281
04:27:17,600 --> 04:27:21,110
factor of a thousand in cost performance
increase in agi type calculations uh not

15282
04:27:21,110 --> 04:27:21,120
increase in agi type calculations uh not
 

15283
04:27:21,120 --> 04:27:22,950
increase in agi type calculations uh not
in general computing necessarily but

15284
04:27:22,950 --> 04:27:22,960
in general computing necessarily but
 

15285
04:27:22,960 --> 04:27:24,710
in general computing necessarily but
there's so much more that we can do with

15286
04:27:24,710 --> 04:27:24,720
there's so much more that we can do with
 

15287
04:27:24,720 --> 04:27:26,630
there's so much more that we can do with
packaging making those right trade-offs

15288
04:27:26,630 --> 04:27:26,640
packaging making those right trade-offs
 

15289
04:27:26,640 --> 04:27:28,550
packaging making those right trade-offs
all those same types of things that in

15290
04:27:28,550 --> 04:27:28,560
all those same types of things that in
 

15291
04:27:28,560 --> 04:27:31,030
all those same types of things that in
the couple next couple decades 1000x

15292
04:27:31,030 --> 04:27:31,040
the couple next couple decades 1000x
 

15293
04:27:31,040 --> 04:27:32,550
the couple next couple decades 1000x
easy and then you're down to a dollar an

15294
04:27:32,550 --> 04:27:32,560
easy and then you're down to a dollar an
 

15295
04:27:32,560 --> 04:27:34,229
easy and then you're down to a dollar an
hour and

15296
04:27:34,229 --> 04:27:34,239
hour and
 

15297
04:27:34,239 --> 04:27:36,229
hour and
then you're kind of like well i should

15298
04:27:36,229 --> 04:27:36,239
then you're kind of like well i should
 

15299
04:27:36,239 --> 04:27:38,389
then you're kind of like well i should
have an entourage of ais that are you

15300
04:27:38,389 --> 04:27:38,399
have an entourage of ais that are you
 

15301
04:27:38,399 --> 04:27:40,149
have an entourage of ais that are you
know following me around helping me out

15302
04:27:40,149 --> 04:27:40,159
know following me around helping me out
 

15303
04:27:40,159 --> 04:27:42,710

on anything that i want them to do

15304
04:27:42,710 --> 04:27:42,720
on anything that i want them to do
 

15305
04:27:42,720 --> 04:27:44,630
on anything that i want them to do
that's one interesting trajectory but

15306
04:27:44,630 --> 04:27:44,640
that's one interesting trajectory but
 

15307
04:27:44,640 --> 04:27:46,950
that's one interesting trajectory but
i'll i'll i'll push back because i have

15308
04:27:46,950 --> 04:27:46,960
i'll i'll i'll push back because i have
 

15309
04:27:46,960 --> 04:27:47,910
i'll i'll i'll push back because i have
um

15310
04:27:47,910 --> 04:27:47,920
um
 

15311
04:27:47,920 --> 04:27:50,630
um
so uh for in that case if you want to

15312
04:27:50,630 --> 04:27:50,640
so uh for in that case if you want to
 

15313
04:27:50,640 --> 04:27:52,550
so uh for in that case if you want to
pay thousands of dollars

15314
04:27:52,550 --> 04:27:52,560
pay thousands of dollars
 

15315
04:27:52,560 --> 04:27:55,189
pay thousands of dollars
it should actually provide some value

15316
04:27:55,189 --> 04:27:55,199
it should actually provide some value
 

15317
04:27:55,199 --> 04:27:57,189
it should actually provide some value
i think it's easier

15318
04:27:57,189 --> 04:27:57,199
i think it's easier
 

15319
04:27:57,199 --> 04:28:00,710
i think it's easier
for cheaper to provide

15320
04:28:00,710 --> 04:28:00,720

 

15321
04:28:00,720 --> 04:28:03,910

to provide value via a dumb ai

15322
04:28:03,910 --> 04:28:03,920
to provide value via a dumb ai
 

15323
04:28:03,920 --> 04:28:04,870
to provide value via a dumb ai
uh

15324
04:28:04,870 --> 04:28:04,880
uh
 

15325
04:28:04,880 --> 04:28:07,349
uh
that will take us towards agi to just

15326
04:28:07,349 --> 04:28:07,359
that will take us towards agi to just
 

15327
04:28:07,359 --> 04:28:08,870
that will take us towards agi to just
have a friend

15328
04:28:08,870 --> 04:28:08,880
have a friend
 

15329
04:28:08,880 --> 04:28:11,110
have a friend
i think there's an ocean of loneliness

15330
04:28:11,110 --> 04:28:11,120
i think there's an ocean of loneliness
 

15331
04:28:11,120 --> 04:28:12,389
i think there's an ocean of loneliness
in the world

15332
04:28:12,389 --> 04:28:12,399
in the world
 

15333
04:28:12,399 --> 04:28:14,710
in the world
and i think an effective friend that

15334
04:28:14,710 --> 04:28:14,720
and i think an effective friend that
 

15335
04:28:14,720 --> 04:28:16,630
and i think an effective friend that
doesn't have to be perfect doesn't have

15336
04:28:16,630 --> 04:28:16,640
doesn't have to be perfect doesn't have
 

15337
04:28:16,640 --> 04:28:20,070
doesn't have to be perfect doesn't have
to be intelligent it has to be empathic

15338
04:28:20,070 --> 04:28:20,080
to be intelligent it has to be empathic
 

15339
04:28:20,080 --> 04:28:22,469
to be intelligent it has to be empathic
having emotional intelligence having

04:28:22,469 --> 04:28:22,479
having emotional intelligence having
 

15341
04:28:22,479 --> 04:28:24,469
having emotional intelligence having
ability to remember things

15342
04:28:24,469 --> 04:28:24,479
ability to remember things
 

15343
04:28:24,479 --> 04:28:26,550
ability to remember things
having ability to listen

15344
04:28:26,550 --> 04:28:26,560
having ability to listen
 

15345
04:28:26,560 --> 04:28:28,389
having ability to listen
most of us don't listen to each other

15346
04:28:28,389 --> 04:28:28,399
most of us don't listen to each other
 

15347
04:28:28,399 --> 04:28:30,229
most of us don't listen to each other
one of the things that love

15348
04:28:30,229 --> 04:28:30,239
one of the things that love
 

15349
04:28:30,239 --> 04:28:31,750
one of the things that love
and when you care about somebody when

15350
04:28:31,750 --> 04:28:31,760
and when you care about somebody when
 

15351
04:28:31,760 --> 04:28:34,309
and when you care about somebody when
you love somebody is when you listen and

15352
04:28:34,309 --> 04:28:34,319
you love somebody is when you listen and
 

15353
04:28:34,319 --> 04:28:35,110
you love somebody is when you listen and
that

15354
04:28:35,110 --> 04:28:35,120
that
 

15355
04:28:35,120 --> 04:28:36,710
that
is something we treasure about each

15356
04:28:36,710 --> 04:28:36,720
is something we treasure about each
 

15357
04:28:36,720 --> 04:28:38,469
is something we treasure about each
other and and

15358
04:28:38,469 --> 04:28:38,479
other and and
 

15359
04:28:38,479 --> 04:28:40,870
other and and
if an ai can do that kind of thing

15360
04:28:40,870 --> 04:28:40,880
if an ai can do that kind of thing
 

15361
04:28:40,880 --> 04:28:42,309
if an ai can do that kind of thing
um i think that

15362
04:28:42,309 --> 04:28:42,319
um i think that
 

15363
04:28:42,319 --> 04:28:44,870
um i think that
provides a huge amount of value and very

15364
04:28:44,870 --> 04:28:44,880
provides a huge amount of value and very
 

15365
04:28:44,880 --> 04:28:46,950
provides a huge amount of value and very
importantly

15366
04:28:46,950 --> 04:28:46,960
importantly
 

15367
04:28:46,960 --> 04:28:50,070
importantly
provides value in its ability to listen

15368
04:28:50,070 --> 04:28:50,080
provides value in its ability to listen
 

15369
04:28:50,080 --> 04:28:52,870
provides value in its ability to listen
and understand versus provide really

15370
04:28:52,870 --> 04:28:52,880
and understand versus provide really
 

15371
04:28:52,880 --> 04:28:54,950
and understand versus provide really
good advice i think providing really

15372
04:28:54,950 --> 04:28:54,960
good advice i think providing really
 

15373
04:28:54,960 --> 04:28:56,229
good advice i think providing really
good advice

15374
04:28:56,229 --> 04:28:56,239
good advice
 

15375
04:28:56,239 --> 04:28:59,030
good advice
is very difficult is another next level

15376
04:28:59,030 --> 04:28:59,040
is very difficult is another next level
 

15377
04:28:59,040 --> 04:29:02,149
is very difficult is another next level
step that would um

15378
04:29:02,149 --> 04:29:02,159
step that would um
 

15379
04:29:02,159 --> 04:29:04,070
step that would um
i think it's just easier to uh to do

15380
04:29:04,070 --> 04:29:04,080
i think it's just easier to uh to do
 

15381
04:29:04,080 --> 04:29:06,229
i think it's just easier to uh to do
companionship yeah i wouldn't disagree i

15382
04:29:06,229 --> 04:29:06,239
companionship yeah i wouldn't disagree i
 

15383
04:29:06,239 --> 04:29:07,910
companionship yeah i wouldn't disagree i
mean i think that there's very few

15384
04:29:07,910 --> 04:29:07,920
mean i think that there's very few
 

15385
04:29:07,920 --> 04:29:10,229
mean i think that there's very few
things that i would argue can't be

15386
04:29:10,229 --> 04:29:10,239
things that i would argue can't be
 

15387
04:29:10,239 --> 04:29:12,149
things that i would argue can't be
reduced to a uh

15388
04:29:12,149 --> 04:29:12,159
reduced to a uh
 

15389
04:29:12,159 --> 04:29:14,469
reduced to a uh
some kind of a narrow ai i think we can

15390
04:29:14,469 --> 04:29:14,479
some kind of a narrow ai i think we can
 

15391
04:29:14,479 --> 04:29:16,870
some kind of a narrow ai i think we can
do trillion dollars of value easily and

15392
04:29:16,870 --> 04:29:16,880
do trillion dollars of value easily and
 

15393
04:29:16,880 --> 04:29:18,790
do trillion dollars of value easily and
all the things that can be done there

15394
04:29:18,790 --> 04:29:18,800
all the things that can be done there
 

15395
04:29:18,800 --> 04:29:20,550
all the things that can be done there
and a lot of it can be done with smoke

15396
04:29:20,550 --> 04:29:20,560
and a lot of it can be done with smoke
 

15397
04:29:20,560 --> 04:29:21,990
and a lot of it can be done with smoke
and mirrors without having to go the

15398
04:29:21,990 --> 04:29:22,000
and mirrors without having to go the
 

15399
04:29:22,000 --> 04:29:23,830
and mirrors without having to go the
whole thing i mean there's going to be

15400
04:29:23,830 --> 04:29:23,840
whole thing i mean there's going to be
 

15401
04:29:23,840 --> 04:29:26,309
whole thing i mean there's going to be
the equivalent of the doom uh

15402
04:29:26,309 --> 04:29:26,319
the equivalent of the doom uh
 

15403
04:29:26,319 --> 04:29:28,870
the equivalent of the doom uh
the doom version for the agi that's not

15404
04:29:28,870 --> 04:29:28,880
the doom version for the agi that's not
 

15405
04:29:28,880 --> 04:29:30,790
the doom version for the agi that's not
really agi it's all smoke and mirrors

15406
04:29:30,790 --> 04:29:30,800
really agi it's all smoke and mirrors
 

15407
04:29:30,800 --> 04:29:32,630
really agi it's all smoke and mirrors
but it happens to do enough valuable

15408
04:29:32,630 --> 04:29:32,640
but it happens to do enough valuable
 

15409
04:29:32,640 --> 04:29:34,870
but it happens to do enough valuable

04:29:34,880 --> 04:29:36,469
things that it's enormously uh useful
and valuable to people

15412
04:29:36,469 --> 04:29:36,479
and valuable to people
 

15413
04:29:36,479 --> 04:29:38,309
and valuable to people
but at some point you do want to get to

15414
04:29:38,309 --> 04:29:38,319
but at some point you do want to get to
 

15415
04:29:38,319 --> 04:29:39,590
but at some point you do want to get to
the point where you have the fully

start using the higher level language
 

15425
04:29:47,199 --> 04:29:48,309
start using the higher level language
instead of writing everything in

15426
04:29:48,309 --> 04:29:48,319
instead of writing everything in
 

15427
04:29:48,319 --> 04:29:50,229
instead of writing everything in
assembly language

15429
04:29:50,239 --> 04:29:52,950

what about consciousness

15430
04:29:52,950 --> 04:29:52,960
what about consciousness
 

15431
04:29:52,960 --> 04:29:55,349
what about consciousness
the c word do what do you think that's

15432
04:29:55,349 --> 04:29:55,359
the c word do what do you think that's
 

15433
04:29:55,359 --> 04:29:56,950
the c word do what do you think that's
fundamental

15434
04:29:56,950 --> 04:29:56,960
fundamental
 

15435
04:29:56,960 --> 04:30:01,110

04:30:01,110 --> 04:30:01,120

cognition
 

15439
04:30:02,479 --> 04:30:05,349
cognition
so i think most of the arguments about

15440
04:30:05,349 --> 04:30:05,359
so i think most of the arguments about
 

15441
04:30:05,359 --> 04:30:07,590
so i think most of the arguments about
consciousness don't have a whole lot of

15442
04:30:07,590 --> 04:30:07,600
consciousness don't have a whole lot of
 

15443
04:30:07,600 --> 04:30:08,710
consciousness don't have a whole lot of
merit

15444
04:30:08,710 --> 04:30:08,720

15445
04:30:08,720 --> 04:30:11,590
merit
i think that consciousness is kind of

15446
04:30:11,590 --> 04:30:11,600
i think that consciousness is kind of
 

15447
04:30:11,600 --> 04:30:13,030
i think that consciousness is kind of
the way the brain feels when it's

15448
04:30:13,030 --> 04:30:13,040
the way the brain feels when it's
 

15449
04:30:13,040 --> 04:30:14,469
the way the brain feels when it's
operating

15450
04:30:14,469 --> 04:30:14,479

15451
04:30:14,479 --> 04:30:17,670

yes and this idea that

15452
04:30:17,670 --> 04:30:17,680
yes and this idea that
 

15453
04:30:17,680 --> 04:30:19,269
yes and this idea that
you know i do generally subscribe to

15454
04:30:19,269 --> 04:30:19,279
you know i do generally subscribe to
 

15455
04:30:19,279 --> 04:30:20,870
you know i do generally subscribe to
sort of the pandemonium theories of

15456
04:30:20,870 --> 04:30:20,880
sort of the pandemonium theories of
 

15457
04:30:20,880 --> 04:30:22,229
sort of the pandemonium theories of
consciousness where there's all these

15458
04:30:22,229 --> 04:30:22,239
consciousness where there's all these
 

15459
04:30:22,239 --> 04:30:24,229
consciousness where there's all these
things bubbling around and i think of

15460
04:30:24,229 --> 04:30:24,239
things bubbling around and i think of
 

15461
04:30:24,239 --> 04:30:26,790
things bubbling around and i think of
them as kind of slightly randomized

15462
04:30:26,790 --> 04:30:26,800
them as kind of slightly randomized
 

15463
04:30:26,800 --> 04:30:28,790
them as kind of slightly randomized
sparse distributed memory bit strings of

04:30:28,790 --> 04:30:28,800
sparse distributed memory bit strings of
 

15465
04:30:28,800 --> 04:30:30,710
sparse distributed memory bit strings of
things that are kind of happening

15466
04:30:30,710 --> 04:30:30,720
things that are kind of happening
 

15467
04:30:30,720 --> 04:30:32,710
things that are kind of happening
recalling different associative memories

15468
04:30:32,710 --> 04:30:32,720
recalling different associative memories
 

15469
04:30:32,720 --> 04:30:34,710
recalling different associative memories
and eventually you get some level of

15470
04:30:34,710 --> 04:30:34,720
and eventually you get some level of
 

15471
04:30:34,720 --> 04:30:36,389
and eventually you get some level of
consensus and it bubbles up to the point

15472
04:30:36,389 --> 04:30:36,399
consensus and it bubbles up to the point
 

15473
04:30:36,399 --> 04:30:38,710
consensus and it bubbles up to the point
of being a conscious thought there and

15474
04:30:38,710 --> 04:30:38,720
of being a conscious thought there and
 

15475
04:30:38,720 --> 04:30:40,550
of being a conscious thought there and
the little bits of stochasticity that

15476
04:30:40,550 --> 04:30:40,560
the little bits of stochasticity that
 

15477
04:30:40,560 --> 04:30:42,950
the little bits of stochasticity that
are sitting on in i in this as it cycles

15478
04:30:42,950 --> 04:30:42,960
are sitting on in i in this as it cycles
 

15479
04:30:42,960 --> 04:30:44,309
are sitting on in i in this as it cycles

15480
04:30:44,309 --> 04:30:44,319
between different things and recalls
 

15481
04:30:44,319 --> 04:30:46,229
between different things and recalls
different memory that's largely our

15482
04:30:46,229 --> 04:30:46,239
different memory that's largely our

15485
04:30:48,479 --> 04:30:49,349
imagination and creativity
um

15486
04:30:49,349 --> 04:30:49,359
um
 

15487
04:30:49,359 --> 04:30:51,349
um
so i don't think there's anything deeply

15488
04:30:51,349 --> 04:30:51,359
so i don't think there's anything deeply
 

15489
04:30:51,359 --> 04:30:53,990
so i don't think there's anything deeply
magical about it certainly not symbolic

15490
04:30:53,990 --> 04:30:54,000
magical about it certainly not symbolic
 

15491
04:30:54,000 --> 04:30:55,750
magical about it certainly not symbolic
i think it is generally the flow of

15492
04:30:55,750 --> 04:30:55,760
i think it is generally the flow of
 

15493
04:30:55,760 --> 04:30:57,189
i think it is generally the flow of
these uh

15494
04:30:57,189 --> 04:30:57,199
these uh
 

15495
04:30:57,199 --> 04:30:59,590
these uh

04:30:59,590 --> 04:30:59,600

15499
04:31:02,800 --> 04:31:04,710
stochastic noise overlaid on top of them
i think so much of that is like it

15500
04:31:04,710 --> 04:31:04,720
i think so much of that is like it
 

15501
04:31:04,720 --> 04:31:06,389
i think so much of that is like it
depends on what you happen to have in

15502
04:31:06,389 --> 04:31:06,399

15503
04:31:06,399 --> 04:31:08,229
depends on what you happen to have in
your field of view as some other thought

15504
04:31:08,229 --> 04:31:08,239
your field of view as some other thought
 

15505
04:31:08,239 --> 04:31:10,550
your field of view as some other thought
was occurring to you that overlay and

15506
04:31:10,550 --> 04:31:10,560
was occurring to you that overlay and

blend into the next key that queries
 

15509
04:31:12,399 --> 04:31:14,389
blend into the next key that queries
your memory for things and that kind of

15510
04:31:14,389 --> 04:31:14,399
your memory for things and that kind of
 

15511
04:31:14,399 --> 04:31:16,309
your memory for things and that kind of
determines how you know how your chain

15512
04:31:16,309 --> 04:31:16,319
determines how you know how your chain
 

15513
04:31:16,319 --> 04:31:19,030
determines how you know how your chain
of consciousness goes so that's kind of

15514
04:31:19,030 --> 04:31:19,040
of consciousness goes so that's kind of
 

15515
04:31:19,040 --> 04:31:21,830

15520
04:31:24,950 --> 04:31:24,960
is not essential for intelligence i
 

15521
04:31:24,960 --> 04:31:26,469
is not essential for intelligence i
think so i don't think there's anything

15522
04:31:26,469 --> 04:31:26,479
think so i don't think there's anything
 

15523
04:31:26,479 --> 04:31:28,229
think so i don't think there's anything
really important there

15524
04:31:28,229 --> 04:31:28,239
really important there
 

15525
04:31:28,239 --> 04:31:29,910
really important there
what about some other human qualities

15526
04:31:29,910 --> 04:31:29,920
what about some other human qualities
 

15527
04:31:29,920 --> 04:31:31,830
what about some other human qualities
like fear of mortality and stuff like

15528
04:31:31,830 --> 04:31:31,840
like fear of mortality and stuff like
 

15529
04:31:31,840 --> 04:31:34,149
like fear of mortality and stuff like
that like um the fact that this ride

15530
04:31:34,149 --> 04:31:34,159
that like um the fact that this ride
 

15531
04:31:34,159 --> 04:31:35,510
that like um the fact that this ride
ends

15532
04:31:35,510 --> 04:31:35,520

me you know we talk so much about this

15536
04:31:40,070 --> 04:31:40,080
me you know we talk so much about this
 

15537
04:31:40,080 --> 04:31:41,590
me you know we talk so much about this

deadlines and constraints
 

15541
04:31:43,600 --> 04:31:45,189
deadlines and constraints
um do you think that's important for

15542
04:31:45,189 --> 04:31:45,199
um do you think that's important for
 

15543
04:31:45,199 --> 04:31:46,630
um do you think that's important for
intelligence actually a super

thing that uh that a sense of mortality
 

15569
04:32:10,640 --> 04:32:13,110
thing that uh that a sense of mortality
and death impending death is necessary

15570
04:32:13,110 --> 04:32:13,120
and death impending death is necessary
 

15571
04:32:13,120 --> 04:32:14,950
and death impending death is necessary
there because those are things that they

15572
04:32:14,950 --> 04:32:14,960
there because those are things that they
 

15573
04:32:14,960 --> 04:32:17,030
there because those are things that they
do wind up providing reward signals to

15574
04:32:17,030 --> 04:32:17,040
do wind up providing reward signals to
 

15575
04:32:17,040 --> 04:32:18,710
do wind up providing reward signals to
us and we will be in control of the

15576
04:32:18,710 --> 04:32:18,720
us and we will be in control of the
 

15577
04:32:18,720 --> 04:32:20,710
us and we will be in control of the
reward signals and there there will have

15578
04:32:20,710 --> 04:32:20,720
reward signals and there there will have
 

15579
04:32:20,720 --> 04:32:22,790
reward signals and there there will have
to be something fundamental that causes

15580
04:32:22,790 --> 04:32:22,800
to be something fundamental that causes
 

15581
04:32:22,800 --> 04:32:24,870
to be something fundamental that causes
that engenders curiosity and goal

15582
04:32:24,870 --> 04:32:24,880
that engenders curiosity and goal
 

15583
04:32:24,880 --> 04:32:27,670
that engenders curiosity and goal
setting and all of that i am something

is going to play in there at the reward

15586
04:32:30,550 --> 04:32:30,560
is going to play in there at the reward
 

15587
04:32:30,560 --> 04:32:31,510
is going to play in there at the reward
level

15588
04:32:31,510 --> 04:32:31,520
level
 

15589
04:32:31,520 --> 04:32:33,189
level
i am you know whether it's positive or

15590
04:32:33,189 --> 04:32:33,199
i am you know whether it's positive or
 

15591
04:32:33,199 --> 04:32:34,630
i am you know whether it's positive or
negative or both

i don't have any strong opinions on

15594
04:32:37,510 --> 04:32:37,520
i don't have any strong opinions on
 

15595
04:32:37,520 --> 04:32:40,149
i don't have any strong opinions on
exactly what it's going to be i but

15596
04:32:40,149 --> 04:32:40,159
exactly what it's going to be i but
 

15597
04:32:40,159 --> 04:32:43,189
exactly what it's going to be i but
that's that type of thing where i doubt

15598
04:32:43,189 --> 04:32:43,199
that's that type of thing where i doubt
 

15599
04:32:43,199 --> 04:32:44,710
that's that type of thing where i doubt
that might be one of those half dozen

15600
04:32:44,710 --> 04:32:44,720
that might be one of those half dozen
 

15601
04:32:44,720 --> 04:32:46,469
that might be one of those half dozen
key things that has to be sorted out on

15602
04:32:46,469 --> 04:32:46,479
key things that has to be sorted out on
 

15603
04:32:46,479 --> 04:32:49,110
key things that has to be sorted out on
exactly what the master reward that's

15604
04:32:49,110 --> 04:32:49,120
exactly what the master reward that's
 

15605
04:32:49,120 --> 04:32:51,670
exactly what the master reward that's
the meta reward over all of the uh the

15606
04:32:51,670 --> 04:32:51,680
the meta reward over all of the uh the
 

15607
04:32:51,680 --> 04:32:54,229
the meta reward over all of the uh the
local task specific rewards have to be

15608
04:32:54,229 --> 04:32:54,239
local task specific rewards have to be
 

15609
04:32:54,239 --> 04:32:56,070
local task specific rewards have to be
that could be that big negative reward

15610
04:32:56,070 --> 04:32:56,080
that could be that big negative reward
 

15611
04:32:56,080 --> 04:32:57,189
that could be that big negative reward
of death

15612
04:32:57,189 --> 04:32:57,199
of death
 

15613
04:32:57,199 --> 04:32:59,670
of death
maybe not death but ability to walk away

15614
04:32:59,670 --> 04:32:59,680
maybe not death but ability to walk away
 

15615
04:32:59,680 --> 04:33:02,790
maybe not death but ability to walk away
from an interaction so it bothers me

15616
04:33:02,790 --> 04:33:02,800
from an interaction so it bothers me
 

15617
04:33:02,800 --> 04:33:05,109
from an interaction so it bothers me
when people treat ai systems like

15618
04:33:05,109 --> 04:33:05,119
when people treat ai systems like
 

15619
04:33:05,119 --> 04:33:06,629
when people treat ai systems like
servants

15620
04:33:06,629 --> 04:33:06,639
servants
 

15621
04:33:06,639 --> 04:33:09,189
servants
so it doesn't bother me but i mean it

15622
04:33:09,189 --> 04:33:09,199
so it doesn't bother me but i mean it
 

15623
04:33:09,199 --> 04:33:13,029
so it doesn't bother me but i mean it
it's it really is drawing the line

15624
04:33:13,029 --> 04:33:13,039
it's it really is drawing the line
 

15625
04:33:13,039 --> 04:33:15,109
it's it really is drawing the line
between what an ais system could be it's

15626
04:33:15,109 --> 04:33:15,119
between what an ais system could be it's
 

15627
04:33:15,119 --> 04:33:16,949
between what an ais system could be it's
limiting the possibility of an asset

15628
04:33:16,949 --> 04:33:16,959
limiting the possibility of an asset
 

15629
04:33:16,959 --> 04:33:18,789
limiting the possibility of an asset
could be is treating them as justice

15630
04:33:18,789 --> 04:33:18,799
could be is treating them as justice
 

15631
04:33:18,799 --> 04:33:19,750
could be is treating them as justice
tools

15632
04:33:19,750 --> 04:33:19,760
tools
 

15633
04:33:19,760 --> 04:33:21,830
tools
now that's of course for from a narrow

15634
04:33:21,830 --> 04:33:21,840
now that's of course for from a narrow
 

15635
04:33:21,840 --> 04:33:23,349
now that's of course for from a narrow
ai perspective

15636
04:33:23,349 --> 04:33:23,359
ai perspective
 

15637
04:33:23,359 --> 04:33:24,869
ai perspective
there's so many

15638
04:33:24,869 --> 04:33:24,879
there's so many
 

15639
04:33:24,879 --> 04:33:27,670
there's so many
uh problems that narrow ai could solve

15640
04:33:27,670 --> 04:33:27,680
uh problems that narrow ai could solve
 

15641
04:33:27,680 --> 04:33:29,510
uh problems that narrow ai could solve
just like you said

15642
04:33:29,510 --> 04:33:29,520
just like you said
 

15643
04:33:29,520 --> 04:33:30,629
just like you said
as

15644
04:33:30,629 --> 04:33:30,639
as
 

15645
04:33:30,639 --> 04:33:33,349
as
in in its form of a tool

15646
04:33:33,349 --> 04:33:33,359
in in its form of a tool
 

15647
04:33:33,359 --> 04:33:36,949
in in its form of a tool
but it could also be a being

15648
04:33:36,949 --> 04:33:36,959
but it could also be a being
 

15649
04:33:36,959 --> 04:33:39,029
but it could also be a being
which is much more than a tool and to be

15650
04:33:39,029 --> 04:33:39,039
which is much more than a tool and to be
 

15651
04:33:39,039 --> 04:33:41,910
which is much more than a tool and to be
a to become a being you have to respect

15652
04:33:41,910 --> 04:33:41,920
a to become a being you have to respect
 

15653
04:33:41,920 --> 04:33:44,709
a to become a being you have to respect
that thing for being a being and for

15654
04:33:44,709 --> 04:33:44,719
that thing for being a being and for
 

15655
04:33:44,719 --> 04:33:48,150
that thing for being a being and for
that it has to be able to have um

15656
04:33:48,150 --> 04:33:48,160
that it has to be able to have um
 

15657
04:33:48,160 --> 04:33:50,310
that it has to be able to have um
to make its own decisions to walk away

15658
04:33:50,310 --> 04:33:50,320
to make its own decisions to walk away
 

15659
04:33:50,320 --> 04:33:52,310
to make its own decisions to walk away
to say i had enough of you i would like

15660
04:33:52,310 --> 04:33:52,320
to say i had enough of you i would like
 

15661
04:33:52,320 --> 04:33:54,070
to say i had enough of you i would like
to break up with you now

15662
04:33:54,070 --> 04:33:54,080
to break up with you now
 

15663
04:33:54,080 --> 04:33:56,390
to break up with you now
uh you've not treated me well and i

15664
04:33:56,390 --> 04:33:56,400
uh you've not treated me well and i
 

15665
04:33:56,400 --> 04:34:00,310
uh you've not treated me well and i
would like to move on so uh i think that

15666
04:34:00,310 --> 04:34:00,320
would like to move on so uh i think that
 

15667
04:34:00,320 --> 04:34:03,029
would like to move on so uh i think that
actually that choice

15668
04:34:03,029 --> 04:34:03,039
actually that choice
 

15669
04:34:03,039 --> 04:34:04,789
actually that choice
to end things

15670
04:34:04,789 --> 04:34:04,799
to end things
 

15671
04:34:04,799 --> 04:34:06,390
to end things
so i i

15672
04:34:06,390 --> 04:34:06,400
so i i
 

15673
04:34:06,400 --> 04:34:08,230
so i i
a couple of things on that so on the one

15674
04:34:08,230 --> 04:34:08,240
a couple of things on that so on the one
 

15675
04:34:08,240 --> 04:34:10,470
a couple of things on that so on the one
hand uh it is kind of disturbing when

15676
04:34:10,470 --> 04:34:10,480
hand uh it is kind of disturbing when
 

15677
04:34:10,480 --> 04:34:12,310
hand uh it is kind of disturbing when
you see people being like people that

15678
04:34:12,310 --> 04:34:12,320
you see people being like people that
 

15679
04:34:12,320 --> 04:34:14,390
you see people being like people that
are mean to robots and you know mean to

15680
04:34:14,390 --> 04:34:14,400
are mean to robots and you know mean to
 

15681
04:34:14,400 --> 04:34:17,269
are mean to robots and you know mean to
alexa whatever and that seems to speak

15682
04:34:17,269 --> 04:34:17,279
alexa whatever and that seems to speak
 

15683
04:34:17,279 --> 04:34:19,750
alexa whatever and that seems to speak
badly about humanity but there's also

15684
04:34:19,750 --> 04:34:19,760
badly about humanity but there's also
 

15685
04:34:19,760 --> 04:34:21,510
badly about humanity but there's also
the exact opposite side of that where

15686
04:34:21,510 --> 04:34:21,520
the exact opposite side of that where
 

15687
04:34:21,520 --> 04:34:23,510
the exact opposite side of that where
you have so many people that imbue

15688
04:34:23,510 --> 04:34:23,520
you have so many people that imbue
 

15689
04:34:23,520 --> 04:34:26,070
you have so many people that imbue
humanity in inanimate objects or things

15690
04:34:26,070 --> 04:34:26,080
humanity in inanimate objects or things
 

15691
04:34:26,080 --> 04:34:28,230
humanity in inanimate objects or things
that are toys or that are are relatively

15692
04:34:28,230 --> 04:34:28,240
that are toys or that are are relatively
 

15693
04:34:28,240 --> 04:34:29,510
that are toys or that are are relatively
limited so

15694
04:34:29,510 --> 04:34:29,520
limited so
 

15695
04:34:29,520 --> 04:34:31,349
limited so
i think there may even be more more

15696
04:34:31,349 --> 04:34:31,359
i think there may even be more more
 

15697
04:34:31,359 --> 04:34:33,029
i think there may even be more more
danger about people putting more

15698
04:34:33,029 --> 04:34:33,039
danger about people putting more
 

15699
04:34:33,039 --> 04:34:35,189
danger about people putting more
emotional investment into a lot of these

15700
04:34:35,189 --> 04:34:35,199
emotional investment into a lot of these
 

15701
04:34:35,199 --> 04:34:38,470
emotional investment into a lot of these
proto ais in different ways yeah um and

15702
04:34:38,470 --> 04:34:38,480
proto ais in different ways yeah um and
 

15703
04:34:38,480 --> 04:34:41,269
proto ais in different ways yeah um and
then the ai would manipulate that

15704
04:34:41,269 --> 04:34:41,279
then the ai would manipulate that
 

15705
04:34:41,279 --> 04:34:43,910
then the ai would manipulate that
but as far as like the ai ethnic sides

15706
04:34:43,910 --> 04:34:43,920
but as far as like the ai ethnic sides
 

15707
04:34:43,920 --> 04:34:44,949
but as far as like the ai ethnic sides
of things

15708
04:34:44,949 --> 04:34:44,959
of things
 

15709
04:34:44,959 --> 04:34:45,830
of things
i

15710
04:34:45,830 --> 04:34:45,840
i
 

15711
04:34:45,840 --> 04:34:48,070
i
really stay away from any of those

15712
04:34:48,070 --> 04:34:48,080
really stay away from any of those
 

15713
04:34:48,080 --> 04:34:49,510
really stay away from any of those
discussions or even really thinking

15714
04:34:49,510 --> 04:34:49,520
discussions or even really thinking
 

15715
04:34:49,520 --> 04:34:52,070
discussions or even really thinking
about it it's similar with the safety

15716
04:34:52,070 --> 04:34:52,080
about it it's similar with the safety
 

15717
04:34:52,080 --> 04:34:54,310
about it it's similar with the safety
things where i think it's just premature

15718
04:34:54,310 --> 04:34:54,320
things where i think it's just premature
 

15719
04:34:54,320 --> 04:34:56,070
things where i think it's just premature
and there's a certain class of people

15720
04:34:56,070 --> 04:34:56,080
and there's a certain class of people
 

15721
04:34:56,080 --> 04:34:58,629
and there's a certain class of people
that enjoy thinking about impractical

15722
04:34:58,629 --> 04:34:58,639
that enjoy thinking about impractical
 

15723
04:34:58,639 --> 04:35:01,349
that enjoy thinking about impractical

there when you start getting down to
taking an actual problem and putting it

has not worked out well in practice and
 

15949
04:38:42,400 --> 04:38:43,750
has not worked out well in practice and
the idea that

04:38:43,750 --> 04:38:43,760
the idea that
 

15951
04:38:43,760 --> 04:38:45,109
the idea that
there was always

15952
04:38:45,109 --> 04:38:45,119
there was always
 

15953
04:38:45,119 --> 04:38:46,629
there was always
like it's always been easy to come up

15954
04:38:46,629 --> 04:38:46,639
like it's always been easy to come up
 

15955
04:38:46,639 --> 04:38:48,789
like it's always been easy to come up
with ways to get com compute faster to

15956
04:38:48,789 --> 04:38:48,799
with ways to get com compute faster to
 

15957
04:38:48,799 --> 04:38:51,510
with ways to get com compute faster to
say more flops or more more gigaops or

15958
04:38:51,510 --> 04:38:51,520
say more flops or more more gigaops or
 

15959
04:38:51,520 --> 04:38:53,590
say more flops or more more gigaops or
whatever there that's usually the easy

15960
04:38:53,590 --> 04:38:53,600
whatever there that's usually the easy
 

15961
04:38:53,600 --> 04:38:56,070
whatever there that's usually the easy
part but you then have interconnect and

15962
04:38:56,070 --> 04:38:56,080
part but you then have interconnect and
 

15963
04:38:56,080 --> 04:38:59,029
part but you then have interconnect and
then memory for what goes into it and

15964
04:38:59,029 --> 04:38:59,039
then memory for what goes into it and
 

15965
04:38:59,039 --> 04:39:00,551
then memory for what goes into it and
when you talk about saying well cell

04:39:00,561 --> 04:39:02,629
when you talk about saying well cell
phones well you're limited to like a 5g

phones well you're limited to like a 5g
 

15969
04:39:02,639 --> 04:39:04,949
phones well you're limited to like a 5g
connection or something on that and if

15970
04:39:04,949 --> 04:39:04,959
connection or something on that and if
 

15971
04:39:04,959 --> 04:39:07,590
connection or something on that and if
you say how if you take your

15972
04:39:07,590 --> 04:39:07,600
you say how if you take your
 

15973
04:39:07,600 --> 04:39:09,189
you say how if you take your
your calculation and you factor it

15974
04:39:09,189 --> 04:39:09,199
your calculation and you factor it
 

15975
04:39:09,199 --> 04:39:10,230
your calculation and you factor it
across

15976
04:39:10,230 --> 04:39:10,240
across
 

15977
04:39:10,240 --> 04:39:12,709
across
a million cell phones instead of

15978
04:39:12,709 --> 04:39:12,719
a million cell phones instead of
 

15979
04:39:12,719 --> 04:39:15,670
a million cell phones instead of
a thousand gpus in a warehouse you might

15980
04:39:15,670 --> 04:39:15,680
a thousand gpus in a warehouse you might
 

15981
04:39:15,680 --> 04:39:17,269
a thousand gpus in a warehouse you might
be able to have some kind of a substrate

15982
04:39:17,269 --> 04:39:17,279
be able to have some kind of a substrate
 

15983
04:39:17,279 --> 04:39:19,670
be able to have some kind of a substrate
like that but it could be operating then

15984
04:39:19,670 --> 04:39:19,680
like that but it could be operating then
 

15985
04:39:19,680 --> 04:39:23,029
like that but it could be operating then
at 1 1000 the speed and so yes you could

15986
04:39:23,029 --> 04:39:23,039
at 1 1000 the speed and so yes you could
 

15987
04:39:23,039 --> 04:39:24,789
at 1 1000 the speed and so yes you could
get you could have an agi working there

15988
04:39:24,789 --> 04:39:24,799
get you could have an agi working there
 

15989
04:39:24,799 --> 04:39:26,629
get you could have an agi working there
but it wouldn't be a real-time agi it

15990
04:39:26,629 --> 04:39:26,639
but it wouldn't be a real-time agi it
 

15991
04:39:26,639 --> 04:39:29,109
but it wouldn't be a real-time agi it
would be something that is operating at

15992
04:39:29,109 --> 04:39:29,119
would be something that is operating at
 

15993
04:39:29,119 --> 04:39:31,429
would be something that is operating at
really a snail's pace you know much much

15994
04:39:31,429 --> 04:39:31,439
really a snail's pace you know much much
 

15995
04:39:31,439 --> 04:39:33,590
really a snail's pace you know much much
slower than kind of human level thought

15996
04:39:33,590 --> 04:39:33,600
slower than kind of human level thought
 

15997
04:39:33,600 --> 04:39:35,510
slower than kind of human level thought
for things yeah i'm not worried about

15998
04:39:35,510 --> 04:39:35,520
for things yeah i'm not worried about
 

15999
04:39:35,520 --> 04:39:37,510
for things yeah i'm not worried about
that problem you're transferring the

16000
04:39:37,510 --> 04:39:37,520
that problem you're transferring the
 

16001
04:39:37,520 --> 04:39:39,190
that problem you're transferring the
problem into the interconnect the

16002
04:39:39,190 --> 04:39:39,200
problem into the interconnect the
 

16003
04:39:39,200 --> 04:39:41,750
problem into the interconnect the
communication the shared memory

16004
04:39:41,750 --> 04:39:41,760
communication the shared memory
 

16005
04:39:41,760 --> 04:39:43,830
communication the shared memory
the the collective intelligence aspect

16006
04:39:43,830 --> 04:39:43,840
the the collective intelligence aspect
 

16007
04:39:43,840 --> 04:39:45,670
the the collective intelligence aspect
of it which is extremely difficult as

16008
04:39:45,670 --> 04:39:45,680
of it which is extremely difficult as
 

16009
04:39:45,680 --> 04:39:47,270
of it which is extremely difficult as
well yeah i mean it's back to the very

16010
04:39:47,270 --> 04:39:47,280
well yeah i mean it's back to the very
 

16011
04:39:47,280 --> 04:39:49,110
well yeah i mean it's back to the very
earliest days of super computers you

16012
04:39:49,110 --> 04:39:49,120
earliest days of super computers you
 

16013
04:39:49,120 --> 04:39:51,510
earliest days of super computers you
still have the the balance between

16014
04:39:51,510 --> 04:39:51,520
still have the the balance between
 

16015
04:39:51,520 --> 04:39:54,470
still have the the balance between
bandwidth storage and computation and

16016
04:39:54,470 --> 04:39:54,480
bandwidth storage and computation and
 

16017
04:39:54,480 --> 04:39:56,230
bandwidth storage and computation and
sometimes they're easier to get one or

16018
04:39:56,230 --> 04:39:56,240
sometimes they're easier to get one or
 

16019
04:39:56,240 --> 04:39:58,390
sometimes they're easier to get one or
the other but it's been remarkably

16020
04:39:58,390 --> 04:39:58,400
the other but it's been remarkably
 

16021
04:39:58,400 --> 04:40:00,788
the other but it's been remarkably
constant across all those years that you

16022
04:40:00,788 --> 04:40:00,798
constant across all those years that you
 

16023
04:40:00,798 --> 04:40:03,830
constant across all those years that you
still need all three

16024
04:40:03,830 --> 04:40:03,840
still need all three
 

16025
04:40:03,840 --> 04:40:05,590
still need all three
what do your efforts

16026
04:40:05,590 --> 04:40:05,600
what do your efforts
 

16027
04:40:05,600 --> 04:40:06,390
what do your efforts
now

16028
04:40:06,390 --> 04:40:06,400
now
 

16029
04:40:06,400 --> 04:40:08,788
now
you mentioned to me that you're really

16030
04:40:08,788 --> 04:40:08,798
you mentioned to me that you're really
 

16031
04:40:08,798 --> 04:40:11,990
you mentioned to me that you're really
committing to ai at this stage what what

16032
04:40:11,990 --> 04:40:12,000
committing to ai at this stage what what
 

16033

finding is that i was
 

16187
04:42:52,480 --> 04:42:54,470
finding is that i was
i'm i was still

16188
04:42:54,470 --> 04:42:54,480
i'm i was still
 

16189
04:42:54,480 --> 04:42:57,030
i'm i was still
not committing where i had a foot firmly

16190
04:42:57,030 --> 04:42:57,040
not committing where i had a foot firmly
 

16191
04:42:57,040 --> 04:42:59,430
not committing where i had a foot firmly
in the vr and meta side of things where

16192
04:42:59,430 --> 04:42:59,440
in the vr and meta side of things where
 

16193
04:42:59,440 --> 04:43:01,830
in the vr and meta side of things where
in theory i've got i've got a very nice

16194
04:43:01,830 --> 04:43:01,840
in theory i've got i've got a very nice
 

16195
04:43:01,840 --> 04:43:03,590
in theory i've got i've got a very nice
position there i only have to work one

16196
04:43:03,590 --> 04:43:03,600
position there i only have to work one
 

16197
04:43:03,600 --> 04:43:06,708
position there i only have to work one
day a week for my my consulting role but

16198
04:43:06,708 --> 04:43:06,718
day a week for my my consulting role but
 

16199
04:43:06,718 --> 04:43:08,868
day a week for my my consulting role but
but i was engaging every day i'd still

16200
04:43:08,868 --> 04:43:08,878
but i was engaging every day i'd still
 

16201
04:43:08,878 --> 04:43:10,550
but i was engaging every day i'd still
be like my computer's there i'd be going

16202
04:43:10,550 --> 04:43:10,560
be like my computer's there i'd be going
 

16203
04:43:10,560 --> 04:43:12,470
be like my computer's there i'd be going
and checking the workplace and notes and

16204
04:43:12,470 --> 04:43:12,480
and checking the workplace and notes and
 

16205
04:43:12,480 --> 04:43:13,590
and checking the workplace and notes and
testing different things and

16206
04:43:13,590 --> 04:43:13,600
testing different things and
 

16207
04:43:13,600 --> 04:43:15,750
testing different things and
communicating with people

16208
04:43:15,750 --> 04:43:15,760
communicating with people
 

16209
04:43:15,760 --> 04:43:16,550
communicating with people
but

16210
04:43:16,550 --> 04:43:16,560
but
 

16211
04:43:16,560 --> 04:43:18,628
but
uh but i did make the the decision

16212
04:43:18,628 --> 04:43:18,638
uh but i did make the the decision
 

16213
04:43:18,638 --> 04:43:21,510
uh but i did make the the decision
recently that no i'm gonna get serious

16214
04:43:21,510 --> 04:43:21,520
recently that no i'm gonna get serious
 

16215
04:43:21,520 --> 04:43:24,390
recently that no i'm gonna get serious
i'm still gonna keep my ties with meta

16216
04:43:24,390 --> 04:43:24,400
i'm still gonna keep my ties with meta
 

16217
04:43:24,400 --> 04:43:27,190
i'm still gonna keep my ties with meta
but i am seriously going for the agi

16218
04:43:27,190 --> 04:43:27,200
but i am seriously going for the agi
 

16219
04:43:27,200 --> 04:43:29,110
but i am seriously going for the agi
side of things and it's actually a

16220
04:43:29,110 --> 04:43:29,120
side of things and it's actually a
 

16221
04:43:29,120 --> 04:43:30,628
side of things and it's actually a
really interesting point because a lot

16222
04:43:30,628 --> 04:43:30,638
really interesting point because a lot
 

16223
04:43:30,638 --> 04:43:31,430
really interesting point because a lot
of

16224
04:43:31,430 --> 04:43:31,440
of
 

16225
04:43:31,440 --> 04:43:33,430
of
the machine learning the ai community is

16226
04:43:33,430 --> 04:43:33,440
the machine learning the ai community is
 

16227
04:43:33,440 --> 04:43:34,628
the machine learning the ai community is
quite large

16228
04:43:34,628 --> 04:43:34,638
quite large
 

16229
04:43:34,638 --> 04:43:36,550
quite large
but really

16230
04:43:36,550 --> 04:43:36,560
but really
 

16231
04:43:36,560 --> 04:43:38,390
but really
basically almost everybody has taken the

16232
04:43:38,390 --> 04:43:38,400
basically almost everybody has taken the
 

16233
04:43:38,400 --> 04:43:39,110
basically almost everybody has taken the
same

16234
04:43:39,110 --> 04:43:39,120
same
 

16235
04:43:39,120 --> 04:43:41,270
same
trajectory through life

16236
04:43:41,270 --> 04:43:41,280
trajectory through life
 

16237
04:43:41,280 --> 04:43:42,948
trajectory through life
uh in that community and it's so

16238
04:43:42,948 --> 04:43:42,958
uh in that community and it's so
 

16239
04:43:42,958 --> 04:43:44,708
uh in that community and it's so
interesting to have somebody like you

16240
04:43:44,708 --> 04:43:44,718
interesting to have somebody like you
 

16241
04:43:44,718 --> 04:43:45,830
interesting to have somebody like you
with a fundamentally different

16242
04:43:45,830 --> 04:43:45,840
with a fundamentally different
 

16243
04:43:45,840 --> 04:43:48,310
with a fundamentally different
trajectory and that's where the big

16244
04:43:48,310 --> 04:43:48,320
trajectory and that's where the big
 

16245
04:43:48,320 --> 04:43:49,910
trajectory and that's where the big
solutions can come because there's a

16246
04:43:49,910 --> 04:43:49,920
solutions can come because there's a
 

16247
04:43:49,920 --> 04:43:51,430
solutions can come because there's a
kind of silo

16248
04:43:51,430 --> 04:43:51,440
kind of silo
 

16249
04:43:51,440 --> 04:43:52,150
kind of silo
and

16250
04:43:52,150 --> 04:43:52,160
and
 

16251
04:43:52,160 --> 04:43:53,830
and
it's it is a bunch of people kind of

16252
04:43:53,830 --> 04:43:53,840
it's it is a bunch of people kind of
 

16253
04:43:53,840 --> 04:43:55,990
it's it is a bunch of people kind of
following the same kind of set of ideas

16254
04:43:55,990 --> 04:43:56,000
following the same kind of set of ideas
 

16255
04:43:56,000 --> 04:43:58,390
following the same kind of set of ideas
and i was really worried that i didn't

16256
04:43:58,390 --> 04:43:58,400
and i was really worried that i didn't
 

16257
04:43:58,400 --> 04:44:00,788
and i was really worried that i didn't
want to come off as you know like an

16258
04:44:00,788 --> 04:44:00,798
want to come off as you know like an
 

16259
04:44:00,798 --> 04:44:02,868
want to come off as you know like an
arrogant outsider for things where i

16260
04:44:02,868 --> 04:44:02,878
arrogant outsider for things where i
 

16261
04:44:02,878 --> 04:44:04,470
arrogant outsider for things where i
have all the respect in the world for

16262
04:44:04,470 --> 04:44:04,480
have all the respect in the world for
 

16263
04:44:04,480 --> 04:44:05,830
have all the respect in the world for
the work that's you know it's been a

16264
04:44:05,830 --> 04:44:05,840
the work that's you know it's been a
 

16265
04:44:05,840 --> 04:44:07,590
the work that's you know it's been a
miracle decade it's we're in the midst

16266
04:44:07,590 --> 04:44:07,600
miracle decade it's we're in the midst
 

16267
04:44:07,600 --> 04:44:09,750
miracle decade it's we're in the midst
of a scientific revolution happening now

16268
04:44:09,750 --> 04:44:09,760
of a scientific revolution happening now
 

16269
04:44:09,760 --> 04:44:12,390
of a scientific revolution happening now
and everybody doing this is i you know

16270
04:44:12,390 --> 04:44:12,400
and everybody doing this is i you know
 

16271
04:44:12,400 --> 04:44:14,390
and everybody doing this is i you know
these are the the einsteins and boars

16272
04:44:14,390 --> 04:44:14,400
these are the the einsteins and boars
 

16273
04:44:14,400 --> 04:44:17,110
these are the the einsteins and boars
and whatever's of our our modern era

16274
04:44:17,110 --> 04:44:17,120
and whatever's of our our modern era
 

16275
04:44:17,120 --> 04:44:19,030
and whatever's of our our modern era
i am and i was really happy to see that

16276
04:44:19,030 --> 04:44:19,040
i am and i was really happy to see that
 

16277
04:44:19,040 --> 04:44:20,788
i am and i was really happy to see that
the the people that i've sat down and

16278
04:44:20,788 --> 04:44:20,798
the the people that i've sat down and
 

16279
04:44:20,798 --> 04:44:22,550
the the people that i've sat down and
talked with everybody does seem to

16280
04:44:22,550 --> 04:44:22,560
talked with everybody does seem to
 

16281
04:44:22,560 --> 04:44:24,948
talked with everybody does seem to
really be quite great about just happy

16282
04:44:24,948 --> 04:44:24,958
really be quite great about just happy
 

16283
04:44:24,958 --> 04:44:26,390
really be quite great about just happy
to talk about things willing to

16284
04:44:26,390 --> 04:44:26,400
to talk about things willing to
 

16285
04:44:26,400 --> 04:44:27,910
to talk about things willing to
acknowledge that we don't know what

16286
04:44:27,910 --> 04:44:27,920
acknowledge that we don't know what
 

16287
04:44:27,920 --> 04:44:29,670
acknowledge that we don't know what
we're doing we're figuring it out as we

16288
04:44:29,670 --> 04:44:29,680
we're doing we're figuring it out as we
 

16289
04:44:29,680 --> 04:44:30,788
we're doing we're figuring it out as we
go along

16290
04:44:30,788 --> 04:44:30,798
go along
 

16291
04:44:30,798 --> 04:44:33,830
go along
and i mean i've got a you know a huge

16292
04:44:33,830 --> 04:44:33,840
and i mean i've got a you know a huge
 

16293
04:44:33,840 --> 04:44:35,750
and i mean i've got a you know a huge
debt on this where this all really

16294
04:44:35,750 --> 04:44:35,760
debt on this where this all really
 

16295
04:44:35,760 --> 04:44:37,350
debt on this where this all really
started for me because sam altman

16296
04:44:37,350 --> 04:44:37,360
started for me because sam altman
 

16297
04:44:37,360 --> 04:44:39,830
started for me because sam altman
basically tried to recruit me to open ai

16298
04:44:39,830 --> 04:44:39,840
basically tried to recruit me to open ai
 

16299
04:44:39,840 --> 04:44:42,310
basically tried to recruit me to open ai
and it was at a point when i didn't know

16300
04:44:42,310 --> 04:44:42,320
and it was at a point when i didn't know
 

16301
04:44:42,320 --> 04:44:44,628
and it was at a point when i didn't know
anything about what was really going on

16302
04:44:44,628 --> 04:44:44,638
anything about what was really going on
 

16303
04:44:44,638 --> 04:44:47,190
anything about what was really going on
in machine learning uh and in fact it's

16304
04:44:47,190 --> 04:44:47,200
in machine learning uh and in fact it's
 

16305
04:44:47,200 --> 04:44:48,788
in machine learning uh and in fact it's
funny how the first time you reached out

16306
04:44:48,788 --> 04:44:48,798
funny how the first time you reached out
 

16307
04:44:48,798 --> 04:44:50,628
funny how the first time you reached out
to me it's like four years ago for your

16308
04:44:50,628 --> 04:44:50,638
to me it's like four years ago for your
 

16309
04:44:50,638 --> 04:44:53,670
to me it's like four years ago for your
ai podcast for people

16310
04:44:53,670 --> 04:44:53,680
ai podcast for people
 

16311
04:44:53,680 --> 04:44:56,708
ai podcast for people
yeah for people who uh

16312
04:44:56,708 --> 04:44:56,718
yeah for people who uh
 

16313
04:44:56,718 --> 04:44:59,590
yeah for people who uh
uh listening to this should know that

16314
04:44:59,590 --> 04:44:59,600
uh listening to this should know that
 

16315
04:44:59,600 --> 04:45:01,670
uh listening to this should know that
first of all obviously i'm i've been a

16316
04:45:01,670 --> 04:45:01,680
first of all obviously i'm i've been a
 

16317
04:45:01,680 --> 04:45:03,270
first of all obviously i'm i've been a
huge fan of yours for the longest time

16318
04:45:03,270 --> 04:45:03,280
huge fan of yours for the longest time
 

16319
04:45:03,280 --> 04:45:05,350
huge fan of yours for the longest time
but we've agreed to talk like yeah like

16320
04:45:05,350 --> 04:45:05,360
but we've agreed to talk like yeah like
 

16321
04:45:05,360 --> 04:45:07,350
but we've agreed to talk like yeah like
four years ago back when this was called

16322
04:45:07,350 --> 04:45:07,360
four years ago back when this was called
 

16323
04:45:07,360 --> 04:45:09,750
four years ago back when this was called
the artificial intelligence podcast we

16324
04:45:09,750 --> 04:45:09,760
the artificial intelligence podcast we
 

16325
04:45:09,760 --> 04:45:11,030
the artificial intelligence podcast we
wanted to

16326
04:45:11,030 --> 04:45:11,040
wanted to
 

16327
04:45:11,040 --> 04:45:12,948
wanted to
do a thing and we said you said yes and

16328
04:45:12,948 --> 04:45:12,958
do a thing and we said you said yes and
 

16329
04:45:12,958 --> 04:45:13,990
do a thing and we said you said yes and
then i said it's like i don't know

16330
04:45:13,990 --> 04:45:14,000
then i said it's like i don't know
 

16331
04:45:14,000 --> 04:45:16,070
then i said it's like i don't know
anything about modern ai that's right i

16332
04:45:16,070 --> 04:45:16,080
anything about modern ai that's right i
 

16333
04:45:16,080 --> 04:45:17,590
anything about modern ai that's right i
said i could kind of take an angle on

16334
04:45:17,590 --> 04:45:17,600
said i could kind of take an angle on
 

16335
04:45:17,600 --> 04:45:19,110
said i could kind of take an angle on
machine perception because i you know

16336
04:45:19,110 --> 04:45:19,120
machine perception because i you know
 

16337
04:45:19,120 --> 04:45:20,708
machine perception because i you know
i'm doing a lot of that with the sensors

16338
04:45:20,708 --> 04:45:20,718
i'm doing a lot of that with the sensors
 

16339
04:45:20,718 --> 04:45:22,628
i'm doing a lot of that with the sensors
and the virtual reality but

16340
04:45:22,628 --> 04:45:22,638
and the virtual reality but
 

16341
04:45:22,638 --> 04:45:24,070
and the virtual reality but
we could probably find something to talk

16342
04:45:24,070 --> 04:45:24,080
we could probably find something to talk
 

16343
04:45:24,080 --> 04:45:26,070
we could probably find something to talk
about and then so i mean and that's

16344
04:45:26,070 --> 04:45:26,080
about and then so i mean and that's
 

16345
04:45:26,080 --> 04:45:28,390
about and then so i mean and that's
where when did sam talk to you about

16346
04:45:28,390 --> 04:45:28,400
where when did sam talk to you about
 

16347
04:45:28,400 --> 04:45:30,788
where when did sam talk to you about
open ai around the same time no i was a

16348
04:45:30,788 --> 04:45:30,798
open ai around the same time no i was a
 

16349
04:45:30,798 --> 04:45:32,868

little bit it was a bit after that so

16350
04:45:32,868 --> 04:45:32,878
little bit it was a bit after that so
 

16351
04:45:32,878 --> 04:45:35,190
little bit it was a bit after that so
i had done the the most basic work i had

16352
04:45:35,190 --> 04:45:35,200
i had done the the most basic work i had
 

16353
04:45:35,200 --> 04:45:37,270
i had done the the most basic work i had
kind of done the neural networks from

16354
04:45:37,270 --> 04:45:37,280
kind of done the neural networks from
 

16355
04:45:37,280 --> 04:45:39,190
kind of done the neural networks from
scratch where i had gone and written it

16356
04:45:39,190 --> 04:45:39,200
scratch where i had gone and written it
 

16357
04:45:39,200 --> 04:45:41,190
scratch where i had gone and written it
all in c just to make sure i understood

16358
04:45:41,190 --> 04:45:41,200
all in c just to make sure i understood
 

16359
04:45:41,200 --> 04:45:43,190
all in c just to make sure i understood

16361
04:45:43,200 --> 04:45:45,430

16363
04:45:45,440 --> 04:45:48,868

but but after sam approached me i

16364
04:45:48,868 --> 04:45:48,878
but but after sam approached me i
 

16365
04:45:48,878 --> 04:45:50,708
but but after sam approached me i
you know it was flattering to think that

16366
04:45:50,708 --> 04:45:50,718
you know it was flattering to think that
 

16367
04:45:50,718 --> 04:45:52,708
you know it was flattering to think that

asked uh you know ilya sutscover to give
 

16377
04:46:03,120 --> 04:46:05,590
asked uh you know ilya sutscover to give
me a reading list and he gave me a you

16378
04:46:05,590 --> 04:46:05,600
me a reading list and he gave me a you
 

16379
04:46:05,600 --> 04:46:08,230
me a reading list and he gave me a you
know a binder full of all the papers

16380
04:46:08,230 --> 04:46:08,240
know a binder full of all the papers

that like okay these are the important
 

16383
04:46:09,840 --> 04:46:11,990
that like okay these are the important

16390
04:46:18,070 --> 04:46:18,080
language researchers work on and and i
 

16391
04:46:18,080 --> 04:46:19,510
language researchers work on and and i
went through and i read all those papers

16392
04:46:19,510 --> 04:46:19,520
went through and i read all those papers
 

16393
04:46:19,520 --> 04:46:21,510
went through and i read all those papers
multiple times and highlighted them and

16394
04:46:21,510 --> 04:46:21,520
multiple times and highlighted them and
 

16395
04:46:21,520 --> 04:46:23,030
multiple times and highlighted them and
went through and kind of figured the

16396
04:46:23,030 --> 04:46:23,040
went through and kind of figured the
 

16397
04:46:23,040 --> 04:46:24,948
went through and kind of figured the
things out there and then started

16398
04:46:24,948 --> 04:46:24,958
things out there and then started
 

16399
04:46:24,958 --> 04:46:26,788
things out there and then started
branching out into my own sets of

branching out into my own sets of
 

16401
04:46:26,798 --> 04:46:29,030
branching out into my own sets of
research on things and eventually

research on things and eventually
 

16403
04:46:29,040 --> 04:46:30,948
research on things and eventually
started writing my own experiments and

04:46:30,948 --> 04:46:30,958
started writing my own experiments and
 

16405
04:46:30,958 --> 04:46:31,830
started writing my own experiments and

and
 

16423
04:46:45,280 --> 04:46:47,190
and
i've had a couple years now like two

16424
04:46:47,190 --> 04:46:47,200
i've had a couple years now like two
 

16425
04:46:47,200 --> 04:46:49,030
i've had a couple years now like two
years since i i kind of left the

full-time position at meta and
 

16429
04:46:52,400 --> 04:46:53,990
full-time position at meta and
now i've kind of pulled the trigger and

16430
04:46:53,990 --> 04:46:54,000
now i've kind of pulled the trigger and
 

16431
04:46:54,000 --> 04:46:56,868
now i've kind of pulled the trigger and
said i'm gonna get serious about it but

16432
04:46:56,868 --> 04:46:56,878
said i'm gonna get serious about it but
 

16433
04:46:56,878 --> 04:46:58,150
said i'm gonna get serious about it but
some of my lessons all the way back to

some of my lessons all the way back to
 

16435
04:46:58,160 --> 04:47:00,550
some of my lessons all the way back to
armadillo aerospace about how i know i

need to be more committed to this where

16438
04:47:03,110 --> 04:47:03,120
need to be more committed to this where
 

16439
04:47:03,120 --> 04:47:04,628
need to be more committed to this where
there is that

16440
04:47:04,628 --> 04:47:04,638
there is that
 

16441
04:47:04,638 --> 04:47:06,628
there is that
it's both a freedom and a cost in some

16442
04:47:06,628 --> 04:47:06,638
it's both a freedom and a cost in some
 

16443
04:47:06,638 --> 04:47:07,990
it's both a freedom and a cost in some
ways when you know that you're wealthy

16444
04:47:07,990 --> 04:47:08,000
ways when you know that you're wealthy
 

16445
04:47:08,000 --> 04:47:09,590
ways when you know that you're wealthy
enough to say it's like this doesn't

16446
04:47:09,590 --> 04:47:09,600
enough to say it's like this doesn't
 

16447
04:47:09,600 --> 04:47:12,470
enough to say it's like this doesn't
really mean anything i can i can spend

16448
04:47:12,470 --> 04:47:12,480
really mean anything i can i can spend
 

16449
04:47:12,480 --> 04:47:14,390
really mean anything i can i can spend
you know i can spend a million dollars a

16450
04:47:14,390 --> 04:47:14,400
you know i can spend a million dollars a
 

16451
04:47:14,400 --> 04:47:16,390
you know i can spend a million dollars a
year for the rest of my life and

16452
04:47:16,390 --> 04:47:16,400
year for the rest of my life and
 

16453
04:47:16,400 --> 04:47:18,948
year for the rest of my life and
it doesn't mean anything it's fine

16454
04:47:18,948 --> 04:47:18,958
it doesn't mean anything it's fine
 

16455
04:47:18,958 --> 04:47:21,190
it doesn't mean anything it's fine
uh but that is an opportunity to just

16456
04:47:21,190 --> 04:47:21,200
uh but that is an opportunity to just
 

16457
04:47:21,200 --> 04:47:23,830
uh but that is an opportunity to just
kind of meander i and i could see that

16458
04:47:23,830 --> 04:47:23,840
kind of meander i and i could see that
 

16459
04:47:23,840 --> 04:47:25,590
kind of meander i and i could see that
in myself when i'm doing some things

16460
04:47:25,590 --> 04:47:25,600
in myself when i'm doing some things
 

16461
04:47:25,600 --> 04:47:26,708
in myself when i'm doing some things
it's like oh this is a kind of

16462
04:47:26,708 --> 04:47:26,718
it's like oh this is a kind of
 

16463
04:47:26,718 --> 04:47:28,868
it's like oh this is a kind of
interesting curious thing let's look at

16464
04:47:28,868 --> 04:47:28,878
interesting curious thing let's look at
 

16465
04:47:28,878 --> 04:47:30,390
interesting curious thing let's look at
this for a little while let's look at

16466
04:47:30,390 --> 04:47:30,400
this for a little while let's look at
 

16467
04:47:30,400 --> 04:47:32,788
this for a little while let's look at
that it's not really bearing down on the

16468
04:47:32,788 --> 04:47:32,798
that it's not really bearing down on the
 

16469
04:47:32,798 --> 04:47:36,310
that it's not really bearing down on the
problem so there's a few things that

16470
04:47:36,310 --> 04:47:36,320
problem so there's a few things that
 

16471
04:47:36,320 --> 04:47:38,470
problem so there's a few things that
that i've done that are kind of tactics

16472
04:47:38,470 --> 04:47:38,480
that i've done that are kind of tactics
 

16473
04:47:38,480 --> 04:47:40,310
that i've done that are kind of tactics
for myself to make me more effective

16474
04:47:40,310 --> 04:47:40,320
for myself to make me more effective
 

16475
04:47:40,320 --> 04:47:42,470
for myself to make me more effective
like one thing i noticed i i was not

16476
04:47:42,470 --> 04:47:42,480
like one thing i noticed i i was not
 

16477
04:47:42,480 --> 04:47:45,190
like one thing i noticed i i was not
doing well is i had a google cloud

16478
04:47:45,190 --> 04:47:45,200
doing well is i had a google cloud
 

16479
04:47:45,200 --> 04:47:47,750
doing well is i had a google cloud
account with uh to get gpus there and i

16480
04:47:47,750 --> 04:47:47,760
account with uh to get gpus there and i
 

16481
04:47:47,760 --> 04:47:49,510
account with uh to get gpus there and i
was finding i was very rarely doing that

16482
04:47:49,510 --> 04:47:49,520
was finding i was very rarely doing that
 

16483
04:47:49,520 --> 04:47:51,830
was finding i was very rarely doing that
for no good psychological reasons where

16484
04:47:51,830 --> 04:47:51,840
for no good psychological reasons where
 

16485
04:47:51,840 --> 04:47:53,430
for no good psychological reasons where
i'm like oh i can always think of

16486
04:47:53,430 --> 04:47:53,440
i'm like oh i can always think of
 

16487
04:47:53,440 --> 04:47:55,030
i'm like oh i can always think of
something to do other than to spin up

16488
04:47:55,030 --> 04:47:55,040
something to do other than to spin up
 

16489
04:47:55,040 --> 04:47:57,030
something to do other than to spin up
instances and run an experiment i can

16490
04:47:57,030 --> 04:47:57,040
instances and run an experiment i can
 

16491
04:47:57,040 --> 04:47:58,868
instances and run an experiment i can
you know keep working on my local titans

16492
04:47:58,868 --> 04:47:58,878
you know keep working on my local titans
 

16493
04:47:58,878 --> 04:48:01,750
you know keep working on my local titans
or something uh but it was really stupid

16494
04:48:01,750 --> 04:48:01,760
or something uh but it was really stupid
 

16495
04:48:01,760 --> 04:48:03,350

i mean it was not a lot of money i

16496
04:48:03,350 --> 04:48:03,360
i mean it was not a lot of money i
 

16497
04:48:03,360 --> 04:48:04,310
i mean it was not a lot of money i
should have been running more

16498
04:48:04,310 --> 04:48:04,320
should have been running more
 

16499
04:48:04,320 --> 04:48:06,708
should have been running more
experiments there so i thought to myself

16500
04:48:06,708 --> 04:48:06,718
experiments there so i thought to myself
 

16501
04:48:06,718 --> 04:48:07,590
experiments there so i thought to myself
well

16502
04:48:07,590 --> 04:48:07,600
well
 

16503
04:48:07,600 --> 04:48:09,030
well
i'm gonna go buy a quarter million

something of me now we've all had the

16576
04:49:24,550 --> 04:49:24,560
something of me now we've all had the
 

16577
04:49:24,560 --> 04:49:26,550
something of me now we've all had the

16587
04:49:34,080 --> 04:49:35,830
sight on the value proposition for this
isn't that i think there are there are

16588
04:49:35,830 --> 04:49:35,840
isn't that i think there are there are
 

16589
04:49:35,840 --> 04:49:38,150
isn't that i think there are there are
unknown unknowns in the way

unknown unknowns in the way
 

16591
04:49:38,160 --> 04:49:40,550

but it's one of these things that it's

16592
04:49:40,550 --> 04:49:40,560
but it's one of these things that it's
 

16593
04:49:40,560 --> 04:49:41,350
but it's one of these things that it's
you know

16594
04:49:41,350 --> 04:49:41,360
you know
 

16595
04:49:41,360 --> 04:49:43,510
you know
it's hyperbole but it's potentially one

16596
04:49:43,510 --> 04:49:43,520
it's hyperbole but it's potentially one
 

16597
04:49:43,520 --> 04:49:45,030
it's hyperbole but it's potentially one
of the most important things humans ever

16598
04:49:45,030 --> 04:49:45,040
of the most important things humans ever
 

16599
04:49:45,040 --> 04:49:46,868
of the most important things humans ever
do and it's something that i think is

16600
04:49:46,868 --> 04:49:46,878
do and it's something that i think is
 

16601
04:49:46,878 --> 04:49:49,030
do and it's something that i think is
within our lifetimes if not within a

04:50:33,510 --> 04:50:33,520
do you see yourself potentially doing
 

16645
04:50:33,520 --> 04:50:35,190
do you see yourself potentially doing
things like this or build you know not

16646
04:50:35,190 --> 04:50:35,200
things like this or build you know not
 

16647
04:50:35,200 --> 04:50:37,270
things like this or build you know not
necessarily solving a gigantic problem

16648
04:50:37,270 --> 04:50:37,280
necessarily solving a gigantic problem
 

16649
04:50:37,280 --> 04:50:40,628
necessarily solving a gigantic problem
but on the journey on the path to that

16650
04:50:40,628 --> 04:50:40,638
but on the journey on the path to that
 

16651
04:50:40,638 --> 04:50:44,390
but on the journey on the path to that
building up intuitions uh and um

16652
04:50:44,390 --> 04:50:44,400
building up intuitions uh and um
 

16653
04:50:44,400 --> 04:50:49,270
building up intuitions uh and um
uh sharing code or ideas or systems

16654
04:50:49,270 --> 04:50:49,280
uh sharing code or ideas or systems
 

16655
04:50:49,280 --> 04:50:53,430
uh sharing code or ideas or systems
that um give inklings of agi but also

16656
04:50:53,430 --> 04:50:53,440
that um give inklings of agi but also
 

16657
04:50:53,440 --> 04:50:55,350
that um give inklings of agi but also
kind of are useful to people in some way

16658
04:50:55,350 --> 04:50:55,360
kind of are useful to people in some way
 

16659
04:50:55,360 --> 04:50:57,270

04:50:57,270 --> 04:50:57,280
so yeah first of all andre is awesome i
 

16661
04:50:57,280 --> 04:50:58,628
so yeah first of all andre is awesome i
learned a lot when i was going through

16662
04:50:58,628 --> 04:50:58,638
learned a lot when i was going through
 

16663
04:50:58,638 --> 04:51:00,948
learned a lot when i was going through
my larval phase from his blog posts and

16664
04:51:00,948 --> 04:51:00,958
my larval phase from his blog posts and
 

16665
04:51:00,958 --> 04:51:03,190
my larval phase from his blog posts and
his stanford course and you know super

16666
04:51:03,190 --> 04:51:03,200
his stanford course and you know super
 

16667
04:51:03,200 --> 04:51:05,350
his stanford course and you know super
valuable i got to meet him first a

16668
04:51:05,350 --> 04:51:05,360
valuable i got to meet him first a
 

16669
04:51:05,360 --> 04:51:06,948
valuable i got to meet him first a
couple years ago when i was first kind

16670
04:51:06,948 --> 04:51:06,958
couple years ago when i was first kind
 

16671
04:51:06,958 --> 04:51:09,430
couple years ago when i was first kind
of starting off on my gentleman

16672
04:51:09,430 --> 04:51:09,440
of starting off on my gentleman
 

16673
04:51:09,440 --> 04:51:10,948
of starting off on my gentleman
scientist bit

16674
04:51:10,948 --> 04:51:10,958
scientist bit
 

16675
04:51:10,958 --> 04:51:13,350
scientist bit
and just uh just a couple months ago

16676
04:51:13,350 --> 04:51:13,360
and just uh just a couple months ago
 

16677
04:51:13,360 --> 04:51:15,430
and just uh just a couple months ago
when he went out on his sabbatical he

16678
04:51:15,430 --> 04:51:15,440
when he went out on his sabbatical he
 

16679
04:51:15,440 --> 04:51:17,110
when he went out on his sabbatical he
stopped by in dallas and we talked for a

16680
04:51:17,110 --> 04:51:17,120
stopped by in dallas and we talked for a
 

16681
04:51:17,120 --> 04:51:19,350
stopped by in dallas and we talked for a
while and i'm i had a great time with

16682
04:51:19,350 --> 04:51:19,360
while and i'm i had a great time with
 

16683
04:51:19,360 --> 04:51:20,550
while and i'm i had a great time with
him and then when i heard he actually

16684
04:51:20,550 --> 04:51:20,560
him and then when i heard he actually
 

16685
04:51:20,560 --> 04:51:22,708
him and then when i heard he actually
left tesla i did of course along with a

16686
04:51:22,708 --> 04:51:22,718
left tesla i did of course along with a
 

16687
04:51:22,718 --> 04:51:24,948

hundred other people say hey if you ever

16688
04:51:24,948 --> 04:51:24,958
hundred other people say hey if you ever
 

16689
04:51:24,958 --> 04:51:27,190
hundred other people say hey if you ever
want to work with me uh it would be an

16690
04:51:27,190 --> 04:51:27,200
want to work with me uh it would be an
 

16691
04:51:27,200 --> 04:51:29,750
want to work with me uh it would be an
honor yeah so i'm he thinks that he's

16692
04:51:29,750 --> 04:51:29,760
honor yeah so i'm he thinks that he's
 

16693
04:51:29,760 --> 04:51:31,270
honor yeah so i'm he thinks that he's
going to be doing this educational work

16694
04:51:31,270 --> 04:51:31,280
going to be doing this educational work
 

16695
04:51:31,280 --> 04:51:32,470
going to be doing this educational work
but i think someone's going to make him

16696
04:51:32,470 --> 04:51:32,480
but i think someone's going to make him
 

16697
04:51:32,480 --> 04:51:34,550
but i think someone's going to make him
an offer he can't refuse

16698
04:51:34,550 --> 04:51:34,560
an offer he can't refuse
 

16699
04:51:34,560 --> 04:51:36,708
an offer he can't refuse
before he gets too far along on it oh

16700
04:51:36,708 --> 04:51:36,718
before he gets too far along on it oh
 

16701
04:51:36,718 --> 04:51:38,550
before he gets too far along on it oh
his cur his current interest is

16702
04:51:38,550 --> 04:51:38,560
his cur his current interest is
 

16703
04:51:38,560 --> 04:51:40,230

something you understand like he did
 

16713
04:51:48,480 --> 04:51:49,990
something you understand like he did
he was very much a programmer's

16714
04:51:49,990 --> 04:51:50,000
he was very much a programmer's
 

16715
04:51:50,000 --> 04:51:51,510
he was very much a programmer's
programmer that was doing machine

16716
04:51:51,510 --> 04:51:51,520
programmer that was doing machine
 

16717

04:51:55,830 --> 04:51:55,840
it's a different feel than an academic
 

16721
04:51:55,840 --> 04:51:57,750
it's a different feel than an academic
where you can see it in paper sometimes

16722
04:51:57,750 --> 04:51:57,760
where you can see it in paper sometimes
 

16723
04:51:57,760 --> 04:51:59,190
where you can see it in paper sometimes
where somebody that's really a

and they're they're doing something with
 

16729
04:52:03,040 --> 04:52:05,430
and they're they're doing something with
machine learning but uh you know andre

16730
04:52:05,430 --> 04:52:05,440
machine learning but uh you know andre
 

16731
04:52:05,440 --> 04:52:07,270
machine learning but uh you know andre
is about getting something done and you

16732
04:52:07,270 --> 04:52:07,280
is about getting something done and you
 

16733

you know crypto works

16744
04:52:19,190 --> 04:52:19,200
you know crypto works
 

16745
04:52:19,200 --> 04:52:22,390
you know crypto works
and i am and yeah it's just

he's a hacker's you know one of his old

16748
04:52:24,070 --> 04:52:24,080
he's a hacker's you know one of his old
 

16749
04:52:24,080 --> 04:52:25,430
he's a hacker's you know one of his old
posts was like a hacker's guide to

16750
04:52:25,430 --> 04:52:25,440
posts was like a hacker's guide to
 

16751
04:52:25,440 --> 04:52:26,948
posts was like a hacker's guide to
machine learning yeah and you know he

16752
04:52:26,948 --> 04:52:26,958
machine learning yeah and you know he
 

16753
04:52:26,958 --> 04:52:28,310
machine learning yeah and you know he
deprecated that and said don't really

16754
04:52:28,310 --> 04:52:28,320
deprecated that and said don't really
 

16755
04:52:28,320 --> 04:52:30,550
deprecated that and said don't really
pay attention to what's in here but it's

16756
04:52:30,550 --> 04:52:30,560
pay attention to what's in here but it's
 

16757
04:52:30,560 --> 04:52:32,628
pay attention to what's in here but it's
that thought that uh that carries

16758
04:52:32,628 --> 04:52:32,638
that thought that uh that carries
 

16759
04:52:32,638 --> 04:52:35,110
that thought that uh that carries
through in a lot of it where it is that

16760
04:52:35,110 --> 04:52:35,120
through in a lot of it where it is that
 

16761
04:52:35,120 --> 04:52:36,868
through in a lot of it where it is that
back again to that hacker mentality and

16762
04:52:36,868 --> 04:52:36,878
back again to that hacker mentality and
 

16763
04:52:36,878 --> 04:52:38,708
back again to that hacker mentality and
the hacker ethic with what he's doing

16764
04:52:38,708 --> 04:52:38,718
the hacker ethic with what he's doing
 

16765
04:52:38,718 --> 04:52:41,430
the hacker ethic with what he's doing
and in sharing all of it yeah and a lot

16766
04:52:41,430 --> 04:52:41,440
and in sharing all of it yeah and a lot
 

16767
04:52:41,440 --> 04:52:43,510
and in sharing all of it yeah and a lot
of his approach to a new thing

16768
04:52:43,510 --> 04:52:43,520
of his approach to a new thing
 

16769
04:52:43,520 --> 04:52:46,310
of his approach to a new thing
like like i said larva stage is let me

16770
04:52:46,310 --> 04:52:46,320
like like i said larva stage is let me
 

16771
04:52:46,320 --> 04:52:48,708
like like i said larva stage is let me
code up the simplest possible thing to

16772
04:52:48,708 --> 04:52:48,718
code up the simplest possible thing to
 

16773
04:52:48,718 --> 04:52:50,708
code up the simplest possible thing to
build up intuition about it yeah like i

16774
04:52:50,708 --> 04:52:50,718
build up intuition about it yeah like i
 

16775
04:52:50,718 --> 04:52:52,628
build up intuition about it yeah like i
say i sketch with structs and things

16776
04:52:52,628 --> 04:52:52,638
say i sketch with structs and things
 

16777
04:52:52,638 --> 04:52:54,470
say i sketch with structs and things
when i'm just thinking about a problem

16778
04:52:54,470 --> 04:52:54,480
when i'm just thinking about a problem
 

16779
04:52:54,480 --> 04:52:58,070
when i'm just thinking about a problem
i'm thinking in some degree of code

16780
04:52:58,070 --> 04:52:58,080
i'm thinking in some degree of code
 

16781
04:52:58,080 --> 04:53:00,948
i'm thinking in some degree of code
you are also among many things a martial

16782
04:53:00,948 --> 04:53:00,958
you are also among many things a martial
 

16783
04:53:00,958 --> 04:53:03,350
you are also among many things a martial
artist both judo and jiu-jitsu

16784
04:53:03,350 --> 04:53:03,360
artist both judo and jiu-jitsu
 

16785
04:53:03,360 --> 04:53:05,750
artist both judo and jiu-jitsu
how has this helped make you the person

16786
04:53:05,750 --> 04:53:05,760
how has this helped make you the person
 

16787
04:53:05,760 --> 04:53:07,030
how has this helped make you the person
you are

16788
04:53:07,030 --> 04:53:07,040
you are
 

16789
04:53:07,040 --> 04:53:09,110
you are
so i mean i was a competent club player

16790
04:53:09,110 --> 04:53:09,120
so i mean i was a competent club player
 

16791
04:53:09,120 --> 04:53:09,830
so i mean i was a competent club player
in

16792
04:53:09,830 --> 04:53:09,840
in
 

16793
04:53:09,840 --> 04:53:11,750
in
judo and grappling i mean i was you know

16794
04:53:11,750 --> 04:53:11,760
judo and grappling i mean i was you know
 

16795
04:53:11,760 --> 04:53:14,708
judo and grappling i mean i was you know

17049
04:57:35,840 --> 04:57:37,270
really really well but sometimes there's
interest in learning a little bit more

17050
04:57:37,270 --> 04:57:37,280
interest in learning a little bit more
 

17051
04:57:37,280 --> 04:57:39,270
interest in learning a little bit more
of the scope there and figuring some

17052
04:57:39,270 --> 04:57:39,280
of the scope there and figuring some
 

17053
04:57:39,280 --> 04:57:41,430
of the scope there and figuring some
things out from you know at one point i

17054

04:57:41,440 --> 04:57:43,750
things out from you know at one point i
had wasn't exactly a spreadsheet but i

17056
04:57:43,750 --> 04:57:43,760
had wasn't exactly a spreadsheet but i
 

17057
04:57:43,760 --> 04:57:46,070
had wasn't exactly a spreadsheet but i
did have a you know a big long text file

17058
04:57:46,070 --> 04:57:46,080
did have a you know a big long text file
 

17059
04:57:46,080 --> 04:57:47,270
did have a you know a big long text file
with like here's the things that i

17060
04:57:47,270 --> 04:57:47,280
with like here's the things that i
 

17061
04:57:47,280 --> 04:57:49,350
with like here's the things that i
learned in here like ways you chain this

17062
04:57:49,350 --> 04:57:49,360
learned in here like ways you chain this
 

17063
04:57:49,360 --> 04:57:52,390
learned in here like ways you chain this
together and while when i went back a

17064
04:57:52,390 --> 04:57:52,400
together and while when i went back a
 

17065
04:57:52,400 --> 04:57:55,030
together and while when i went back a
few years ago it was good to see that i

17066
04:57:55,030 --> 04:57:55,040
few years ago it was good to see that i
 

17067
04:57:55,040 --> 04:57:56,708
few years ago it was good to see that i
whipped myself back into reasonable

17068
04:57:56,708 --> 04:57:56,718
whipped myself back into reasonable
 

17069
04:57:56,718 --> 04:57:58,550
whipped myself back into reasonable
shape about doing the basic grappling

17070
04:57:58,550 --> 04:57:58,560
shape about doing the basic grappling
 

17071
04:57:58,560 --> 04:57:59,910
shape about doing the basic grappling
but i know there was a ton of the

17072
04:57:59,910 --> 04:57:59,920
but i know there was a ton of the
 

17073
04:57:59,920 --> 04:58:01,990
but i know there was a ton of the
subtleties that were just that were gone

17074
04:58:01,990 --> 04:58:02,000
subtleties that were just that were gone
 

17075
04:58:02,000 --> 04:58:03,670
subtleties that were just that were gone
but could probably be brought back

17076
04:58:03,670 --> 04:58:03,680
but could probably be brought back
 

17077
04:58:03,680 --> 04:58:05,670
but could probably be brought back
reasonably quickly and there's also the

17078
04:58:05,670 --> 04:58:05,680
reasonably quickly and there's also the
 

17079
04:58:05,680 --> 04:58:07,750
reasonably quickly and there's also the
benefit i mean you're exceptionally

anything you just you're trapped and
that's uh that's a style that's a

17252
05:00:56,628 --> 05:00:56,638
that's uh that's a style that's a
 

17253
05:00:56,638 --> 05:00:58,788
that's uh that's a style that's a
difference in the style of martial arts

but it's also
 

17257
05:01:00,400 --> 05:01:01,990
but it's also
uh once you start the study you

17258
05:01:01,990 --> 05:01:02,000
uh once you start the study you
 

17259
05:01:02,000 --> 05:01:03,910
uh once you start the study you
understand it all has to do with human

17260
05:01:03,910 --> 05:01:03,920
understand it all has to do with human
 

17261
05:01:03,920 --> 05:01:05,590
understand it all has to do with human
movement and the physics of it and the

17262
05:01:05,590 --> 05:01:05,600
movement and the physics of it and the
 

17263
05:01:05,600 --> 05:01:06,948
movement and the physics of it and the
leverage and all that kind of stuff and

17264
05:01:06,948 --> 05:01:06,958
leverage and all that kind of stuff and
 

17265
05:01:06,958 --> 05:01:07,990
leverage and all that kind of stuff and
that's like

17266
05:01:07,990 --> 05:01:08,000
that's like
 

17267
05:01:08,000 --> 05:01:09,590
that's like
yeah that's super fascinating at the end

17268
05:01:09,590 --> 05:01:09,600
yeah that's super fascinating at the end
 

17269
05:01:09,600 --> 05:01:10,948
yeah that's super fascinating at the end
of the day for me

17270
05:01:10,948 --> 05:01:10,958
of the day for me
 

17271
05:01:10,958 --> 05:01:12,948
of the day for me
the biggest benefit is and the humbling

17272
05:01:12,948 --> 05:01:12,958
the biggest benefit is and the humbling
 

17273
05:01:12,958 --> 05:01:16,868
the biggest benefit is and the humbling
aspect when another human being

17274
05:01:16,868 --> 05:01:16,878

 

17275
05:01:16,878 --> 05:01:17,830

kind of

17276
05:01:17,830 --> 05:01:17,840
kind of
 

17277
05:01:17,840 --> 05:01:19,670
kind of
tells you that you know there's a

17278
05:01:19,670 --> 05:01:19,680
tells you that you know there's a
 

17279
05:01:19,680 --> 05:01:22,150
tells you that you know there's a
hierarchy or there's a

17280
05:01:22,150 --> 05:01:22,160
hierarchy or there's a
 

17281
05:01:22,160 --> 05:01:23,270
hierarchy or there's a
um

17282
05:01:23,270 --> 05:01:23,280
um
 

17283
05:01:23,280 --> 05:01:25,910
um
you're not that special and in the most

17284
05:01:25,910 --> 05:01:25,920
you're not that special and in the most
 

17285
05:01:25,920 --> 05:01:28,150
you're not that special and in the most
extreme case when you tap to a choke you

17286
05:01:28,150 --> 05:01:28,160
extreme case when you tap to a choke you
 

17287
05:01:28,160 --> 05:01:29,750
extreme case when you tap to a choke you
are basically

17288
05:01:29,750 --> 05:01:29,760
are basically
 

17289
05:01:29,760 --> 05:01:31,910
are basically
living because somebody lets you live

17290
05:01:31,910 --> 05:01:31,920
living because somebody lets you live
 

17291
05:01:31,920 --> 05:01:33,830
living because somebody lets you live
and that's that is one of those if you

17292
05:01:33,830 --> 05:01:33,840
and that's that is one of those if you
 

17293
05:01:33,840 --> 05:01:35,510
and that's that is one of those if you
think about it that is a closer brush

17294
05:01:35,510 --> 05:01:35,520
think about it that is a closer brush
 

17295
05:01:35,520 --> 05:01:38,070
think about it that is a closer brush
with mortality than than most people

17296
05:01:38,070 --> 05:01:38,080
with mortality than than most people
 

17297
05:01:38,080 --> 05:01:40,628
with mortality than than most people
consider

17298
05:01:40,628 --> 05:01:40,638

 

17299
05:01:40,638 --> 05:01:42,150

and that kind of
 

17301
05:01:42,160 --> 05:01:44,948
and that kind of
humbling act is good to take to your

17302
05:01:44,948 --> 05:01:44,958
humbling act is good to take to your
 

17303
05:01:44,958 --> 05:01:46,948
humbling act is good to take to your
work then where it's harder to get

you know my my biggest point was that
 

17353
05:02:36,080 --> 05:02:37,750
you know my my biggest point was that
the path for me might not be the path

17354
05:02:37,750 --> 05:02:37,760
the path for me might not be the path
 

17355
05:02:37,760 --> 05:02:40,390
the path for me might not be the path
for everyone and in fact the advice the

17356
05:02:40,390 --> 05:02:40,400
for everyone and in fact the advice the
 

17357

for everyone and in fact the advice the
the path that i took and even the advice

the path that i took and even the advice
 

17359
05:02:42,400 --> 05:02:44,550
the path that i took and even the advice
that i would give based on my

17360
05:02:44,550 --> 05:02:44,560
that i would give based on my
 

17361
05:02:44,560 --> 05:02:46,868
that i would give based on my
experience and learnings probably isn't

17362
05:02:46,868 --> 05:02:46,878
experience and learnings probably isn't
 

17363

the best advice for everyone because
 

17365
05:02:49,520 --> 05:02:51,830
the best advice for everyone because
what i did was all about this knowledge

17366
05:02:51,830 --> 05:02:51,840
what i did was all about this knowledge
 

17367
05:02:51,840 --> 05:02:54,390
what i did was all about this knowledge
in depth it was about not just having

17368
05:02:54,390 --> 05:02:54,400
in depth it was about not just having
 

17369
05:02:54,400 --> 05:02:56,550
in depth it was about not just having
this surface level ability to make

17370
05:02:56,550 --> 05:02:56,560
this surface level ability to make
 

17371
05:02:56,560 --> 05:02:58,310
this surface level ability to make
things do what i want but to really

17372
05:02:58,310 --> 05:02:58,320
things do what i want but to really
 

17373
05:02:58,320 --> 05:02:59,910
things do what i want but to really
understand them through and through to

and there's whole new worlds to explore
on the different things that you can do

you can and then be be prepared for
 

17435
05:04:01,520 --> 05:04:03,270
you can and then be be prepared for
opportunities to present themselves

17436
05:04:03,270 --> 05:04:03,280
opportunities to present themselves
 

17437
05:04:03,280 --> 05:04:05,830
opportunities to present themselves
where you can't just say this is my goal

17438
05:04:05,830 --> 05:04:05,840
where you can't just say this is my goal
 

17439
05:04:05,840 --> 05:04:08,230
where you can't just say this is my goal
in life and just push at that i mean you

17440
05:04:08,230 --> 05:04:08,240
in life and just push at that i mean you
 

17441
05:04:08,240 --> 05:04:09,510
in life and just push at that i mean you
might be able to do that but you're

17442
05:04:09,510 --> 05:04:09,520
might be able to do that but you're
 

17443
05:04:09,520 --> 05:04:11,750
might be able to do that but you're
going to make more total progress if you

17444
05:04:11,750 --> 05:04:11,760
going to make more total progress if you
 

17445
05:04:11,760 --> 05:04:14,390
going to make more total progress if you
say i'm preparing myself with this broad

17446
05:04:14,390 --> 05:04:14,400
say i'm preparing myself with this broad
 

17447
05:04:14,400 --> 05:04:17,430
say i'm preparing myself with this broad
set of tools and then i'm being aware of

17448
05:04:17,430 --> 05:04:17,440
set of tools and then i'm being aware of
 

17449
05:04:17,440 --> 05:04:19,430
set of tools and then i'm being aware of
all the way things are changing as i

17450
05:04:19,430 --> 05:04:19,440
all the way things are changing as i
 

17451
05:04:19,440 --> 05:04:20,868
all the way things are changing as i
move through the world and as the whole

17452
05:04:20,868 --> 05:04:20,878
move through the world and as the whole
 

17453
05:04:20,878 --> 05:04:23,110
move through the world and as the whole
world changes around me and then looking

05:04:23,110 --> 05:04:23,120
world changes around me and then looking
 

17455
05:04:23,120 --> 05:04:25,110
world changes around me and then looking
for opportunities to deploy the tools

17456
05:04:25,110 --> 05:04:25,120
for opportunities to deploy the tools
 

17457
05:04:25,120 --> 05:04:26,390
for opportunities to deploy the tools
that you've built

17458
05:04:26,390 --> 05:04:26,400
that you've built
 

17459
05:04:26,400 --> 05:04:28,788
that you've built
and there's going to be more and more of

17460
05:04:28,788 --> 05:04:28,798
and there's going to be more and more of
 

17461
05:04:28,798 --> 05:04:31,110
and there's going to be more and more of
those types of things there where

17462
05:04:31,110 --> 05:04:31,120
those types of things there where
 

17463
05:04:31,120 --> 05:04:32,868
those types of things there where
an awareness of what's happening where

an awareness of what's happening where
the inefficiencies are what things can

05:04:35,350 --> 05:04:35,360
the inefficiencies are what things can
 

17467
05:04:35,360 --> 05:04:37,750
the inefficiencies are what things can
be done what's possible versus what's

17468
05:04:37,750 --> 05:04:37,760
be done what's possible versus what's
 

17469
05:04:37,760 --> 05:04:40,230
be done what's possible versus what's
current practice and then finding those

17470
05:04:40,230 --> 05:04:40,240
current practice and then finding those
 

17471
05:04:40,240 --> 05:04:42,230
current practice and then finding those
areas where you can go and make an

17472
05:04:42,230 --> 05:04:42,240
areas where you can go and make an
 

17473
05:04:42,240 --> 05:04:44,948
areas where you can go and make an
adjustment and make something that may

17474
05:04:44,948 --> 05:04:44,958
adjustment and make something that may
 

17475
05:04:44,958 --> 05:04:47,190
adjustment and make something that may
affect millions or billions of people in

how are you able to recognize this about
yourself that you saw the layers in in a

yourself that you saw the layers in in a
particular thing and you were drawn to

computers i remember the the reference
 

17501
05:05:12,718 --> 05:05:14,788
computers i remember the the reference
manuals and the very early ones even had

manuals and the very early ones even had
 

17503
05:05:14,798 --> 05:05:17,030
manuals and the very early ones even had
schematics of uh computers in the

how the different things worked uh i was
pulling out the information that i could

17518

pulling out the information that i could
 

17519
05:05:32,240 --> 05:05:34,628
pulling out the information that i could
get but i always wanted to know all of

05:08:24,638 --> 05:08:26,628
have a lot of layers and complexity to
them and a lot of opportunities hidden

17690
05:08:26,628 --> 05:08:26,638
them and a lot of opportunities hidden
 

17691
05:08:26,638 --> 05:08:28,150
them and a lot of opportunities hidden
within them

17692

within them
 

17693
05:08:28,160 --> 05:08:29,830
within them
so that would probably be the most

05:08:29,830 --> 05:08:29,840
so that would probably be the most
 

17695

and
 

17907
05:12:31,120 --> 05:12:33,590

uh take a crack at the problem of agi
 

17909
05:12:33,600 --> 05:12:35,670
uh take a crack at the problem of agi
and create things that eventually

17910
05:12:35,670 --> 05:12:35,680
and create things that eventually
 

17911
05:12:35,680 --> 05:12:38,788
