00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:22,709
how do you accurately analyze the
 

167
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,590
how do you accurately analyze the
situation how do you accurately discover

168
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:24,600
situation how do you accurately discover
 

169
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,440
situation how do you accurately discover
the truth the nature of things almost

170
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,450
the truth the nature of things almost
 

171
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,970
the truth the nature of things almost
the way you're asking the question

172
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:28,980
the way you're asking the question
 

173
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,080
the way you're asking the question
implies that truth and newness have

174
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,090
implies that truth and newness have
 

175
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,780
implies that truth and newness have
nothing or almost at odds and I just

176
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:35,790
nothing or almost at odds and I just
 

177
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,340
nothing or almost at odds and I just
want to say that I don't think that

178
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:37,350
want to say that I don't think that
 

179
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,670
want to say that I don't think that
that's true right so what I mean by

180
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:40,680
that's true right so what I mean by
 

181
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,520
that's true right so what I mean by
truth truth is you know was a reality

182
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:43,530
truth truth is you know was a reality
 

183
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,130
truth truth is you know was a reality
how does the reality work and so if

184
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,140
how does the reality work and so if
 

185
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,020
how does the reality work and so if
you're doing something new that has

186
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,030
you're doing something new that has
 

187
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,670
you're doing something new that has
never been done before which is exciting

188
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
never been done before which is exciting
 

189
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,670
never been done before which is exciting
and I like to do the way that you would

190
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
and I like to do the way that you would
 

191
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,820
and I like to do the way that you would
start with that is experimenting on what

192
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:55,830
start with that is experimenting on what
 

193
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,040
start with that is experimenting on what
are the realities and the premises that

194
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,050
are the realities and the premises that
 

195
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,050
are the realities and the premises that
you're using on that and how to stress

196
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,060
you're using on that and how to stress
 

197
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,270
you're using on that and how to stress
test those types of things I think what

198
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,280
test those types of things I think what
 

199
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,789
test those types of things I think what
you're talking about is instead the fact

200
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
you're talking about is instead the fact
 

201
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,440
you're talking about is instead the fact
of how do you deal with something that's

202
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,450
of how do you deal with something that's
 

203
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,750
of how do you deal with something that's
never been done before and deal with the

204
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:08,760
never been done before and deal with the
 

205
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,020
never been done before and deal with the
Associated probabilities and so I I

206
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,030
Associated probabilities and so I I
 

207
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,449
Associated probabilities and so I I
think in that don't let something that's

208
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:14,459
think in that don't let something that's
 

209
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,490
think in that don't let something that's
never been done before stand in the way

210
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:16,500
never been done before stand in the way
 

211
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,940
never been done before stand in the way
of you doing that particular thing you

212
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:19,950
of you doing that particular thing you
 

213
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,670
of you doing that particular thing you
have a because almost the only way that

214
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:22,680
have a because almost the only way that
 

215
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,550
have a because almost the only way that
you understand what truth is is through

216
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:25,560
you understand what truth is is through
 

217
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,219
you understand what truth is is through
experimentation and so when you go out

218
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:28,229
experimentation and so when you go out
 

219
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,260
experimentation and so when you go out
and experiment you're going to learn a

220
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,270
and experiment you're going to learn a
 

221
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,540
and experiment you're going to learn a
lot more about what truth is but the

222
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:32,550
lot more about what truth is but the
 

223
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,990
lot more about what truth is but the
essence of what I'm saying is that when

224
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
essence of what I'm saying is that when
 

225
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,719
essence of what I'm saying is that when
you take a look at that use truth that

226
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:38,729
you take a look at that use truth that
 

227
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,520
you take a look at that use truth that
find out what the realities are as a

228
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:40,530
find out what the realities are as a
 

229
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,130
find out what the realities are as a
foundation do the independent thinking

230
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,140
foundation do the independent thinking
 

231
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,860
foundation do the independent thinking
do the experimentation to find out

232
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:45,870
do the experimentation to find out
 

233
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,650
do the experimentation to find out
what's true and change and keep going

234
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:48,660
what's true and change and keep going
 

235
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,310
what's true and change and keep going
after that so I think that the way that

236
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
after that so I think that the way that
 

237
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,500
after that so I think that the way that
when you're thinking about it the way

238
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:54,510
when you're thinking about it the way
 

239
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,630
when you're thinking about it the way
you're thinking about it that almost

240
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:56,640
you're thinking about it that almost
 

241
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,060
you're thinking about it that almost
implies that you're you're letting

242
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,070
implies that you're you're letting
 

243
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,930
implies that you're you're letting
people almost say that they're reliant

244
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:02,940
people almost say that they're reliant
 

245
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,270
people almost say that they're reliant
on what's been discovered before to find

246
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
on what's been discovered before to find
 

247
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,040
on what's been discovered before to find
out what's true and what's been

248
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,050
out what's true and what's been
 

249
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,469
out what's true and what's been
discovered before is often not true

250
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
discovered before is often not true
 

251
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,469
discovered before is often not true
right conventional view of what what is

252
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:13,479
right conventional view of what what is
 

253
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,159
right conventional view of what what is
true is very often wrong it'll go in ups

254
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:17,169
true is very often wrong it'll go in ups
 

255
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,200
true is very often wrong it'll go in ups
and downs and you know I mean there are

256
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,210
and downs and you know I mean there are
 

257
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,329
and downs and you know I mean there are
fads and okay this thing it goes this

258
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:21,339
fads and okay this thing it goes this
 

259
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:23,670
fads and okay this thing it goes this
way and that way and so definitions of

260
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
way and that way and so definitions of
 

261
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,119
way and that way and so definitions of
truths that are conventional are not the

262
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:27,129
truths that are conventional are not the
 

263
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,049
truths that are conventional are not the
thing to go by how do you know the thing

264
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:31,059
thing to go by how do you know the thing
 

265
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:32,909
thing to go by how do you know the thing
that has been done before it might

266
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:32,919
that has been done before it might
 

267
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,510
that has been done before it might
succeed its to do you whatever homework

268
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:36,520
succeed its to do you whatever homework
 

269
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,879
succeed its to do you whatever homework
that you have in order to try to get a

270
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:38,889
that you have in order to try to get a
 

271
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,760
that you have in order to try to get a
foundation and then to go into worlds of

272
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:41,770
foundation and then to go into worlds of
 

273
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,579
foundation and then to go into worlds of
not knowing and you go into the world of

274
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:44,589
not knowing and you go into the world of
 

275
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:47,939
not knowing and you go into the world of
not knowing but not stupidly not naively

276
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:47,949
not knowing but not stupidly not naively
 

277
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,579
not knowing but not stupidly not naively
you know you go into that world of not

278
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:50,589
you know you go into that world of not
 

279
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:52,829
you know you go into that world of not
knowing and then you do experimenting

280
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:52,839
knowing and then you do experimenting
 

281
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,260
knowing and then you do experimenting
and you learn what truth is and what's

282
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,270
and you learn what truth is and what's
 

283
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,200
and you learn what truth is and what's
possible through that process I describe

284
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,210
possible through that process I describe
 

285
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,540
possible through that process I describe
it as a five step process the first step

286
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:00,550
it as a five step process the first step
 

287
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,610
it as a five step process the first step
is you go after your goals the second

288
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:02,620
is you go after your goals the second
 

289
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,920
is you go after your goals the second
step is you identify the problems that

290
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:04,930
step is you identify the problems that
 

291
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,420
step is you identify the problems that
stand in the way of you getting to your

292
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,430
stand in the way of you getting to your
 

293
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,909
stand in the way of you getting to your
goals the third step is you diagnose

294
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:08,919
goals the third step is you diagnose
 

295
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,829
goals the third step is you diagnose
those to get at the root cause of those

296
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:10,839
those to get at the root cause of those
 

297
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,469
those to get at the root cause of those
then the fourth step is then now that

298
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:13,479
then the fourth step is then now that
 

299
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,329
then the fourth step is then now that
you know the exact truth calls you get

300
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:15,339
you know the exact truth calls you get
 

301
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:17,730
you know the exact truth calls you get
you design a way to get around those and

302
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:17,740
you design a way to get around those and
 

303
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,550
you design a way to get around those and
then you follow through and do the

304
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
then you follow through and do the
 

305
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,760
then you follow through and do the
designs you set out to do and it's the

306
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:22,770
designs you set out to do and it's the
 

307
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,079
designs you set out to do and it's the
experimentation I think that what

308
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:25,089
experimentation I think that what
 

309
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:28,889
experimentation I think that what
happens to people mostly is that they

310
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:28,899
happens to people mostly is that they
 

311
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,899
happens to people mostly is that they
try to decide whether they're going to

312
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:30,909
try to decide whether they're going to
 

313
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:32,610
try to decide whether they're going to
be successful or not

314
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:32,620
be successful or not
 

315
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,769
be successful or not
ahead of doing it and they don't know

316
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:34,779
ahead of doing it and they don't know
 

317
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,600
ahead of doing it and they don't know
how to do the process well because the

318
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:36,610
how to do the process well because the
 

319
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,029
how to do the process well because the
nature of your questions are along those

320
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
nature of your questions are along those
 

321
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,159
nature of your questions are along those
lines like how do you know well you

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,910
there right that there's a confidence
and and the more confidence that you

995
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,690
1981-82 I had calculated that American
banks had given a lot more money to lent

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:42,910
countries than those countries were
 

1001
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,270
countries than those countries were
going to pay back and that they would

1002
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
going to pay back and that they would
 

1003
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,400
going to pay back and that they would
have a debt crisis and that this had

1004
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,410
have a debt crisis and that this had
 

1005
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,490

said the economy tumbling and that was

1006
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:50,500

said the economy tumbling and that was
an extremely controversial point of view

1008

an extremely controversial point of view
then it started to happen and it

1010
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
then it started to happen and it

going to be a an economic collapse that
was going to follow because there was a

1018
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,300
was going to follow because there was a
 

1019
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,790
was going to follow because there was a
series of the other countries it was

1020
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:05,800
series of the other countries it was
 

1021

and that well it couldn't have been more
wrong that was the exact bottom in the

1026
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,030
wrong that was the exact bottom in the

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,070
other words person by person I hired
them and I wanted the smartest people

1106
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
them and I wanted the smartest people
 

1107
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,870
them and I wanted the smartest people
who would be independent thinkers who

1108
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:51,880
who would be independent thinkers who
 

1109
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,210
who would be independent thinkers who
would disagree with each other and me

1110
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:54,220
would disagree with each other and me
 

1111
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,280
would disagree with each other and me
well so that we could be independent

1112
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,290
well so that we could be independent
 

1113
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,950
well so that we could be independent
thinkers to go off to produce those

1114
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
thinkers to go off to produce those
 

1115
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,870
thinkers to go off to produce those
audacious dreams because you have to be

1116
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
audacious dreams because you have to be
 

1117
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,940
audacious dreams because you have to be
an independent thinker to do that and to

1118
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:02,950
an independent thinker to do that and to
 

1119
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,710
an independent thinker to do that and to
do that not independently of the

1120
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
do that not independently of the
 

1121
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,690
do that not independently of the
consensus independently of each other

1122
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:06,700
consensus independently of each other
 

1123
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
consensus independently of each other
and then work ourselves through that

1124
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:08,710
and then work ourselves through that
 

1125
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,170
and then work ourselves through that
because who know whether you're gonna

1126
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:10,180
because who know whether you're gonna
 

1127
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,480
because who know whether you're gonna
have the right answer and by doing that

1128
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,490
have the right answer and by doing that
 

1129
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,330
have the right answer and by doing that
then that was the key to our success

1130
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:15,340
then that was the key to our success
 

1131
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,400
then that was the key to our success
and the things that I want to pass along

1132
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,410
and the things that I want to pass along
 

1133
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,200
and the things that I want to pass along
to people the reason I'm doing this

1134
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,210
to people the reason I'm doing this
 

1135
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,380
to people the reason I'm doing this
podcast with you is you know I'm 70

1136
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:22,390
podcast with you is you know I'm 70
 

1137
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,000
podcast with you is you know I'm 70
years old and that is a magical way of a

1138
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,010
years old and that is a magical way of a
 

1139
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,980
years old and that is a magical way of a
achieving success if you can create an

1140
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:28,990
achieving success if you can create an
 

1141
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,100
achieving success if you can create an
idea meritocracy it's it's so much

1142
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,110
idea meritocracy it's it's so much
 

1143
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,140
idea meritocracy it's it's so much
better in terms of achieving success and

1144
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,150
better in terms of achieving success and
 

1145
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,480
better in terms of achieving success and
also quality relationships with people

1146
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:36,490
also quality relationships with people
 

1147
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,160
also quality relationships with people
but that's what that experience gave me

1148
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,170
but that's what that experience gave me
 

1149
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,590
but that's what that experience gave me
so if we can look around a little bit

1150
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:40,600
so if we can look around a little bit
 

1151
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,340
so if we can look around a little bit
longer

1152
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,350
longer
 

1153
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,410
longer
the idea of an idea meritocracy it's

1154
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:43,420
the idea of an idea meritocracy it's
 

1155
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,470
the idea of an idea meritocracy it's
fascinating but especially because it

1156
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
fascinating but especially because it
 

1157
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,960
fascinating but especially because it
seems to be rare not just in companies

1158
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:48,970
seems to be rare not just in companies
 

1159
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,900
seems to be rare not just in companies
but in society so there's a lot of

1160
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:51,910
but in society so there's a lot of
 

1161
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,730
but in society so there's a lot of
people on Twitter and public discourse

1162
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:53,740
people on Twitter and public discourse
 

1163
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,490
people on Twitter and public discourse
and politics and so on that are really

1164
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:56,500
and politics and so on that are really
 

1165
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,380
and politics and so on that are really
stuck in certain sets of ideas whatever

1166
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:58,390
stuck in certain sets of ideas whatever
 

1167
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,530
stuck in certain sets of ideas whatever
they are so when you're confronted with

1168
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:01,540
they are so when you're confronted with
 

1169
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,470
they are so when you're confronted with
it with an idea that said that's

1170
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
it with an idea that said that's
 

1171
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,410
it with an idea that said that's
different than your own about a

1172
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:07,420
different than your own about a
 

1173
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,250
different than your own about a
particular topic what kind of process do

1174
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:11,260
particular topic what kind of process do
 

1175
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,390
particular topic what kind of process do
you go through mental

1176
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,400
you go through mental
 

1177
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,940
you go through mental
are you arguing through the idea with

1178
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:14,950
are you arguing through the idea with
 

1179
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,100
are you arguing through the idea with
the person sort of present is almost

1180
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,110
the person sort of present is almost
 

1181
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,980
the person sort of present is almost
like a debate or do you sit on it and

1182
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:19,990
like a debate or do you sit on it and
 

1183
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,149
like a debate or do you sit on it and
consider the world sort of

1184
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:21,159
consider the world sort of
 

1185
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:26,159
consider the world sort of
empathetically if this is true then what

1186
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:26,169
empathetically if this is true then what
 

1187
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:27,750
empathetically if this is true then what
is that war look like does that world

1188
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:27,760
is that war look like does that world
 

1189
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,279
is that war look like does that world
make sense and so on so what's the

1190
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:29,289
make sense and so on so what's the
 

1191
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,980
make sense and so on so what's the
process of considering those conflicting

1192
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:31,990
process of considering those conflicting
 

1193
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,340
process of considering those conflicting
ideas I'm gonna answer that question but

1194
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:35,350
ideas I'm gonna answer that question but
 

1195
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,710
ideas I'm gonna answer that question but
after saying first imposed implicit in

1196
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:37,720
after saying first imposed implicit in
 

1197
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,909
after saying first imposed implicit in
your question is it's not common okay

1198
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
your question is it's not common okay
 

1199
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,820
your question is it's not common okay
what's common produces only common

1200
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:44,830
what's common produces only common
 

1201
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,019
what's common produces only common
results okay so don't judge yes anything

1202
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:49,029
results okay so don't judge yes anything
 

1203
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:50,789
results okay so don't judge yes anything
that is good based on whether it's

1204
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
that is good based on whether it's
 

1205
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,350
that is good based on whether it's
common because you're on its only going

1206
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:52,360
common because you're on its only going
 

1207
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,970
common because you're on its only going
to give you common results if you want

1208
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:53,980
to give you common results if you want
 

1209
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,190
to give you common results if you want
unique you have a unique approach yes

1210
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,200
unique you have a unique approach yes
 

1211
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,830
unique you have a unique approach yes
okay and so that art of thoughtful

1212
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:58,840
okay and so that art of thoughtful
 

1213
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,820
okay and so that art of thoughtful
disagreement is the is the capacity to

1214
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:02,830
disagreement is the is the capacity to
 

1215
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,610
disagreement is the is the capacity to
hold two things in your mind at the same

1216
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:05,620
hold two things in your mind at the same
 

1217
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,419
hold two things in your mind at the same
time the G I think this makes sense and

1218
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:09,429
time the G I think this makes sense and
 

1219
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:12,299
time the G I think this makes sense and
then saying I'm not sure it makes sense

1220
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:12,309
then saying I'm not sure it makes sense
 

1221
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,529
then saying I'm not sure it makes sense
and then try to say why does it make

1222
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:16,539
and then try to say why does it make
 

1223
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:19,560
and then try to say why does it make
sense and then to triangulate with

1224
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:19,570
sense and then to triangulate with
 

1225
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,600
sense and then to triangulate with
others so if I'm having a discussion

1226
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:21,610
others so if I'm having a discussion
 

1227
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,060
others so if I'm having a discussion
like that and I work myself through and

1228
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,070
like that and I work myself through and
 

1229
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,649
like that and I work myself through and
I'm not sure then I have to do that in a

1230
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:28,659
I'm not sure then I have to do that in a
 

1231
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:31,139
I'm not sure then I have to do that in a
good way so I always give attention for

1232
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:31,149
good way so I always give attention for
 

1233
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:33,330
good way so I always give attention for
example what let's start off what does

1234
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:33,340
example what let's start off what does
 

1235
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,190
example what let's start off what does
the other person know relative to what I

1236
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,200
the other person know relative to what I
 

1237
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,159
the other person know relative to what I
know so if a person has a higher

1238
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:38,169
know so if a person has a higher
 

1239
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:40,500
know so if a person has a higher
expertise or things I'm much more

1240
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:40,510
expertise or things I'm much more
 

1241
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,450
expertise or things I'm much more
inclined to ask questions I'm always

1242
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:42,460
inclined to ask questions I'm always
 

1243
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,639
inclined to ask questions I'm always
asking questions if you want to learn

1244
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:44,649
asking questions if you want to learn
 

1245
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,799
asking questions if you want to learn
you're asking questions you're not

1246
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:46,809
you're asking questions you're not
 

1247
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:49,649
you're asking questions you're not
arguing okay you're taking in your

1248
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:49,659
arguing okay you're taking in your
 

1249
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,019
arguing okay you're taking in your
assessing when it comes in to you does

1250
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:52,029
assessing when it comes in to you does
 

1251
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,580
assessing when it comes in to you does
that make sense so you're learning

1252
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:53,590
that make sense so you're learning
 

1253
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,529
that make sense so you're learning
something are you getting epiphanies and

1254
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:55,539
something are you getting epiphanies and
 

1255
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:58,080
something are you getting epiphanies and
so on and I try to then do that if the

1256
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,090
so on and I try to then do that if the
 

1257
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,080
so on and I try to then do that if the
conversation it as we're trying to

1258
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,090
conversation it as we're trying to
 

1259
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,360
conversation it as we're trying to
decide what is true and we're trying to

1260
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,370
decide what is true and we're trying to
 

1261
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,370
decide what is true and we're trying to
do that together and we see truth

1262
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:05,380
do that together and we see truth
 

1263
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,799
do that together and we see truth
different then I might even call in

1264
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:07,809
different then I might even call in
 

1265
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,490
different then I might even call in
another really smart capable person and

1266
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:11,500
another really smart capable person and
 

1267
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,710
another really smart capable person and
try to say what is true and how do we

1268
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:13,720
try to say what is true and how do we
 

1269
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,110
try to say what is true and how do we
explore that together and you go through

1270
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,120
explore that together and you go through
 

1271
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,340
explore that together and you go through
that same thing so I would I said I

1272
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:19,350
that same thing so I would I said I
 

1273
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,260
that same thing so I would I said I
describe it as having open mindedness

1274
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:22,270
describe it as having open mindedness
 

1275
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,110
describe it as having open mindedness
and assertiveness at the same time that

1276
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
and assertiveness at the same time that
 

1277
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,060
and assertiveness at the same time that
you can simultaneous

1278
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,070
you can simultaneous
 

1279
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,509
you can simultaneous
be open-minded and taken with that

1280
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:29,519
be open-minded and taken with that
 

1281
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,430
be open-minded and taken with that
curiosity and then also be assertive and

1282
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:32,440
curiosity and then also be assertive and
 

1283
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,019
curiosity and then also be assertive and
say but that doesn't make sense why

1284
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:34,029
say but that doesn't make sense why
 

1285
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,330
say but that doesn't make sense why
would this be the case and you do that

would this be the case and you do that
back and forth and when you're doing

back and forth and when you're doing

that kind of back and forth on the topic
 

1291
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,779
that kind of back and forth on the topic

create valuable things people create the
latter is people borrowing from the

1350
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:00,610
latter is people borrowing from the
 

1351
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,700
latter is people borrowing from the
their future selves to hopefully create

their future selves to hopefully create
 

1353

those valuable things faster so this is
 

1355
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,350
those valuable things faster so this is
an incredible system to me

system that has so much credit so that's
 

1381
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,350
system that has so much credit so that's
a long way to ask

1382
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,360
a long way to ask
 

1383
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,530
a long way to ask
do you think credit is good or bad for

society that system of that's so

1386
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
society that system of that's so
 

1387
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,500
society that system of that's so
fundamentally based on credit I think

1388
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:49,510
fundamentally based on credit I think
 

1389
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,340
fundamentally based on credit I think
credit is great even though people often

1390

credit is great even though people often
 

1391
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,760
credit is great even though people often
overdo it the credit is that somebody

1392

overdo it the credit is that somebody
 

1393
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,260
overdo it the credit is that somebody
has earned money yeah and you know and

1394
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,270
has earned money yeah and you know and
 

1395
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,840
has earned money yeah and you know and
what happens is they lend it to somebody

1396
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:03,850
what happens is they lend it to somebody
 

1397
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,480
what happens is they lend it to somebody
else who's got better ideas and they cut

1398

1399
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,610
else who's got better ideas and they cut
a deal and then that person with the

1400
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:08,620
a deal and then that person with the
 

1401
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,710
a deal and then that person with the
better ideas is gonna pay it back and if

1402
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:10,720
better ideas is gonna pay it back and if
 

1403
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,010
better ideas is gonna pay it back and if
it works well it helps resource

1404
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,020
it works well it helps resource
 

1405
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,440
it works well it helps resource
allocations go well providing people

1406

luck like the entrepreneurs and all of

1408
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:18,670
luck like the entrepreneurs and all of
 

1409
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,310
luck like the entrepreneurs and all of
those they need capital

1410
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,320
those they need capital
 

1411
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,290
those they need capital
they don't have capital themselves and

1412
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:22,300
they don't have capital themselves and
 

1413
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,970
they don't have capital themselves and
so somebody's gonna give them capital

1414
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:23,980
so somebody's gonna give them capital
 

1415
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,290
so somebody's gonna give them capital
and they'll give them credit and along

1416
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:25,300
and they'll give them credit and along
 

1417
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,680
and they'll give them credit and along
those lines then what happens is it's

1418
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:28,690
those lines then what happens is it's
 

1419
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,980
those lines then what happens is it's
not managed well in a variety of ways so

1420
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:31,990
not managed well in a variety of ways so
 

1421
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,380
not managed well in a variety of ways so
I did a another book on principles

1422
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:34,390
I did a another book on principles
 

1423
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,690
I did a another book on principles
principles of big debt crisis that go

1424
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:36,700
principles of big debt crisis that go
 

1425
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,900
principles of big debt crisis that go
into that and it's free by the way I met

1426
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:39,910
into that and it's free by the way I met
 

1427
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:44,250
into that and it's free by the way I met
put it free online on as a PDF so if you

1428
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:44,260
put it free online on as a PDF so if you
 

1429
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,130
put it free online on as a PDF so if you
go online and you look principles for

1430
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,140
go online and you look principles for
 

1431
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,169
go online and you look principles for
big debt crisis is under my name you can

1432
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:49,179
big debt crisis is under my name you can
 

1433
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:51,570
big debt crisis is under my name you can
download it in a PDF or you can buy a

1434
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:51,580
download it in a PDF or you can buy a
 

1435
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,700
download it in a PDF or you can buy a
print book of it and it goes through

1436
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:53,710
print book of it and it goes through
 

1437
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,490
print book of it and it goes through
that particular process and so you

1438
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:56,500
that particular process and so you
 

1439
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,419
that particular process and so you
always have it over done in always the

1440
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:00,429
always have it over done in always the
 

1441
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:03,180
always have it over done in always the
same way everything by the way almost

1442
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,190
same way everything by the way almost
 

1443
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,740
same way everything by the way almost
everything happens over and over again

1444
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:04,750
everything happens over and over again
 

1445
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,620
everything happens over and over again
for the same reasons okay so these debt

1446
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:07,630
for the same reasons okay so these debt
 

1447
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,390
for the same reasons okay so these debt
crisis has all happen over and over

1448
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:09,400
crisis has all happen over and over
 

1449
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,549
crisis has all happen over and over
again for the same reasons they get it

1450
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:11,559
again for the same reasons they get it
 

1451
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,650
again for the same reasons they get it
over done in the book it explains how

1452
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:13,660
over done in the book it explains how
 

1453
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,299
over done in the book it explains how
you identify whether it's overdone or

1454
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:15,309
you identify whether it's overdone or
 

1455
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,120
you identify whether it's overdone or
not they get it overdone and then you go

1456
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,130
not they get it overdone and then you go
 

1457
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,860
not they get it overdone and then you go
through the process of making the

1458
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:19,870
through the process of making the
 

1459
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,200
through the process of making the
adjustments according that and then and

1460
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,210
adjustments according that and then and
 

1461
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,330
adjustments according that and then and
it explains how they can use the levers

1462
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:24,340
it explains how they can use the levers
 

1463
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,270
it explains how they can use the levers
and so on if you didn't have credit then

1464
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,280
and so on if you didn't have credit then
 

1465
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,760
and so on if you didn't have credit then
you would be sort of everybody sort of

1466
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:29,770
you would be sort of everybody sort of
 

1467
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:35,460
you would be sort of everybody sort of
be stuck so credit is a good thing but

1468
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:35,470
be stuck so credit is a good thing but
 

1469
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,799
be stuck so credit is a good thing but
it can easily be overdone so now we get

1470
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:37,809
it can easily be overdone so now we get
 

1471
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:40,080
it can easily be overdone so now we get
into the quote what is money what is

1472
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,090
into the quote what is money what is
 

1473
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,480
into the quote what is money what is
credit okay you get into money and

1474
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:42,490
credit okay you get into money and
 

1475
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,790
credit okay you get into money and
credit so if you're holding credit and

1476
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:44,800
credit so if you're holding credit and
 

1477
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,100
credit so if you're holding credit and
you think that's worthwhile keep in mind

1478
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,110
you think that's worthwhile keep in mind
 

1479
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,710
you think that's worthwhile keep in mind
that the central bank let's say it can

1480
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:49,720
that the central bank let's say it can
 

1481
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,240
that the central bank let's say it can
print the money what is that problem

1482
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,250
print the money what is that problem
 

1483
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,970
print the money what is that problem
they you have an IOU

1484
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:53,980
they you have an IOU
 

1485
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,590
they you have an IOU
the IOU says you're going to get a

1486
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:55,600
the IOU says you're going to get a
 

1487
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,110
the IOU says you're going to get a
certain number of dollars let's say or

1488
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,120
certain number of dollars let's say or
 

1489
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,919
certain number of dollars let's say or
yet nor euros and that is what the IOU

1490
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:01,929
yet nor euros and that is what the IOU
 

1491
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:04,560
yet nor euros and that is what the IOU
is and so the question is will you get

1492
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,570
is and so the question is will you get
 

1493
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,260
is and so the question is will you get
that money and and what will it be worth

1494
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,270
that money and and what will it be worth
 

1495
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,260
that money and and what will it be worth
and then also you have a government

1496
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,270
and then also you have a government
 

1497
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,419
and then also you have a government
which is a participant in that process

1498
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:12,429
which is a participant in that process
 

1499
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,789
which is a participant in that process
because they want they are on the hook

1500
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
because they want they are on the hook
 

1501
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,880
because they want they are on the hook
they old money and then will they print

1502
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:17,890
they old money and then will they print
 

1503
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,860
they old money and then will they print
the money to make it easy for everybody

1504
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:19,870
the money to make it easy for everybody
 

1505
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,260
the money to make it easy for everybody
to pay so you have to pay attention to

1506
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,270
to pay so you have to pay attention to
 

1507
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,659
to pay so you have to pay attention to
those two I would suggest like you you

1508
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:24,669
those two I would suggest like you you
 

1509
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:27,000
those two I would suggest like you you
recommend to other people just take that

1510
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,010
recommend to other people just take that
 

1511
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,150
recommend to other people just take that
30 minutes and it in it and it comes

1512
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:30,160
30 minutes and it in it and it comes
 

1513
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,610
30 minutes and it in it and it comes
across pretty clearly but my conclusion

1514
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:32,620
across pretty clearly but my conclusion
 

1515
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,970
across pretty clearly but my conclusion
is that of course you want it and even

1516
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:35,980
is that of course you want it and even
 

1517
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,330
is that of course you want it and even
if you understand it and the cycles well

1518
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:39,340
if you understand it and the cycles well
 

1519
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,450
if you understand it and the cycles well
you can benefit from those cycles rather

1520
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:42,460
you can benefit from those cycles rather
 

1521
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,720
you can benefit from those cycles rather
than to be hurt by those cycles because

1522
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:45,730
than to be hurt by those cycles because
 

1523
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,690
than to be hurt by those cycles because
I don't know the way the cycle works if

1524
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:48,700
I don't know the way the cycle works if
 

1525
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,850
I don't know the way the cycle works if
somebody gets over indebted they have to

1526
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:50,860
somebody gets over indebted they have to
 

1527
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,549
somebody gets over indebted they have to
sell an asset okay then I don't know me

1528
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:53,559
sell an asset okay then I don't know me
 

1529
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,890
sell an asset okay then I don't know me
that's when assets become cheaper how do

1530
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:55,900
that's when assets become cheaper how do
 

1531
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,840
that's when assets become cheaper how do
you acquire the asset it's a whole

1532
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:57,850
you acquire the asset it's a whole
 

1533
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,770
you acquire the asset it's a whole
process so again maybe another another

1534
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:01,780
process so again maybe another another
 

1535
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,289
process so again maybe another another
dumb question but there are no such

1536
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:04,299
dumb question but there are no such
 

1537
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:06,180
dumb question but there are no such
things as dumb questions okay there you

1538
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,190
things as dumb questions okay there you
 

1539
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:06,539
things as dumb questions okay there you
go

1540
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:06,549
go
 

1541
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:09,960
go
but what is money so you've mentioned

1542
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:09,970
but what is money so you've mentioned
 

1543
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:13,440
but what is money so you've mentioned
you know credit and money it's another

1544
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:13,450
you know credit and money it's another
 

1545
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,710
you know credit and money it's another
thing that if I just zoom out from an

1546
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
thing that if I just zoom out from an
 

1547
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,690
thing that if I just zoom out from an
alien perspective and look at human

1548
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:18,700
alien perspective and look at human
 

1549
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,430
alien perspective and look at human
civilization it's incredible that we've

1550
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:20,440
civilization it's incredible that we've
 

1551
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,409
civilization it's incredible that we've
created a thing that's not that only

1552
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:25,419
created a thing that's not that only
 

1553
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:28,320
created a thing that's not that only
works because currency because we all

1554
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,330
works because currency because we all
 

1555
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:33,539
works because currency because we all
agree it has value so I guess my

1556
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:33,549
agree it has value so I guess my
 

1557
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:36,299
agree it has value so I guess my
question is how do you think about money

1558
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:36,309
question is how do you think about money
 

1559
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:39,210
question is how do you think about money
as this emergent phenomenon and what do

1560
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:39,220
as this emergent phenomenon and what do
 

1561
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,850
as this emergent phenomenon and what do
you think is the future of money you've

1562
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:41,860
you think is the future of money you've
 

1563
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,610
you think is the future of money you've
come into that Bitcoin other forms what

1564
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:44,620
come into that Bitcoin other forms what
 

1565
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,419
come into that Bitcoin other forms what
do you think is its history and future

1566
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:48,429
do you think is its history and future
 

1567
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:51,630
do you think is its history and future
how do you think about money there are

1569
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,380
how do you think about money there are
two things that money is for it's a

1570
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:55,390
two things that money is for it's a
 

1571
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,350
two things that money is for it's a
medium of exchange and it's a store hold

1572
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:58,360
medium of exchange and it's a store hold
 

1573
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,350
medium of exchange and it's a store hold
of wealth yes that's that that some

1574
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
of wealth yes that's that that some
 

1575
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,320
of wealth yes that's that that some
money you know the so you could say

1576
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,330
money you know the so you could say
 

1577
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,539
money you know the so you could say
something's a medium of exchange

1578
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:06,549
something's a medium of exchange
 

1579
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,159
something's a medium of exchange
and then you could say is it a store

1580
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,169
and then you could say is it a store
 

1581
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:12,030
and then you could say is it a store
hold of wealth okay so those and money

1582
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,040
hold of wealth okay so those and money
 

1583
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,149
hold of wealth okay so those and money
is that vehicle that is those things and

1584
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:17,159
is that vehicle that is those things and
 

1585
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,149
is that vehicle that is those things and
can be used to pay off your debt so when

1586
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:21,159
can be used to pay off your debt so when
 

1587
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,169
can be used to pay off your debt so when
you have a debt and you provide it it

1588
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:25,179
you have a debt and you provide it it
 

1589
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,750
you have a debt and you provide it it
pays off your debt so that that's that

1590
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:27,760
pays off your debt so that that's that
 

1591
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,690
pays off your debt so that that's that
process and it's a I apologize to

1592
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:30,700
process and it's a I apologize to
 

1593
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,780
process and it's a I apologize to
interrupt but it only can be a medium of

1594
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:33,790
interrupt but it only can be a medium of
 

1595
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,790
interrupt but it only can be a medium of
exchange or store wealth when everybody

1596
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:35,800
exchange or store wealth when everybody
 

1597
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,099
exchange or store wealth when everybody
recognizes it to be a value that's right

1598
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:38,109
recognizes it to be a value that's right
 

1599
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,290
recognizes it to be a value that's right
right and so you see in the history and

1600
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:40,300
right and so you see in the history and
 

1601
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,730
right and so you see in the history and
you around the world and you go to

1602
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:41,740
you around the world and you go to
 

1603
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,320
you around the world and you go to
places I was in an island and the

1604
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,330
places I was in an island and the
 

1605
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:52,050
places I was in an island and the
Pacific in which they had as money these

1606
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,060
Pacific in which they had as money these
 

1607
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,500
Pacific in which they had as money these
big stones and literally they were

1608
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:55,510
big stones and literally they were
 

1609
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,890
big stones and literally they were
taking a boat this this big carved stone

1610
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:58,900
taking a boat this this big carved stone
 

1611
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,599
taking a boat this this big carved stone
and they were taking it from one of the

1612
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:00,609
and they were taking it from one of the
 

1613
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:03,480
and they were taking it from one of the
islands to the other and it sank the the

1614
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:03,490
islands to the other and it sank the the
 

1615
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,260
islands to the other and it sank the the
the piece of this big stone piece of

1616
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:07,270
the piece of this big stone piece of
 

1617
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,510
the piece of this big stone piece of
money that they had and it went to the

1618
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
money that they had and it went to the
 

1619
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,240
money that they had and it went to the
bottom and they still perceived it as

1620
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,250
bottom and they still perceived it as
 

1621
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,089
bottom and they still perceived it as
having value so that it was even though

1622
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:15,099
having value so that it was even though
 

1623
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:16,560
having value so that it was even though
it's in the bottom and it's this big

1624
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:16,570
it's in the bottom and it's this big
 

1625
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,780
it's in the bottom and it's this big
hunk of rock the fact that somebody

1626
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:18,790
hunk of rock the fact that somebody
 

1627
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,880
hunk of rock the fact that somebody
owned it they would say oh I'll loan it

1628
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:20,890
owned it they would say oh I'll loan it
 

1629
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,150
owned it they would say oh I'll loan it
for this and that I've seen beads in

1630
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,160
for this and that I've seen beads in
 

1631
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,150
for this and that I've seen beads in
different places shells converted to

1632
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,160
different places shells converted to
 

1633
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,220
different places shells converted to
this and mediums of exchange and when we

1634
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,230
this and mediums of exchange and when we
 

1635
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,620
this and mediums of exchange and when we
look at what we've got you're exactly

1636
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:31,630
look at what we've got you're exactly
 

1637
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,470
look at what we've got you're exactly
right it is the notion that if I give it

1638
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
right it is the notion that if I give it
 

1639
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,070
right it is the notion that if I give it
to you

1640
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,080
to you
 

1641
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,810
to you
I can then take it and I can buy

1642
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:36,820
I can then take it and I can buy
 

1643
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,240
I can then take it and I can buy
something with it and that's so it's a

1644
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,250
something with it and that's so it's a
 

1645
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,270
something with it and that's so it's a
matter of perception okay and then we go

1646
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:42,280
matter of perception okay and then we go
 

1647
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,820
matter of perception okay and then we go
through then the history of money and

1648
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:44,830
through then the history of money and
 

1649
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,329
through then the history of money and
the vulnerabilities of money and what we

1650
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:48,339
the vulnerabilities of money and what we
 

1651
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:51,000
the vulnerabilities of money and what we
have is there's through history there's

1652
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,010
have is there's through history there's
 

1653
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:54,359
have is there's through history there's
been two types of money those that are

1654
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:54,369
been two types of money those that are
 

1655
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:59,070
been two types of money those that are
claims on something of value like the

1656
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,080
claims on something of value like the
 

1657
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,310
claims on something of value like the
connection of to gold or something that

1658
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,320
connection of to gold or something that
 

1659
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,460
connection of to gold or something that
that would be an or they just are money

1660
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:05,470
that would be an or they just are money
 

1661
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,829
that would be an or they just are money
without any connection which and then we

1662
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:07,839
without any connection which and then we
 

1663
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,480
without any connection which and then we
have a system now which is a Fiat

1664
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:09,490
have a system now which is a Fiat
 

1665
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,089
have a system now which is a Fiat
monetary system so that's what money is

1666
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:12,099
monetary system so that's what money is
 

1667
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:17,160
monetary system so that's what money is
then it will last as long as its captive

1668
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,170
then it will last as long as its captive
 

1669
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,599
then it will last as long as its captive
value and it works the

1670
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:18,609
value and it works the
 

1671
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:22,349
value and it works the
way so let's say central banks when they

1672
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:22,359
way so let's say central banks when they
 

1673
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:24,569
way so let's say central banks when they
get in the position of like they owe a

1674
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:24,579
get in the position of like they owe a
 

1675
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:27,390
get in the position of like they owe a
lot of money like we have the in the

1676
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:27,400
lot of money like we have the in the
 

1677
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,089
lot of money like we have the in the
case it's increasingly the case and they

1678
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:30,099
case it's increasingly the case and they
 

1679
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:32,339
case it's increasingly the case and they
also another a bind and they have the

1680
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:32,349
also another a bind and they have the
 

1681
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:34,999
also another a bind and they have the
printing press to print the money and

1682
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:35,009
printing press to print the money and
 

1683
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:37,319
printing press to print the money and
get out of that and you have a lot of

1684
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:37,329
get out of that and you have a lot of
 

1685
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,569
get out of that and you have a lot of
people might be in that position then

1686
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:39,579
people might be in that position then
 

1687
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:41,549
people might be in that position then
you can print it and then it could be

1688
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:41,559
you can print it and then it could be
 

1689
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,970
you can print it and then it could be
devalued in there and so history is show

1690
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:44,980
devalued in there and so history is show
 

1691
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,460
devalued in there and so history is show
and forget about today history has shown

1692
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:47,470
and forget about today history has shown
 

1693
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:52,470
and forget about today history has shown
that no currency has laughs every

1694
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
that no currency has laughs every
 

1695
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,259
that no currency has laughs every
currency has either ended as being a

1696
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:55,269
currency has either ended as being a
 

1697
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:58,140
currency has either ended as being a
currency been or devalued as the

1698
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,150
currency been or devalued as the
 

1699
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,120
currency been or devalued as the
currency over periods of time long

1700
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,130
currency over periods of time long
 

1701
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,849
currency over periods of time long
periods of time so it evolved and it

1702
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:02,859
periods of time so it evolved and it
 

1703
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:05,069
periods of time so it evolved and it
changes but everybody needs that medium

1704
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:05,079
changes but everybody needs that medium
 

1705
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:07,289
changes but everybody needs that medium
of exchange and everybody needs that

1706
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:07,299
of exchange and everybody needs that
 

1707
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:09,390
of exchange and everybody needs that
store hold of wealth so it keeps

1708
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:09,400
store hold of wealth so it keeps
 

1709
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,940
store hold of wealth so it keeps
changing what is money over a period of

1710
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:11,950
changing what is money over a period of
 

1711
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,029
changing what is money over a period of
time but so much is being digitized

1712
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:15,039
time but so much is being digitized
 

1713
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,229
time but so much is being digitized
today and there's this ideas that based

1714
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:19,239
today and there's this ideas that based
 

1715
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,739
today and there's this ideas that based
on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on

1716
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:21,749
on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on
 

1717
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:25,859
on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on
so if all currencies like all empires

1718
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:25,869
so if all currencies like all empires
 

1719
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,489
so if all currencies like all empires
come to an end what do you think well do

1720
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:29,499
come to an end what do you think well do
 

1721
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:30,809
come to an end what do you think well do
you think something like Bitcoin might

1722
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:30,819
you think something like Bitcoin might
 

1723
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:34,979
you think something like Bitcoin might
emerge as as a common store value store

1724
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:34,989
emerge as as a common store value store
 

1725
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,950
emerge as as a common store value store
of wealth and a medium of exchange

1726
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:36,960
of wealth and a medium of exchange
 

1727
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,029
of wealth and a medium of exchange
the problem with Bitcoin is that it's

1728
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:42,039
the problem with Bitcoin is that it's
 

1729
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:45,239
the problem with Bitcoin is that it's
not a fact the medium exchange like it's

1730
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:45,249
not a fact the medium exchange like it's
 

1731
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,700
not a fact the medium exchange like it's
not easy for me to go in there and buy

1732
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:47,710
not easy for me to go in there and buy
 

1733
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,430
not easy for me to go in there and buy
things with it and then it's not an

1734
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:50,440
things with it and then it's not an
 

1735
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,890
things with it and then it's not an
effective store hold of value because it

1736
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:52,900
effective store hold of value because it
 

1737
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,079
effective store hold of value because it
has a volatility that's based on

1738
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:55,089
has a volatility that's based on
 

1739
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:57,779
has a volatility that's based on
speculation and the like so yeah it's

1740
00:37:57,779 --> 00:37:57,789
speculation and the like so yeah it's
 

1741
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:00,479
speculation and the like so yeah it's
not a very effective saving that's very

1742
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:00,489
not a very effective saving that's very
 

1743
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:03,839
not a very effective saving that's very
different from Facebook's prop of a

1744
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:03,849
different from Facebook's prop of a
 

1745
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,180
different from Facebook's prop of a
stable value currency which would be

1746
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,190
stable value currency which would be
 

1747
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,489
stable value currency which would be
effective as both a medium of exchange

1748
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:08,499
effective as both a medium of exchange
 

1749
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:11,609
effective as both a medium of exchange
and a store hold of wealth because if

1750
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:11,619
and a store hold of wealth because if
 

1751
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:13,680
and a store hold of wealth because if
you were to hold it and in the way it's

1752
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:13,690
you were to hold it and in the way it's
 

1753
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,960
you were to hold it and in the way it's
linked to number of things that it's

1754
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:15,970
linked to number of things that it's
 

1755
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,450
linked to number of things that it's
linked to would mean that it could be a

1756
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:18,460
linked to would mean that it could be a
 

1757
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,940
linked to would mean that it could be a
very effective store hold of wealth then

1758
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:20,950
very effective store hold of wealth then
 

1759
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,829
very effective store hold of wealth then
you have a digital currency that could

1760
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:22,839
you have a digital currency that could
 

1761
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:25,109
you have a digital currency that could
be a very effective medium exchange and

1762
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:25,119
be a very effective medium exchange and
 

1763
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,420
be a very effective medium exchange and
store hold of wealth that so in my

1764
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:27,430
store hold of wealth that so in my
 

1765
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,029
store hold of wealth that so in my
opinion some digital currencies are

1766
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:30,039
opinion some digital currencies are
 

1767
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,580
opinion some digital currencies are
likely to succeed more or

1768
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:32,590
likely to succeed more or
 

1769
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,580
likely to succeed more or
based on that ability to do it then the

1770
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:35,590
based on that ability to do it then the
 

1771
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,490
based on that ability to do it then the
question is what happens okay what

1772
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:38,500
question is what happens okay what
 

1773
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,190
question is what happens okay what
happens is two central banks allow that

1774
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200
happens is two central banks allow that
 

1775
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,240
happens is two central banks allow that
to happen

1776
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,250
to happen
 

1777
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,240
to happen
I really do believe it's possible to get

1778
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,250
I really do believe it's possible to get
 

1779
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,730
I really do believe it's possible to get
a better form of money that central

1780
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:47,740
a better form of money that central
 

1781
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,510
a better form of money that central
banks don't control okay a better force

1782
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:51,520
banks don't control okay a better force
 

1783
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,340
banks don't control okay a better force
of money that the central banks don't

1784
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:53,350
of money that the central banks don't
 

1785
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,330
of money that the central banks don't
control but then that's not yet happened

1786
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:57,340
control but then that's not yet happened
 

1787
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,330
control but then that's not yet happened
and we also have to and so they've got

1788
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:00,340
and we also have to and so they've got
 

1789
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,910
and we also have to and so they've got
to go through that evolutionary process

1790
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:02,920
to go through that evolutionary process
 

1791
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,040
to go through that evolutionary process
in order to go through that evolutionary

1792
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,050
in order to go through that evolutionary
 

1793
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,080
in order to go through that evolutionary
process first of all governments have

1794
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,090
process first of all governments have
 

1795
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,690
process first of all governments have
got to allow that to happen which is to

1796
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:09,700
got to allow that to happen which is to
 

1797
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,490
got to allow that to happen which is to
some extent a threat to them

1798
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:11,500
some extent a threat to them
 

1799
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,740
some extent a threat to them
in terms of their power and and that's

1800
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:13,750
in terms of their power and and that's
 

1801
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,110
in terms of their power and and that's
an issue and and then you have to also

1802
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,120
an issue and and then you have to also
 

1803
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,540
an issue and and then you have to also
build the confidence and all of the

1804
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,550
build the confidence and all of the
 

1805
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,020
build the confidence and all of the
components of it to say okay that's

1806
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,030
components of it to say okay that's
 

1807
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,810
components of it to say okay that's
going to be effective because I won't

1808
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:24,820
going to be effective because I won't
 

1809
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,200
going to be effective because I won't
get in I won't have problems owning it

1810
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,210
get in I won't have problems owning it
 

1811
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,170
get in I won't have problems owning it
so I think that digital currencies have

1812
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:31,180
so I think that digital currencies have
 

1813
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,340
so I think that digital currencies have
a have some element of potential but

1814
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:35,350
a have some element of potential but
 

1815
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,130
a have some element of potential but
there's a lot of hurdles that are going

1816
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:38,140
there's a lot of hurdles that are going
 

1817
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,500
there's a lot of hurdles that are going
to have to be gotten over I think that

1818
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:40,510
to have to be gotten over I think that
 

1819
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,710
to have to be gotten over I think that
it'll be a very long time possibly never

1820
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:43,720
it'll be a very long time possibly never
 

1821
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,740
it'll be a very long time possibly never
but anyway a very long time before we

1822
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:46,750
but anyway a very long time before we
 

1823
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,690
but anyway a very long time before we
have that let's say get into a position

1824
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:48,700
have that let's say get into a position
 

1825
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,860
have that let's say get into a position
that would be you know effective means

1826
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:52,870
that would be you know effective means
 

1827
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,470
that would be you know effective means
relative to gold let's say if you were

1828
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:55,480
relative to gold let's say if you were
 

1829
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,170
relative to gold let's say if you were
think of that because gold has a track

1830
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:58,180
think of that because gold has a track
 

1831
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,480
think of that because gold has a track
record you know of thousands of years

1832
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:00,490
record you know of thousands of years
 

1833
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,390
record you know of thousands of years
okay Unum all across countries and it

1834
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:03,400
okay Unum all across countries and it
 

1835
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,760
okay Unum all across countries and it
has its mobility it has the ability to

1836
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:05,770
has its mobility it has the ability to
 

1837
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,440
has its mobility it has the ability to
put it down and has certain abilities

1838
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:07,450
put it down and has certain abilities
 

1839
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,080
put it down and has certain abilities
it's got disadvantages relative to

1840
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,090
it's got disadvantages relative to
 

1841
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,470
it's got disadvantages relative to
digital currencies but but central banks

1842
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:13,480
digital currencies but but central banks
 

1843
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,090
digital currencies but but central banks
will hold it like their central banks

1844
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:15,100
will hold it like their central banks
 

1845
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,240
will hold it like their central banks
that worry about others you know the

1846
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,250
that worry about others you know the
 

1847
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,070
that worry about others you know the
other country central banks might worry

1848
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,080
other country central banks might worry
 

1849
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,780
other country central banks might worry
about whether the US dollar is going to

1850
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:21,790
about whether the US dollar is going to
 

1851
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,940
about whether the US dollar is going to
print or not in that and so the thing

1852
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:23,950
print or not in that and so the thing
 

1853
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,440
print or not in that and so the thing
they're going to go to is not going to

1854
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:25,450
they're going to go to is not going to
 

1855
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,300
they're going to go to is not going to
be the digital currency thing they're

1856
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,310
be the digital currency thing they're
 

1857
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,330
be the digital currency thing they're
going to go to is is gold or something

1858
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:30,340
going to go to is is gold or something
 

1859
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,830
going to go to is is gold or something
else some other currency they got a

1860
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:31,840
else some other currency they got a
 

1861
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,410
else some other currency they got a
ticket and so I think it's a long way to

1862
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:34,420
ticket and so I think it's a long way to
 

1863
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,780
ticket and so I think it's a long way to
go well you think it's possible then one

1864
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:36,790
go well you think it's possible then one
 

1865
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,520
go well you think it's possible then one
day we don't even have a central bank

1866
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:38,530
day we don't even have a central bank
 

1867
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,700
day we don't even have a central bank
because of the

1868
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:40,710
because of the
 

1869
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,329
because of the
a currency that doesn't that's cannot be

1870
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:44,339
a currency that doesn't that's cannot be
 

1871
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,760
a currency that doesn't that's cannot be
controlled by the central bank is the

1872
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:46,770
controlled by the central bank is the
 

1873
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:52,880
controlled by the central bank is the
primary currency or is that some very it

1874
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:52,890
primary currency or is that some very it
 

1875
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:58,819
primary currency or is that some very it
would be very remote possibility or very

1876

00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:02,270
would be very remote possibility or very
long in the future got it again may be a

00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:02,280
long in the future got it again may be a
 

1879
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,309
long in the future got it again may be a
dumb question but romanticize one when

1880
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:04,319
dumb question but romanticize one when
 

1881
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,740
dumb question but romanticize one when
you sit back and you look you describe

1882
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:06,750
you sit back and you look you describe
 

1883
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,220
you sit back and you look you describe
these transactions between individuals

1884
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,230
these transactions between individuals
 

1885
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:13,760
these transactions between individuals
somehow creating short term debt cycles

1886
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:13,770
somehow creating short term debt cycles
 

1887
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,069
somehow creating short term debt cycles
long-term debt cycles this productivity

1888
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:16,079
long-term debt cycles this productivity
 

1889
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,730
long-term debt cycles this productivity
growth does it amaze you that this whole

1890
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:19,740
growth does it amaze you that this whole
 

1891
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:24,559
growth does it amaze you that this whole
thing works that that there's however

1892
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:24,569
thing works that that there's however
 

1893
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:26,540
thing works that that there's however
many millions and millions of people in

1894
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:26,550
many millions and millions of people in
 

1895
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,880
many millions and millions of people in
the United States globally over seven

1896
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:28,890
the United States globally over seven
 

1897
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,040
the United States globally over seven
billion people that this thing between

1898
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,050
billion people that this thing between
 

1899
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:35,660
billion people that this thing between
individual transactions it just it works

1900
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:35,670
individual transactions it just it works
 

1901
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:40,549
individual transactions it just it works
yeah it amazes me like I go I go back

1902
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:40,559
yeah it amazes me like I go I go back
 

1903
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,760
yeah it amazes me like I go I go back
and forth between being in it and then I

1904
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:43,770
and forth between being in it and then I
 

1905
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:48,049
and forth between being in it and then I
think like how does a credit card that

1906
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:48,059
think like how does a credit card that
 

1907
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:49,609
think like how does a credit card that
is that really possible

1908
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:49,619
is that really possible
 

1909
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,289
is that really possible
I'm still used to I look up credit card

1910
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:51,299
I'm still used to I look up credit card
 

1911
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:53,780
I'm still used to I look up credit card
and I put it on the guy doesn't know me

1912
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:53,790
and I put it on the guy doesn't know me
 

1913
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,470
and I put it on the guy doesn't know me
yeah it'll streamlines okay we're making

1914
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:57,480
yeah it'll streamlines okay we're making
 

1915
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,210
yeah it'll streamlines okay we're making
the digital entries is that really

1916
00:41:59,210 --> 00:41:59,220
the digital entries is that really
 

1917
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,950
the digital entries is that really
secure enough and that that kind of

1918
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
secure enough and that that kind of
 

1919
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,720
secure enough and that that kind of
thing and then it goes back and it goes

1920
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:02,730
thing and then it goes back and it goes
 

1921
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,059
thing and then it goes back and it goes
this and it clears and it all happens

1922
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:05,069
this and it clears and it all happens
 

1923
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:08,450
this and it clears and it all happens
and it what I marvel at that and those

1924
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:08,460
and it what I marvel at that and those
 

1925
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,710
and it what I marvel at that and those
types of things is because of the the

1926
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:11,720
types of things is because of the the
 

1927
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,900
types of things is because of the the
capacity of the human mind to create

1928
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:14,910
capacity of the human mind to create
 

1929
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,210
capacity of the human mind to create
abstractions that are true you know it's

1930
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:19,220
abstractions that are true you know it's
 

1931
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,460
abstractions that are true you know it's
imagination and then the ability to go

1932
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:22,470
imagination and then the ability to go
 

1933
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,530
imagination and then the ability to go
from one level and then if these things

1934
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:24,540
from one level and then if these things
 

1935
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,020
from one level and then if these things
are true then you go to the next level

1936
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,030
are true then you go to the next level
 

1937
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,240
are true then you go to the next level
and if those things are true then you go

1938
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,250
and if those things are true then you go
 

1939
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,190
and if those things are true then you go
to the next level and all those miracles

1940
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,200
to the next level and all those miracles
 

1941
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,039
to the next level and all those miracles
that we almost become common it's like

1942
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:34,049
that we almost become common it's like
 

1943
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:37,099
that we almost become common it's like
it when I'm flying in a plane or what

1944
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:37,109
it when I'm flying in a plane or what
 

1945
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:38,809
it when I'm flying in a plane or what
I'm looking at all of the things that

1946
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:38,819
I'm looking at all of the things that
 

1947
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:41,450
I'm looking at all of the things that
happen when I get communications in the

1948
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:41,460
happen when I get communications in the
 

1949
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,910
happen when I get communications in the
middle of I don't know Africa or

1950
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:43,920
middle of I don't know Africa or
 

1951
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,490
middle of I don't know Africa or
Antarctica and we're communicating in

1952
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:46,500
Antarctica and we're communicating in
 

1953
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,609
Antarctica and we're communicating in
the ways where I see the face on my iPad

1954
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:49,619
the ways where I see the face on my iPad
 

1955
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:52,160
the ways where I see the face on my iPad
of somebody my grandkid in someplace

1956
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,170
of somebody my grandkid in someplace
 

1957
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,260
of somebody my grandkid in someplace
else and I look at

1958
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,270
else and I look at
 

1959
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,360
else and I look at
and I say wow yes it all amazes me

1960
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:57,370
and I say wow yes it all amazes me
 

1961
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,670
and I say wow yes it all amazes me
so while being amazing do you have a

1962
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:00,680
so while being amazing do you have a
 

1963
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,010
so while being amazing do you have a
sense the principles you describe that

1964
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,020
sense the principles you describe that
 

1965
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,440
sense the principles you describe that
the whole thing is stable somehow also

1966
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:05,450
the whole thing is stable somehow also
 

1967
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,970
the whole thing is stable somehow also
or is this I was just lucky so the the

1968
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:09,980
or is this I was just lucky so the the
 

1969
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,860
or is this I was just lucky so the the
principles that you describe are those

1970
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:11,870
principles that you describe are those
 

1971
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:16,120
principles that you describe are those
describing a system that is stable

1972
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,130
describing a system that is stable
 

1973
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,600
describing a system that is stable
robust and will remain so or is it a

1974
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:19,610
robust and will remain so or is it a
 

1975
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,140
robust and will remain so or is it a
lucky accident of our early history my

1976
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,150
lucky accident of our early history my
 

1977
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,510
lucky accident of our early history my
area of expertise is economics and

1978
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
area of expertise is economics and
 

1979
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,400
area of expertise is economics and
market so I get down to it like a real

1980
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:27,410
market so I get down to it like a real
 

1981
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,740
market so I get down to it like a real
nitty-gritty yes I can tell you whether

1982
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:29,750
nitty-gritty yes I can tell you whether
 

1983
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,270
nitty-gritty yes I can tell you whether
the plane is going to fall out of the

1984
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
the plane is going to fall out of the
 

1985
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,540
the plane is going to fall out of the
sky yes because of its particular

1986
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:33,550
sky yes because of its particular
 

1987
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,890
sky yes because of its particular
fundamentals I don't know enough about

1988
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:35,900
fundamentals I don't know enough about
 

1989
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,720
fundamentals I don't know enough about
that but it happens over and over again

1990
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:37,730
that but it happens over and over again
 

1991
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,760
that but it happens over and over again
and so on it gives me faith ok so

1992
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:39,770
and so on it gives me faith ok so
 

1993
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,520
and so on it gives me faith ok so
without me knowing it in the markets and

1994
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:42,530
without me knowing it in the markets and
 

1995
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,220
without me knowing it in the markets and
the economy I know those things quote

1996
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:45,230
the economy I know those things quote
 

1997
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,940
the economy I know those things quote
well enough in a sense to say that by

1998
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:48,950
well enough in a sense to say that by
 

1999
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:53,800
well enough in a sense to say that by
and large that structure is right what

2000
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:53,810
and large that structure is right what
 

2001
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,050
and large that structure is right what
we're seeing is right now whether there

2002
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:56,060
we're seeing is right now whether there
 

2003
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,160
we're seeing is right now whether there
are disruptions and it has effects that

2004
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,170
are disruptions and it has effects that
 

2005
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,650
are disruptions and it has effects that
can come not because that structure is

2006
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:02,660
can come not because that structure is
 

2007
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,180
can come not because that structure is
right I believe that's right

2008
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:04,190
right I believe that's right
 

2009
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:08,070
right I believe that's right
but whether it can be hurt by let's say

2010
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:08,080
but whether it can be hurt by let's say
 

2011
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,320
but whether it can be hurt by let's say
connectivity or journal entries they

2012
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,330
connectivity or journal entries they
 

2013
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:13,090
connectivity or journal entries they
could take from all the money away from

2014
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:13,100
could take from all the money away from
 

2015
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,550
could take from all the money away from
you through your digital entries there's

2016
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:15,560
you through your digital entries there's
 

2017
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,650
you through your digital entries there's
all sorts of things that can happen in

2018
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:17,660
all sorts of things that can happen in
 

2019
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,560
all sorts of things that can happen in
various ways that means that that money

2020
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:20,570
various ways that means that that money
 

2021
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,740
various ways that means that that money
is worthless or the system Falls but

2022
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:23,750
is worthless or the system Falls but
 

2023
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,930
is worthless or the system Falls but
from what I see in terms of its basic

2024
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:25,940
from what I see in terms of its basic
 

2025
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,360
from what I see in terms of its basic
structure and those complexities that

2026
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:28,370
structure and those complexities that
 

2027
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,820
structure and those complexities that
still take my breath away I would say

2028
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:30,830
still take my breath away I would say
 

2029
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,010
still take my breath away I would say
knowing them enough about the mechanics

2030
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:33,020
knowing them enough about the mechanics
 

2031
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,570
knowing them enough about the mechanics
of them that doesn't worry me

2032
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:34,580
of them that doesn't worry me
 

2033
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,490
of them that doesn't worry me
have you seen disruptions in your

2034
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:36,500
have you seen disruptions in your
 

2035
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,380
have you seen disruptions in your
lifetime that really surprised you most

2036
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:38,390
lifetime that really surprised you most
 

2037
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,540
lifetime that really surprised you most
all the time this is one of the great

2038
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:40,550
all the time this is one of the great
 

2039
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,920
all the time this is one of the great
lessons of my life is that there many

2040
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,930
lessons of my life is that there many
 

2041
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:48,610
lessons of my life is that there many
times I've seen things that I was very

2042
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:48,620
times I've seen things that I was very
 

2043
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,170
times I've seen things that I was very
surprised about and that I realized

2044
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:52,180
surprised about and that I realized
 

2045
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,600
surprised about and that I realized
almost all of those I was surprised

2046
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:55,610
almost all of those I was surprised
 

2047
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,120
almost all of those I was surprised
about because they just they were just

2048
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:58,130
about because they just they were just
 

2049
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,370
about because they just they were just
the first time it happened to me they

2050
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:00,380
the first time it happened to me they
 

2051
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,770
the first time it happened to me they
didn't happen in my lifetime before but

2052
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:02,780
didn't happen in my lifetime before but
 

2053
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,470
didn't happen in my lifetime before but
when I researched them they happened in

2054
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:05,480
when I researched them they happened in
 

2055
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,099
when I researched them they happened in
other places or other people

2056
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:07,109
other places or other people
 

2057
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:11,959
other places or other people
lifetimes so for example I remember 1971

2058
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:11,969
lifetimes so for example I remember 1971
 

2059
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:14,420
lifetimes so for example I remember 1971
the dollar there was no such thing as a

2060
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:14,430
the dollar there was no such thing as a
 

2061
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,059
the dollar there was no such thing as a
devaluation of a currency didn't

2062
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:17,069
devaluation of a currency didn't
 

2063
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:19,729
devaluation of a currency didn't
experience it and with the dollar was

2064
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:19,739
experience it and with the dollar was
 

2065
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:21,890
experience it and with the dollar was
connected to gold and I was watching

2066
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:21,900
connected to gold and I was watching
 

2067
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,140
connected to gold and I was watching
events happen and then you get on and

2068
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:24,150
events happen and then you get on and
 

2069
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,719
events happen and then you get on and
and he's that definition of money all of

2070
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:26,729
and he's that definition of money all of
 

2071
00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:29,509
and he's that definition of money all of
a sudden went out the window because it

2072
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:29,519
a sudden went out the window because it
 

2073
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,920
a sudden went out the window because it
was not tied to gold

2074
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:30,930
was not tied to gold
 

2075
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,039
was not tied to gold
and then you have this devaluation and

2076
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:34,049
and then you have this devaluation and
 

2077
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:37,190
and then you have this devaluation and
so and then or the first oil shock or

2078
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
so and then or the first oil shock or
 

2079
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,190
so and then or the first oil shock or
the second oil shot or so many of these

2080
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:40,200
the second oil shot or so many of these
 

2081
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,109
the second oil shot or so many of these
things and when I but almost always I

2082
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:44,119
things and when I but almost always I
 

2083
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,930
things and when I but almost always I
realized that they when I looked in

2084
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:47,940
realized that they when I looked in
 

2085
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,449
realized that they when I looked in
history they happened before they just

2086
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:50,459
history they happened before they just
 

2087
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:52,209
history they happened before they just
happened in other people's lifetimes

2088
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:52,219
happened in other people's lifetimes
 

2089
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:56,299
happened in other people's lifetimes
which led me to realize that I needed to

2090
00:45:56,299 --> 00:45:56,309
which led me to realize that I needed to
 

2091
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:59,539
which led me to realize that I needed to
study history and what happened in other

2092
00:45:59,539 --> 00:45:59,549
study history and what happened in other
 

2093
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:01,579
study history and what happened in other
people's lifetimes and what happened in

2094
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:01,589
people's lifetimes and what happened in
 

2095
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:04,519
people's lifetimes and what happened in
other countries and places so that I

2096
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:04,529
other countries and places so that I
 

2097
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,339
other countries and places so that I
would have timeless and universal

2098
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:06,349
would have timeless and universal
 

2099
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:09,229
would have timeless and universal
principles for dealing with that thing

2100
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:09,239
principles for dealing with that thing
 

2101
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:12,079
principles for dealing with that thing
so I oh yeah I've been some you know the

2102
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:12,089
so I oh yeah I've been some you know the
 

2103
00:46:12,089 --> 00:46:14,329
so I oh yeah I've been some you know the
implausible happening but it's like a

2104
00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:14,339
implausible happening but it's like a
 

2105
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:18,739
implausible happening but it's like a
one in a hundred year storm right okay

2106
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:18,749
one in a hundred year storm right okay
 

2107
00:46:18,749 --> 00:46:22,339
one in a hundred year storm right okay
or it's or they've happened before yeah

2108
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:22,349
or it's or they've happened before yeah
 

2109
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,829
or it's or they've happened before yeah
nothing just not to you let me talk

2110
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:24,839
nothing just not to you let me talk
 

2111
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:27,769
nothing just not to you let me talk
about if we could about AI a little bit

2112
00:46:27,769 --> 00:46:27,779
about if we could about AI a little bit
 

2113
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:32,329
about if we could about AI a little bit
so if Bridgewater associates manage

2114
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:32,339
so if Bridgewater associates manage
 

2115
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:35,809
so if Bridgewater associates manage
about a hundred sixty billion dollars in

2116
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:35,819
about a hundred sixty billion dollars in
 

2117
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:39,829
about a hundred sixty billion dollars in
assets and our artificial intelligence

2118
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:39,839
assets and our artificial intelligence
 

2119
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,140
assets and our artificial intelligence
systems algorithms are pretty good with

2120
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:42,150
systems algorithms are pretty good with
 

2121
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:47,779
systems algorithms are pretty good with
data what role in the future DC AI play

2122
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:47,789
data what role in the future DC AI play
 

2123
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:50,569
data what role in the future DC AI play
in analysis and decision making in this

2124
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:50,579
in analysis and decision making in this
 

2125
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:55,160
in analysis and decision making in this
kind of data rich an impactful area of

2126
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,170
kind of data rich an impactful area of
 

2127
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,789
kind of data rich an impactful area of
investment I'm gonna answer that not

2128
00:46:58,789 --> 00:46:58,799
investment I'm gonna answer that not
 

2129
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:00,920
investment I'm gonna answer that not
only an investment but I give them more

2130
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:00,930
only an investment but I give them more
 

2131
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:07,069
only an investment but I give them more
all encompassing rule for AI as I think

2132
00:47:07,069 --> 00:47:07,079
all encompassing rule for AI as I think
 

2133
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,930
all encompassing rule for AI as I think
you know for the last 25 years we have

2134
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:11,940
you know for the last 25 years we have
 

2135
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,529
you know for the last 25 years we have
taken our thinking and put them in

2136
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:14,539
taken our thinking and put them in
 

2137
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:17,180
taken our thinking and put them in
algorithms and so we make decisions that

2138
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,190
algorithms and so we make decisions that
 

2139
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,330
algorithms and so we make decisions that
the computer takes those

2140
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:20,340
the computer takes those
 

2141
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,700
the computer takes those
criteria algorithms and they put them

2142
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:22,710
criteria algorithms and they put them
 

2143
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,740
criteria algorithms and they put them
and they're in there and it takes data

2144
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:24,750
and they're in there and it takes data
 

2145
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,920
and they're in there and it takes data
and they operate as an independent

2146
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:27,930
and they operate as an independent
 

2147
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,320
and they operate as an independent
decision-maker power in parallel with

2148
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:30,330
decision-maker power in parallel with
 

2149
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:32,510
decision-maker power in parallel with
our decision-making so for me it's like

2150
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:32,520
our decision-making so for me it's like
 

2151
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,660
our decision-making so for me it's like
there's a chess game playing and on

2152
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:35,670
there's a chess game playing and on
 

2153
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,960
there's a chess game playing and on
person with my chess game and I'm saying

2154
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:38,970
person with my chess game and I'm saying
 

2155
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,580
person with my chess game and I'm saying
it made that move and I'm making the

2156
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:40,590
it made that move and I'm making the
 

2157
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,410
it made that move and I'm making the
move and how do I compare those two

2158
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:42,420
move and how do I compare those two
 

2159
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,240
move and how do I compare those two
moves so so we've done a lot but let me

2160
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:44,250
moves so so we've done a lot but let me
 

2161
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,960
moves so so we've done a lot but let me
give you an if the future can be

2162
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:47,970
give you an if the future can be
 

2163
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:53,060
give you an if the future can be
different from the past and you don't

2164
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,070
different from the past and you don't
 

2165
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,500
different from the past and you don't
have deep understanding you should not

2166
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:57,510
have deep understanding you should not
 

2167
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:03,410
have deep understanding you should not
rely on AI okay those two things deep

2168
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:03,420
rely on AI okay those two things deep
 

2169
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,980
rely on AI okay those two things deep
understanding of the cause-effect

2170
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:05,990
understanding of the cause-effect
 

2171
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,970
understanding of the cause-effect
relationships that are leading you to

2172
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:07,980
relationships that are leading you to
 

2173
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,480
relationships that are leading you to
place that bet in anything okay anything

2174
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:11,490
place that bet in anything okay anything
 

2175
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,700
place that bet in anything okay anything
important let's say if it was do

2176
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:13,710
important let's say if it was do
 

2177
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,980
important let's say if it was do
surgeries and you would say how do I do

2178
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:15,990
surgeries and you would say how do I do
 

2179
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,860
surgeries and you would say how do I do
surgeries I think it's totally fine to

2180
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:18,870
surgeries I think it's totally fine to
 

2181
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,500
surgeries I think it's totally fine to
watch all the doctors do the surgeries

2182
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:21,510
watch all the doctors do the surgeries
 

2183
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:26,000
watch all the doctors do the surgeries
you can put it on I take a a digital

2184
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,010
you can put it on I take a a digital
 

2185
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:29,590
you can put it on I take a a digital
camera and do that convert that into AI

2186
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:29,600
camera and do that convert that into AI
 

2187
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,920
camera and do that convert that into AI
algorithms that go to robots and have

2188
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:33,930
algorithms that go to robots and have
 

2189
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,930
algorithms that go to robots and have
them do surgeries and I'd be comfortable

2190
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:35,940
them do surgeries and I'd be comfortable
 

2191
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,600
them do surgeries and I'd be comfortable
with that because if it'll do that if

2192
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:38,610
with that because if it'll do that if
 

2193
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,310
with that because if it'll do that if
the keeps doing the same thing over and

2194
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:40,320
the keeps doing the same thing over and
 

2195
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,020
the keeps doing the same thing over and
over again and you have enough of that

2196
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,030
over again and you have enough of that
 

2197
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,840
over again and you have enough of that
that would be fine even though you may

2198
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:44,850
that would be fine even though you may
 

2199
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:47,090
that would be fine even though you may
not understand the algorithms because

2200
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:47,100
not understand the algorithms because
 

2201
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,890
not understand the algorithms because
you're if the things happening over and

2202
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:48,900
you're if the things happening over and
 

2203
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,480
you're if the things happening over and
over again and you're not asking the

2204
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:50,490
over again and you're not asking the
 

2205
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,100
over again and you're not asking the
future would be the same that

2206
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:52,110
future would be the same that
 

2207
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,530
future would be the same that
appendicitis or whatever it is will be

2208
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:54,540
appendicitis or whatever it is will be
 

2209
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,510
appendicitis or whatever it is will be
handled the same way the surgery that's

2210
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:56,520
handled the same way the surgery that's
 

2211
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,790
handled the same way the surgery that's
fine however what happens with AI is for

2212
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:01,800
fine however what happens with AI is for
 

2213
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,640
fine however what happens with AI is for
the most part is it takes a lot of data

2214
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:04,650
the most part is it takes a lot of data
 

2215
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,690
the most part is it takes a lot of data
and it with a high enough sample size

2216
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:08,700
and it with a high enough sample size
 

2217
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,600
and it with a high enough sample size
and then it puts together its own

2218
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:11,610
and then it puts together its own
 

2219
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,270
and then it puts together its own
algorithms okay there are two ways you

2220
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:14,280
algorithms okay there are two ways you
 

2221
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,550
algorithms okay there are two ways you
can come up with algorithms you can

2222
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:16,560
can come up with algorithms you can
 

2223
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,980
can come up with algorithms you can
either take your thinking and express

2224
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:18,990
either take your thinking and express
 

2225
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:22,340
either take your thinking and express
them in algorithms or you can say let

2226
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:22,350
them in algorithms or you can say let
 

2227
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,710
them in algorithms or you can say let
put the data in and say what is the

2228
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:24,720
put the data in and say what is the
 

2229
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,960
put the data in and say what is the
algorithm when you that's machine

2230
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:26,970
algorithm when you that's machine
 

2231
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,880
algorithm when you that's machine
learning yeah and when you have machine

2232
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:28,890
learning yeah and when you have machine
 

2233
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:32,270
learning yeah and when you have machine
learning it'll give you equations which

2234
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:32,280
learning it'll give you equations which
 

2235
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,860
learning it'll give you equations which
quite often are not

2236
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:33,870
quite often are not
 

2237
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,260
quite often are not
understandable you would try to say okay

2238
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,270
understandable you would try to say okay
 

2239
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,510
understandable you would try to say okay
now describe what it's telling you it's

2240
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:38,520
now describe what it's telling you it's
 

2241
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,730
now describe what it's telling you it's
very difficult to describe and so they

2242
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:40,740
very difficult to describe and so they
 

2243
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,430
very difficult to describe and so they
can escape understanding and so it's

2244
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:43,440
can escape understanding and so it's
 

2245
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,280
can escape understanding and so it's
very good for doing those things that

2246
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,290
very good for doing those things that
 

2247
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:48,020
very good for doing those things that
could be done over and over again if

2248
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,030
could be done over and over again if
 

2249
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,220
could be done over and over again if
you're watching and you're not taking

2250
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:49,230
you're watching and you're not taking
 

2251
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,710
you're watching and you're not taking
that but if the future is different from

2252
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:51,720
that but if the future is different from
 

2253
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,470
that but if the future is different from
the past and you have that then you're

2254
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
the past and you have that then you're
 

2255
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,780
the past and you have that then you're
at the future is different from the past

2256
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:56,790
at the future is different from the past
 

2257
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,270
at the future is different from the past
and you don't have deep understanding

2258
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:58,280
and you don't have deep understanding
 

2259
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,410
and you don't have deep understanding
you're going to get in trouble

2260
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:00,420
you're going to get in trouble
 

2261
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,530
you're going to get in trouble
and so that's the main thing as far as

2262
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:03,540
and so that's the main thing as far as
 

2263
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,940
and so that's the main thing as far as
AI is concerned ai and I'd say computer

2264
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:07,950
AI is concerned ai and I'd say computer
 

2265
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,770
AI is concerned ai and I'd say computer
replications of thinking in very ways I

2266
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:09,780
replications of thinking in very ways I
 

2267
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,690
replications of thinking in very ways I
think it's particularly good for

2268
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:11,700
think it's particularly good for
 

2269
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,560
think it's particularly good for
processing but but the the notion of

2270
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,570
processing but but the the notion of
 

2271
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:20,360
processing but but the the notion of
what you want to do is better most of

2272
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:20,370
what you want to do is better most of
 

2273
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:22,340
what you want to do is better most of
the time determined by the human mind

2274
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:22,350
the time determined by the human mind
 

2275
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:25,220
the time determined by the human mind
that what are the principles like okay

2276
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,230
that what are the principles like okay
 

2277
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,680
that what are the principles like okay
how should I raise my children it's

2278
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:27,690
how should I raise my children it's
 

2279
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,110
how should I raise my children it's
gonna be a long time before AI you're

2280
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:30,120
gonna be a long time before AI you're
 

2281
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,000
gonna be a long time before AI you're
going to say it has a good enough

2282
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,010
going to say it has a good enough

00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:33,770
going to say it has a good enough
judgment to do that who should I marry

00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,320
judgment to do that who should I marry
on all of those things maybe you can get

2286
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:36,330
on all of those things maybe you can get
 

2287
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,210
on all of those things maybe you can get
the computer to help you but if you just

2288
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:38,220
the computer to help you but if you just
 

2289
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,220
the computer to help you but if you just
took data and do machine learning it's

2290
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:40,230
took data and do machine learning it's
 

2291
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:42,230
took data and do machine learning it's
not going to find it if you were to then

2292
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:42,240
not going to find it if you were to then
 

2293
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,400
not going to find it if you were to then
take one of my criteria for any of those

2294
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:46,410
take one of my criteria for any of those
 

2295
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,130
take one of my criteria for any of those
questions and then say put them into an

2296
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:49,140
questions and then say put them into an
 

2297
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,870
questions and then say put them into an
algorithm and you'd be a lot better off

2298
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:50,880
algorithm and you'd be a lot better off
 

2299
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,870
algorithm and you'd be a lot better off
than if you took AI to do it but by and

2300
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:53,880
than if you took AI to do it but by and
 

2301
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,170
than if you took AI to do it but by and
large the mind should be do used for

large the mind should be do used for
 

2303
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,230
large the mind should be do used for

00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
inventing and those creative things and
 

2305
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,950
inventing and those creative things and
then the computer should be used for

2306
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
then the computer should be used for
 

2307
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,180
then the computer should be used for
processing because it could process a

2308
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:05,190
processing because it could process a
 

2309
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:09,020
processing because it could process a
lot more information a lot faster a lot

it'll be an Android it'll be in a few
 

2403
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,930
it'll be an Android it'll be in a few
months it'll be on an awesome but it has

00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:29,940
months it'll be on an awesome but it has
 

2405
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,230
months it'll be on an awesome but it has
an app in there that helps people write

2406
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:33,240
an app in there that helps people write
 

2407
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,480
an app in there that helps people write
down their own principles because this

2408
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:35,490
down their own principles because this
 

2409
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:37,940
down their own principles because this
is very powerful so when you're in that

2410
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:37,950
is very powerful so when you're in that
 

2411
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,090
is very powerful so when you're in that
moment where you've just you're thinking

00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:41,100
moment where you've just you're thinking
 

2413
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,200
moment where you've just you're thinking
about it and you're thinking your

2414
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:42,210
about it and you're thinking your
 

2415
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,810
about it and you're thinking your
criteria for you know choosing the

2416
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:44,820
criteria for you know choosing the
 

2417
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,820
criteria for you know choosing the
school for your child or whatever that

2418
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:46,830
school for your child or whatever that
 

2419
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,650
school for your child or whatever that
might be and you write down your

2420
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:48,660
might be and you write down your
 

2421
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,990
might be and you write down your
criteria or whatever they are those

criteria or whatever they are those
 

2423
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,500
criteria or whatever they are those
principles you write down and you you

principles you write down and you you
 

2425
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,800
principles you write down and you you
that will at that moment make you

2426
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:57,810
that will at that moment make you
 

2427
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,710
that will at that moment make you
articulate your principles in a very

2428
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:00,720
articulate your principles in a very
 

2429
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,430
articulate your principles in a very
valuable

valuable
way and if you have the way that we

2432
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:03,930
way and if you have the way that we
 

2433
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,410
way and if you have the way that we
operate that you have easy access so

2434
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:06,420
operate that you have easy access so
 

2435
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,900
operate that you have easy access so
then the next time that comes along you

2436
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:08,910
then the next time that comes along you
 

2437
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,030
then the next time that comes along you
can go to that or you can show those

2438
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:11,040
can go to that or you can show those
 

2439
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,500
can go to that or you can show those
principles to others to see if they're

2440
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:12,510
principles to others to see if they're
 

2441
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,510
principles to others to see if they're
the right principles you will get a

2442
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:14,520
the right principles you will get a
 

2443
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,569
the right principles you will get a
clarity of that principle that's really

2444
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:17,579
clarity of that principle that's really
 

2445
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,760
clarity of that principle that's really
invaluable in words and that'll help you

2446
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:19,770
invaluable in words and that'll help you
 

2447
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,880
invaluable in words and that'll help you
a lot then but then you start to think

2448
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:22,890
a lot then but then you start to think
 

2449
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:26,300
a lot then but then you start to think
how do i express that in data and it'll

2450
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:26,310
how do i express that in data and it'll
 

2451
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,059
how do i express that in data and it'll
shock you about how you can do that

2452
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:29,069
shock you about how you can do that
 

2453
00:54:29,069 --> 00:54:31,609
shock you about how you can do that
you'll you'll form an equation that will

2454
00:54:31,609 --> 00:54:31,619
you'll you'll form an equation that will
 

2455
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,859
you'll you'll form an equation that will
show the relationship between these

2456
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:33,869
show the relationship between these
 

2457
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:35,770
show the relationship between these
particular parts and then the

2458
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:35,780
particular parts and then the
 

2459
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,780
particular parts and then the
essentially the variables that are going

2460
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:38,790
essentially the variables that are going
 

2461
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,510
essentially the variables that are going
to go into that particular equation and

2462
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:41,520
to go into that particular equation and
 

2463
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,550
to go into that particular equation and
you will be able to do that and you take

2464
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:43,560
you will be able to do that and you take
 

2465
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,160
you will be able to do that and you take
that little piece and you put it into

2466
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,170
that little piece and you put it into
 

2467
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,040
that little piece and you put it into
the computer and then take the next

2468
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,050
the computer and then take the next
 

2469
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,990
the computer and then take the next
little piece and you put that into the

2470
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:51,000
little piece and you put that into the
 

2471
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,470
little piece and you put that into the
computer and before you know it you will

2472
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:54,480
computer and before you know it you will
 

2473
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,569
computer and before you know it you will
have a decision making system that's of

2474
00:54:56,569 --> 00:54:56,579
have a decision making system that's of
 

2475
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:58,400
have a decision making system that's of
the sort that I'm describing so that

2476
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:58,410
the sort that I'm describing so that
 

2477
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,920
the sort that I'm describing so that
you're almost making an argument against

2478
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:00,930
you're almost making an argument against
 

2479
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,780
you're almost making an argument against
the past an earlier statement you've

2480
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:02,790
the past an earlier statement you've
 

2481
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,460
the past an earlier statement you've
made and you're convinced to me at first

2482
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:04,470
made and you're convinced to me at first
 

2483
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,099
made and you're convinced to me at first
you said there's no way a computer could

2484
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:07,109
you said there's no way a computer could
 

2485
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:10,609
you said there's no way a computer could
raise a child essentially but now you've

2486
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:10,619
raise a child essentially but now you've
 

2487
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,230
raise a child essentially but now you've
described in making me think of it if

2488
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
described in making me think of it if
 

2489
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,829
described in making me think of it if
you have that kind of idea meritocracy

2490
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:15,839
you have that kind of idea meritocracy
 

2491
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,660
you have that kind of idea meritocracy
you have this rigorous approach at

2492
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:17,670

00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,980
gonna go from what are called systems of
record which are a lot of okay

2650
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:36,990
record which are a lot of okay
 

2651
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,900
record which are a lot of okay
information organized in the right way

2652
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:38,910
information organized in the right way
 

2653
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:42,470
information organized in the right way
to intelligence and we're going to that

2654
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:42,480
to intelligence and we're going to that
 

2655
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,130
to intelligence and we're going to that
Trent that'll be the next big move in my

2656
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:46,140
Trent that'll be the next big move in my
 

2657
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,370
Trent that'll be the next big move in my
opinion and so you will get intelligence

2658
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:48,380
opinion and so you will get intelligence
 

2659
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:51,170
opinion and so you will get intelligence
back and that that intelligence comes

2660
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:51,180
back and that that intelligence comes
 

2661
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,270
back and that that intelligence comes
from reducing things down to principles

2662
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:53,280
from reducing things down to principles
 

2663
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,090
from reducing things down to principles
into that's how what happens so what's

2664
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:56,100
into that's how what happens so what's
 

2665
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,040
into that's how what happens so what's
your intuition if you look at the future

2666
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:58,050
your intuition if you look at the future
 

2667
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:00,880
your intuition if you look at the future
societies do you think we'll be able to

2668
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:00,890
societies do you think we'll be able to
 

2669
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:05,250
societies do you think we'll be able to
reduce a lot of the

2670
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:05,260

 

2671
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,590

the details of our lives down to

2672
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:07,600
the details of our lives down to
 

2673
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,270
the details of our lives down to
principles that would be further and

2674
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:09,280
principles that would be further and
 

2675
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,950
principles that would be further and
further automated I think the real

2676
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:10,960
further automated I think the real
 

2677
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,840
further automated I think the real
question hinges on people's emotional

2678
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:14,850
question hinges on people's emotional
 

2679
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:20,240
question hinges on people's emotional
emotions and irrational behaviors I

2680
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:20,250
emotions and irrational behaviors I
 

2681
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,220
emotions and irrational behaviors I
think that there's subliminal things

2682
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:23,230
think that there's subliminal things
 

2683
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:26,630
think that there's subliminal things
that we want okay and then there's

2684
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:26,640
that we want okay and then there's
 

2685
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,640
that we want okay and then there's
cerebral the you know conscious logic oh

2686
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:29,650
cerebral the you know conscious logic oh
 

2687
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:33,780
cerebral the you know conscious logic oh
and the too often are at odds so there's

2688
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:33,790
and the too often are at odds so there's
 

2689
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:37,560
and the too often are at odds so there's
almost like to use and you write and so

2690
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:37,570
almost like to use and you write and so
 

2691
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:41,310
almost like to use and you write and so
let's say what do you want and your mind

2692
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:41,320
let's say what do you want and your mind
 

2693
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,020
let's say what do you want and your mind
will answer one thing your emotions or

2694
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:43,030
will answer one thing your emotions or
 

2695
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:45,450
will answer one thing your emotions or
lands or something else so when I think

2696
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:45,460
lands or something else so when I think
 

2697
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,380
lands or something else so when I think
about it I think emotions are I want

2698
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:48,390
about it I think emotions are I want
 

2699
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,930
about it I think emotions are I want
inspiration I want love is a good thing

2700
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:51,940
inspiration I want love is a good thing
 

2701
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,480
inspiration I want love is a good thing
being able to have a good impact but it

2702
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:54,490
being able to have a good impact but it
 

2703
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,250
being able to have a good impact but it
is in the reconciliation of your

2704
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:58,260
is in the reconciliation of your
 

2705
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,410
is in the reconciliation of your
subliminal wants and your intellectual

2706
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:01,420
subliminal wants and your intellectual
 

2707
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,440
subliminal wants and your intellectual
wants so that you really say they're

2708
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:04,450
wants so that you really say they're
 

2709
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:07,590
wants so that you really say they're
aligned and so to do that in a way to

2710
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:07,600
aligned and so to do that in a way to
 

2711
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,370
aligned and so to do that in a way to
get what you want so irrationality is a

2712
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:11,380
get what you want so irrationality is a
 

2713
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:15,780
get what you want so irrationality is a
bad thing if it means that it doesn't

2714
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:15,790
bad thing if it means that it doesn't
 

2715
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:18,120
bad thing if it means that it doesn't
make sense in getting you what you want

2716
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:18,130
make sense in getting you what you want
 

2717
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,530
make sense in getting you what you want
but you better decide what you your

2718
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:19,540
but you better decide what you your
 

2719
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,270
but you better decide what you your
satisfying is it the lower level you

2720
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,280
satisfying is it the lower level you
 

2721
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,030
satisfying is it the lower level you
emotional subliminal one or is it the

2722
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:24,040
emotional subliminal one or is it the
 

2723
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,370
emotional subliminal one or is it the
other but if you can align them so what

2724
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:26,380
other but if you can align them so what
 

2725
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,810
other but if you can align them so what
I find is that by going from my you

2726
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:30,820
I find is that by going from my you
 

2727
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,410
I find is that by going from my you
experience the decision do this thing

2728
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:33,420
experience the decision do this thing
 

2729
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,760
experience the decision do this thing
subliminally and that's the thing I want

2730
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:35,770
subliminally and that's the thing I want
 

2731
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,520
subliminally and that's the thing I want
it comes to the surface I find that if I

2732
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:38,530
it comes to the surface I find that if I
 

2733
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,150
it comes to the surface I find that if I
can align that with what my logical me

2734
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,160
can align that with what my logical me
 

2735
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,700
can align that with what my logical me
wants and does do the devil double-check

2736
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:44,710
wants and does do the devil double-check
 

2737
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:47,100
wants and does do the devil double-check
between them and I get the same sort of

2738
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:47,110
between them and I get the same sort of
 

2739
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,160
between them and I get the same sort of
thing that that helps me a lot I find

2740
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:50,170
thing that that helps me a lot I find
 

2741
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,740
thing that that helps me a lot I find
for example meditation is one of the

2742
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:52,750
for example meditation is one of the
 

2743
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,390
for example meditation is one of the
things that helps to achieve that

2744
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
things that helps to achieve that
 

2745
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,210
things that helps to achieve that
alignment it's fantastic for achieving

2746
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:57,220
alignment it's fantastic for achieving
 

2747
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,850
alignment it's fantastic for achieving
that alignment and often then I also

2748
01:00:59,850 --> 01:00:59,860
that alignment and often then I also
 

2749
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,400
that alignment and often then I also
want to not just do it in my head I want

2750
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:02,410
want to not just do it in my head I want
 

2751
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,290
want to not just do it in my head I want
to say does that make sense help you you

2752
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:04,300
to say does that make sense help you you
 

2753
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,630
to say does that make sense help you you
and so I do with other people and I say

2754
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:06,640
and so I do with other people and I say
 

2755
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,220
and so I do with other people and I say
okay well let's say I want this thing

2756
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:08,230
okay well let's say I want this thing
 

2757
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,590
okay well let's say I want this thing
and whatever it does that make sense and

2758
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:10,600
and whatever it does that make sense and
 

2759
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,080
and whatever it does that make sense and
when you do that kind of triangulation

2760
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:13,090
when you do that kind of triangulation
 

2761
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,650
when you do that kind of triangulation
you're to use and you do that with also

2762
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:16,660
you're to use and you do that with also
 

2763
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,620
you're to use and you do that with also
the other way

2764
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:17,630
the other way
 

2765
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:20,440
the other way
then you certainly want to be rational

2766
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:20,450
then you certainly want to be rational
 

2767
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:21,010
then you certainly want to be rational
right

2768
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:21,020
right
 

2769
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,440
right
but rationality has to be defined by

2770
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:23,450
but rationality has to be defined by
 

2771
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:27,370
but rationality has to be defined by
those things and then you discover sort

2772
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:27,380
those things and then you discover sort
 

2773
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:30,820
those things and then you discover sort
of new ideas that the drive you're just

2774
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:30,830
of new ideas that the drive you're just
 

2775
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,740
of new ideas that the drive you're just
so-so is you're always at the edge of

2776
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:32,750
so-so is you're always at the edge of
 

2777
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,120
so-so is you're always at the edge of
the set of principles you've developed

2778
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:34,130
the set of principles you've developed
 

2779
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:36,160
the set of principles you've developed
you're doing new things always well

2780
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,170
you're doing new things always well
 

2781
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,570
you're doing new things always well
that's where the intellect is needed

2782
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:37,580
that's where the intellect is needed
 

2783
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,720
that's where the intellect is needed
well and the inspiration the inspiration

2784
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:40,730
well and the inspiration the inspiration
 

2785
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,050
well and the inspiration the inspiration
is needed to do that right like what are

2786
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:44,060
is needed to do that right like what are
 

2787
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:47,440
is needed to do that right like what are
you doing it for the segment what is the

2788
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:47,450
you doing it for the segment what is the
 

2789
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:51,460
you doing it for the segment what is the
velocity the hunger what's uh if you can

2790
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:51,470
velocity the hunger what's uh if you can
 

2791
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,640
velocity the hunger what's uh if you can
be Freud for a second what's in that

2792
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:53,650
be Freud for a second what's in that
 

2793
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,780
be Freud for a second what's in that
subconscious well it's the thing that

2794
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:55,790
subconscious well it's the thing that
 

2795
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,240
subconscious well it's the thing that
drives us all I think you can't

2796
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:58,250
drives us all I think you can't
 

2797
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,610
drives us all I think you can't
generalize of us I think different

2798
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:00,620
generalize of us I think different
 

2799
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,470
generalize of us I think different
people are driven by different things

2800
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:02,480
people are driven by different things
 

2801
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,310
people are driven by different things
there's not a common one right so like

2802
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:06,320
there's not a common one right so like
 

2803
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,530
there's not a common one right so like
if you would take the shapers I think it

2804
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:08,540
if you would take the shapers I think it
 

2805
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:13,360
if you would take the shapers I think it
is a combination of subliminally it's a

2806
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:13,370
is a combination of subliminally it's a
 

2807
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:18,310
is a combination of subliminally it's a
combination of excitement curiosity is

2808
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:18,320
combination of excitement curiosity is
 

2809
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,560
combination of excitement curiosity is
there a dark element there is there is

2810
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:20,570
there a dark element there is there is
 

2811
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,930
there a dark element there is there is
their demons there's their fears is

2812

their demons there's their fears is
 

2813
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,630
their demons there's their fears is
there in your sense uh most of the ones

2814
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:25,640
there in your sense uh most of the ones
 

2815
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,550
there in your sense uh most of the ones
the most of the ones that I'm dealing

2816
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:27,560
the most of the ones that I'm dealing
 

2817
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,330
the most of the ones that I'm dealing
with I have not seen that I see the what

2818
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:31,340
with I have not seen that I see the what
 

2819
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,590
with I have not seen that I see the what
I really see is who if I can do that

2820
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:35,600
I really see is who if I can do that
 

2821
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,020
I really see is who if I can do that
that would be the most dream and then

2822
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:38,030
that would be the most dream and then
 

2823
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:41,020
that would be the most dream and then
the act of creativity and you say whew

2824
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:41,030
the act of creativity and you say whew
 

2825
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:44,310
the act of creativity and you say whew
so excitement is one of the things

2826
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:44,320
so excitement is one of the things
 

2827
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,250
so excitement is one of the things
curiosity is a big pull okay and then

2828
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:48,260
curiosity is a big pull okay and then
 

2829
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:51,130
curiosity is a big pull okay and then
tenacity you know okay at that to do

2830
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:51,140
tenacity you know okay at that to do
 

2831
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,370
tenacity you know okay at that to do
those things but definitely emotions are

2832
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:54,380
those things but definitely emotions are
 

2833
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,900
those things but definitely emotions are
entering into it then there's an

2834
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:55,910
entering into it then there's an
 

2835
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:58,750
entering into it then there's an
intellectual component of it too okay it

2836
01:02:58,750 --> 01:02:58,760
intellectual component of it too okay it
 

2837
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,810
intellectual component of it too okay it
may be empathy it may can I have an

2838
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:01,820
may be empathy it may can I have an
 

2839
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,960
may be empathy it may can I have an
impact can I have an impact the desire

2840
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:04,970
impact can I have an impact the desire
 

2841
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,090
impact can I have an impact the desire
to have an impact that's an emotional

2842
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:07,100
to have an impact that's an emotional
 

2843
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,030
to have an impact that's an emotional
thrill and but it also it has empathy

2844
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:10,040
thrill and but it also it has empathy
 

2845
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,760
thrill and but it also it has empathy
and then you start to see spirituality

2846
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:12,770
and then you start to see spirituality
 

2847
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:14,080
and then you start to see spirituality
but a spirituality I mean the

2848
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:14,090
but a spirituality I mean the
 

2849
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,540
but a spirituality I mean the
connectedness to the whole you start to

2850
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:16,550
connectedness to the whole you start to
 

2851
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:18,580
connectedness to the whole you start to
see people operate those things those

2852
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:18,590
see people operate those things those
 

2853
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,590
see people operate those things those
tend to be the things that you see the

2854
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:20,600
tend to be the things that you see the
 

2855
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,070
tend to be the things that you see the
most of and I think you're gonna shut

2856
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:24,080
most of and I think you're gonna shut
 

2857
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,130
most of and I think you're gonna shut
down this idea completely but there's a

2858
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:27,140
down this idea completely but there's a
 

2859
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,480
down this idea completely but there's a
notion that some of these shapers

2860
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:29,490
notion that some of these shapers
 

2861
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:31,700
notion that some of these shapers
really walk the line between sort of

2862
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:31,710
really walk the line between sort of
 

2863
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,640
really walk the line between sort of
madness and genius do you think madness

2864
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:34,650
madness and genius do you think madness
 

2865
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,640
madness and genius do you think madness
has a role in any of this or do you

2866
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:37,650
has a role in any of this or do you
 

2867
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,400
has a role in any of this or do you
still see Steve Jobs in a mosque is

2868
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:40,410
still see Steve Jobs in a mosque is
 

2869
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,680
still see Steve Jobs in a mosque is
fundamentally rational the others a

2870
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:42,690
fundamentally rational the others a
 

2871
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,900
fundamentally rational the others a
continuum there then what comes to my

2872
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:44,910
continuum there then what comes to my
 

2873
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:51,950
continuum there then what comes to my
mind is that genius is that often at the

2874
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:51,960
mind is that genius is that often at the
 

2875
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,480
mind is that genius is that often at the
edge in some cases imaginary genius is

2876
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:56,490
edge in some cases imaginary genius is
 

2877
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:00,740
edge in some cases imaginary genius is
at the edge of insanity and it's almost

2878
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:00,750
at the edge of insanity and it's almost
 

2879
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,920
at the edge of insanity and it's almost
like a radio that I think okay if I can

2880
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:03,930
like a radio that I think okay if I can
 

2881
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:06,470
like a radio that I think okay if I can
tune it just right it's playing right

2882
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
tune it just right it's playing right
 

2883
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,559
tune it just right it's playing right
but if I go a little bit too far yeah it

2884
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:09,569
but if I go a little bit too far yeah it
 

2885
01:04:09,569 --> 01:04:12,980
but if I go a little bit too far yeah it
goes off yeah okay and so you can you

2886
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:12,990
goes off yeah okay and so you can you
 

2887
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:16,010
goes off yeah okay and so you can you
can see this kay Jamison was studying

2888
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:16,020
can see this kay Jamison was studying
 

2889
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,370
can see this kay Jamison was studying

that's definitely the case because when
 

2893
01:04:22,349 --> 01:04:24,650
that's definitely the case because when
you're going out there that imagination

recently what's your view on the impact
 

2905
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,770
recently what's your view on the impact
of automation of whether we're talking

automation on the economy in the short
 

2911
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,430
automation on the economy in the short
term in the long term do you have

2912
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,440
term in the long term do you have
 

2913
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,480
term in the long term do you have

and it's a it's a giant thing it'll come
 

2919
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,799
and it's a it's a giant thing it'll come
at us in a very big way and in the

impact and it will have a big impact and
 

2927

it's a two-edged sword because it'll

it's a two-edged sword because it'll
 

2929
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:15,650
it's a two-edged sword because it'll
have tremendous benefits and at the same

2930
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:15,660
have tremendous benefits and at the same
 

2931
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,650
have tremendous benefits and at the same
time it has profound benefits in

2932
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:18,660
time it has profound benefits in
 

2933
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,750
time it has profound benefits in
employment and distributions of wealth

2934

employment and distributions of wealth
 

2935
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,680
employment and distributions of wealth
because the way I think think about it

2936
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:24,690
because the way I think think about it
 

2937
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:26,539
because the way I think think about it
is there are certain things human beings

2938
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:26,549
is there are certain things human beings
 

2939
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:31,609
is there are certain things human beings
can do and over time we've evolved to go

2940
01:05:31,609 --> 01:05:31,619
can do and over time we've evolved to go
 

2941
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:34,130
can do and over time we've evolved to go
to almost higher and higher levels and

2942
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:34,140
to almost higher and higher levels and
 

2943
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,440
to almost higher and higher levels and
now we're almost like we're at this

2944
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:36,450
now we're almost like we're at this
 

2945
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:39,340
now we're almost like we're at this
level you know it used to be your labor

2946
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:39,350
level you know it used to be your labor
 

2947
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:41,920
level you know it used to be your labor
you would then do your labor and okay we

2948
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:41,930
you would then do your labor and okay we
 

2949
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:43,660
you would then do your labor and okay we
can get past the labor we got tractors

2950
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:43,670
can get past the labor we got tractors
 

2951
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:46,030
can get past the labor we got tractors
and things and you go up up up up up and

2952
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:46,040
and things and you go up up up up up and
 

2953
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,880
and things and you go up up up up up and
we're up over here and to the point in

2954
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:48,890
we're up over here and to the point in
 

2955
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:53,200
we're up over here and to the point in
our minds we're okay anything related to

2956
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:53,210
our minds we're okay anything related to
 

2957
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,900
our minds we're okay anything related to
mental processing the computer can

2958
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:55,910
mental processing the computer can
 

2959
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,330
mental processing the computer can
probably do better and we can find that

2960
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:58,340
probably do better and we can find that
 

2961
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,080
probably do better and we can find that
and so other than almost inventing

2962
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:01,090
and so other than almost inventing
 

2963
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:04,390
and so other than almost inventing
you're at a point where these are the

2964
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
you're at a point where these are the
 

2965
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,240
you're at a point where these are the
Commission's and the automation will

2966
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:07,250
Commission's and the automation will
 

2967
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:10,500
Commission's and the automation will
probably do it better and and that's

2968
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:10,510
probably do it better and and that's
 

2969
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,580
probably do it better and and that's
accelerating and that's a force and

2970
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:12,590
accelerating and that's a force and
 

2971
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:16,000
accelerating and that's a force and
that's a force for the good and at the

2972
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,010
that's a force for the good and at the
 

2973
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,940
that's a force for the good and at the
same time it what it does is it

2974
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:18,950
same time it what it does is it
 

2975
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,490
same time it what it does is it
displaces people in terms of employment

2976
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:21,500
displaces people in terms of employment
 

2977
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,890
displaces people in terms of employment
and changes and it produces wealth gaps

2978
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:23,900
and changes and it produces wealth gaps
 

2979
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,470
and changes and it produces wealth gaps
and all of that so I think the real

2980
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:26,480
and all of that so I think the real
 

2981
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,580
and all of that so I think the real
issue is that that has to be viewed as a

2982
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:30,590
issue is that that has to be viewed as a
 

2983
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,710
issue is that that has to be viewed as a
national emergency in other words I

2984
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
national emergency in other words I
 

2985
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,410
national emergency in other words I
think the well the wealth gap theme the

2986
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:35,420
think the well the wealth gap theme the
 

2987
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:38,020
think the well the wealth gap theme the
income gap the opportunity gap all of

2988
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:38,030
income gap the opportunity gap all of
 

2989
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:41,950
income gap the opportunity gap all of
those things that force is creating the

2990
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:41,960
those things that force is creating the
 

2991
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,260
those things that force is creating the
problems that we're having today a lot

2992
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:44,270
problems that we're having today a lot
 

2993
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:46,930
problems that we're having today a lot
of the problems the the great polarity

2994
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:46,940
of the problems the the great polarity
 

2995
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:50,860
of the problems the the great polarity
the disenfranchised eat dis not equal

2996
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:50,870
the disenfranchised eat dis not equal
 

2997
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:53,320
the disenfranchised eat dis not equal
not anything approaching equality of

2998
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:53,330
not anything approaching equality of
 

2999
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:57,100
not anything approaching equality of
education all of these problems a lot of

3000
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:57,110
education all of these problems a lot of
 

3001
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:59,080
education all of these problems a lot of
problems are coming as a result of that

3002
01:06:59,080 --> 01:06:59,090
problems are coming as a result of that
 

3003
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:01,810
problems are coming as a result of that
and so there it needs to be viewed

3004
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:01,820
and so there it needs to be viewed
 

3005
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:05,500
and so there it needs to be viewed
really as an emergency situation in

3006
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:05,510
really as an emergency situation in
 

3007
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:09,570
really as an emergency situation in
which there's a good work good plan

3008
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:09,580
which there's a good work good plan
 

3009
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:12,760
which there's a good work good plan
worked out for how to deal with that

3010
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:12,770
worked out for how to deal with that
 

3011
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:16,210
worked out for how to deal with that
effectively so that it's dealt with

3012
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:16,220
effectively so that it's dealt with
 

3013
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:20,020
effectively so that it's dealt with
effectively so because it's it's it you

3014
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:20,030
effectively so because it's it's it you
 

3015
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:21,970
effectively so because it's it's it you
know it's good for the average it's good

3016
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:21,980
know it's good for the average it's good
 

3017
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,830
know it's good for the average it's good
for the impact but it's not good for

3018
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:23,840
for the impact but it's not good for
 

3019
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,110
for the impact but it's not good for
everyone in the crates that polarity so

3020
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:26,120
everyone in the crates that polarity so
 

3021
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,120
everyone in the crates that polarity so
it's got to be dealt with yeah and

3022
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:28,130
it's got to be dealt with yeah and
 

3023
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,680
it's got to be dealt with yeah and
you've talked about the American Dream

you've talked about the American Dream
 

3025
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:31,680
you've talked about the American Dream
and that that's something that all

3026
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:31,690
and that that's something that all
 

3027
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,970
and that that's something that all
people should have an opportunity for

give that opportunity for everyone let
 

3033
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,750
give that opportunity for everyone let
me ask kind of one of the ideas in terms

3034
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:43,760
me ask kind of one of the ideas in terms
 

3035
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,690
me ask kind of one of the ideas in terms
of safety nets that support that kind of

3036
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:46,700
of safety nets that support that kind of
 

3037
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,400
of safety nets that support that kind of
opportunity there's been a lot of

3038
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:48,410
opportunity there's been a lot of
 

3039
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:50,190
opportunity there's been a lot of
discussion of universal basic income

that giving a thousand dollars or some
 

3053
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,160
that giving a thousand dollars or some
amount of money to everybody as a way to

01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:06,170
amount of money to everybody as a way to
 

3055
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:10,420
amount of money to everybody as a way to
give them the the padding the freedom to

give them the the padding the freedom to
 

3057
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:13,720
give them the the padding the freedom to
sort of take leaps to take the call for

3058
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:13,730
sort of take leaps to take the call for
 

3059
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:16,479
sort of take leaps to take the call for
adventure to take the crazy procedure

3060
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:16,489
adventure to take the crazy procedure
 

3061
01:08:16,489 --> 01:08:19,059
adventure to take the crazy procedure
before I get right into the my thoughts

3062
01:08:19,059 --> 01:08:19,069
before I get right into the my thoughts
 

3063
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:21,010
before I get right into the my thoughts
on universal basic income I want to

3064
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:21,020
on universal basic income I want to
 

3065
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:26,530
on universal basic income I want to
start with the notion that opportunity

3066
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:26,540
start with the notion that opportunity
 

3067
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:31,630
start with the notion that opportunity
education development creating equality

3068
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:31,640
education development creating equality
 

3069
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,710
education development creating equality
so that you people say there's equal

3070
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:34,720
so that you people say there's equal
 

3071
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,010
so that you people say there's equal
opportunity and is the most important

3072
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:39,020
opportunity and is the most important
 

3073
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,579
opportunity and is the most important
thing and then to find out what is the

3074
01:08:42,579 --> 01:08:42,589
thing and then to find out what is the
 

3075
01:08:42,589 --> 01:08:44,440
thing and then to find out what is the
amount how are you going to provide that

3076
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:44,450
amount how are you going to provide that
 

3077
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:47,050
amount how are you going to provide that
what where what how does it how do you

3078
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:47,060
what where what how does it how do you
 

3079
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,539
what where what how does it how do you
get the money into a public school

3080
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:49,549
get the money into a public school
 

3081

plan to create equal opportunity in all

3086
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:58,460
plan to create equal opportunity in all
 

3087
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,150
plan to create equal opportunity in all
of its various forms is the most

3088
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:01,160
of its various forms is the most
 

3089
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,390
of its various forms is the most
pressing thing to do and so I'm you know

3090
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,400
pressing thing to do and so I'm you know
 

3091

pressing thing to do and so I'm you know
that is that the the opportunity is the

3092
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
that is that the the opportunity is the
 

3093
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,740
that is that the the opportunity is the
most important one you're kind of

3094

most important one you're kind of
 

3095
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,650
most important one you're kind of
implying is the earlier the better sort

3096
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:11,660
implying is the earlier the better sort
 

3097

of like opportunity to education so in
the early development of a human being

01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,050
which goes from birth until you're on
your own and you're an adult and you're

3110
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:29,060
your own and you're an adult and you're
 

3111
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:32,680
your own and you're an adult and you're
now out there and you deal with early

3112
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:32,690
now out there and you deal with early
 

3113
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:35,110
now out there and you deal with early
childhood development okay and you take

3114
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:35,120
childhood development okay and you take
 

3115
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,539
childhood development okay and you take
the brain and you say what's important

3116
01:09:37,539 --> 01:09:37,549
the brain and you say what's important
 

3117
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:41,860
the brain and you say what's important
the child care okay like the it makes a

3118
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:41,870
the child care okay like the it makes a
 

3119
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:43,690
the child care okay like the it makes a
world of difference for example if you

3120
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:43,700
world of difference for example if you
 

3121
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,370
world of difference for example if you
have good parents who are trying to

3122
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:45,380
have good parents who are trying to
 

3123
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:48,579
have good parents who are trying to
think about instilling the stability in

3124
01:09:48,579 --> 01:09:48,589
think about instilling the stability in
 

3125
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:51,460
think about instilling the stability in
a non traumatic environment to provide

3126
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:51,470
a non traumatic environment to provide
 

3127
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,650
a non traumatic environment to provide
them so I would say the good guidance

3128
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:53,660
them so I would say the good guidance
 

3129
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,110
them so I would say the good guidance
that normally comes from parents and the

3130
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:56,120
that normally comes from parents and the
 

3131
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,360
that normally comes from parents and the
good education that they're receiving

3132
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:00,370
good education that they're receiving
 

3133
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:04,270
good education that they're receiving
are you know the most important things

3134
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:04,280
are you know the most important things
 

3135
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,400
are you know the most important things
in that person's development the

3136
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:06,410
in that person's development the
 

3137
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,700
in that person's development the
ability to be able to be prepared to go

3138
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:09,710
ability to be able to be prepared to go
 

3139
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,700
ability to be able to be prepared to go
out there and then to go into a market

3140
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:12,710
out there and then to go into a market
 

3141
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:15,430
out there and then to go into a market
that's an equal opportunity job market

3142
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:15,440
that's an equal opportunity job market
 

3143
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,070
that's an equal opportunity job market
to be able to then go into that kind of

3144
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:18,080
to be able to then go into that kind of
 

3145
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,390
to be able to then go into that kind of
market is a system that creates not only

3146
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:21,400
market is a system that creates not only
 

3147
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,640
market is a system that creates not only
fairness anything else is not fair and

3148
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:24,650
fairness anything else is not fair and
 

3149
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:27,910
fairness anything else is not fair and
then in addition to that it also is a

3150
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:27,920
then in addition to that it also is a
 

3151
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,790
then in addition to that it also is a
more effective economic system because

3152
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,800
more effective economic system because
 

3153
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,490
more effective economic system because
the consequences of not doing that are

3154
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:33,500
the consequences of not doing that are
 

3155
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,220
the consequences of not doing that are
to a society or devastating if you look

3156
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:36,230
to a society or devastating if you look
 

3157
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:38,830
to a society or devastating if you look
at what the difference in outcomes for

3158
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:38,840
at what the difference in outcomes for
 

3159
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,050
at what the difference in outcomes for
somebody who completes high school or

3160
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:41,060
somebody who completes high school or
 

3161
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,940
somebody who completes high school or
doesn't complete high school or does

3162
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:42,950
doesn't complete high school or does
 

3163
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:46,420
doesn't complete high school or does
each one of those state changes and you

3164
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:46,430
each one of those state changes and you
 

3165
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:48,370
each one of those state changes and you
look at what that means in terms of

3166
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:48,380
look at what that means in terms of
 

3167
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:50,860
look at what that means in terms of
their costs to society not only

3168
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:50,870
their costs to society not only
 

3169
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:52,990
their costs to society not only
themselves but their cost and

3170
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:53,000
themselves but their cost and
 

3171
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,780
themselves but their cost and
incarceration costs and then on crimes

3172
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:55,790
incarceration costs and then on crimes
 

3173
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,780
incarceration costs and then on crimes
and all of those things it's

3174
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:57,790
and all of those things it's
 

3175
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:00,820
and all of those things it's
economically better for the society and

3176
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:00,830
economically better for the society and
 

3177
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:03,910
economically better for the society and
it's fairer if they can complete fake an

3178
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:03,920
it's fairer if they can complete fake an
 

3179
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,640
it's fairer if they can complete fake an
get those particular things once they

3180
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:06,650
get those particular things once they
 

3181
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:08,650
get those particular things once they
have those things then you move on to

3182
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:08,660
have those things then you move on to
 

3183
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,320
have those things then you move on to
other things but yes from birth all the

3184
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:11,330
other things but yes from birth all the
 

3185
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:14,020
other things but yes from birth all the
way through that process anything less

3186
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:14,030
way through that process anything less
 

3187
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:18,400
way through that process anything less
than that is bad is a tragedy and and so

3188
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:18,410
than that is bad is a tragedy and and so
 

3189
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:20,590
than that is bad is a tragedy and and so
on so that's what uh that's yeah those

3190
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:20,600
on so that's what uh that's yeah those
 

3191
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,840
on so that's what uh that's yeah those
are the things that I'm estimate and so

3192
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:22,850
are the things that I'm estimate and so
 

3193
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:25,420
are the things that I'm estimate and so
my I'm what I would want to above all

3194
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:25,430
my I'm what I would want to above all
 

3195
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:28,360
my I'm what I would want to above all
else is to provide that so with that in

3196
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:28,370
else is to provide that so with that in
 

3197
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:30,130
else is to provide that so with that in
mind now we'll talk about universal

3198
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:30,140
mind now we'll talk about universal
 

3199
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,960
mind now we'll talk about universal
basic income start with that well now we

3200
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:31,970
basic income start with that well now we
 

3201
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:33,820
basic income start with that well now we
can talk about well the bright because

3202
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:33,830
can talk about well the bright because
 

3203
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:35,440
can talk about well the bright because
you have to have that now the question

3204
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:35,450
you have to have that now the question
 

3205
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,620
you have to have that now the question
is what's the best way to provide that

3206
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:37,630
is what's the best way to provide that
 

3207
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:41,860
is what's the best way to provide that
okay so when I look at UB I I really

3208
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:41,870
okay so when I look at UB I I really
 

3209
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:44,080
okay so when I look at UB I I really
think is what is going to happen with

3210
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:44,090
think is what is going to happen with
 

3211
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:47,140
think is what is going to happen with
that thousand dollars okay and will that

3212
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:47,150
that thousand dollars okay and will that
 

3213
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:49,510
that thousand dollars okay and will that
thousand dollars come from another

3214
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
thousand dollars come from another
 

3215
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,820
thousand dollars come from another
program does that come from an early

3216
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:51,830
program does that come from an early
 

3217
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:54,460
program does that come from an early
childhood developmental program who are

3218
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:54,470
childhood developmental program who are
 

3219
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:57,100
childhood developmental program who are
you giving the thousand dollars to and

3220
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:57,110
you giving the thousand dollars to and
 

3221
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:59,050
you giving the thousand dollars to and
what will they do for that thousand

3222
01:11:59,050 --> 01:11:59,060
what will they do for that thousand
 

3223
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,510
what will they do for that thousand
dollars I mean like my reaction would be

3224
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:01,520
dollars I mean like my reaction would be
 

3225
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,190
dollars I mean like my reaction would be
I think it's a great thing that

3226
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:03,200
I think it's a great thing that
 

3227
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,470
I think it's a great thing that
everybody should have almost a thousand

3228
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:05,480
everybody should have almost a thousand
 

3229
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,170
everybody should have almost a thousand
dollars in their bank and so on but when

3230
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:08,180
dollars in their bank and so on but when
 

3231
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,940
dollars in their bank and so on but when
do they get to make decisions or who's

3232
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:09,950
do they get to make decisions or who's
 

3233
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,160
do they get to make decisions or who's
the parent a lot of pit times you can

3234
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:12,170
the parent a lot of pit times you can
 

3235
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:14,140
the parent a lot of pit times you can
give a thousand dollars to somebody and

3236
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:14,150
give a thousand dollars to somebody and
 

3237
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:16,120
give a thousand dollars to somebody and
it could have a negative result it can

3238
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:16,130
it could have a negative result it can
 

3239
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,860
it could have a negative result it can
have you know they can use that money

3240
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:17,870
have you know they can use that money
 

3241
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:20,270
have you know they can use that money
detrimental II not just for

3242
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:20,280
detrimental II not just for
 

3243
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,979
detrimental II not just for
octave Lee and if that money's coming

3244
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:21,989
octave Lee and if that money's coming
 

3245
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:24,439
octave Lee and if that money's coming
away from some of those other things

3246
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:24,449
away from some of those other things
 

3247
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:25,760
away from some of those other things
that are going to produce the things I

3248
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:25,770
that are going to produce the things I
 

3249
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:26,209
that are going to produce the things I
want

3250
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:26,219
want
 

3251
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:29,180
want
and you're shifted to let's say to come

3252
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:29,190
and you're shifted to let's say to come
 

3253
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,069
and you're shifted to let's say to come
in and give a check doesn't mean it's

3254
01:12:31,069 --> 01:12:31,079
in and give a check doesn't mean it's
 

3255
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:32,720
in and give a check doesn't mean it's
outcomes are going to be good and

3256
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:32,730
outcomes are going to be good and
 

3257
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,279
outcomes are going to be good and
providing those things that I think are

3258
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:34,289
providing those things that I think are
 

3259
01:12:34,289 --> 01:12:37,279
providing those things that I think are
so fundamental important if it was just

3260
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:37,289
so fundamental important if it was just
 

3261
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:39,020
so fundamental important if it was just
everybody can have a thousand dollars

3262
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:39,030
everybody can have a thousand dollars
 

3263
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:40,700
everybody can have a thousand dollars

01:12:59,779 --> 01:12:59,789
things that are taken care of so if it
 

3281
01:12:59,789 --> 01:13:02,330
things that are taken care of so if it
comes out of that budget and you know I

3287
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,569
that's gonna be doing those things and I
you know so you have to figure it out

that's one of them it could stand in the
way of that yes okay but I could almost

3424
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:09,340
way of that yes okay but I could almost
 

3425

way of that yes okay but I could almost
list the ways that it could stand it

3426
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:11,770
list the ways that it could stand it
 

3427
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:12,750
list the ways that it could stand it
could be a problem

3428
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:12,760
could be a problem
 

3429
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,870

3536
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,010
know they're not the most fundamental
 

3537
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:54,120
know they're not the most fundamental
things so I think that people sometimes

3538
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:54,130
things so I think that people sometimes
 

3539
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:57,060
things so I think that people sometimes
think money has value money doesn't have

3540
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,070
think money has value money doesn't have
 

3541
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:00,390
think money has value money doesn't have
value the money is like you say just a

3542
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
value the money is like you say just a
 

3543
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,970
value the money is like you say just a
of exchange in a store although well and

3544
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:02,980
of exchange in a store although well and
 

3545
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,580
of exchange in a store although well and
so what you have to say is what is it

3546
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:05,590
so what you have to say is what is it
 

3547
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:07,830
so what you have to say is what is it
that you're going to buy now there are

of work what people are thinking is that
 

3769

01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:03,200
thing and another and of course they
 

3773
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,310
thing and another and of course they
they do but they don't realize that if

3774
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:06,320
they do but they don't realize that if
 

3775
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:10,000
they do but they don't realize that if
they develop the skill to get a lot more

3776

out of an hour it's the equivalent Earl
 

3779
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,660
out of an hour it's the equivalent Earl
if-- and so you know that's why in the

3780
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:16,670
if-- and so you know that's why in the
 

3781
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:18,730
if-- and so you know that's why in the
book principles I try to go into okay

3782
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:18,740
book principles I try to go into okay
 

3783
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,920
book principles I try to go into okay
now how can you get a lot more out of

3784
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:20,930
now how can you get a lot more out of

01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:24,340
now how can you get a lot more out of
out of an hour that allows you to get

the work-life balance and that's the
 

3791
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:32,020
the work-life balance and that's the
primary struggle in that 35 to 45 you

primary struggle in that 35 to 45 you
 

3793
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:35,410
primary struggle in that 35 to 45 you
know if you could linger on that sort of

sequentially one has a great time they

3838
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:35,090
sequentially one has a great time they
 

3839
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:37,750
sequentially one has a great time they
date they go out and so on you find the

3840
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
date they go out and so on you find the

you'll have your series of failures
that's the that's that that's when you

that's the that's that that's when you
 

3865
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,260
that's the that's that that's when you
go into the abyss

go into the abyss
 

3867
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:08,350
go into the abyss
you learn you hopefully learn from those

3868
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:08,360
you learn you hopefully learn from those
 

3869
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:11,050
you learn you hopefully learn from those
mistakes you have to metamorphosis you

3870
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:11,060
mistakes you have to metamorphosis you
 

3871
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:13,660
mistakes you have to metamorphosis you
come out you change hopefully become

3872
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:13,670
come out you change hopefully become
 

3873
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:15,540

starting to approach the transition in
 

3881
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,730
starting to approach the transition in
that late part of the second phase of

3882
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:27,740
that late part of the second phase of
 

3883
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,740
that late part of the second phase of
your life before you go into the third

your life before you go into the third
 

3885
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,960
your life before you go into the third
phase of your life second phase is

3886
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:31,970
phase of your life second phase is
 

3887
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:33,070
phase of your life second phase is
you're working trying to be successful

3888
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:33,080

you're at that phase they're at making
 

3899
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,600
you're at that phase they're at making
their transition from the first phase to

3900
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:49,610
their transition from the first phase to
 

3901
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:51,070
their transition from the first phase to
the second phase and they're trying to

3902
01:26:51,070 --> 01:26:51,080
the second phase and they're trying to
 

3903
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,720
the second phase and they're trying to
be successful you want them to be

3904
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:52,730
be successful you want them to be
 

3905
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:54,850
be successful you want them to be
successful without you and you have and

3906
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:54,860
successful without you and you have and
 

3907
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:57,430
successful without you and you have and
your parents are gone and then you have

3908
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:57,440
your parents are gone and then you have
 

3909
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,100
your parents are gone and then you have
freedom and then you have freedom again

3910
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:00,110
freedom and then you have freedom again
 

3911
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:02,290
freedom and then you have freedom again
and that with that freedom and then you

3912
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:02,300
and that with that freedom and then you
 

3913
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,740
and that with that freedom and then you
have these histories shown with this you

3914
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:05,750
have these histories shown with this you
 

3915
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,930
have these histories shown with this you
have friendships you have perspective on

3916
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:07,940
have friendships you have perspective on
 

3917
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,490
have friendships you have perspective on
life you have different things and

3918
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:09,500
life you have different things and
 

3919
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,440
life you have different things and
that's one of the reasons that that

3920
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:11,450
that's one of the reasons that that
 

3921
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,840
that's one of the reasons that that
later part of the life can be real it on

3922
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:13,850
later part of the life can be real it on
 

3923
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:16,360
later part of the life can be real it on
average actually it's the highest very

3924
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:16,370
average actually it's the highest very
 

3925
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:18,760
average actually it's the highest very
interesting thing if they and they their

3926
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:18,770
interesting thing if they and they their
 

3927
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:22,780
interesting thing if they and they their
surveys and say how good do you look and

3928
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:22,790
surveys and say how good do you look and
 

3929
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:26,770
surveys and say how good do you look and
how good do you feel and and that's the

3930
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:26,780
how good do you feel and and that's the
 

3931
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,900
how good do you feel and and that's the
highest survey the person now they not

3932
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:28,910
highest survey the person now they not
 

3933
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,700
highest survey the person now they not
look in the best yeah and they're not

3934
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:30,710
look in the best yeah and they're not
 

3935
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,860
look in the best yeah and they're not
feeling the best right maybe it's thirty

3936
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:32,870
feeling the best right maybe it's thirty
 

3937
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:34,750
feeling the best right maybe it's thirty
five that they're actually looking the

3938
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:34,760
five that they're actually looking the
 

3939
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,180
five that they're actually looking the
best and feeling the best but they rank

3940
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:37,190
best and feeling the best but they rank
 

3941
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:40,090
best and feeling the best but they rank
the highest at that point survey results

3942
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:40,100
the highest at that point survey results
 

3943
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,610
the highest at that point survey results
of being the highest so that seventy to

3944
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:42,620
of being the highest so that seventy to
 

3945
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:45,010
of being the highest so that seventy to
eighty period of time because it has to

3946
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:45,020
eighty period of time because it has to
 

3947
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,440
eighty period of time because it has to
do with an attitude on life then you

3948
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:47,450
do with an attitude on life then you
 

3949
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:49,870
do with an attitude on life then you
start to have grandkids Oh grandkids are

3950
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:49,880
start to have grandkids Oh grandkids are
 

3951
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,930
start to have grandkids Oh grandkids are
great and you start to experience that

3952
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:52,940
great and you start to experience that
 

3953
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,610
great and you start to experience that
transition well

3954
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:54,620
transition well
 

3955
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:56,740
transition well
so that's what the Ark of life pretty

3956
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:56,750
so that's what the Ark of life pretty
 

3957
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:59,860
so that's what the Ark of life pretty
much looks like in and I'm experiencing

3958
01:27:59,860 --> 01:27:59,870
much looks like in and I'm experiencing
 

3959
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:02,680
much looks like in and I'm experiencing
it you know that's good that when you

3960
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:02,690
it you know that's good that when you
 

3961
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:05,380
it you know that's good that when you
meditate we're all human or immortal

3962
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:05,390
meditate we're all human or immortal
 

3963
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:07,870
meditate we're all human or immortal
when you meditate it on your own

3964
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:07,880
when you meditate it on your own
 

3965
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,960
when you meditate it on your own
mortality having achieved a lot of

3966
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:10,970
mortality having achieved a lot of
 

3967
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:14,800
mortality having achieved a lot of
success on whatever dimension what do

3968
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:14,810
success on whatever dimension what do
 

3969
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:17,140
success on whatever dimension what do
you think is the meaning of it all the

3970
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:17,150
you think is the meaning of it all the
 

3971
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:19,360
you think is the meaning of it all the
meaning of our short existence on earth

3972
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:19,370
meaning of our short existence on earth
 

3973
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:24,010
meaning of our short existence on earth
as human beings I think that evolution

3974
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:24,020
as human beings I think that evolution
 

3975
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:26,110
as human beings I think that evolution
is the greatest force of in the universe

3976
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:26,120
is the greatest force of in the universe
 

3977
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:30,640
is the greatest force of in the universe
and that were all tiny bits of an

3978
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:30,650
and that were all tiny bits of an
 

3979
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:33,850
and that were all tiny bits of an
evolutionary type of process where it's

3980
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:33,860
evolutionary type of process where it's
 

3981
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,790
evolutionary type of process where it's
just matter and machines that go through

3982
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:36,800
just matter and machines that go through
 

3983
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:41,550
just matter and machines that go through
time and that we all have a deeply

3984
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:41,560
time and that we all have a deeply
 

3985
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:46,360
time and that we all have a deeply
embedded inclination to evolve and

3986
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:46,370
embedded inclination to evolve and
 

3987
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:49,770
embedded inclination to evolve and
contribute to evolution so I think it's

3988
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:49,780
contribute to evolution so I think it's
 

3989
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:52,870
contribute to evolution so I think it's
too personally evolved and contribute to

3990
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:52,880
too personally evolved and contribute to
 

3991
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,180
too personally evolved and contribute to
the evolution I could have predicted you

3992
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:55,190
the evolution I could have predicted you
 

3993
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:57,250
the evolution I could have predicted you
would answer that way it's brilliant and

3994
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:57,260
would answer that way it's brilliant and
 

3995
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:01,450
would answer that way it's brilliant and
exactly right and I think we've said it

3996
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:01,460
exactly right and I think we've said it
 

3997
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,460
exactly right and I think we've said it
before but I'll say it again you have a

3998
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:03,470
before but I'll say it again you have a
 

3999
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:05,590
before but I'll say it again you have a
lot of incredible videos out there that

4000
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:05,600
lot of incredible videos out there that
 

4001
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,960
lot of incredible videos out there that
people should definitely watch I don't

4002
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:07,970
people should definitely watch I don't
 

4003
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:09,820
people should definitely watch I don't
