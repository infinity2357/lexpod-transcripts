00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,390
it's a domed building
and and you can see it on the panorama

if he's not comparable to stalin he
still works as i said in those same

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,790
still works as i said in those same
buildings those same offices

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
the problems that stalin had

russia is smaller now

yeah lex when you don't when a war

doesn't go well
 

2495
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,589
doesn't go well
it looks like

2496
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:49,599
it looks like
 

2497
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,910
it looks like
lunacy to have launched it in the first

2498
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:51,920
lunacy to have launched it in the first
 

2499
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,150
lunacy to have launched it in the first
place does it ever go well

2500
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:54,160
place does it ever go well
 

2501
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,710
place does it ever go well
war never goes according to plan

00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:56,720
war never goes according to plan
 

2503
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,750
war never goes according to plan
all war is based upon miscalculation

2504
00:47:59,750 --> 00:47:59,760
all war is based upon miscalculation
 

2505
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,829
all war is based upon miscalculation
but not everybody is punished for their

2506
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:01,839
but not everybody is punished for their
 

2507
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,670
but not everybody is punished for their

2509
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,589
miscalculation
all aggressive war we're talking about

2510
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:05,599
all aggressive war we're talking about
 

2511
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,510
all aggressive war we're talking about
not defensive war

00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:07,520
not defensive war
 

2513
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,990
not defensive war
is based upon miscalculation

2514
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
is based upon miscalculation
 

2515
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,510
is based upon miscalculation
but you can adjust you can recalibrate

2516
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:13,520
but you can adjust you can recalibrate
 

2517
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,109
but you can adjust you can recalibrate
you know when when you're driving down

2518
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,119
you know when when you're driving down
 

2519
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,670
you know when when you're driving down
the road and that very annoying voice is

2520
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:17,680
the road and that very annoying voice is
 

2521
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,589
the road and that very annoying voice is
telling you in a thousand

2522
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
telling you in a thousand
 

2523
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,750
telling you in a thousand
feet make a right yeah and you fail to

2524
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
feet make a right yeah and you fail to
 

2525
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,230
feet make a right yeah and you fail to
make a right it recalibrates right yeah

2526
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
make a right it recalibrates right yeah
 

2527
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,790
make a right it recalibrates right yeah
it tells you okay now you know go uh

2528
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
it tells you okay now you know go uh
 

2529
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,829
it tells you okay now you know go uh
turn around or u-turn or make a left it

2530
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:31,839
turn around or u-turn or make a left it
 

2531
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,510
turn around or u-turn or make a left it
doesn't say you're an idiot and turn

2532
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,520
doesn't say you're an idiot and turn
 

2533
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,190
doesn't say you're an idiot and turn
around and make a u-turn but it does

2534
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,200
around and make a u-turn but it does
 

2535
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,870
around and make a u-turn but it does
recalibrate

2536
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:36,880
recalibrate
 

2537
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,109
recalibrate
so you can miscalculate and the problem

2538
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:39,119
so you can miscalculate and the problem
 

2539
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,349
so you can miscalculate and the problem
is not the miscalculation usually it's

2540
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:41,359
is not the miscalculation usually it's
 

2541
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,150
is not the miscalculation usually it's
the failure to do that adjustment

2542
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
the failure to do that adjustment
 

2543
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,349
the failure to do that adjustment
right

2544
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:45,359
right
 

2545
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,910
right
people i know who are hedge fund traders

2546
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:49,920
people i know who are hedge fund traders
 

2547
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,430
people i know who are hedge fund traders
they i asked them you know what's your

2548
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:51,440
they i asked them you know what's your
 

2549
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,829
they i asked them you know what's your
favorite trade and the line from them

2550
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:53,839
favorite trade and the line from them
 

2551
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,390
favorite trade and the line from them
all and this is a cliche is my favorite

2552
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
all and this is a cliche is my favorite
 

2553
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,790
all and this is a cliche is my favorite
trade is when i made a mistake

2554
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:58,800
trade is when i made a mistake
 

2555
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,710
trade is when i made a mistake
but i got out early

2556
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:00,720
but i got out early
 

2557
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,470
but i got out early
before all the carnage

2558
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:02,480
before all the carnage
 

2559
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,309
before all the carnage
so it's their favorite trade is not when

2560
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
so it's their favorite trade is not when
 

2561
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,309
so it's their favorite trade is not when
they made some brilliant choice

2562
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:06,319
they made some brilliant choice
 

2563
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,790
they made some brilliant choice
but it's when they miscalculated but

2564
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:08,800
but it's when they miscalculated but
 

2565
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,950
but it's when they miscalculated but
they reduced the consequences of their

2566
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:10,960
they reduced the consequences of their
 

2567
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,670
they reduced the consequences of their
miscalculation by recalibrating quickly

2568
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:13,680
miscalculation by recalibrating quickly
 

2569
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,710
miscalculation by recalibrating quickly
right

2570
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:14,720
right
 

2571
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,710
right
so let's talk about the calculation and

2572
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:16,720
so let's talk about the calculation and
 

2573
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,270
so let's talk about the calculation and
miscalculation of february

2574
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,280
miscalculation of february
 

2575
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,030
miscalculation of february
let's imagine lex that you've been

2576
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,040
let's imagine lex that you've been
 

2577
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,349
let's imagine lex that you've been
getting away with murder

2578
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:23,359
getting away with murder
 

2579
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,349
getting away with murder
i don't mean murder in a figurative

2580
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
i don't mean murder in a figurative
 

2581
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,309
i don't mean murder in a figurative
sense

2582
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:26,319
sense
 

2583
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,630
sense
i mean you've been murdering people

2584
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
i mean you've been murdering people
 

2585
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,630
i mean you've been murdering people
you've been murdering them domestically

2586
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640
you've been murdering them domestically
 

2587
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,470
you've been murdering them domestically
and you've been murdering them all

2588
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:32,480
and you've been murdering them all
 

2589
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,790
and you've been murdering them all
across europe and you've been murdering

2590
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
across europe and you've been murdering
 

2591
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,630
across europe and you've been murdering
them not just with for example

2592
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
them not just with for example
 

2593
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,069
them not just with for example
a car accident a staged car accident or

2594
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:42,079
a car accident a staged car accident or
 

2595
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,390
a car accident a staged car accident or
using a handgun

2596
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
using a handgun
 

2597
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,589
using a handgun
you use novichok

2598
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
you use novichok
 

2599
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,670
you use novichok
or you use some other

2600
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:49,680
or you use some other
 

2601
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,750

chemical weapon
 

2605
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,630
chemical weapon
and let's imagine that you did it and

2606
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
and let's imagine that you did it and
 

2607
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,630
and let's imagine that you did it and
nothing happened to you

2608
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:58,640
nothing happened to you
 

2609
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,309
nothing happened to you
it wasn't like you were removed from

2610
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:00,319
it wasn't like you were removed from
 

2611
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,270
it wasn't like you were removed from
power

2612
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:01,280
power
 

2613
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,910
power
it wasn't like you paid a personal price

2614
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
it wasn't like you paid a personal price
 

2615
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,990
it wasn't like you paid a personal price
sure maybe there was some sanctions on

2616
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
sure maybe there was some sanctions on
 

2617
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,750
sure maybe there was some sanctions on
your economy but you didn't pay the

2618
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:07,760
your economy but you didn't pay the
 

2619
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,589
your economy but you didn't pay the
price of those sanctions

2620
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:09,599
price of those sanctions
 

2621
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,430
price of those sanctions
little people paid the price of those

2622
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:11,440
little people paid the price of those
 

2623
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,549
little people paid the price of those
sanctions

2624
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:12,559
sanctions
 

2625
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,710
sanctions
other people in your country paid the

2626
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:14,720
other people in your country paid the
 

2627
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,270
other people in your country paid the
prices let's imagine not only were you

2628
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:17,280

the 90-something percent is also

the 90-something percent is also
 

3953
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,110
the 90-something percent is also
deserved fully deserved and the question

is how that all stabilizes
 

3957
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,030
is how that all stabilizes
it feels

3958
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:55,040
it feels
 

3959
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,030
it feels
like this

3960
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:57,040
like this

01:14:58,719 --> 01:14:59,910
set of events
i may be

i may be
 

3965

paying attention to twitter too much
 

3967
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:05,110
paying attention to twitter too much
which is a concern

3968
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:05,120
which is a concern
 

3969
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,870
which is a concern
of mine whether

3970
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:06,880
of mine whether
 

3971
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,430
of mine whether
the change i see is just surface level

3972
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:09,440
the change i see is just surface level
 

3973
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,630
the change i see is just surface level
or deep level but it seems like we're in

3974
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:12,640
or deep level but it seems like we're in
 

3975
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,950
or deep level but it seems like we're in
a new world that something dramatic has

a new world that something dramatic has

uh it's unclear what lesson china learns

4002
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:39,920
uh it's unclear what lesson china learns
 

4003
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,590
uh it's unclear what lesson china learns
from watching this well lesson india

learns from watching this both nations
 

4007
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,910

as far as you can get polls about

4008
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:45,920
as far as you can get polls about
 

4009
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,590
as far as you can get polls about
chinese population

4010
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:47,600
chinese population
 

4011
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,310
chinese population
but both nations are largely in support

4012
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:50,320
but both nations are largely in support
 

4013
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,669
but both nations are largely in support
of putin

4014

of putin
 

4015
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,950

supporting of putin
quietly i would maybe

4020
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:00,239
quietly i would maybe
 

4021
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:03,270
quietly i would maybe
elaborate a little bit on that point lex

4022
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:03,280
elaborate a little bit on that point lex
 

4023
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,990
elaborate a little bit on that point lex
i think you're right the the feeling

4024
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
i think you're right the the feeling
 

4025
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,310
i think you're right the the feeling
that we're in an inflection moment you

4026
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:08,320
that we're in an inflection moment you
 

4027
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,390
that we're in an inflection moment you
know an inflection point

4028
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:10,400
know an inflection point
 

4029
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,790
know an inflection point
i think that's widespread and i think

4030
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:12,800
i think that's widespread and i think
 

4031
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,110
i think that's widespread and i think
it's widespread for good reason we might

4032
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:15,120
it's widespread for good reason we might
 

4033
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,310
it's widespread for good reason we might
be

4034
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,320
be
 

4035
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,229

modesty

4042
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:23,440
modesty
 

4043
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,390
modesty
about

4044
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:24,400
about
 

4045
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,070
about
where it's going

4046
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:26,080
where it's going
 

4047
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,229
where it's going
and how hard it is to predict where this

4048
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
and how hard it is to predict where this
 

4049
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,430
and how hard it is to predict where this
might go

4050
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
might go
 

4051
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,830
might go
it's only an inflection point if the

4052
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:31,840
it's only an inflection point if the
 

4053
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,669
it's only an inflection point if the
trends continue

4054
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:33,679
trends continue
 

4055
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,910
trends continue
right if the trends endure

4056
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:35,920
right if the trends endure
 

4057
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,830
right if the trends endure
there are plenty of non-inflection

4058
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:37,840
there are plenty of non-inflection
 

4059
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,870
there are plenty of non-inflection
points

4060
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:38,880
points
 

4061
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,189
points
after 9 11 the whole world rallied

4062
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:41,199
after 9 11 the whole world rallied
 

4063
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,270
after 9 11 the whole world rallied
around the united states after it was

4064
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:43,280
around the united states after it was
 

4065
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,790
around the united states after it was
attacked

4066
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:44,800
attacked
 

4067
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,910
attacked
after the

4068
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:45,920
after the
 

4069
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,750
after the
the bombing of the towers here in new

4070
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:47,760
the bombing of the towers here in new
 

4071
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,110
the bombing of the towers here in new
york city and the hitting of the

4072
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:49,120
york city and the hitting of the
 

4073
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,870
york city and the hitting of the
pentagon

4074
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:50,880
pentagon
 

4075
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,950
pentagon
and and that didn't last

4076
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:52,960
and and that didn't last
 

4077
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,790
and and that didn't last
and it was not really an inflection

4078
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:54,800
and it was not really an inflection
 

4079
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,390
and it was not really an inflection
point was it

4080
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:56,400
point was it
 

4081
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,430
point was it
it felt like it might be but it wasn't

4082
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
it felt like it might be but it wasn't
 

4083
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,510
it felt like it might be but it wasn't
and so this is not a comparable moment

4084
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,520
and so this is not a comparable moment
 

4085
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,070
and so this is not a comparable moment
in terms of what happened

4086
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
in terms of what happened
 

4087
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,030
in terms of what happened
but it has the feeling that it might be

a watershed
 

4091
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,669

so it's not a multi-polar world
we talked already about the

we could talk about lex right
and so it's a western dominated world

4236
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:57,520
and so it's a western dominated world

01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:31,990
and so this is something which we fail
to address

4422
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:32,000
to address
 

4423
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,990
to address
it's very hard to address it's very hard

4424
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:34,000
it's very hard to address it's very hard
 

4425
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,790
it's very hard to address it's very hard
to reform international institutions

4426
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:36,800
to reform international institutions
 

4427
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,669
to reform international institutions
it's very hard to share power

4428
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:39,679
it's very hard to share power
 

4429
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,669
it's very hard to share power
it's very hard to acknowledge that you

4430
01:23:41,669 --> 01:23:41,679
it's very hard to acknowledge that you
 

4431
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:44,070
it's very hard to acknowledge that you
have too much power

4432
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,080
have too much power
 

4433
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,950
have too much power
and that maybe having too much power

4434
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:46,960
and that maybe having too much power
 

4435
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,790
and that maybe having too much power
is not good not only for the rest of the

4436
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:48,800
is not good not only for the rest of the
 

4437
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,110
is not good not only for the rest of the
world but for yourself

4438
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:51,120
world but for yourself
 

4439
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,590
world but for yourself
and so it's great to rediscover the west

4440
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600
and so it's great to rediscover the west
 

4441
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,110
and so it's great to rediscover the west
and rediscover its values and rediscover

4442
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,120
and rediscover its values and rediscover
 

4443
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,510
and rediscover its values and rediscover
its authority and credibility

4444
01:23:59,510 --> 01:23:59,520
its authority and credibility
 

4445
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,790
its authority and credibility
and power

4446
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:00,800
and power
 

4447
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,270
and power
but it's that's not sufficient so we

4448
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:03,280
but it's that's not sufficient so we
 

4449
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,550
but it's that's not sufficient so we
know this now

4450
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:04,560
know this now
 

4451
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,189
know this now
we know that the rest of the world

4452
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:07,199
we know that the rest of the world
 

4453
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,110
we know that the rest of the world
is not necessarily

4454
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:09,120
is not necessarily
 

4455
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,750
is not necessarily
jumping on the western bandwagon

4456
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
jumping on the western bandwagon
 

4457
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,790
jumping on the western bandwagon
right to condemn russia for its actions

4458
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:14,800
right to condemn russia for its actions
 

4459
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,629
right to condemn russia for its actions
because the west can

4460
01:24:16,629 --> 01:24:16,639
because the west can
 

4461
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,270
because the west can
do things like sanction your central

4462

must then
 

5409
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,510
must then
insert the codes

they're actually right there and so you
 

5517
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,430
they're actually right there and so you
fire that weapon on ukrainian territory

5518

fire that weapon on ukrainian territory
 

5519
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,750
fire that weapon on ukrainian territory
and you can get the fallout

5520
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:11,760
and you can get the fallout
 

5521
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,229
and you can get the fallout
just like the chernobyl fallout

which is how the
 

5527
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,390
which is how the
we got the kremlin 2 finally

5528
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:20,400
we got the kremlin 2 finally
 

5529
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,149
we got the kremlin 2 finally
first they denied they said oh we don't

first they denied they said oh we don't
 

5531
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:23,910
first they denied they said oh we don't
know why there's a big nuclear cloud

5532
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:23,920
know why there's a big nuclear cloud
 

5533
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,910
know why there's a big nuclear cloud
over sweden we don't know where that

5534
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:25,920
over sweden we don't know where that
 

5535
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,229
over sweden we don't know where that
came from but eventually they admitted

came from but eventually they admitted
it

it
 

5539
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,310
it
so russia can't actually use a nuclear

5540
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:32,320
so russia can't actually use a nuclear
 

5541

5729
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,149
and so a disintegration of the russian
military because there are orders that

5730
01:48:20,149 --> 01:48:20,159
military because there are orders that
 

5731
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,229
military because there are orders that
they either can't implement or don't

5732
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:22,239
they either can't implement or don't
 

5733
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:24,070
they either can't implement or don't
want to implement

5734
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:24,080
want to implement
 

5735
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:27,510
want to implement
is also not excluded and so you have

5736
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:27,520
is also not excluded and so you have
 

5737
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,830
is also not excluded and so you have
these two big variables the ukrainian

5738
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:29,840
these two big variables the ukrainian
 

5739
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,070
these two big variables the ukrainian
army in the field and its ability to

5740
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:32,080
army in the field and its ability to
 

5741
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:35,109
army in the field and its ability to
move from defense to offense at scale

5742
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:35,119
move from defense to offense at scale
 

5743
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:37,189
move from defense to offense at scale
and we're going to test that soon

5744
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:37,199
and we're going to test that soon
 

5745
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,109
and we're going to test that soon
and then the russian ability in the

5746
01:48:39,109 --> 01:48:39,119
and then the russian ability in the
 

5747
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,189
and then the russian ability in the
field to hold together

5748
01:48:41,189 --> 01:48:41,199
field to hold together
 

5749
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:44,790
field to hold together
in a war of conquest and aggression

5750
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:44,800
in a war of conquest and aggression
 

5751
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,910
in a war of conquest and aggression
where they're they're conscripts or

5752
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:47,920
where they're they're conscripts or
 

5753
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:51,109
where they're they're conscripts or
they're fed dog food or or or they don't

5754
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:51,119
they're fed dog food or or or they don't
 

5755
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,510
they're fed dog food or or or they don't
have any weapons anymore because there's

5756
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:53,520
have any weapons anymore because there's
 

5757
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,750
have any weapons anymore because there's
no resupply and

5758
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:55,760
no resupply and
 

5759
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:58,070
no resupply and
so so the disintegration of the army

5760
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:58,080
so so the disintegration of the army
 

5761
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,310
so so the disintegration of the army
can't be excluded and then of course all

5762
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:00,320
can't be excluded and then of course all
 

5763
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,709
can't be excluded and then of course all
bets are off on the putin regime

5764
01:49:02,709 --> 01:49:02,719
bets are off on the putin regime
 

5765
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:04,390
bets are off on the putin regime
more long term

5766
01:49:04,390 --> 01:49:04,400
more long term
 

5767
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,310
more long term
there are these technology export

5768
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:06,320
there are these technology export
 

5769
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,669
there are these technology export
controls

5770
01:49:07,669 --> 01:49:07,679
controls
 

5771
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:09,109
controls
we were talking about how the

5772
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:09,119
we were talking about how the
 

5773
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,350
we were talking about how the
military-industrial complex in russia is

5774
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,360
military-industrial complex in russia is
 

5775
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,950
military-industrial complex in russia is
dependent

5776
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:12,960
dependent
 

5777
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,550
dependent
on foreign component parts and software

5778
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:16,560
on foreign component parts and software
 

5779
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,270
on foreign component parts and software
and so if you have export controls

5780
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:19,280
and so if you have export controls
 

5781
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:21,589
and so if you have export controls
and you have firms voluntarily even when

5782
01:49:21,589 --> 01:49:21,599
and you have firms voluntarily even when
 

5783
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:24,149
and you have firms voluntarily even when
they don't fall under export controls

5784
01:49:24,149 --> 01:49:24,159
they don't fall under export controls
 

5785
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:26,709
they don't fall under export controls
leaving russian business refusing to do

5786
01:49:26,709 --> 01:49:26,719
leaving russian business refusing to do

business with russia
 

5789
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:31,109
business with russia
and we see this not just in the civilian

5790
01:49:31,109 --> 01:49:31,119
and we see this not just in the civilian
 

5791
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:33,750
and we see this not just in the civilian
sector like with mcdonald's or many

5792
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:33,760

01:49:37,669 --> 01:49:37,679
we see this in the key
 

5797
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:40,310
we see this in the key
areas like the oil industry

5798
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:40,320
areas like the oil industry
 

5799
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:43,189
areas like the oil industry

with the executives fleeing
 

5801
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:45,510
with the executives fleeing
that is the western executives fleeing

that is the western executives fleeing

we see a lot of stuff under tremendous

01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:06,800
we see a lot of stuff under tremendous
 

5819
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,589
we see a lot of stuff under tremendous
stress and in the long term there's no

5820
01:50:09,589 --> 01:50:09,599
stress and in the long term there's no
 

5821
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:11,030
stress and in the long term there's no
obvious way

5822
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:11,040
obvious way
 

5823
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,149
obvious way
they can rebuild the military-industrial

5824
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:14,159
they can rebuild the military-industrial
 

5825
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:17,669
they can rebuild the military-industrial
complex to produce those weapons

5826

complex to produce those weapons
 

5827
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:19,910
complex to produce those weapons

that they can't get anymore and there
 

5831
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,830
that they can't get anymore and there
are no domestic

5832
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:22,840
are no domestic
 

5833
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,229
are no domestic
substitutes on the immediate horizon

5834
01:50:26,229 --> 01:50:26,239
substitutes on the immediate horizon
 

5835
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:27,430

that's

5836
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:27,440
that's

01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,750
that's
at the earliest a two-year

at the earliest a two-year
 

5839
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,229
at the earliest a two-year
proposition to have domestic substitutes

5840
01:50:32,229 --> 01:50:32,239
proposition to have domestic substitutes
 

5841
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:33,430
proposition to have domestic substitutes
and for some things like

5842
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:33,440
and for some things like
 

5843
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,270
and for some things like
microelectronics

5844
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:35,280
microelectronics
 

5845
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:37,270
microelectronics
they've never had domestic substitutes

5846
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:37,280
they've never had domestic substitutes
 

5847
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,189
they've never had domestic substitutes
going back to the soviet times as you

know well

01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:43,189
know well
and so there's that pressure

5852

and so there's that pressure
 

5853
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:45,589
and so there's that pressure

you're feeling that pain as we speak

5866
01:50:56,870 --> 01:50:56,880
you're feeling that pain as we speak
 

5867
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:01,830
you're feeling that pain as we speak
and you're wondering about the strategy

5868
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:01,840

 

5869
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,310

let me ask you about

5870
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:04,320
let me ask you about
 

5871
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,390
let me ask you about
again the echoes of history

5872
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:06,400
again the echoes of history
 

5873
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,629
again the echoes of history
and it frustrates me in part when people

5874
01:51:08,629 --> 01:51:08,639
and it frustrates me in part when people
 

5875
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:10,310
and it frustrates me in part when people
draw these parallels

5876
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:10,320
draw these parallels
 

5877
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,149
draw these parallels
but maybe there is some deep insight

5878
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:12,159
but maybe there is some deep insight
 

5879
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:14,149
but maybe there is some deep insight
about those parallels

5880
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:14,159
about those parallels
 

5881
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:17,030
about those parallels
so there's um

5882
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:17,040
so there's um
 

5883
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:26,310
so there's um
there's a song that goes let's

5884
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:26,320

 

5885
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,310

operation barbarossa the

operation barbarossa the
the bombing of kiev by hitler

5888
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:31,920
the bombing of kiev by hitler
 

5889
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,270
the bombing of kiev by hitler
there is sort of an eerie parallel

5890
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
there is sort of an eerie parallel
 

5891
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,189
there is sort of an eerie parallel

01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:58,709
of this that do echo in the actions of
vladimir putin

5910
01:51:58,709 --> 01:51:58,719
vladimir putin
 

5911
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:01,669
vladimir putin
and more specifically

5912
01:52:01,669 --> 01:52:01,679
and more specifically
 

5913
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:04,070
and more specifically
do you think the vladimir putin is a war

5914
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:04,080
do you think the vladimir putin is a war
 

5915

do you think the vladimir putin is a war
criminal

5916
01:52:06,149 --> 01:52:06,159
criminal
 

5917
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:08,229
criminal
can that label be assigned to the

5918
01:52:08,229 --> 01:52:08,239
can that label be assigned to the
 

5919
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:10,790
can that label be assigned to the
actions of this man

5920
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:10,800
actions of this man
 

5921
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:14,390

so war criminal is a legal determination

5922
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:14,400
so war criminal is a legal determination
 

5923
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,750
so war criminal is a legal determination
and it requires evidence and due process

5924
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:17,760
and it requires evidence and due process
 

5925
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,270
and it requires evidence and due process
and the ability to defend oneself

5926
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:21,280
and the ability to defend oneself
 

5927
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,030
and the ability to defend oneself
we don't just decide

they can be a suspected war criminal
 

5937
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,990
they can be a suspected war criminal
and we can gather evidence to try to

prosecute that case
 

5941
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,709
prosecute that case
and then

5942
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:36,719
and then
 

5943
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:39,669

victims does it happen in the hog
 

5953
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,030
victims does it happen in the hog
because there's an international

01:52:49,030 --> 01:52:49,040
because there's an international
 

5955
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:51,030
because there's an international
criminal court there

5956

criminal court there
 

5957
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,109
criminal court there
does it happen inside russia because

5958
01:52:53,109 --> 01:52:53,119
does it happen inside russia because
 

5959
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:56,070
does it happen inside russia because
there's regime change at some point and

so those are all important questions
that have to be pursued with resources

5970

and it's
 

6015
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:04,629
and it's
very deeply troubling to think that this

6016
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
very deeply troubling to think that this
 

6017
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:06,870
very deeply troubling to think that this
could happen again

6018
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:06,880

6019
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,430

and there's a bizarre sense
that the russians

once again is much smaller
 

6231
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:08,229
once again is much smaller
the size of the armies here

they're not in the
many hundred eight hundred thousand

seven hundred thousand a million two a
million four that's not what we're

million four that's not what we're
 

6241
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,910

talking about today
 

6243
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,669
talking about today
but the weapons

6244
01:58:19,669 --> 01:58:19,679
but the weapons
 

6245
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:21,510
but the weapons
the cruise missiles

6246
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:21,520
the cruise missiles
 

6247
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:22,390
the cruise missiles
right

6248
01:58:22,390 --> 01:58:22,400
right
 

6249
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,149
right
artillery fire

6250
01:58:24,149 --> 01:58:24,159
artillery fire
 

6251
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:26,390
artillery fire
you know artillery fire used to be very

6252
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:26,400
you know artillery fire used to be very
 

6253
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:29,270
you know artillery fire used to be very
inaccurate and it was like saturation

6254
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:29,280
inaccurate and it was like saturation
 

6255
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,270
inaccurate and it was like saturation
you were just fired towards the enemy

6256
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:31,280
you were just fired towards the enemy
 

6257
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,030
you were just fired towards the enemy
lines and if you hit something you hit

6258
01:58:33,030 --> 01:58:33,040
lines and if you hit something you hit
 

6259
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:35,030
lines and if you hit something you hit
something and if you didn't you just

6260
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:35,040
something and if you didn't you just
 

6261
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:36,790
something and if you didn't you just
kept firing

6262
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:36,800
kept firing
 

6263
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,430
kept firing
now you have drones lex

6264
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:39,440
now you have drones lex
 

6265
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:43,910
now you have drones lex
and so artillery fire is now sniper fire

6266
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:43,920
and so artillery fire is now sniper fire
 

6267
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,830
and so artillery fire is now sniper fire
because you can coordinate the direction

6268
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:45,840
because you can coordinate the direction
 

6269
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,350
because you can coordinate the direction
of the artillery fire with the drones

6270
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:49,360
of the artillery fire with the drones
 

6271
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:51,510
of the artillery fire with the drones
the drones can take a picture and show

6272
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:51,520
the drones can take a picture and show
 

6273
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,270
the drones can take a picture and show
you where the enemy is precisely located

6274
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:55,280
you where the enemy is precisely located
 

6275
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:58,470
you where the enemy is precisely located
and you can align that artillery to hit

6276
01:58:58,470 --> 01:58:58,480
and you can align that artillery to hit
 

6277
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,550
and you can align that artillery to hit
them instead of just indiscriminately

6278
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,560
them instead of just indiscriminately
 

6279
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,830
them instead of just indiscriminately
bombing an area a territory

6280
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:03,840
bombing an area a territory
 

6281
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,870
bombing an area a territory
and the nato supplied artillery goes

6282
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:06,880
and the nato supplied artillery goes
 

6283
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,149
and the nato supplied artillery goes
really far

6284
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:08,159
really far
 

6285
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:11,350
really far
and you can fire into russian positions

6286
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:11,360
and you can fire into russian positions
 

6287
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:14,390
and you can fire into russian positions
and yourself not be exposed to russian

6288
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:14,400
and yourself not be exposed to russian
 

6289
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:16,390
and yourself not be exposed to russian
fire because your

6290
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:16,400
fire because your
 

6291
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:17,669
fire because your
artillery

6292
01:59:17,669 --> 01:59:17,679
artillery
 

6293
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:20,470
artillery
fires farther than theirs

6294
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:20,480
fires farther than theirs
 

6295
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,070
fires farther than theirs
so that's coming

6296
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:22,080
so that's coming
 

6297
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,550
so that's coming
and we're going to see that in action

6298
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:24,560
and we're going to see that in action
 

6299
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:25,750
and we're going to see that in action
and so

6300
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:25,760
and so
 

6301
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,750
and so
the scale is not the same but the

6302
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:27,760
the scale is not the same but the
 

6303
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,910
the scale is not the same but the
weapons the precision of some of the

6304
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:29,920
weapons the precision of some of the
 

6305
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,910
weapons the precision of some of the
weapons and some of the nato we're not

6306
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:31,920
weapons and some of the nato we're not
 

6307
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,830
weapons and some of the nato we're not
sending all of our stuff

6308
01:59:33,830 --> 01:59:33,840
sending all of our stuff
 

6309
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:36,149
sending all of our stuff
but as i said the dynamic is russia

willingness to risk their lives
 

6325
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:54,629
willingness to risk their lives
is really so impressive and the reason

6326
01:59:54,629 --> 01:59:54,639
is really so impressive and the reason
 

6327
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:56,709
is really so impressive and the reason
that we it's

6328

6331
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:01,910
it's our duty we're obliged to supply
those weapons and so the russians don't

6332
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:01,920
those weapons and so the russians don't
 

6333
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:05,910
those weapons and so the russians don't
have that resupply and the ukrainians do

6334
02:00:05,910 --> 02:00:05,920
have that resupply and the ukrainians do
 

6335
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,750
have that resupply and the ukrainians do
and so the russians are now digging in

but so so there are these things that we
 

6367
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,510
but so so there are these things that we
can't predict but there are these things

can't predict but there are these things
 

6369
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:49,830
can't predict but there are these things
we're watching and watching closely

6371
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:52,149

and on top of that something that's not

6372
02:00:52,149 --> 02:00:52,159
and on top of that something that's not
 

6373
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:54,070
and on top of that something that's not
in world war ii or for the most part

in world war ii or for the most part
 

6375
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,149
in world war ii or for the most part
it's cyber attacks and cyber warfare

6376
02:00:56,149 --> 02:00:56,159
it's cyber attacks and cyber warfare
 

6377
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:57,109
it's cyber attacks and cyber warfare
which

6378
02:00:57,109 --> 02:00:57,119
which
 

6379
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:58,870
which
is uh

6380
02:00:58,870 --> 02:00:58,880
is uh
 

6381
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:03,589
is uh
much less perhaps

6382
02:01:03,589 --> 02:01:03,599

 

6383
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:05,669

convertible into human words because it

6384
02:01:05,669 --> 02:01:05,679
convertible into human words because it
 

6385
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:08,390
convertible into human words because it
happens so quickly such large scales so

6386
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:08,400
happens so quickly such large scales so
 

6387
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:09,910
happens so quickly such large scales so
difficult to trace and all those kinds

6388
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:09,920
difficult to trace and all those kinds
 

6389
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:12,149
difficult to trace and all those kinds
of things it's not bullets it's

6390
02:01:12,149 --> 02:01:12,159
of things it's not bullets it's
 

6391
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:14,390
of things it's not bullets it's
uh electrical signals and the that's

6392
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:14,400
uh electrical signals and the that's
 

6393
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,790
uh electrical signals and the that's
yeah but those ukrainian people they're

6394
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:16,800
yeah but those ukrainian people they're
 

6395
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,310
yeah but those ukrainian people they're
like ulex

6396
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:18,320
like ulex
 

6397
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,589
like ulex
they're young

6403
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,790
proficient
yeah and they've been amazing

6404
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:24,800
yeah and they've been amazing
 

6405

6406
02:01:27,109 --> 02:01:27,119
you know they spent those teenage years
 

6407
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:30,390
you know they spent those teenage years
in the basement yeah playing video games

6408
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:30,400
in the basement yeah playing video games
 

6409
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,870
in the basement yeah playing video games
not turns out it's useful after all it

6410
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:32,880
not turns out it's useful after all it
 

6411
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:35,430
not turns out it's useful after all it
turns out it's more than useful you can

6412
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:35,440
turns out it's more than useful you can
 

6413
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,430
turns out it's more than useful you can
save your country that way

6414
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:37,440
save your country that way
 

6415
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,830
save your country that way
and so they're not alone they're getting

6416
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:39,840
and so they're not alone they're getting
 

6417
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,030
and so they're not alone they're getting
support

6418
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:41,040
support
 

6419
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:43,270
support
and that support is important

6420
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:43,280
and that support is important
 

6421
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:46,149
and that support is important
but really predominantly it's ukrainians

6422
02:01:46,149 --> 02:01:46,159
but really predominantly it's ukrainians
 

6423
02:01:46,159 --> 02:01:48,149
but really predominantly it's ukrainians
on the cyber battlefield

6424
02:01:48,149 --> 02:01:48,159
on the cyber battlefield
 

6425
02:01:48,159 --> 02:01:49,669
on the cyber battlefield
and their skills have been very

6426
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:49,679
and their skills have been very
 

6427
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:51,350
and their skills have been very
impressive and they've been preparing

6428
02:01:51,350 --> 02:01:51,360
impressive and they've been preparing
 

6429
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,430
impressive and they've been preparing
for this for a number of years

6430
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:53,440
for this for a number of years
 

6431
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,750
for this for a number of years
and they have a whole army of young

6432
02:01:55,750 --> 02:01:55,760
and they have a whole army of young
 

6433
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:56,709
and they have a whole army of young
people

6434
02:01:56,709 --> 02:01:56,719
people
 

6435
02:01:56,719 --> 02:01:58,390
people
on the cyber side

6436
02:01:58,390 --> 02:01:58,400
on the cyber side
 

6437
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:00,550
on the cyber side
it's their civilian population these are

6438
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:00,560
it's their civilian population these are
 

6439
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:02,629
it's their civilian population these are
not people conscripted into the military

6440
02:02:02,629 --> 02:02:02,639
not people conscripted into the military
 

6441
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:05,750
not people conscripted into the military
or volunteering wearing the uniform

6442
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:05,760
or volunteering wearing the uniform
 

6443
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:07,910
or volunteering wearing the uniform
and so even in cyber warfare the

6444
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:07,920
and so even in cyber warfare the
 

6445
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,750
and so even in cyber warfare the
ukrainians have been extremely

6446
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:09,760
ukrainians have been extremely
 

6447
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:11,350
ukrainians have been extremely
impressive

6448
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:11,360
impressive
 

6449
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,589
impressive
and so let's remember

6450
02:02:13,589 --> 02:02:13,599
and so let's remember
 

6451
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:14,390
and so let's remember
that

6452
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:14,400
that
 

6453
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,790
that
all of these aspects

6454
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:16,800
all of these aspects
 

6455
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:18,550
all of these aspects
of warfare

6456
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:18,560
of warfare
 

6457
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,629
of warfare
whether it's

6458
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:20,639
whether it's
 

6459
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:23,109
whether it's
how far your cruise missiles go and how

6460
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:23,119
how far your cruise missiles go and how
 

6461
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:24,709
how far your cruise missiles go and how
accurate they are

6462
02:02:24,709 --> 02:02:24,719
accurate they are
 

6463
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:29,109
accurate they are
what size your cyber capabilities are

6464
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:29,119
what size your cyber capabilities are
 

6465
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:31,750
what size your cyber capabilities are
it's really ultimately about the people

6466
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:31,760
it's really ultimately about the people
 

6467
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:34,070
it's really ultimately about the people
it's about the human capital

6468
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:34,080
it's about the human capital
 

6469
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,830
it's about the human capital
right it's it's about

6470
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:35,840
right it's it's about
 

6471
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:38,390
right it's it's about
the their willingness

6472
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:38,400
the their willingness
 

6473
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,070
the their willingness
their skill level but also their

6474
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:40,080
their skill level but also their
 

6475
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,149
their skill level but also their
willingness to fight and to put their

willingness to fight and to put their
 

6477
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:44,149
willingness to fight and to put their
lives on the line and there's no

lives on the line and there's no
 

6479
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,629
lives on the line and there's no
substitute for that and so what's called

6480
02:02:46,629 --> 02:02:46,639
substitute for that and so what's called
 

6481
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:48,229
substitute for that and so what's called
morale

6482
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:48,239
morale
 

6483
02:02:48,239 --> 02:02:51,510

that's really the ultimately decisive

6486
02:02:54,149 --> 02:02:54,159
that's really the ultimately decisive
 

6487
02:02:54,159 --> 02:02:58,870

02:03:40,159 --> 02:03:42,229
that's a really big lesson
that we need to absorb in our own

should that be granted
 

7045
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:46,229

china had this brilliant grand strategy
 

7057
02:13:57,760 --> 02:13:59,030
china had this brilliant grand strategy
which was

7058
02:13:59,030 --> 02:13:59,040
which was
 

7059

because america is hegemonic america
 

7063
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:06,390
because america is hegemonic america
wants to control the world america will

wants to control the world america will
never let china rise america will do

7066
02:14:08,629 --> 02:14:08,639

02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,280
alive then i see
 

7543
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,510
alive then i see
the war behind us

7544

i see
 

7547
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:11,270
i see
uh prosperity on the horizon yes

inflation in germany and

7550
02:23:13,270 --> 02:23:13,280
inflation in germany and
 

7551
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:15,349
inflation in germany and
and some many other

uh difficult issues but there are more
 

7555
02:23:18,160 --> 02:23:20,070

02:23:20,070 --> 02:23:20,080
democracies now than there were before
 

7557
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:23,030
democracies now than there were before
the war and the old empires are gone

7558
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:23,040
the war and the old empires are gone
 

7559
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:25,349
the war and the old empires are gone
and there's a cultural efflorescence and

7560
02:23:25,349 --> 02:23:25,359
and there's a cultural efflorescence and
 

7561
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:27,830
and there's a cultural efflorescence and
there's modernism in the arts and

7562
02:23:27,830 --> 02:23:27,840
there's modernism in the arts and
 

7563
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:29,670
there's modernism in the arts and
and there's women entering the public

and there's women entering the public
 

7565
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:31,590
and there's women entering the public
sphere and there's all this fantastic

7566
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:31,600
sphere and there's all this fantastic
 

7567
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:34,710
sphere and there's all this fantastic
new technology like automobiles and

7568
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:34,720
new technology like automobiles and
 

7569
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:38,550
new technology like automobiles and
i'm looking at the future from 1922 and

7570
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:38,560
i'm looking at the future from 1922 and
 

7571
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:40,550
i'm looking at the future from 1922 and
and i'm not seeing the great depression

7572
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:40,560
and i'm not seeing the great depression
 

7573
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:42,389
and i'm not seeing the great depression
and i'm not seeing world war ii and i'm

7574
02:23:42,389 --> 02:23:42,399
and i'm not seeing world war ii and i'm
 

7575
02:23:42,399 --> 02:23:44,630
and i'm not seeing world war ii and i'm
not seeing the holocaust

7576
02:23:44,630 --> 02:23:44,640
not seeing the holocaust
 

7577
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,469
not seeing the holocaust
because

7578
02:23:46,469 --> 02:23:46,479
because
 

7579
02:23:46,479 --> 02:23:48,790
because
i don't predict the future and nobody in

7580
02:23:48,790 --> 02:23:48,800
i don't predict the future and nobody in
 

7581
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:52,070
i don't predict the future and nobody in
1922 could see that future although

7582
02:23:52,070 --> 02:23:52,080
1922 could see that future although
 

7583
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:54,230
1922 could see that future although
i guess there were some clairvoyance who

7584
02:23:54,230 --> 02:23:54,240
i guess there were some clairvoyance who
 

7585
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:56,070
i guess there were some clairvoyance who
predicted it but

7586
02:23:56,070 --> 02:23:56,080
predicted it but
 

7587
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:58,070
predicted it but
but you're not one of them yeah i'm not

7588
02:23:58,070 --> 02:23:58,080
but you're not one of them yeah i'm not
 

7589
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:00,469
but you're not one of them yeah i'm not
one of them and and but but this is what

7590
02:24:00,469 --> 02:24:00,479
one of them and and but but this is what
 

7591
02:24:00,479 --> 02:24:03,190
one of them and and but but this is what
i know lex from studying history

7592
02:24:03,190 --> 02:24:03,200
i know lex from studying history
 

7593
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:06,950
i know lex from studying history
what i know is stuff happens

7594
02:24:06,950 --> 02:24:06,960
what i know is stuff happens
 

7595
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:09,270
what i know is stuff happens
in other words it's very deep insight

7596
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:09,280
in other words it's very deep insight
 

7597
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:10,710
in other words it's very deep insight
in other words like

7598
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:10,720
in other words like
 

7599
02:24:10,720 --> 02:24:13,510
in other words like
we're watching ukraine war right now

7600
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:13,520
we're watching ukraine war right now
 

7601
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:15,510
we're watching ukraine war right now
and all of our attention is focused on

7602
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:15,520
and all of our attention is focused on
 

7603
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:16,790
and all of our attention is focused on
that

7604
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:16,800
that
 

7605
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:18,469
that
and it's like the economists say in

7606
02:24:18,469 --> 02:24:18,479
and it's like the economists say in
 

7607
02:24:18,479 --> 02:24:20,309
and it's like the economists say in
their textbooks when their their

7608
02:24:20,309 --> 02:24:20,319
their textbooks when their their
 

7609
02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:22,309
their textbooks when their their
powerful models

7610
02:24:22,309 --> 02:24:22,319
powerful models
 

7611
02:24:22,319 --> 02:24:23,910
powerful models
are employed

7612
02:24:23,910 --> 02:24:23,920
are employed
 

7613
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:26,070
are employed
and there's this line that says

7614
02:24:26,070 --> 02:24:26,080
and there's this line that says
 

7615
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:27,270
and there's this line that says
all

7616
02:24:27,270 --> 02:24:27,280
all
 

7617
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:31,110
all
other factors held constant comma

7618
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:31,120
other factors held constant comma
 

7619
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:33,270
other factors held constant comma
and then the model works

7620
02:24:33,270 --> 02:24:33,280
and then the model works
 

7621
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,030
and then the model works
and you get this really great result

7622
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:35,040
and you get this really great result
 

7623
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:38,150
and you get this really great result
it's very powerful predictor and

7624
02:24:38,150 --> 02:24:38,160
it's very powerful predictor and
 

7625
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:40,070
it's very powerful predictor and
analysis the model

7626
02:24:40,070 --> 02:24:40,080
analysis the model
 

7627
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:42,550
analysis the model
and and the whole game is all other

7628
02:24:42,550 --> 02:24:42,560
and and the whole game is all other
 

7629
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:45,270
and and the whole game is all other
factors held constant

7630
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:45,280
factors held constant
 

7631
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:47,270
factors held constant
so the russia ukraine war that we've

7632
02:24:47,270 --> 02:24:47,280
so the russia ukraine war that we've
 

7633
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:49,030
so the russia ukraine war that we've
been discussing and this could happen

7634
02:24:49,030 --> 02:24:49,040
been discussing and this could happen
 

7635
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:50,469
been discussing and this could happen
and that could happen

7636
02:24:50,469 --> 02:24:50,479
and that could happen
 

7637
02:24:50,479 --> 02:24:52,150
and that could happen
but you know what stuff could happen

7638
02:24:52,150 --> 02:24:52,160
but you know what stuff could happen
 

7639
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:53,030
but you know what stuff could happen
like

7640
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:53,040
like
 

7641
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:54,870
like
for example

7642
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:54,880
for example
 

7643
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:57,030
for example
the israeli government could decide this

7644
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:57,040
the israeli government could decide this
 

7645
02:24:57,040 --> 02:25:00,070
the israeli government could decide this
summer that it's going to bomb iran

7646
02:25:00,070 --> 02:25:00,080
summer that it's going to bomb iran
 

7647
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:01,990
summer that it's going to bomb iran
because no israeli government will

7648
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:02,000
because no israeli government will
 

7649
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,670
because no israeli government will
tolerate iran acquiring a nuclear weapon

7650
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:05,680
tolerate iran acquiring a nuclear weapon
 

7651
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:07,750
tolerate iran acquiring a nuclear weapon
and since president trump

7652
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:07,760
and since president trump
 

7653
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:12,070
and since president trump
exited unilaterally exited from the

7654
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:12,080
exited unilaterally exited from the
 

7655
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:14,389
exited unilaterally exited from the
multi-power nuclear agreement

7656
02:25:14,389 --> 02:25:14,399
multi-power nuclear agreement
 

7657
02:25:14,399 --> 02:25:16,469
multi-power nuclear agreement
iran is now much closer to the bomb than

7658
02:25:16,469 --> 02:25:16,479
iran is now much closer to the bomb than
 

7659
02:25:16,479 --> 02:25:18,150
iran is now much closer to the bomb than
they were

7660
02:25:18,150 --> 02:25:18,160
they were
 

7661
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:19,670
they were
when they were still in when the united

7662
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:19,680
when they were still in when the united
 

7663
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:21,990
when they were still in when the united
states was still in that agreement

7664
02:25:21,990 --> 02:25:22,000
states was still in that agreement
 

7665
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,750
states was still in that agreement
and you tell me the israeli government

7666
02:25:23,750 --> 02:25:23,760
and you tell me the israeli government
 

7667
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:25,830
and you tell me the israeli government
that says sure it's fine it's okay iran

7668
02:25:25,830 --> 02:25:25,840
that says sure it's fine it's okay iran
 

7669
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:27,990
that says sure it's fine it's okay iran
can get the bomb

7670
02:25:27,990 --> 02:25:28,000
can get the bomb
 

7671
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,230
can get the bomb
and so maybe that happens and maybe that

7672
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:30,240
and so maybe that happens and maybe that
 

7673
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:32,150
and so maybe that happens and maybe that
happens as early as this summer as iran

7674
02:25:32,150 --> 02:25:32,160
happens as early as this summer as iran
 

7675
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:35,670
happens as early as this summer as iran
gets closer and closer and closer

7676
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:35,680
gets closer and closer and closer
 

7677
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:36,630
gets closer and closer and closer
maybe

7678
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:36,640
maybe
 

7679
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:37,670
maybe
that

7680
02:25:37,670 --> 02:25:37,680
that
 

7681
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:40,630

and navalny is killed i've been afraid

7918
02:30:09,270 --> 02:30:09,280
and navalny is killed i've been afraid
 

7919
02:30:09,280 --> 02:30:11,990
and navalny is killed i've been afraid
of that but he's still alive even though

7920
02:30:11,990 --> 02:30:12,000
of that but he's still alive even though
 

7921
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,389
of that but he's still alive even though
he's serving a long sentence

7922

he's serving a long sentence
 

7923
02:30:14,399 --> 02:30:17,270
he's serving a long sentence
so that leads me to guess

7924
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:17,280
so that leads me to guess
 

7925
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,990
so that leads me to guess
that people inside the putin regime and

7926
02:30:19,990 --> 02:30:20,000
that people inside the putin regime and
 

7927
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,349
that people inside the putin regime and
maybe president putin himself understand

7928
02:30:23,349 --> 02:30:23,359
maybe president putin himself understand
 

7929
02:30:23,359 --> 02:30:26,550
maybe president putin himself understand
that navalny is their ticket to lift

7930
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:26,560
that navalny is their ticket to lift
 

7931
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:29,030
that navalny is their ticket to lift
sanctions

7933
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,110
sanctions
that navalny is

7934
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:31,120
that navalny is
 

7935
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:33,750
that navalny is
even more popular outside of russia than

7936
02:30:33,750 --> 02:30:33,760
even more popular outside of russia than
 

7937
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:35,510
even more popular outside of russia than
he is inside of russia you know he's the

7938
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:35,520
he is inside of russia you know he's the

7941
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:38,550
leader
in many ways of the up political

7942
02:30:38,550 --> 02:30:38,560
in many ways of the up political
 

7943
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:40,870
in many ways of the up political
opposition in the country

7944
02:30:40,870 --> 02:30:40,880
opposition in the country
 

7945
02:30:40,880 --> 02:30:42,870
opposition in the country
even while still in prison his

7946
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:42,880
even while still in prison his
 

7947
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:45,270
even while still in prison his
organization's been destroyed

7948
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:45,280
organization's been destroyed
 

7949
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:47,190
organization's been destroyed
but it's he doesn't have majority

7950
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:47,200
but it's he doesn't have majority
 

7951
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:49,270
but it's he doesn't have majority
support in the population by any stretch

7952
02:30:49,270 --> 02:30:49,280
support in the population by any stretch
 

7953
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:51,429
support in the population by any stretch
of the imagination but he's a big figure

7954
02:30:51,429 --> 02:30:51,439
of the imagination but he's a big figure
 

7955
02:30:51,439 --> 02:30:52,630
of the imagination but he's a big figure
in the west

7956
02:30:52,630 --> 02:30:52,640
in the west
 

7957
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:55,030
in the west
including here in the u.s

7958
02:30:55,030 --> 02:30:55,040
including here in the u.s
 

7959
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:57,270
including here in the u.s
and so navalny could be their ticket

7960
02:30:57,270 --> 02:30:57,280
and so navalny could be their ticket
 

7961
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,630
and so navalny could be their ticket
they're kind of g

7962
02:30:58,630 --> 02:30:58,640
they're kind of g
 

7963
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:00,469
they're kind of g
get out of jail card meaning they

7964
02:31:00,469 --> 02:31:00,479
get out of jail card meaning they
 

7965
02:31:00,479 --> 02:31:02,469
get out of jail card meaning they
release him from prison

7966
02:31:02,469 --> 02:31:02,479
release him from prison
 

7967
02:31:02,479 --> 02:31:04,150
release him from prison
he gets appointed i don't know prime

7968
02:31:04,150 --> 02:31:04,160
he gets appointed i don't know prime
 

7969
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:06,790
he gets appointed i don't know prime
minister even by the putin regime if he

7970
02:31:06,790 --> 02:31:06,800
minister even by the putin regime if he
 

7971
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:09,270
minister even by the putin regime if he
were willing to accept such a position

7972
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:09,280
were willing to accept such a position
 

7973
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:11,670
were willing to accept such a position
and i have my doubts about that

7974
02:31:11,670 --> 02:31:11,680
and i have my doubts about that
 

7975
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:14,950
and i have my doubts about that
and then that's how they lobby to remove

7976
02:31:14,950 --> 02:31:14,960
and then that's how they lobby to remove
 

7977
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:17,590
and then that's how they lobby to remove
the sanctions against them so he's a

7978
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:17,600
the sanctions against them so he's a
 

7979
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:21,510
the sanctions against them so he's a
card that president putin could play

7980
02:31:21,510 --> 02:31:21,520
card that president putin could play
 

7981
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:23,510
card that president putin could play
and so maybe that's the reason he's

7982
02:31:23,510 --> 02:31:23,520
and so maybe that's the reason he's
 

7983
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:24,710
and so maybe that's the reason he's
still alive

7984
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:24,720
still alive
 

7985
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:26,950
still alive
or maybe there are other reasons that we

7986
02:31:26,950 --> 02:31:26,960
or maybe there are other reasons that we
 

7987
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:28,389
or maybe there are other reasons that we
don't know

7988
02:31:28,389 --> 02:31:28,399
don't know
 

7989
02:31:28,399 --> 02:31:29,910
don't know
and so

7990
02:31:29,910 --> 02:31:29,920
and so
 

7991
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:32,950
and so
some alternative to putin is more likely

7992
02:31:32,950 --> 02:31:32,960
some alternative to putin is more likely
 

7993
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:34,309
some alternative to putin is more likely
to arise

7994
02:31:34,309 --> 02:31:34,319
to arise
 

7995
02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:37,270
to arise
inside his gang

7996
02:31:37,270 --> 02:31:37,280

of his mistakes
they tire of his self-defeating actions

8006
02:31:49,429 --> 02:31:49,439
they tire of his self-defeating actions
 

8007
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:53,190
they tire of his self-defeating actions
