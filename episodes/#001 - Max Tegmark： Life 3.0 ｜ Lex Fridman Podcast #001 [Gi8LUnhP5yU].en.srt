years since our Big Bang there's more

164
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:19,689
years since our Big Bang there's more
 

165
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,719
years since our Big Bang there's more
space here but this is what we call a

166
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:21,729
space here but this is what we call a
 

167
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,039
space here but this is what we call a
universe because that's all we have

168
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,049
universe because that's all we have
 

169
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,780
universe because that's all we have
access to mm-hmm so is there intelligent

170

access to mm-hmm so is there intelligent
 

171
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,999
access to mm-hmm so is there intelligent
life here that's gotten to the point of

building telescopes and computers my
guess is no actually no the probability

176
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:35,229
guess is no actually no the probability
 

177
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:39,210
guess is no actually no the probability
of it happening on any given planet is

178
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:39,220
of it happening on any given planet is
 

179
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,129
of it happening on any given planet is
some number we don't know what it is and

180
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:43,139
some number we don't know what it is and
 

181
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,699
some number we don't know what it is and
what we do know is that the number can't

182
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:47,709
what we do know is that the number can't
 

183
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,020
what we do know is that the number can't
be super-high because there's over a

184
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,030
be super-high because there's over a
 

185
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,550
be super-high because there's over a
billion earth-like planets in the Milky

186
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
billion earth-like planets in the Milky
 

187
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,089
billion earth-like planets in the Milky
Way galaxy alone many of which are

188
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:54,099
Way galaxy alone many of which are
 

189
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,809
Way galaxy alone many of which are
billions of years older than Earth and

190
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:56,819
billions of years older than Earth and
 

191
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,629
billions of years older than Earth and
aside from some UFO believers in other

192
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:00,639
aside from some UFO believers in other
 

193
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,270
aside from some UFO believers in other
reason is much evidence that any super

194
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
reason is much evidence that any super
 

195
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,309
reason is much evidence that any super
20 civilization has come here at all and

196
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:05,319
20 civilization has come here at all and
 

197
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,679
20 civilization has come here at all and
so that's the famous Fermi paradox right

198
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:07,689
so that's the famous Fermi paradox right
 

199
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:10,050
so that's the famous Fermi paradox right
and then if you if you work the numbers

200
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,060
and then if you if you work the numbers
 

201
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,050
and then if you if you work the numbers
what you find is that if you have no

202
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,060
what you find is that if you have no
 

203
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,459
what you find is that if you have no
clue what the probability is of getting

204
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:14,469
clue what the probability is of getting
 

205
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,020
clue what the probability is of getting
life on a given planet

life on a given planet
 

207
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,789
life on a given planet
could be 10 to the minus 10 and the

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,060
open-minded that translates into it

by the time he gets much less than than
 

223
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,370
by the time he gets much less than than
10 to the 16 already we pretty much know

224
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:42,380
10 to the 16 already we pretty much know
 

225
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,879
10 to the 16 already we pretty much know
there is nothing else that's close and

226
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:45,889
there is nothing else that's close and
 

227
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,590
there is nothing else that's close and
when you get the other would have

228
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
when you get the other would have
 

229
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,330
when you get the other would have
discovered us they yeah they would have

230
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,340
discovered us they yeah they would have
 

231
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,830
discovered us they yeah they would have
been discovered as long or if they're

232
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:50,840
been discovered as long or if they're
 

233
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,330
been discovered as long or if they're
really close we would have probably know

234
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:52,340
really close we would have probably know
 

235
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,710
really close we would have probably know
that some engineering projects that

236
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:53,720
that some engineering projects that
 

237
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,260
that some engineering projects that
they're doing and if it's beyond 10 to

238
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,270
they're doing and if it's beyond 10 to
 

239
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,900
they're doing and if it's beyond 10 to
the 26 meters that's already outside of

240
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:58,910
the 26 meters that's already outside of
 

241
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,700
the 26 meters that's already outside of
here so my guess is actually that there

242
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:03,710
here so my guess is actually that there
 

243
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,980
here so my guess is actually that there
are we are the only life in here they've

244
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:05,990
are we are the only life in here they've
 

245
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,110
are we are the only life in here they've
gotten the point of building advanced

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,120
gotten the point of building advanced
 

247
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,060
gotten the point of building advanced
tech which i think is very um puts a lot

screw up you know I think people who

252
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:16,460
screw up you know I think people who
 

253
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,460
screw up you know I think people who
take for granted that it's okay for us

254
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:18,470
take for granted that it's okay for us
 

255
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,920
take for granted that it's okay for us
to screw up have an accident in a

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:20,930
to screw up have an accident in a
 

257
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,630
to screw up have an accident in a
nuclear war or go extinct somehow

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:22,640
nuclear war or go extinct somehow
 

259
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,219
nuclear war or go extinct somehow
because there's a star trek-like

because there's a star trek-like

either that roadblock is either beef
 

317
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,170
either that roadblock is either beef
behind us or in front of us I'm hoping

318
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:39,180
behind us or in front of us I'm hoping
 

319
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,529
behind us or in front of us I'm hoping
very much that it's behind us I'm super

320
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:42,539
very much that it's behind us I'm super
 

321
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,350
very much that it's behind us I'm super
excited every time we get a new report

322
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
excited every time we get a new report
 

323
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,119
excited every time we get a new report
from NASA saying they failed to find any

324
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:47,129
from NASA saying they failed to find any
 

325
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,050
from NASA saying they failed to find any
life on Mars

326
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,060
life on Mars
 

327
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,570
life on Mars
like just awesome because that suggests

328
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:50,580
like just awesome because that suggests
 

329
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,429
like just awesome because that suggests
that the hard part maybe what maybe he

330
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:52,439
that the hard part maybe what maybe he
 

331
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,409
that the hard part maybe what maybe he
was getting the first ribosome or or

332
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:54,419
was getting the first ribosome or or
 

333
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,399
was getting the first ribosome or or
some some very low-level kind of

334
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:57,409
some some very low-level kind of
 

335
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,200
some some very low-level kind of
stepping stone so they were home free

336
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,210
stepping stone so they were home free
 

337
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,600
stepping stone so they were home free
cuz if that's true then the future is

338
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:02,610
cuz if that's true then the future is
 

339
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,860
cuz if that's true then the future is
really only limited by our own

340
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:03,870
really only limited by our own
 

341
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,499
really only limited by our own
imagination it'd be much luckier if it

342
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:06,509
imagination it'd be much luckier if it
 

343
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,529
imagination it'd be much luckier if it
turns out that this level of life is

344
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:09,539
turns out that this level of life is
 

345
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,899
turns out that this level of life is
kind of a dime a dozen but maybe there

346
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:11,909
kind of a dime a dozen but maybe there
 

347
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,969
kind of a dime a dozen but maybe there
is some other problem like as soon as a

348
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:13,979
is some other problem like as soon as a
 

349
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,950
is some other problem like as soon as a
civilization gets advanced technology

350
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:15,960
civilization gets advanced technology
 

351
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,270
civilization gets advanced technology
within a hundred years they get into

352
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
within a hundred years they get into
 

353
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,709
within a hundred years they get into
some stupid fight with themselves and

354
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:18,719
some stupid fight with themselves and
 

355
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,899
some stupid fight with themselves and
poof yeah no that would be a bummer

356
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:20,909
poof yeah no that would be a bummer
 

357
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,170
poof yeah no that would be a bummer
yeah so you've explored the mysteries of

358
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,180
yeah so you've explored the mysteries of
 

359
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,140
yeah so you've explored the mysteries of
the universe the cosmological universe

360
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,150
the universe the cosmological universe
 

361
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,659
the universe the cosmological universe
the one that's sitting between us today

362
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:29,669
the one that's sitting between us today
 

363
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:34,399
the one that's sitting between us today
I think you've also begun to explore the

364
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,409
I think you've also begun to explore the
 

365
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,580
I think you've also begun to explore the
other universe which is sort of the

366
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:36,590
other universe which is sort of the
 

367
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,080
other universe which is sort of the
mystery the mysterious universe of the

368
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,090
mystery the mysterious universe of the
 

369
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,959
mystery the mysterious universe of the
mind of intelligence of intelligent life

370
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:41,969
mind of intelligence of intelligent life
 

371
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:44,480
mind of intelligence of intelligent life
so is there a common thread between your

372
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,490
so is there a common thread between your
 

373
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,100
so is there a common thread between your
interest or in the way you think about

374
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,110
interest or in the way you think about
 

375
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,730
interest or in the way you think about
space and intelligence oh yeah when I

376
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:49,740
space and intelligence oh yeah when I
 

377
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,140
space and intelligence oh yeah when I
was a teenager yeah I was already very

378
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,150
was a teenager yeah I was already very
 

379
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,260
was a teenager yeah I was already very
fascinated by the biggest questions and

380
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,270
fascinated by the biggest questions and
 

381
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,519
fascinated by the biggest questions and
I felt that the two biggest quite

382
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:58,529
I felt that the two biggest quite
 

383
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,769
I felt that the two biggest quite
mysteries of all in science where our

384
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:00,779
mysteries of all in science where our
 

385
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,559
mysteries of all in science where our
universe out there and our universe in

386
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:03,569
universe out there and our universe in
 

387
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:06,350
universe out there and our universe in
here yeah so it's quite natural after

388
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,360
here yeah so it's quite natural after
 

389
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,589
here yeah so it's quite natural after
having spent a quarter of a century on

390
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
having spent a quarter of a century on
 

391
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,899
having spent a quarter of a century on
my career thinking a lot about this one

392
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:11,909
my career thinking a lot about this one
 

393
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,570
my career thinking a lot about this one
I'm now indulging in the luxury of doing

394
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,580
I'm now indulging in the luxury of doing
 

395
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,300
I'm now indulging in the luxury of doing
research on this one it's just so cool I

396
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,310
research on this one it's just so cool I
 

397
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,070
research on this one it's just so cool I
feel the time is right now for you

398
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
feel the time is right now for you

Trane's greatly deepening our
 

401
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,459
Trane's greatly deepening our
understanding of this just start

402
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:25,469
understanding of this just start
 

403
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:27,050
understanding of this just start
exploring this one yeah because I think

404
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,060
exploring this one yeah because I think
 

405
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,490
exploring this one yeah because I think
I think a lot of people view

406
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,500
I think a lot of people view
 

407
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,790
I think a lot of people view
intelligence as something mysterious

408
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:31,800
intelligence as something mysterious
 

409
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,339
intelligence as something mysterious
that can only exist and biological

all talk about artificial general

414
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:38,579
all talk about artificial general
 

415
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:41,190
all talk about artificial general
intelligence is science fiction

416
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
intelligence is science fiction
 

417
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,750
intelligence is science fiction
but from my perspective as a physicist

418
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:42,760
but from my perspective as a physicist
 

419
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,090
but from my perspective as a physicist
you know I am a blob of quarks and

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:45,100
you know I am a blob of quarks and

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,940
you know I am a blob of quarks and

I am NOT smarter than the water bottle

430
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,270
I am NOT smarter than the water bottle
 

431
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,880
I am NOT smarter than the water bottle
because I'm made of different kind of

432
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:56,890
because I'm made of different kind of
 

433

there's no secret sauce I think in me

438
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:05,080
there's no secret sauce I think in me
 

439
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
there's no secret sauce I think in me
it's all about the pattern of the

440
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,090
it's all about the pattern of the
 

441
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,080
it's all about the pattern of the
information processing and this means

442
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,090
information processing and this means
 

443
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,480
information processing and this means
that there's no law of physics saying

444
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,490
that there's no law of physics saying
 

445
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,840
that there's no law of physics saying
the way that we can't create technology

446
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:14,850
the way that we can't create technology
 

447
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,780
the way that we can't create technology
which can have helped us by being

00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:18,790
which can have helped us by being
 

449
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,400
which can have helped us by being
incredibly intelligent and helped us

450
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,410
incredibly intelligent and helped us
 

451
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,750
incredibly intelligent and helped us
crack mysteries that we couldn't in

452
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
crack mysteries that we couldn't in
 

453
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,580
crack mysteries that we couldn't in
other words I think we really only seen

454
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:23,590
other words I think we really only seen
 

455
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,620
other words I think we really only seen
the tip of the intelligence iceberg so

456
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:25,630
the tip of the intelligence iceberg so
 

457
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,440
the tip of the intelligence iceberg so
far yeah so the perceptron ium yeah so

458
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,450
far yeah so the perceptron ium yeah so
 

459
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,600
far yeah so the perceptron ium yeah so
you can't go in this amazing term it's a

460
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:33,610
you can't go in this amazing term it's a
 

461
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,180
you can't go in this amazing term it's a
hypothetical state of matter sort of

462
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,190
hypothetical state of matter sort of
 

463
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,550
hypothetical state of matter sort of
thinking from a physics perspective what

464
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
thinking from a physics perspective what
 

465
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,170
thinking from a physics perspective what
is the kind of matter that can help as

466
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:40,180
is the kind of matter that can help as
 

467
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,120
is the kind of matter that can help as
you're saying a subjective experience

468
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,130
you're saying a subjective experience
 

469
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,480
you're saying a subjective experience
emerged consciousness emerge so how do

470
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,490
emerged consciousness emerge so how do
 

471
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,980
emerged consciousness emerge so how do
you think about consciousness from this

472
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:46,990
you think about consciousness from this
 

473
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,760
you think about consciousness from this
physics perspective very good question

474
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:50,770
physics perspective very good question
 

475
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:56,670
physics perspective very good question
so again I think many people have

476
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:56,680
so again I think many people have
 

477
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,330
so again I think many people have
underestimated our ability to make

478
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:00,340
underestimated our ability to make
 

479
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,940
underestimated our ability to make
progress on this and by convincing

480
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:02,950
progress on this and by convincing
 

481
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,620
progress on this and by convincing
themselves it's hopeless because somehow

482
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:04,630
themselves it's hopeless because somehow
 

483
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,010
themselves it's hopeless because somehow
we're missing some ingredient that we

484
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,020
we're missing some ingredient that we
 

485
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,650
we're missing some ingredient that we
need or some new consciousness particle

486
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:10,660
need or some new consciousness particle
 

487
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,520
need or some new consciousness particle
or whatever I happen to think that we're

488
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:14,530
or whatever I happen to think that we're
 

489
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,520
or whatever I happen to think that we're
not missing anything and and that it's

490
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:17,530
not missing anything and and that it's
 

491
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,290
not missing anything and and that it's
or not the interesting thing about

492
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:19,300
or not the interesting thing about
 

493
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,170
or not the interesting thing about
consciousness that gives us this amazing

494
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,180
consciousness that gives us this amazing
 

495
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,480
consciousness that gives us this amazing
subjective experience of colors and

496
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,490
subjective experience of colors and
 

497
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,770
subjective experience of colors and
sounds and emotions and so on is rather

498
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:27,780
sounds and emotions and so on is rather
 

499
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,450
sounds and emotions and so on is rather
something at the higher level about the

500
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:30,460
something at the higher level about the
 

501
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,330
something at the higher level about the
patterns of information processing

502
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:32,340
patterns of information processing
 

503
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,120
patterns of information processing
that's why that's why I am like to think

504
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,130
that's why that's why I am like to think
 

505
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,310
that's why that's why I am like to think
about this idea of perceptron Neum what

506
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
about this idea of perceptron Neum what
 

507
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,960
about this idea of perceptron Neum what
does it mean for an arbitrary physical

508
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:39,970
does it mean for an arbitrary physical
 

509
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,070
does it mean for an arbitrary physical
system to be conscious in terms of what

510
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,080
system to be conscious in terms of what
 

511
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,200
system to be conscious in terms of what
its particles are doing or its

512
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,210
its particles are doing or its
 

513
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,700
its particles are doing or its
information is doing I don't think I

514
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:47,710
information is doing I don't think I
 

515
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,740
information is doing I don't think I
don't hate carbon chauvinism you know

516
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:49,750
don't hate carbon chauvinism you know
 

517
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,940
don't hate carbon chauvinism you know
this attitude you have to be made of

518
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:50,950
this attitude you have to be made of
 

519
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,920
this attitude you have to be made of
carbon atoms to be smart or conscious

520
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,930
carbon atoms to be smart or conscious
 

521
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,540
carbon atoms to be smart or conscious
something about the information

522
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:55,550
something about the information
 

523
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,330
something about the information
processing yes kind of matter performs

524
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:58,340
processing yes kind of matter performs
 

525
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,800
processing yes kind of matter performs
yeah and you know yeah I have my

526
00:10:59,800 --> 00:10:59,810
yeah and you know yeah I have my
 

527
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,930
yeah and you know yeah I have my
favorite equations here describing

528
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:01,940
favorite equations here describing
 

529
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,940
favorite equations here describing
various fundamental aspects of the world

530
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:03,950
various fundamental aspects of the world
 

531
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,100
various fundamental aspects of the world
I feel that I think one day maybe

532
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,110
I feel that I think one day maybe
 

533
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,630
I feel that I think one day maybe
someone who's watching this will come up

534
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:07,640
someone who's watching this will come up
 

535
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,120
someone who's watching this will come up
with the equations that information

536
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,130
with the equations that information
 

537
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,500
with the equations that information
processing has to satisfy to be

538
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:11,510
processing has to satisfy to be
 

539
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,620
processing has to satisfy to be
conscious I'm quite convinced there is

540
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:13,630
conscious I'm quite convinced there is
 

541
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,660
conscious I'm quite convinced there is
big discovery to be made there yeah

542
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:16,670
big discovery to be made there yeah
 

543
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,870
big discovery to be made there yeah
because let's face it sumit we know that

544
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:19,880
because let's face it sumit we know that
 

545
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,730
because let's face it sumit we know that
some information processing is conscious

546
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:21,740
some information processing is conscious
 

547
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,050
some information processing is conscious
because we are yeah conscious but we

548
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,060
because we are yeah conscious but we
 

549
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,430
because we are yeah conscious but we
also know that a lot of information

550
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
also know that a lot of information
 

551
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,080
also know that a lot of information
processing is not conscious like most of

552
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,090
processing is not conscious like most of
 

553
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,340
processing is not conscious like most of
the information processing happening in

554
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,350
the information processing happening in
 

555
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,800
the information processing happening in
your brain right now is not conscious

556
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:32,810
your brain right now is not conscious
 

557
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,470
your brain right now is not conscious
there is like 10 megabytes per second

558
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,480
there is like 10 megabytes per second
 

559
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,850
there is like 10 megabytes per second
coming in and even just through your

560
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:36,860
coming in and even just through your
 

561
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,950
coming in and even just through your
visual system you are not conscious

562
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:38,960
visual system you are not conscious
 

563
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,050
visual system you are not conscious
about your heartbeat regulation or or

564
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,060
about your heartbeat regulation or or
 

565
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,990
about your heartbeat regulation or or
most things by even even like if I just

566
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
most things by even even like if I just
 

567
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,850
most things by even even like if I just
ask you to like read what it says here

568
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:45,860
ask you to like read what it says here
 

569
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,410
ask you to like read what it says here
you look at it and then oh now you know

570
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:47,420
you look at it and then oh now you know
 

571
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,300
you look at it and then oh now you know
what it said but you don't aware of how

572
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,310
what it said but you don't aware of how
 

573
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,220
what it said but you don't aware of how
the computation actually happened you're

574
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,230
the computation actually happened you're
 

575
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,720
the computation actually happened you're
like the your consciousness is like the

576
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:52,730
like the your consciousness is like the
 

577
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,880
like the your consciousness is like the
CEO that got an email at the end we

578
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:54,890
CEO that got an email at the end we
 

579
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,830
CEO that got an email at the end we
leave with a final answer so what is it

580
00:11:59,830 --> 00:11:59,840
leave with a final answer so what is it
 

581
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
leave with a final answer so what is it
that makes the difference I think that's

582
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:01,850
that makes the difference I think that's
 

583
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,470
that makes the difference I think that's
a both of us great science mystery we're

584
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:05,480
a both of us great science mystery we're
 

585
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,730
a both of us great science mystery we're
actually starting it a little bit in my

586
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:06,740
actually starting it a little bit in my
 

587
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,370
actually starting it a little bit in my
lab here at MIT but I also I think it's

588
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:09,380
lab here at MIT but I also I think it's
 

589
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,500
lab here at MIT but I also I think it's
just a really urgent question the answer

590
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:11,510
just a really urgent question the answer
 

591
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,720
just a really urgent question the answer
for started I mean if you're an

592
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:13,730
for started I mean if you're an
 

593
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,430
for started I mean if you're an
emergency room doctor and you have an

594
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
emergency room doctor and you have an
 

595
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,410
emergency room doctor and you have an
unresponsive patient coming in and

596
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:17,420
unresponsive patient coming in and
 

597
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,030
unresponsive patient coming in and
wouldn't it be great if in addition to

598
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
wouldn't it be great if in addition to
 

599
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,390
wouldn't it be great if in addition to
having a CT scan

600
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:23,400
having a CT scan
 

601
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,220
having a CT scan
you had a consciousness scanner mm-hmm

602
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,230
you had a consciousness scanner mm-hmm
 

603
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,500
you had a consciousness scanner mm-hmm
that could figure out whether this

604
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:27,510
that could figure out whether this
 

605
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,870
that could figure out whether this
person is actually having locked-in

606
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:29,880
person is actually having locked-in
 

607
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,740
person is actually having locked-in
syndrome or is actually comatose and in

608
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:33,750
syndrome or is actually comatose and in
 

609
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,270
syndrome or is actually comatose and in
the future imagine if we build the

610
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:35,280
the future imagine if we build the
 

611
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,250
the future imagine if we build the
robots or the machine that we can have

612
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,260
robots or the machine that we can have
 

613
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,320
robots or the machine that we can have
really good conversations which I think

614
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,330
really good conversations which I think
 

615
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,540
really good conversations which I think
it's mostly very likely to happen right

616
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:44,550
it's mostly very likely to happen right
 

617
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,190
it's mostly very likely to happen right
wouldn't you want to know like if your

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,690
experiencing anything or just like a
zombie I mean would you prefer what

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:56,730
it's actually unconscious so that you
 

629
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,680
it's actually unconscious so that you
don't have to feel guilty about

630
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:57,690
don't have to feel guilty about
 

631
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,330
don't have to feel guilty about
switching it off or giving me boring

switching it off or giving me boring
 

633
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,520
switching it off or giving me boring
chores or would you prefer

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,530
chores or would you prefer
 

635
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,810
chores or would you prefer
well the certainly would we would prefer

636
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:05,820
well the certainly would we would prefer
 

637
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,030
well the certainly would we would prefer
I would prefer the appearance of

638
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,040
I would prefer the appearance of
 

639
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,750
I would prefer the appearance of
consciousness

640
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:08,760
consciousness
 

641
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,430
consciousness
but the question is whether the

642
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:10,440
but the question is whether the
 

643
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,290
but the question is whether the
appearance of consciousness is different

644
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:12,300
appearance of consciousness is different
 

645
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,770
appearance of consciousness is different
than cost consciousness itself and sort

646
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:15,780
than cost consciousness itself and sort
 

647
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,440
than cost consciousness itself and sort
of ask that as a question yeah do you

648
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,450
of ask that as a question yeah do you
 

649
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,780
of ask that as a question yeah do you
think we need to you know understand

650
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:20,790
think we need to you know understand
 

651
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,490
think we need to you know understand
what consciousness is solve the hard

652
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:22,500
what consciousness is solve the hard
 

653
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,260
what consciousness is solve the hard
problem of consciousness in order to

654
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,270
problem of consciousness in order to
 

655
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,730
problem of consciousness in order to
build something like an a GI system no I

656
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:28,740
build something like an a GI system no I
 

657
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,110
build something like an a GI system no I
don't think that and I think we we will

658
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
don't think that and I think we we will
 

659
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,910
don't think that and I think we we will
probably be able to build things even if

660
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:34,920
probably be able to build things even if
 

661
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,470
probably be able to build things even if
we don't answer that question but if we

662
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
we don't answer that question but if we
 

663
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,030
we don't answer that question but if we
want to make sure that what happens is a

664
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,040
want to make sure that what happens is a
 

665
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,320
want to make sure that what happens is a
good thing we better solve it first so

666
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,330
good thing we better solve it first so
 

667
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,730
good thing we better solve it first so
it's a wonderful controversy you're

668
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:43,740
it's a wonderful controversy you're
 

669
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,700
it's a wonderful controversy you're
raising there there where you have

670
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:45,710
raising there there where you have
 

671
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,320
raising there there where you have
basically three points of view about the

672
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,330
basically three points of view about the
 

673
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,390
basically three points of view about the
heart problem sir there are two

674
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:50,400
heart problem sir there are two
 

675
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,120
heart problem sir there are two
different points of view that both

676
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,130
different points of view that both
 

677
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,620
different points of view that both
conclude that the hard problem of

678
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:54,630
conclude that the hard problem of
 

679
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,350
conclude that the hard problem of
consciousness is BS you're on one hand

680
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
consciousness is BS you're on one hand
 

681
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
consciousness is BS you're on one hand
you have some people like Daniel Dennett

682
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:58,890
you have some people like Daniel Dennett
 

683
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,980
you have some people like Daniel Dennett
who say this is our consciousness is

684
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:00,990
who say this is our consciousness is
 

685
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,810
who say this is our consciousness is
just BS because consciousness is the

686
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:02,820
just BS because consciousness is the
 

687
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,420
just BS because consciousness is the
same thing as intelligence there's no

688
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:05,430
same thing as intelligence there's no
 

689
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,400
same thing as intelligence there's no
difference so anything which acts

690
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,410
difference so anything which acts
 

691
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,020
difference so anything which acts
conscious is conscious just like like we

692
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,030
conscious is conscious just like like we
 

693
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,980
conscious is conscious just like like we
are and then there are also a lot of

694
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:14,990
are and then there are also a lot of
 

695
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,690
are and then there are also a lot of
people including many top AI researchers

696
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:17,700
people including many top AI researchers
 

697
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,550
people including many top AI researchers
I know you say all conscience is just

698
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:19,560
I know you say all conscience is just
 

699
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,930
I know you say all conscience is just
 because of course machines

700
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:20,940
because of course machines
 

701
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,190
because of course machines
should never be conscious tonight

702
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,200
should never be conscious tonight

never have to feel guilty about how you

706
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:25,950
never have to feel guilty about how you
 

707
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,580
never have to feel guilty about how you
treat them and then there's a third

708
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:28,590
treat them and then there's a third
 

709
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,910
treat them and then there's a third

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,090
which it is and I think we've just been
 

727
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,600
which it is and I think we've just been
a little bit lazy kind of running away

728
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,610
a little bit lazy kind of running away

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,090
a little bit lazy kind of running away
from this problem for a long time it's

731
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,950
from this problem for a long time it's
been almost taboo would even mention the

been almost taboo would even mention the

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,900
been almost taboo would even mention the
c-word a lot of circles because look but

and coming back to this helper robot I

744
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:13,670
and coming back to this helper robot I
 

745
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,910
and coming back to this helper robot I
mean so you said you'd want to help a

746
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
mean so you said you'd want to help a
 

747
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,500
mean so you said you'd want to help a
robot to certainly act conscious and

748
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:17,510
robot to certainly act conscious and

robot to certainly act conscious and
treat you like to have conversations

750
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:20,420
treat you like to have conversations
 

751
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,240
treat you like to have conversations
with us I think so wouldn't you would

752
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,250
with us I think so wouldn't you would
 

753
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,380
with us I think so wouldn't you would
you feel would you feel a little bit

754
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:23,390
you feel would you feel a little bit
 

755
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,880
you feel would you feel a little bit
creeped out if you realize that it was

756
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:24,890
creeped out if you realize that it was
 

757
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,850
creeped out if you realize that it was
just glossed up the tape recorder they

758
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:27,860
just glossed up the tape recorder they
 

759
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,170
just glossed up the tape recorder they
know there was just Sambi and there's

760
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:29,180
know there was just Sambi and there's
 

761
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,019
know there was just Sambi and there's
some faking emotion would you prefer

762
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:32,029
some faking emotion would you prefer
 

763
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,650
some faking emotion would you prefer
that it actually had an experience or

764
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:34,660
that it actually had an experience or
 

765
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,210
that it actually had an experience or
will you prefer that it's actually not

766
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:37,220
will you prefer that it's actually not
 

767
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,250
will you prefer that it's actually not
experiencing anything so you feel you

768
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:39,260
experiencing anything so you feel you
 

769
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,810
experiencing anything so you feel you
don't have to feel guilty about what you

770
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:40,820
don't have to feel guilty about what you
 

771
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,390
don't have to feel guilty about what you
do to it it's such a difficult question

772
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:43,400
do to it it's such a difficult question
 

773
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,790
do to it it's such a difficult question
because you know it's like when you're

774
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:45,800
because you know it's like when you're
 

775
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,530
because you know it's like when you're
in a relationship and you say well I

776
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:47,540
in a relationship and you say well I
 

777
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,030
in a relationship and you say well I
love you and the other person I love you

778

love you and the other person I love you
 

779
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,400
love you and the other person I love you
back it's like asking well do they

780
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:51,410
back it's like asking well do they
 

781
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,230
back it's like asking well do they
really love you back or are they just

782
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,240
really love you back or are they just
 

783
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,760
really love you back or are they just
saying they love you back

784
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:54,770
saying they love you back
 

785
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,800
saying they love you back
do you don't you really want them to

786
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:56,810
do you don't you really want them to
 

787
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,390
do you don't you really want them to
actually love you I it's hard to it's

788
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:01,400
actually love you I it's hard to it's
 

789
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,890
actually love you I it's hard to it's
hard to really know the difference

790
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:02,900
hard to really know the difference
 

791
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,350
hard to really know the difference
between everything seeming like there's

you dinner it's not afraid of death but

1112
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:19,590
you dinner it's not afraid of death but
 

1113
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,100
you dinner it's not afraid of death but
it really wants to complete the dinner

1114
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,110
it really wants to complete the dinner
 

1115
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,480
it really wants to complete the dinner
cooking gold so it will have a

1116
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:23,490
cooking gold so it will have a
 

1117
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,369
cooking gold so it will have a
self-preservation instinct continue

similarly if you give any kind of warm

1122
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:31,889
similarly if you give any kind of warm

and they she's go to an AGI
 

1125
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,830
and they she's go to an AGI
it's very likely they want to acquire

1126
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:36,840
it's very likely they want to acquire
 

1127
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,539
it's very likely they want to acquire
more resources so it can do that better

1128
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:38,549
more resources so it can do that better
 

1129
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:42,230
more resources so it can do that better
and it's exactly from those sort of sub

1130
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
and it's exactly from those sort of sub
 

1131

goals that we might not have intended
 

1133
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,799
goals that we might not have intended
that but some of the concerns about AGI

1134
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:45,809
that but some of the concerns about AGI
 

1135
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,019
that but some of the concerns about AGI
safety come you give it some goal which

1136
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:48,029
safety come you give it some goal which
 

1137
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:51,519
safety come you give it some goal which
seems completely harmless and then

1138
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:51,529
seems completely harmless and then
 

1139
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:54,529
seems completely harmless and then
before you realize it it's also trying

1140

before you realize it it's also trying
 

1141
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,489
before you realize it it's also trying
to do these other things which you

1142
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:55,499
to do these other things which you
 

1143
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,590
to do these other things which you
didn't want it to do and it's moment be

didn't want it to do and it's moment be
 

1145
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,310
didn't want it to do and it's moment be
smarter than us so so lastly and let me

1146
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:01,320
smarter than us so so lastly and let me
 

1147
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,310
smarter than us so so lastly and let me
pause just because I

1148
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
pause just because I
 

1149
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,910
pause just because I
in a very kind of human centric way see

haha so you don't think do you think

1154
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,450
haha so you don't think do you think
 

1155
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,060
haha so you don't think do you think
that's an artifact of evolution so

1156
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,070
that's an artifact of evolution so
 

1157
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,580
that's an artifact of evolution so
that's the kind of mind space evolution

1158
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:19,590
that's the kind of mind space evolution
 

1159
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,500
that's the kind of mind space evolution
created they were sort of almost

1163
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,950

genetic well you don't think that's

1164
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:24,960
genetic well you don't think that's
 

1165
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,720
genetic well you don't think that's
necessary to be afraid of death so not

1166
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:29,730
necessary to be afraid of death so not
 

1167
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,090

just a kind of sub goal of
 

1169
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,500
just a kind of sub goal of
self-preservation just so you can keep

1170
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:33,510
self-preservation just so you can keep

doing the thing but more fundamentally

for both do you think really like a

1187
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:03,860

how to define intelligence even so I

1206
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,250
how to define intelligence even so I
 

1207
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,250
how to define intelligence even so I
define intelligence simply as the

1208

I like your broad definition because

1212
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,030
I like your broad definition because
 

1213
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,190
I like your broad definition because
again I don't want to be a carbon

1214
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,200
again I don't want to be a carbon

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,620
again I don't want to be a carbon
chauvinist right and in that case no it

1216
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:33,630
chauvinist right and in that case no it
 

1217
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,110
chauvinist right and in that case no it
certainly certainly doesn't require fear

1218

I don't think alpha zero has any fear of

1224
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:41,670
I don't think alpha zero has any fear of
 

1225
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,520
I don't think alpha zero has any fear of
being turned off because it doesn't

1226
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:43,530
being turned off because it doesn't

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,070
being turned off because it doesn't
understand the concept of that even and

understand the concept of that even and
 

1229
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,770
understand the concept of that even and
and similarly consciousness I mean you

1230
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:48,780
and similarly consciousness I mean you
 

1231
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,460

don't think they were afraid of dying if

1238
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:58,650
don't think they were afraid of dying if
 

1239
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,570
don't think they were afraid of dying if
there's nothing they can do about it

there's nothing they can do about it
 

1241
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,850
there's nothing they can do about it
anyway much so there wasn't that much

1242
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:01,860
anyway much so there wasn't that much
 

1243
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:07,100
anyway much so there wasn't that much
value and but more seriously I think if

1244
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,110
value and but more seriously I think if
 

1245
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,960
value and but more seriously I think if
you ask not just about being conscious

1246
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:08,970
you ask not just about being conscious
 

1247
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,470
you ask not just about being conscious
but maybe having what you would

it's finite you know let's let's make
the most of this this live to the

1262
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
the most of this this live to the
 

1263
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
the most of this this live to the
fullest so if you if you knew you were

1264
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:32,650
fullest so if you if you knew you were
 

1265
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,460
fullest so if you if you knew you were
gonna slip forever if you think you

1266
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:35,470
gonna slip forever if you think you
 

1267
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,370
gonna slip forever if you think you
would change your yeah in some

1268
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:38,380
would change your yeah in some
 

1269
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,580
would change your yeah in some
perspective it would be an incredibly

1270
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:41,590
perspective it would be an incredibly
 

1271
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,850
perspective it would be an incredibly
boring life living forever so in the

1272
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:44,860
boring life living forever so in the
 

1273
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,010
boring life living forever so in the
sort of loose subjective terms that you

1274
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,020
sort of loose subjective terms that you
 

1275
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,020
sort of loose subjective terms that you
said of something exciting and something

1276
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,030
said of something exciting and something
 

1277
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,480
said of something exciting and something
in this that other humans would

1278
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:51,490
in this that other humans would
 

1279
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,730
in this that other humans would
understand I think is yeah it seems that

1280
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:53,740
understand I think is yeah it seems that
 

1281
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,240
understand I think is yeah it seems that
the the finiteness of it is important

1282
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,250
the the finiteness of it is important
 

1283
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,500
the the finiteness of it is important
well the good news I have for you then

1284
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:58,510
well the good news I have for you then
 

1285
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,450
well the good news I have for you then
is based on what we understand about

1286
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:00,460
is based on what we understand about
 

1287
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,930
is based on what we understand about
cosmology everything is in our universe

1288
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:03,940
cosmology everything is in our universe
 

1289
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,230
cosmology everything is in our universe
is Pro ultimately probably finite alone

1290
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,240
is Pro ultimately probably finite alone
 

1291
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,500
is Pro ultimately probably finite alone
although pay crunch or bit or big what's

1292
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:10,510
although pay crunch or bit or big what's
 

1293
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,090
although pay crunch or bit or big what's
to expand anything yeah we couldn't have

1294
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,100
to expand anything yeah we couldn't have
 

1295
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,430
to expand anything yeah we couldn't have
a Big Chill or a Big Crunch or a big rip

1296
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:14,440
a Big Chill or a Big Crunch or a big rip
 

1297
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,390
a Big Chill or a Big Crunch or a big rip
or that's the big snap or death bubbles

1298
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:17,400
or that's the big snap or death bubbles
 

1299
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,919
or that's the big snap or death bubbles
all over more than a billion years away

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:19,929
all over more than a billion years away
 

1301
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:23,100
all over more than a billion years away
so we should we certainly have vastly

1302
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,110
so we should we certainly have vastly
 

1303
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,909
so we should we certainly have vastly
more time than our ancestors thought but

1304
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:26,919
more time than our ancestors thought but
 

1305
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,240
more time than our ancestors thought but
there is still it's still pretty hard to

1306
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,250
there is still it's still pretty hard to
 

1307
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,880
there is still it's still pretty hard to
squeeze in an infinite number of compute

1308
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:32,890
squeeze in an infinite number of compute
 

1309
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,580

cycles even though there are some

1310
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:35,590
cycles even though there are some
 

1311
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,710

1312
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:37,720
loophole let's just might be possible
 

1313
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,610
loophole let's just might be possible
but I think I you know some people like

1314
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:41,620
but I think I you know some people like
 

1315
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,460
but I think I you know some people like
to say that you should live as if you're

1316
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:44,470
to say that you should live as if you're
 

1317
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,560
to say that you should live as if you're
about you're gonna die in five years or

1318
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:46,570
about you're gonna die in five years or
 

1319
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,590
about you're gonna die in five years or
something that sort of optimal maybe

1320
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:48,600
something that sort of optimal maybe
 

1321
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,690
something that sort of optimal maybe
it's a good it subs we should build our

00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:51,700
it's a good it subs we should build our
 

1323
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,900
it's a good it subs we should build our
civilization as if it's all finite to be

on the safe side right exactly so you

1326
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,030
on the safe side right exactly so you
 

1327
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,049
on the safe side right exactly so you
mentioned in defining intelligence as

1328
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:00,059
mentioned in defining intelligence as
 

1329
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,419
mentioned in defining intelligence as
the ability solve complex goals where

1330
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:03,429
the ability solve complex goals where
 

1331
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:05,400
the ability solve complex goals where
would you draw a line how would you try

1332
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,410
would you draw a line how would you try
 

1333
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,419
would you draw a line how would you try
to define human level intelligence and

1334
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:08,429
to define human level intelligence and
 

1335
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:11,400
to define human level intelligence and
superhuman level intelligence where this

1336
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,410
superhuman level intelligence where this
 

1337
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,549
superhuman level intelligence where this
consciousness part of that definition no

1338
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:13,559
consciousness part of that definition no
 

1339
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,870
consciousness part of that definition no
consciousness does not come into this

1340
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:15,880
consciousness does not come into this
 

1341
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,150
consciousness does not come into this
definition so so I think your

1342
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,160
definition so so I think your
 

1343
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,400
definition so so I think your
intelligence is it's a spectrum but

1344
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,410
intelligence is it's a spectrum but
 

1345
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,600
intelligence is it's a spectrum but
there are very many different kinds of

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,860
better at us at doing most of the jobs
that we do because that's it can takes

1418
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:49,870
that we do because that's it can takes
 

1419
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,289
that we do because that's it can takes
away much of the demand for human labor

1420
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:52,299
away much of the demand for human labor
 

1421
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:55,110
away much of the demand for human labor
and then the really whopping change

1422
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
and then the really whopping change
 

1423
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,220
and then the really whopping change
comes when they become better than us at

00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,230
comes when they become better than us at

1523
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,440
problems but you know just kind of to
take a pause and we took a bunch of

1524
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,450
take a pause and we took a bunch of
 

1525
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,090
take a pause and we took a bunch of
questions and a lot of social networks

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,100
questions and a lot of social networks
 

1527
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,040
questions and a lot of social networks
and a bunch of people asked a sort of a

and a bunch of people asked a sort of a
 

1529
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,190

perhaps aren't a peak the it's you know

perhaps aren't a peak the it's you know

00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,880
perhaps aren't a peak the it's you know

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,990
so let me sort of yeah
start and start easy first of all so you

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,000
start and start easy first of all so you
 

1545
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,850
start and start easy first of all so you
have a lot of cool equations let me ask

1546
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:36,860
have a lot of cool equations let me ask
 

1547
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,410
have a lot of cool equations let me ask
what's your favorite equation first of

1548
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:38,420
what's your favorite equation first of
 

1549
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,600
what's your favorite equation first of
all I know they're all like your

1550
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:40,610
all I know they're all like your
 

1551
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,580
all I know they're all like your
children but like which one is that it's

1552
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:45,590
children but like which one is that it's
 

1553
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,560
children but like which one is that it's
the master key of

1554
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:47,570
the master key of
 

1555
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,380
the master key of
want the mechanics of the microworld

1556
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,390
want the mechanics of the microworld
 

1557
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,880
want the mechanics of the microworld
this equation to protect you like

1558
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:51,890
this equation to protect you like
 

1559
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,490
this equation to protect you like
everything to do with atoms molecules

1560
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:54,500
everything to do with atoms molecules
 

1561
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,890
everything to do with atoms molecules
and all that we have yeah so okay it's a

1562
00:31:59,890 --> 00:31:59,900
and all that we have yeah so okay it's a
 

1563
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,060
and all that we have yeah so okay it's a
quantum mechanics is certainly a

00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,070
quantum mechanics is certainly a
 

1565
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,270
quantum mechanics is certainly a
beautiful mysterious formulation of our

00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:04,280
beautiful mysterious formulation of our
 

1567
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,430
beautiful mysterious formulation of our
world so I'd like to sort of ask you

1568
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:06,440
world so I'd like to sort of ask you
 

1569
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,580
world so I'd like to sort of ask you
just as an example it perhaps doesn't

1570
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:09,590
just as an example it perhaps doesn't

got quite famous for it so I find this
 

1661
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,630
got quite famous for it so I find this
too late for me to even publish it but

too late for me to even publish it but

00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:14,129
so what would it take and at that moment
 

1671
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:17,540
so what would it take and at that moment
that wow that was yours in a moment so

that wow that was yours in a moment so

that wow that was yours in a moment so
what do you think it takes for an

00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,080
traditional computers is because it's
 

1887
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,390
traditional computers is because it's
something that comes more naturally if

1888
00:38:59,390 --> 00:38:59,400
something that comes more naturally if
 

1889
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,700
something that comes more naturally if
you're a neural network then if you're a

1890
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:01,710
you're a neural network then if you're a
 

1891
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,790
you're a neural network then if you're a
traditional logic gate based computer

1892
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:04,800
traditional logic gate based computer

1894
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,130
machine
 

1895
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,740
machine
you know we physically have all these

1896
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:06,750
you know we physically have all these
 

1897
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,730
you know we physically have all these
connections and you activate here

1898
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:10,740
connections and you activate here
 

1899
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,720

activator here activate here ping you

1900

know I my hunch is that if we ever build

1902
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,330
know I my hunch is that if we ever build
 

1903
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,410
know I my hunch is that if we ever build
a machine where you could just give it

1904
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:21,420
a machine where you could just give it
 

1905
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,360
a machine where you could just give it
the task hey hey you say hey you know I

1906
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,370
the task hey hey you say hey you know I
 

1907
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,010
the task hey hey you say hey you know I
just realized that I have I want to

1908
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,020
just realized that I have I want to
 

1909
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,060
just realized that I have I want to
travel around the world instead this

1910
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,070
travel around the world instead this
 

1911
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,680
travel around the world instead this
months can you teach my eight a GI

1912
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:33,690
months can you teach my eight a GI
 

1913
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,660
months can you teach my eight a GI
course for me and it's like ok I'll do

1914
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:35,670
course for me and it's like ok I'll do
 

1915
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,460
course for me and it's like ok I'll do
it and it does everything that you would

1916
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:37,470
it and it does everything that you would
 

1917
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,870
it and it does everything that you would
have done and they provides us and so

1918
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:38,880
have done and they provides us and so
 

1919
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,480
have done and they provides us and so
yeah that that would in my mind involve

1920
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:41,490
yeah that that would in my mind involve
 

1921
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,630
yeah that that would in my mind involve
a lot of creativity yeah so I had such a

1922
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:44,640
a lot of creativity yeah so I had such a
 

1923
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,490
a lot of creativity yeah so I had such a
beautiful way to put it I think we do

1924
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:46,500
beautiful way to put it I think we do
 

1925
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,990
beautiful way to put it I think we do
try to grab grasp at the you know the

1926
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,000
try to grab grasp at the you know the
 

1927
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,090
try to grab grasp at the you know the
definition of intelligence is everything

1928
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:53,100
definition of intelligence is everything
 

1929
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,510
definition of intelligence is everything
we don't understand how how to build so

1930
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:56,520
we don't understand how how to build so
 

1931
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,180
we don't understand how how to build so
like so we as humans try to find things

1932
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,190
like so we as humans try to find things
 

1933
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,890
like so we as humans try to find things
well that we have on machines don't

1934
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:00,900
well that we have on machines don't
 

1935
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,840
well that we have on machines don't
happen maybe creativity is just one of

1936
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:02,850
happen maybe creativity is just one of
 

1937
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,640
happen maybe creativity is just one of
the things one of the words we use to

1938
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:04,650
the things one of the words we use to
 

1939
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,560
the things one of the words we use to
describe that that's really interesting

1940
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:06,570
describe that that's really interesting
 

1941
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,430
describe that that's really interesting
where to put it out

1942
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,440
where to put it out
 

1943
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,800
where to put it out
think we need to be that defensive I

1944
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:09,810
think we need to be that defensive I
 

1945
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,270
think we need to be that defensive I
don't think anything good comes out of

1946
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:11,280
don't think anything good comes out of
 

1947
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,220
don't think anything good comes out of
saying oh we're somehow special you know

1948
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,230
saying oh we're somehow special you know
 

1949
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:19,819
saying oh we're somehow special you know
I it's contrariwise there are many

1950
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:19,829
I it's contrariwise there are many
 

1951
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:24,530
I it's contrariwise there are many
examples in history of we're trying to

1952
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:24,540
examples in history of we're trying to
 

1953
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,099
examples in history of we're trying to
pretend that were somehow superior to

1954
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:28,109
pretend that were somehow superior to
 

1955
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:32,089
pretend that were somehow superior to
all other intelligent beings has led the

1956
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:32,099
all other intelligent beings has led the
 

1957
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:35,319
all other intelligent beings has led the
pretty bad results right

1958
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:35,329

 

1959
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:37,579

Nazi Germany they said that they were

1960
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:37,589
Nazi Germany they said that they were
 

1961
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:40,280
Nazi Germany they said that they were
somehow superior to other people today

1962
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,290
somehow superior to other people today
 

1963
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,410
somehow superior to other people today
we still do a lot of cruelty to animals

1964
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:42,420
we still do a lot of cruelty to animals
 

1965
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,910
we still do a lot of cruelty to animals
by saying that we're social superiors

1966
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:43,920
by saying that we're social superiors
 

1967
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,380
by saying that we're social superiors
and how and the other they can't feel

1968
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:45,390
and how and the other they can't feel
 

1969
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:45,970
and how and the other they can't feel
pain

1970
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:45,980
pain
 

1971
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,530

slavery was justified by the same kind

1972
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:48,540
slavery was justified by the same kind
 

1973
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,990
slavery was justified by the same kind
of really weak weak arguments and and I

1974
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,000
of really weak weak arguments and and I
 

1975
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,880
of really weak weak arguments and and I
don't think if we actually go ahead and

1976
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:55,890
don't think if we actually go ahead and
 

1977
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,450
don't think if we actually go ahead and
build artificial general intelligence it

1978
00:40:59,450 --> 00:40:59,460
build artificial general intelligence it
 

1979
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,250
build artificial general intelligence it
can do things better than us I don't

1980
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:01,260
can do things better than us I don't
 

1981
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,809
can do things better than us I don't
think we should try to found our

00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:02,819
think we should try to found our
 

1983
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:07,250
think we should try to found our
self-worth on some sort of bogus claims

00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:07,260
self-worth on some sort of bogus claims
 

1985
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,950
self-worth on some sort of bogus claims
of superiority in in terms of our

1986
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:09,960
of superiority in in terms of our
 

1987
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,160
of superiority in in terms of our
intelligence I think it's we shouldn't

stand Joe find our calling and then the

1990
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:19,859
stand Joe find our calling and then the
 

1991
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,859
stand Joe find our calling and then the
meaning of life from from experiences

1992
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:21,869
meaning of life from from experiences
 

1993

that we have right you know I can have I
 

1995
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,910
that we have right you know I can have I
can have very meaningful experiences

1996

can have very meaningful experiences
 

1997
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,960
can have very meaningful experiences
even if there are other people who are

even if there are other people who are
smarter than me you know when I go to

00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:33,390
smarter than me you know when I go to
 

2001
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,420
smarter than me you know when I go to
faculty meeting here and I was talking

2002
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:35,430
faculty meeting here and I was talking
 

2003
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,380
faculty meeting here and I was talking
about something that I certainly realize

2004
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:36,390
about something that I certainly realize
 

2005
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,569
about something that I certainly realize
oh boy he has a Nobel Prize he has a

2006

oh boy he has a Nobel Prize he has a

what does that make me enjoy life any

2010
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,170
what does that make me enjoy life any
 

2011
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:47,240
what does that make me enjoy life any
less or would enjoy talking those people

2012
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,250
less or would enjoy talking those people
 

2013
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,140
less or would enjoy talking those people
less of course not see my and the

less of course not see my and the
 

2015
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,660
less of course not see my and the
contrariwise I I feel very honored and

2016
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:53,670
contrariwise I I feel very honored and
 

2017
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,059

other very intelligent beings that are
 

2021
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,940
other very intelligent beings that are
better than me a lot of stuff so I don't

2022
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:01,950
better than me a lot of stuff so I don't
 

2023
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,170
better than me a lot of stuff so I don't
think there's any reason why we can't

2024
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:03,180
think there's any reason why we can't
 

2025
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,579
think there's any reason why we can't
have the same approach with with

00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:04,589
have the same approach with with
 

2027
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,559
have the same approach with with
intelligent machines that's a really

2028
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:06,569
intelligent machines that's a really
 

2029
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:08,210
intelligent machines that's a really
interesting so people don't often think

2030
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:08,220
interesting so people don't often think
 

2031
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,770
interesting so people don't often think
about that they think about when there's

2032
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:09,780
about that they think about when there's
 

2033
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,319
about that they think about when there's
going if there's machines that are more

2034
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:12,329
going if there's machines that are more
 

2035
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,569
going if there's machines that are more
intelligent you naturally think that

2036
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:14,579
intelligent you naturally think that
 

2037
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:17,630
intelligent you naturally think that
that's not going to be a beneficial type

2038
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:17,640

2125
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,059
oestrus with it's it's child you know
and why did we humans private extinction

2126
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:09,069
and why did we humans private extinction
 

2127
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:11,370
and why did we humans private extinction
wasn't because we were evil Rhino haters

2128
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:11,380
wasn't because we were evil Rhino haters
 

2129
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,589
wasn't because we were evil Rhino haters
right as a whole it was just because we

2130
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
right as a whole it was just because we
 

2131
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,359
right as a whole it was just because we
our goals weren't aligned with those of

our goals weren't aligned with those of
the rhinoceros and it didn't work out so

2134
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:16,780
the rhinoceros and it didn't work out so
 

2135
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,270
the rhinoceros and it didn't work out so
well for the rhinoceros because we were

2136
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:18,280
well for the rhinoceros because we were
 

2137
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,370
well for the rhinoceros because we were
more intelligent right so I think it's

2138
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:20,380
more intelligent right so I think it's
 

2139
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,290
more intelligent right so I think it's
just so important that if we ever do

2140
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:22,300
just so important that if we ever do
 

2141
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,069
just so important that if we ever do
build AGI before we

2142
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:27,079
build AGI before we
 

2143
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:31,480

we have to make sure that it it learns

2144
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:31,490
we have to make sure that it it learns
 

2145
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:34,990
we have to make sure that it it learns
to understand our goals that it adopts

2146
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:35,000
to understand our goals that it adopts
 

2147
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,109
to understand our goals that it adopts
our goals and it retains those goals so

2148
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:38,119
our goals and it retains those goals so
 

2149
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:40,589
our goals and it retains those goals so
the cool interesting problem there is

2150
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:40,599
the cool interesting problem there is
 

2151
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:44,740
the cool interesting problem there is
being able us as human beings trying to

2152
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:44,750
being able us as human beings trying to
 

2153
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,950
being able us as human beings trying to
formulate our values so you know you

2154
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:47,960
formulate our values so you know you
 

2155
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,940

could think of the United States

we should say they formulated the goals

2164
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:00,799
we should say they formulated the goals
 

2165
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,440
we should say they formulated the goals
for this country and a lot of people

2166
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:02,450
for this country and a lot of people
 

2167
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,059
for this country and a lot of people
agree that those goals actually hold up

2168
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:04,069
agree that those goals actually hold up
 

2169
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:06,160
agree that those goals actually hold up
pretty well that's an interesting

2170
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,170
pretty well that's an interesting
 

2171
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,630
pretty well that's an interesting

00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:45,890
it's not at all a crazy idea to just
 

2351
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,880
it's not at all a crazy idea to just
have that hardwired into the car just

2352
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:48,890
have that hardwired into the car just
 

2353
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:50,650
have that hardwired into the car just
yeah there are a lot of there's always

2354
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:50,660
yeah there are a lot of there's always
 

2355
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,450
yeah there are a lot of there's always
gonna be people who for some reason want

2356
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:52,460
gonna be people who for some reason want
 

2357
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,780
gonna be people who for some reason want
to harm others

2358
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:53,790
to harm others
 

2359
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:55,280
to harm others
most of those people don't have the

2360
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:55,290
most of those people don't have the
 

2361
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,930
most of those people don't have the
technical expertise to figure out how to

2362
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:56,940
technical expertise to figure out how to
 

2363
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,760
technical expertise to figure out how to
work around something like that so if

2364
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:58,770
work around something like that so if
 

2365
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,460
work around something like that so if
the car just won't do it

2366
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:00,470
the car just won't do it
 

2367
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,200
the car just won't do it
it helps it let's start there so there's

2368
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:03,210
it helps it let's start there so there's
 

2369
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,930
it helps it let's start there so there's
a lot of that's a great point so not not

2370
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:05,940
a lot of that's a great point so not not
 

2371
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,700
a lot of that's a great point so not not
chasing perfect there's a lot of things

2372
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:07,710
chasing perfect there's a lot of things
 

2373
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,340
chasing perfect there's a lot of things
that a lot that most of the world agrees

2374
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:10,350
that a lot that most of the world agrees
 

2375
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,230
that a lot that most of the world agrees
on yeah and this look there let's start

2376
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:12,240
on yeah and this look there let's start
 

2377
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,570
on yeah and this look there let's start
there and and then once we start there

2378
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:14,580
there and and then once we start there
 

2379
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,120
there and and then once we start there
we'll also get into the habit of having

2380
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,130
we'll also get into the habit of having
 

2381
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,560
we'll also get into the habit of having
these kind of conversations about okay

2382
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:18,570
these kind of conversations about okay
 

2383
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,300
these kind of conversations about okay
what else should we put in here and I

2384
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:20,310
what else should we put in here and I
 

2385
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,340
what else should we put in here and I
have these discussions this should be a

2386
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:22,350
have these discussions this should be a
 

2387
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:26,660
have these discussions this should be a
gradual process then great so but that

2388
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:26,670
gradual process then great so but that
 

2389
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,730
gradual process then great so but that
also means describing these things and

2390
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:28,740
also means describing these things and
 

2391
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,800
also means describing these things and
describing it to a machine

2392
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:30,810
describing it to a machine
 

2393
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:34,190
describing it to a machine
so one thing we had a few conversation

2394
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:34,200
so one thing we had a few conversation
 

2395
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,200
so one thing we had a few conversation
was Stephen Wolfram I'm not sure if

2396
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:36,210
was Stephen Wolfram I'm not sure if
 

2397
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,400
was Stephen Wolfram I'm not sure if
you're familiar with Stephen but yeah I

2398
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:37,410
you're familiar with Stephen but yeah I
 

2399
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,890
you're familiar with Stephen but yeah I
know quite well so he is you know he

2400
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:39,900
know quite well so he is you know he
 

2401
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,840
know quite well so he is you know he
played you know works with a bunch of

2402
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:41,850
played you know works with a bunch of
 

2403
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,280
played you know works with a bunch of
things but you know cellular automata

2404
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:43,290
things but you know cellular automata
 

2405
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:46,640
things but you know cellular automata
are these simple computable things these

2406
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,650
are these simple computable things these
 

2407
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,470
are these simple computable things these
computation systems and he kind of

2408
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:48,480
computation systems and he kind of
 

2409
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,750
computation systems and he kind of
mentioned that you know we probably have

2410
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:50,760
mentioned that you know we probably have
 

2411
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,670
mentioned that you know we probably have
already within these systems already

2412
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:52,680
already within these systems already
 

2413
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,860
already within these systems already
something that's AGI meaning like we

2414
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:57,870
something that's AGI meaning like we
 

2415
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,540
something that's AGI meaning like we
just don't know it because we can't talk

2416
00:49:59,540 --> 00:49:59,550
just don't know it because we can't talk
 

2417
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,230
just don't know it because we can't talk
to it so if you give me this chance to

2418
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:03,240
to it so if you give me this chance to
 

2419
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,450
to it so if you give me this chance to
try to try to release form a question

2420
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:05,460
try to try to release form a question
 

2421
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,900
try to try to release form a question
out of this is I think it's an

2422
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:08,910
out of this is I think it's an
 

2423
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,390
out of this is I think it's an
interesting idea to think that we can

2424
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:11,400
interesting idea to think that we can
 

2425
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,220
interesting idea to think that we can
have intelligent systems but we don't

2426
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:13,230
have intelligent systems but we don't
 

2427
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:15,440
have intelligent systems but we don't
know how to describe something to them

2428
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:15,450
know how to describe something to them
 

2429
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,210
know how to describe something to them
and they can't communicate with us I

2430
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:17,220
and they can't communicate with us I
 

2431
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,740
and they can't communicate with us I
know you're doing a little bit work an

2432
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:18,750
know you're doing a little bit work an
 

2433
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,690
know you're doing a little bit work an
explainable AI trying to get AI to

2434
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:20,700
explainable AI trying to get AI to
 

2435
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,930
explainable AI trying to get AI to
explain itself so what are your thoughts

2436
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:23,940
explain itself so what are your thoughts
 

2437
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,760
explain itself so what are your thoughts
of natural language processing or some

2438
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:25,770
of natural language processing or some
 

2439
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,550
of natural language processing or some
kind of other communication how how does

2440
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:28,560
kind of other communication how how does
 

2441
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,440
kind of other communication how how does
the AI explain something to us how do we

2442
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:30,450
the AI explain something to us how do we
 

2443
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,170
the AI explain something to us how do we
explain something to it to machines or

2444
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:33,180
explain something to it to machines or
 

2445
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,690
explain something to it to machines or
you think of it differently so there are

2446
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:35,700
you think of it differently so there are
 

2447
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,300
you think of it differently so there are
two separate parts to your question

2448
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:38,310
two separate parts to your question
 

2449
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,720
two separate parts to your question
there are them one of them has to do

2450
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:41,730
there are them one of them has to do
 

2451
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,920
there are them one of them has to do
with communication which is super

2452
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:42,930
with communication which is super
 

2453
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,150
with communication which is super
interesting you don't get that insect

2454
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
interesting you don't get that insect
 

2455
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,940
interesting you don't get that insect
the other is whether we already have AGI

2456
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:46,950
the other is whether we already have AGI
 

2457
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,890
the other is whether we already have AGI
but we just haven't noticed it yeah

2458
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:48,900
but we just haven't noticed it yeah
 

2459
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,750
but we just haven't noticed it yeah
right there I beg to differ right and

right there I beg to differ right and
 

2461
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,610
right there I beg to differ right and
don't think there's anything in any

00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:55,620
don't think there's anything in any
 

2463
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,740
don't think there's anything in any
cellular automaton or anything or the

we humans can do better I think today if

2472
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:07,960
we humans can do better I think today if
 

2473
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,280
we humans can do better I think today if
the day that happens when that happens

the day that happens when that happens
 

2475
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,920
the day that happens when that happens
we will very soon notice we will

we will very soon notice we will

we will very soon notice we will
probably notice even before andif

know as information processing you can
 

2489
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,590
know as information processing you can
think of intelligence and information

2490
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:31,600
think of intelligence and information
 

2491
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,540
think of intelligence and information
processing and this you can think of the

processing and this you can think of the
 

2493
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,910
processing and this you can think of the
entire universe there's these particles

2494

entire universe there's these particles
 

2495

entire universe there's these particles
and these systems roaming around that

and these systems roaming around that
 

2497
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,530
and these systems roaming around that
have this information processing power

2498
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:40,540
have this information processing power
 

2499
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,290
have this information processing power
you don't you don't think there is

2500
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:43,300
you don't you don't think there is
 

2501
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,680
you don't you don't think there is
something with the power to process

2502
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:46,690
something with the power to process
 

2503
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,540
something with the power to process
information in the way that we human

2504
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:48,550
information in the way that we human

seems a little bit philosophical perhaps
 

2511
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,670

but there's something compelling to the
 

2513
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,710
but there's something compelling to the
idea that the power is already there

cool here so the raw hardware power
 

2581
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:19,319
cool here so the raw hardware power
and sherbet and then and even just like

and sherbet and then and even just like
 

2583
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,299
and sherbet and then and even just like
computing what's gonna happen for the

next five seconds in this water ball you
 

2587
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,109
next five seconds in this water ball you
know it takes in a ridiculous amount of

2588
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
know it takes in a ridiculous amount of
 

2589
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,089
know it takes in a ridiculous amount of
compute if you do it on a human computer

compute if you do it on a human computer
 

2591
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:27,569

in yeah

2592
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:27,579
in yeah

not mean this water bottle has AGI and

2596
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:34,140
not mean this water bottle has AGI and
 

2597
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,510
not mean this water bottle has AGI and
because AGI means it should also be able

2598
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:36,520
because AGI means it should also be able
 

2599

to like have written my book during his
 

2601
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,859
to like have written my book during his
interview yes and I don't think it's

00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:40,869
interview yes and I don't think it's
 

2603
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,510
interview yes and I don't think it's
just communication problems as far as

00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:42,520
just communication problems as far as
 

2605
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,380
just communication problems as far as
you know don't think it can do it and

they can communicate with communication
that's also very important here because

with all these brilliant ideas but but
 

2627

with all these brilliant ideas but but
to communicate with somebody else you

2628
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:14,530
to communicate with somebody else you
 

2629
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:16,020
to communicate with somebody else you
have to also be able to simulate their

00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,030
have to also be able to simulate their

00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:18,839
have to also be able to simulate their

00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,140
mind that you can say things that they
will understand and that's quite

2638
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:25,150
will understand and that's quite
 

2639
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,630
will understand and that's quite
difficult and that's why today it's so

2640
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:27,640
difficult and that's why today it's so
 

2641
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,700
difficult and that's why today it's so
frustrating if you have a computer that

2642
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:29,710
frustrating if you have a computer that
 

2643
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:33,000
frustrating if you have a computer that
makes some cancer diagnosis and you ask

2644
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,010
makes some cancer diagnosis and you ask
 

2645
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,529
makes some cancer diagnosis and you ask
it well why are you saying I should have

2646
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:34,539
it well why are you saying I should have
 

2647
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,779
it well why are you saying I should have
a surgery if it and if they don't know

2648
00:54:36,779 --> 00:54:36,789
a surgery if it and if they don't know
 

2649
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:39,359
a surgery if it and if they don't know
can only reply or I was trained on five

2650
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,369
can only reply or I was trained on five
 

2651
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:42,620
can only reply or I was trained on five
terabytes of data and this is my

00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:42,630
terabytes of data and this is my
 

2653
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:45,180
terabytes of data and this is my

2654
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,190

2657
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:50,099
didn't doesn't really instill a lot of
confidence right right so I think we

2658
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:50,109
confidence right right so I think we
 

2659
00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:52,589
confidence right right so I think we
have a lot of work do one on

01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,270
answer that question no it's enough to

01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,720
airplanes
yeah my plans do a pretty good job of

2974
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:15,730
yeah my plans do a pretty good job of
 

2975
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,000
yeah my plans do a pretty good job of
flying without really mimicking bird

2976
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,010
flying without really mimicking bird
 

2977
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:20,100
flying without really mimicking bird
flight and even now after 100 is 100

2978
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:20,110
flight and even now after 100 is 100
 

2979
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,720
flight and even now after 100 is 100
years later did you see the TED talk

2980
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:21,730
years later did you see the TED talk
 

2981
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:24,740
years later did you see the TED talk
with a mr. mechanical bird you mentioned

2982
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:24,750
with a mr. mechanical bird you mentioned
 

2983
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,600
with a mr. mechanical bird you mentioned
it's amazing but even after that right

2984
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:27,610
it's amazing but even after that right
 

2985
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:29,340
it's amazing but even after that right
we still don't fly in mechanical birds

2986
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:29,350
we still don't fly in mechanical birds
 

2987
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,810
we still don't fly in mechanical birds
because it turned out the way we came up

2988
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:30,820
because it turned out the way we came up
 

2989
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,390
because it turned out the way we came up
with but simpler and it's better for our

2990
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:33,400
with but simpler and it's better for our
 

2991
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,650
with but simpler and it's better for our
purposes and I think it might be the

2992
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:34,660
purposes and I think it might be the
 

2993
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,160
purposes and I think it might be the
same there that's one lesson and another

2994
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:38,170
same there that's one lesson and another
 

2995
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,280
same there that's one lesson and another
lesson it is one what did when our paper

2996
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:41,290
lesson it is one what did when our paper
 

2997
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:41,790
lesson it is one what did when our paper
was about

2998
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:41,800
was about
 

2999
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,310
was about
well first we wife is a physicist

01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:44,320
well first we wife is a physicist
 

3001
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,170
well first we wife is a physicist
thought it was fascinating how there is

3002
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:46,180
thought it was fascinating how there is
 

3003
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,120
thought it was fascinating how there is
a very closed mathematical relationship

3004
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:48,130
a very closed mathematical relationship
 

3005
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:50,070
a very closed mathematical relationship
actually between our artificial neural

01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:50,080
actually between our artificial neural
 

3007
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,690
actually between our artificial neural
networks and a lot of things that we've

3008
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:51,700
networks and a lot of things that we've
 

3009
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,500

3011
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,360

01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:12,490
well there's something crazy here that
 

3021
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:16,370
well there's something crazy here that
doesn't make sense because we know that

01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:16,380
doesn't make sense because we know that
 

3023
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,920
doesn't make sense because we know that
if you even want to build a super simple

3029
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:27,780
pictures and dog pictures right that you
can do that very very well now but if

3030
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:27,790
can do that very very well now but if
 

3031
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,130
can do that very very well now but if
you think about it a little bit you

3032
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:29,140
you think about it a little bit you
 

3033
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,420
you think about it a little bit you
convince yourself it must be impossible

3034
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:30,430
convince yourself it must be impossible
 

3035
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:34,050
convince yourself it must be impossible
because if I have one megapixel even if

3036
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:34,060
because if I have one megapixel even if
 

3037
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,610
because if I have one megapixel even if
each pixel is just black or white

there are atoms in our universe right so

3044
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:41,020
there are atoms in our universe right so

there are atoms in our universe right so
in order to and then for each one of

in order to and then for each one of
 

3047
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,650
in order to and then for each one of
those I have to assign a number which is

01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:46,660
those I have to assign a number which is
 

3049
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,140
those I have to assign a number which is
the probability that it's a dog right so

3050
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:49,150
the probability that it's a dog right so

01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:52,170
the probability that it's a dog right so
an arbitrary function of images is a

list of more numbers than there are
 

3055
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,570
list of more numbers than there are
atoms in our universe so clearly I can't

01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:57,580
atoms in our universe so clearly I can't
 

3057
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,550

store that under the hood of my my GPU
 

3059
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,100

or maybe my computer yet somehow works
so what does that mean well it means

3062
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:04,330
so what does that mean well it means
 

3063
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,530
so what does that mean well it means
that the out of all of the problems that

01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:07,540
that the out of all of the problems that

that the out of all of the problems that
you could all try to solve with a neural

then what we should show it in our paper

3074
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:19,510
then what we should show it in our paper
 

3075
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:23,580
then what we should show it in our paper
was was that they the fraks the kind of

was was that they the fraks the kind of

an infinitesimally tiny little part and
 

3087
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:36,160
an infinitesimally tiny little part and
amazingly they're basically the same

amazingly they're basically the same

01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,800
amazingly they're basically the same

of come together yeah but you could say
 

3095
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:44,050
of come together yeah but you could say
maybe where the world created the world

3096
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,060
maybe where the world created the world
 

3097
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,700
maybe where the world created the world
that the world was created for us but I

3098
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:45,710
that the world was created for us but I
 

3099
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,380
that the world was created for us but I
have a more modest interpretation which

have a more modest interpretation which
is that instead evolution in downest but

read so it makes sense that why do we

3116
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:07,520
read so it makes sense that why do we
 

3117
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,520
read so it makes sense that why do we
have a brain in the first place it's to

01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:09,530
have a brain in the first place it's to
 

3119
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:10,750
have a brain in the first place it's to
be able to make predictions about the

01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,330
be able to make predictions about the

wouldn't have a logic so but it's so
this is this is a I think you're very

3128
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:22,460
this is this is a I think you're very

on why deeper networks are good but we

3136
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:32,300
on why deeper networks are good but we
 

3137
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,150
on why deeper networks are good but we
were able to show an additional cool

will happily figure this out for you if

3286
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:46,520
will happily figure this out for you if
 

3287
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,100
will happily figure this out for you if
you just cool it down and make you very

3288
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:48,110
you just cool it down and make you very
 

3289
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:51,760
you just cool it down and make you very
very cold if you put a ball somewhere

3290
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:51,770
very cold if you put a ball somewhere
 

3291
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,590
very cold if you put a ball somewhere
it'll roll down to its minimum and this

3292
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:53,600
it'll roll down to its minimum and this
 

3293
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,210
it'll roll down to its minimum and this
happens metaphorically

3294
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:55,220
happens metaphorically
 

3295
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,849
happens metaphorically
and the energy landscape too and quantum

3296
01:07:57,849 --> 01:07:57,859
and the energy landscape too and quantum
 

3297
01:07:57,859 --> 01:07:59,470
and the energy landscape too and quantum
mechanics even used as a mode some

learning systems don't like if you're

3302
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:04,430
learning systems don't like if you're
 

3303
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,530
learning systems don't like if you're
trying to find the minimum and you get

3304
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:05,540
trying to find the minimum and you get
 

3305
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,020
trying to find the minimum and you get
stuck in a little local minima here in

3306
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:08,030
stuck in a little local minima here in
 

3307
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:08,980
stuck in a little local minima here in
quantum mechanics you can actually

3308
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:08,990
quantum mechanics you can actually
 

3309
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:11,680
quantum mechanics you can actually
tunnel through the barrier and get

3310
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:11,690
tunnel through the barrier and get
 

3311
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:14,980
tunnel through the barrier and get
unstuck in Yemen and that's really

3312
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:14,990
unstuck in Yemen and that's really
 

3313
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,510
unstuck in Yemen and that's really
interesting yeah so it may be for

3314
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:16,520
interesting yeah so it may be for
 

3315
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,959
interesting yeah so it may be for
example it will one day use quantum

3316
01:08:18,959 --> 01:08:18,969
example it will one day use quantum

01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:24,319
networks better that's really
 

3321
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,229
networks better that's really
interesting okay so as a component of

3322
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:26,239
interesting okay so as a component of
 

3323
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,269
interesting okay so as a component of
kind of the learning process for example

3324
01:08:28,269 --> 01:08:28,279
kind of the learning process for example
 

3325
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:29,320
kind of the learning process for example
yeah

3326
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:29,330
yeah
 

3327
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:32,860
yeah
let me ask sort of wrapping up here a

3328
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:32,870
let me ask sort of wrapping up here a
 

3329
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:35,709
let me ask sort of wrapping up here a
little bit let me let me return to the

3330
01:08:35,709 --> 01:08:35,719
little bit let me let me return to the
 

3331
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:37,499
little bit let me let me return to the
questions of our human nature and and

3332
01:08:37,499 --> 01:08:37,509
questions of our human nature and and
 

3333
01:08:37,509 --> 01:08:44,860
questions of our human nature and and
love as I mentioned so do you think you

3334
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:44,870
love as I mentioned so do you think you
 

3335
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,570
love as I mentioned so do you think you
mentioned sort of a helper robot you can

3336
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:46,580
mentioned sort of a helper robot you can
 

3337
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,300
mentioned sort of a helper robot you can
think of also personal robots do you

3338
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:49,310
think of also personal robots do you
 

3339
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:52,510
think of also personal robots do you
think the way we human beings fall in

3340
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:52,520
think the way we human beings fall in
 

3341
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,249
think the way we human beings fall in
love and get connected to each other

3342
01:08:54,249 --> 01:08:54,259
love and get connected to each other

and human-level AI intelligence system
do you think we would ever see that kind

3348
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,089
do you think we would ever see that kind
 

3349
01:09:02,089 --> 01:09:05,650
do you think we would ever see that kind
of connection or you know in all this

yeah as this kind of human social

3354
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:09,890
yeah as this kind of human social
 

3355
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,680
yeah as this kind of human social
connection do you think that's one of

3356
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:11,690
connection do you think that's one of
 

3357
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,530

the goals and the peaks and valleys that

3358
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:14,540
the goals and the peaks and valleys that
 

3359
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:16,479
the goals and the peaks and valleys that
with the raising sea levels that we'll

3360
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:16,489
with the raising sea levels that we'll
 

3361
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:17,860
with the raising sea levels that we'll
be able to achieve or do you think

3362
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:17,870
be able to achieve or do you think
 

3363
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:20,439
be able to achieve or do you think
that's something that's ultimately or at

that's something that's ultimately or at
 

3365
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,209
that's something that's ultimately or at

least in the short term relative to
 

3367
01:09:22,219 --> 01:09:23,950
least in the short term relative to
other goals is not achievable I think

3368
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:23,960
other goals is not achievable I think
 

3369
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,470
other goals is not achievable I think
it's all possible and I mean in in

3393
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:55,120

course then I think these things are all

3394
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,130
course then I think these things are all
 

3395
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:57,340
course then I think these things are all
possible but in terms of whether it will

3396
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:57,350
possible but in terms of whether it will
 

3397
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:00,010
possible but in terms of whether it will
happen I don't I think we shouldn't

3398
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:00,020
happen I don't I think we shouldn't
 

3399
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,200
happen I don't I think we shouldn't
spend so much time asking what do we

01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:02,210
spend so much time asking what do we

01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,689
spend so much time asking what do we
think will happen in the future as if we

3402
01:10:04,689 --> 01:10:04,699
think will happen in the future as if we
 

3403
01:10:04,699 --> 01:10:06,250
think will happen in the future as if we
are just some sort of pathetic your

3411
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:14,910
happen to us hey we're the ones creating
this future right so we should be

3412
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:14,920
this future right so we should be
 

3413
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,410
this future right so we should be
proactive about it and ask us of what

3414
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:17,420
proactive about it and ask us of what
 

3415
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:18,760
proactive about it and ask us of what
sort of future we would like to have

sort of future we would like to have
 

3417
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:19,630
sort of future we would like to have
happen that's right

3418
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:19,640
happen that's right

angles have trouble and the majority of
 

3461
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,700
angles have trouble and the majority of
cases if they think through that happen

3462
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:18,710
cases if they think through that happen
 

3463
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:20,620

about this thing this about the problems
 

3503
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:06,370
about this thing this about the problems
and risks that also remember how huge

3504
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:06,380
and risks that also remember how huge
 

3505
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,170
and risks that also remember how huge
the upsides can be if we get it right I

3506
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:08,180
the upsides can be if we get it right I
 

3507

a motivator I think reminding ourselves

3524
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:27,239
a motivator I think reminding ourselves
 

3525
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:29,090
a motivator I think reminding ourselves
that the reason we try to solve problems

3526
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:29,100
that the reason we try to solve problems
 

3527
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,930
that the reason we try to solve problems
is not just because we're trying to

3528
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:32,940
is not just because we're trying to
 

3529
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,220
is not just because we're trying to
avoid gloom but because we're trying to

avoid gloom but because we're trying to
 

3531
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:36,979
avoid gloom but because we're trying to
do something great but then in terms of

3532
01:12:36,979 --> 01:12:36,989
do something great but then in terms of
 

3533
01:12:36,989 --> 01:12:41,810
do something great but then in terms of
the risks I think um the entry the

3534
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:41,820
the risks I think um the entry the
 

3535
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:43,610
the risks I think um the entry the
important question is to ask what can we

3536
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:43,620
important question is to ask what can we

01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:48,649
issue is it is basically you know but
the real choice we have is first of all

3592
01:13:48,649 --> 01:13:48,659
the real choice we have is first of all
 

3593
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:50,629
the real choice we have is first of all
are we gonna stir this dismiss this the

3594
01:13:50,629 --> 01:13:50,639
are we gonna stir this dismiss this the
 

3595
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:52,100
are we gonna stir this dismiss this the
risks and say well you know let's just

3596
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:52,110
risks and say well you know let's just
 

3597
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:55,010
risks and say well you know let's just
go ahead and build machines that can do

3598
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:55,020
go ahead and build machines that can do
 

3599
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:56,720
go ahead and build machines that can do
everything we can do better and cheaper

3600
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:56,730
everything we can do better and cheaper
 

3601
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,790
everything we can do better and cheaper
you know let's just make yourselves

3602
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:58,800
you know let's just make yourselves
 

3603
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,410
you know let's just make yourselves
obsolete as fast as possible or what

3604
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:00,420
obsolete as fast as possible or what
 

3605
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,209
obsolete as fast as possible or what
could possibly go wrong right that's one

3606
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:02,219
could possibly go wrong right that's one
 

3607
01:14:02,219 --> 01:14:04,640
could possibly go wrong right that's one
attitude the opposite attitude that I

3608
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:04,650
attitude the opposite attitude that I
 

3609
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:07,790
attitude the opposite attitude that I
think is to say is incredible potential

3610
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:07,800
think is to say is incredible potential
 

3611
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,760
think is to say is incredible potential
you know let's think about what kind of

3612
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:10,770
you know let's think about what kind of
 

3613
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:13,959
you know let's think about what kind of
future we're really really excited about

3614
01:14:13,959 --> 01:14:13,969
future we're really really excited about
 

3615
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:17,270
future we're really really excited about
what are the shared goals that we can

3616
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:17,280
what are the shared goals that we can
 

3617
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,160
what are the shared goals that we can
really aspire towards and then let's

3618
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:19,170
really aspire towards and then let's
 

3619
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:20,330
really aspire towards and then let's
think really hard on how about how we

3620
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:20,340
think really hard on how about how we
 

3621
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,459
think really hard on how about how we
can actually get there as it's a start

3622
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:22,469
can actually get there as it's a start
 

3623
01:14:22,469 --> 01:14:23,689
can actually get there as it's a start
with it no don't start thinking about

3624
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:23,699
with it no don't start thinking about
 

3625
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:25,430
with it no don't start thinking about
the risk start thinking about the goals

3626
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:25,440
the risk start thinking about the goals
 

3627
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,649
the risk start thinking about the goals
goals yeah and then when you do that

3628
01:14:27,649 --> 01:14:27,659
goals yeah and then when you do that
 

3629
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:29,660
goals yeah and then when you do that
then you can think about the obstacles

3630
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:29,670
then you can think about the obstacles
 

3631
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:31,010
then you can think about the obstacles
you want to avoid well they often get

3632
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:31,020
you want to avoid well they often get
 

3633
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,360
you want to avoid well they often get

3636
01:14:34,669 --> 01:14:34,679
office for career advising always ask
 

3637
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,020
office for career advising always ask
them this very question where you

3638
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:36,030
them this very question where you
 

3639
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:38,330
them this very question where you
want to be in the future man if all she

3640
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:38,340
want to be in the future man if all she
 

3641
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,189
want to be in the future man if all she
can say is oh maybe I'll have cancer

3642
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:40,199
can say is oh maybe I'll have cancer
 

3643
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:42,799
can say is oh maybe I'll have cancer
maybe I'll run over by a tortoise and

3644
01:14:42,799 --> 01:14:42,809
maybe I'll run over by a tortoise and
 

3645
01:14:42,809 --> 01:14:44,750
maybe I'll run over by a tortoise and
obstacles instead of the bill he's just

3646
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:44,760
obstacles instead of the bill he's just
 

3647
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,700
obstacles instead of the bill he's just
gonna end up a hypochondriac paranoid

3648
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:46,710
gonna end up a hypochondriac paranoid
 

3649
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:49,520
gonna end up a hypochondriac paranoid
yeah whereas if she comes in and fire in

3650
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:49,530
yeah whereas if she comes in and fire in
 

3651
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:50,839
yeah whereas if she comes in and fire in
her eyes and it's like I want to be

3652
01:14:50,839 --> 01:14:50,849
her eyes and it's like I want to be
 

3653
01:14:50,849 --> 01:14:53,479
her eyes and it's like I want to be
there and then we can talk about the

3654
01:14:53,479 --> 01:14:53,489
there and then we can talk about the
 

3655
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,919
there and then we can talk about the
obstacles and see how we can circumvent

3656
01:14:54,919 --> 01:14:54,929
obstacles and see how we can circumvent
 

3657
01:14:54,929 --> 01:14:57,470
obstacles and see how we can circumvent
them that's I think a much much

3658
01:14:57,470 --> 01:14:57,480
them that's I think a much much
 

3659
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,560
them that's I think a much much
healthier attitude and um that's really

3660
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:00,570
healthier attitude and um that's really
 

3661
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:04,250
healthier attitude and um that's really
well plan and I I feel it's it's very

3662
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:04,260
well plan and I I feel it's it's very
 

3663
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:06,439
well plan and I I feel it's it's very
challenging to come up with a vision for

3664
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:06,449
challenging to come up with a vision for
 

3665
01:15:06,449 --> 01:15:09,129
challenging to come up with a vision for
the future which we wish we are

3666
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:09,139
the future which we wish we are
 

3667
01:15:09,139 --> 01:15:11,120
the future which we wish we are
unequivocally excited about I'm not just

3668
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:11,130
unequivocally excited about I'm not just
 

3669
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,040
unequivocally excited about I'm not just
talking now in the vague terms like yeah

3670
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:13,050
talking now in the vague terms like yeah
 

3671
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,109
talking now in the vague terms like yeah
let's cure cancer fine I'm talking about

3672
01:15:15,109 --> 01:15:15,119
let's cure cancer fine I'm talking about
 

3673
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:17,689
let's cure cancer fine I'm talking about
what kind of society do we want to

3674
01:15:17,689 --> 01:15:17,699
what kind of society do we want to
 

3675
01:15:17,699 --> 01:15:19,700
what kind of society do we want to
create what do we want it to mean you

3676
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:19,710
create what do we want it to mean you
 

3677
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:23,209
create what do we want it to mean you
know to be human in the Age of AI in the

3678
01:15:23,209 --> 01:15:23,219
know to be human in the Age of AI in the
 

3679
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:26,029
know to be human in the Age of AI in the
age of AGI so if we can have this

3680
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:26,039
age of AGI so if we can have this
 

3681
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:28,760
age of AGI so if we can have this
conversation broad inclusive

3682
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:28,770
conversation broad inclusive
 

3683
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:31,549
conversation broad inclusive
conversation and gradually start

3684
01:15:31,549 --> 01:15:31,559
conversation and gradually start
 

3685
01:15:31,559 --> 01:15:34,640
conversation and gradually start
converging towards some some future that

3686
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:34,650
converging towards some some future that
 

3687
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,740
converging towards some some future that
with some direction at least that we

3688
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:36,750
with some direction at least that we
 

3689
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,529
with some direction at least that we
want to steer towards right then then no

3690
01:15:38,529 --> 01:15:38,539
want to steer towards right then then no
 

3691
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,520
want to steer towards right then then no
we'll be much more motivated to

3692
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:40,530
we'll be much more motivated to
 

3693
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:42,410
we'll be much more motivated to
constructively take on the obstacles and

3694
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:42,420
constructively take on the obstacles and
 

3695
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:45,830
constructively take on the obstacles and
I think if I had if I had the I think if

3696
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:45,840
I think if I had if I had the I think if
 

3697
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,049
I think if I had if I had the I think if
you make if I try to wrap this up in a

3698
01:15:48,049 --> 01:15:48,059
you make if I try to wrap this up in a
 

3699
01:15:48,059 --> 01:15:51,919
you make if I try to wrap this up in a
more sixteenth way I think I think we

3700
01:15:51,919 --> 01:15:51,929
more sixteenth way I think I think we
 

3701
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:54,500
more sixteenth way I think I think we
can all agree already now that we should

3702
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:54,510
can all agree already now that we should
 

3703
01:15:54,510 --> 01:16:01,430
can all agree already now that we should
aspire to build AGI but doesn't

3704
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:01,440
aspire to build AGI but doesn't
 

3705
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,510
aspire to build AGI but doesn't
overpower us but that empowers us and

3706
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
overpower us but that empowers us and
 

3707
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,089
overpower us but that empowers us and
think of the many various ways that can

3708
01:16:08,089 --> 01:16:08,099
think of the many various ways that can
 

3709
01:16:08,099 --> 01:16:10,819
think of the many various ways that can
do that whether that's from my side of

3710
01:16:10,819 --> 01:16:10,829
do that whether that's from my side of
 

3711
01:16:10,829 --> 01:16:13,580
do that whether that's from my side of
the world of autonomous vehicles I I'm

3712
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:13,590
the world of autonomous vehicles I I'm
 

3713
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:14,899
the world of autonomous vehicles I I'm
personally actually from the camp that

3714
01:16:14,899 --> 01:16:14,909
personally actually from the camp that
 

3715
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:16,459
personally actually from the camp that
believes there's human level

3716
01:16:16,459 --> 01:16:16,469
believes there's human level
 

3717
01:16:16,469 --> 01:16:18,350
believes there's human level
intelligence is required to to achieve

3718
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:18,360
intelligence is required to to achieve
 

3719
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,899
intelligence is required to to achieve
something like vehicles that would

3720
01:16:20,899 --> 01:16:20,909
something like vehicles that would
 

3721
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,939
something like vehicles that would
actually be something we would enjoy

3722
01:16:22,939 --> 01:16:22,949
actually be something we would enjoy
 

3723
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:25,790
actually be something we would enjoy
using and being part of so that's one

3724
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:25,800
using and being part of so that's one
 

3725
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,229
using and being part of so that's one
example and certainly there's a lot of

3726
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:27,239
example and certainly there's a lot of
 

3727
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:30,109
example and certainly there's a lot of
other types of robots in medicine and so

3728
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:30,119
other types of robots in medicine and so
 

3729
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:32,629
other types of robots in medicine and so
on so focusing on those and then and

3730
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:32,639
on so focusing on those and then and
 

3731
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,189
on so focusing on those and then and
then coming up with the obstacles coming

3732
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:34,199
then coming up with the obstacles coming
 

3733
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:35,870
then coming up with the obstacles coming
up with the ways that that can go wrong

3734
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:35,880
up with the ways that that can go wrong
 

3735
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,359
up with the ways that that can go wrong
and solving those one at a time and just

3736
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:38,369
and solving those one at a time and just
 

3737
01:16:38,369 --> 01:16:40,549
and solving those one at a time and just
because you can build an autonomous

3738
01:16:40,549 --> 01:16:40,559
because you can build an autonomous
 

3739
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:43,040
because you can build an autonomous
vehicle even if you could build one that

3740
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:43,050
vehicle even if you could build one that
 

3741
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:45,350
vehicle even if you could build one that
would drive this finalize you know maybe

3742
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:45,360
would drive this finalize you know maybe
 

3743
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,060
would drive this finalize you know maybe
there are some things in life that we

3744
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:47,070

that we find very meaningful to do and
 

3755
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:59,460
that we find very meaningful to do and
that doesn't mean we have to stop doing

3756
01:16:59,460 --> 01:16:59,470
that doesn't mean we have to stop doing
 

3757
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:00,900
that doesn't mean we have to stop doing
them just because machines can do them

01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:10,480
lot of people in the 20th century going
 

3815
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,420
lot of people in the 20th century going
to the moon going to space was an

inspiring thing I feel like the the the
 

3819
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:20,130

creating intelligence is that for the
 

3823
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:24,030
creating intelligence is that for the
21st century so it's really surprising

3824
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:24,040
21st century so it's really surprising
 

3825
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,830
21st century so it's really surprising
and I've heard you mention this it's

01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:25,840
and I've heard you mention this it's
 

3827

and I've heard you mention this it's
really surprising to me both on the

really surprising to me both on the
 

3829
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:29,820
really surprising to me both on the
research funding side that it's not

3830
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:29,830
research funding side that it's not
 

3831
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,950
research funding side that it's not
funded as greatly as it could be but

3832
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:31,960
funded as greatly as it could be but
 

3833
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,200
funded as greatly as it could be but
most importantly on the politicians side

3834
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:34,210
most importantly on the politicians side
 

3835
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,910
most importantly on the politicians side
that it's not part of the public

3836
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:35,920
that it's not part of the public

01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,600
foreign for four years but for billions
of years yes I can even tell you about

3902
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:01,610
of years yes I can even tell you about
 

3903
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:03,010
of years yes I can even tell you about
how to move it out of harm's way when

3904
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:03,020
how to move it out of harm's way when
 

3905
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:06,670
how to move it out of harm's way when
its own Sun gets too hot and and then we

3906
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:06,680
its own Sun gets too hot and and then we
 

3907
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,830
its own Sun gets too hot and and then we
have so much more resources out here

3908
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:08,840
have so much more resources out here
 

3909
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,860
have so much more resources out here
which today yeah maybe there are a lot

3910
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:11,870
which today yeah maybe there are a lot
 

3911
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:13,990
which today yeah maybe there are a lot
of other planets with bacteria or a cow

3912
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:14,000
of other planets with bacteria or a cow
 

3913
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,100
of other planets with bacteria or a cow
like life on them but I most of this all

3914
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:18,110
like life on them but I most of this all
 

3915
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,410
like life on them but I most of this all
this opportunity seems as far as we can

3916
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:20,420
this opportunity seems as far as we can
 

3917
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:23,110
this opportunity seems as far as we can
fail to be largely dead like the Sahara

3918
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:23,120
fail to be largely dead like the Sahara
 

3919
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,960
fail to be largely dead like the Sahara
Desert and yet we have the opportunity

3920
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:25,970
Desert and yet we have the opportunity
 

3921
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:26,950
Desert and yet we have the opportunity
but to help

3922
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:26,960
but to help
 

3923
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,980
but to help
life flourish promise there are billions

3924
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:29,990
life flourish promise there are billions
 

3925
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:31,480
life flourish promise there are billions
of year and so like let's quit

3926
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:31,490
of year and so like let's quit
 

3927
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:35,290
of year and so like let's quit
squabbling about when some little border

3928
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:35,300
squabbling about when some little border
 

3929
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,420

should be drawn one-fifth one mile to

3930
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:37,430
should be drawn one-fifth one mile to
 

3931
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:41,290
should be drawn one-fifth one mile to
the left to right and realize hey you

amazing opportunities they will squander
 

3961
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,550
amazing opportunities they will squander
if we wipe out out here on earth

3962
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:16,560
if we wipe out out here on earth
 

3963
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,500
if we wipe out out here on earth
and we're not just gonna wipe out the

3964
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:18,510
and we're not just gonna wipe out the
 

3965
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,750
and we're not just gonna wipe out the
next generation but all generations and

01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:20,760
next generation but all generations and
 

3967

this incredible opportunity that's out
 

3969
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,040
this incredible opportunity that's out
there that would be really a waste and

3970
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:25,050
there that would be really a waste and
 

3971
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:30,020
there that would be really a waste and
AI for people who think that we better

3972
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:30,030
AI for people who think that we better
 

3973
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:32,720
AI for people who think that we better
to do without technology well let me

3974
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:32,730
to do without technology well let me
 

3975
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:35,750
to do without technology well let me
just mention that if we don't improve

3976
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:35,760
just mention that if we don't improve
 

3977
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,920
just mention that if we don't improve
our technology the question isn't

3978
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:36,930
our technology the question isn't
 

3979
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,650
our technology the question isn't
whether humanity is gonna go extinct

3980
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:38,660
whether humanity is gonna go extinct
 

3981
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,640
whether humanity is gonna go extinct
question is just whether we're gonna get

3982
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:40,650
question is just whether we're gonna get
 

3983
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:43,670
question is just whether we're gonna get
taken out by the next big asteroid or

3984
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:43,680
taken out by the next big asteroid or
 

3985
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,770
taken out by the next big asteroid or
the next supervolcano or something else

3986
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:45,780
the next supervolcano or something else
 

3987
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:48,410
the next supervolcano or something else
dumb that we could easily prevent with

3988
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:48,420
dumb that we could easily prevent with
 

3989
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:51,500
dumb that we could easily prevent with
more tech right and if we want life to

3990
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:51,510
more tech right and if we want life to
 

3991
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,900
more tech right and if we want life to
flourish throughout the cosmos AI is the

3992
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:53,910
flourish throughout the cosmos AI is the
 

3993
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:58,070
flourish throughout the cosmos AI is the
key to it as I mentioned a lot of detail

3994
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:58,080
key to it as I mentioned a lot of detail
 

3995
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,670
key to it as I mentioned a lot of detail
in my book right there even many of the

3996
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:01,680
in my book right there even many of the
 

3997
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:05,330
in my book right there even many of the
most inspired sci-fi writers I feel have

3998
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:05,340
most inspired sci-fi writers I feel have
 

3999
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:08,380
most inspired sci-fi writers I feel have
totally underestimated the opportunities

4000
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:08,390
totally underestimated the opportunities
 

4001
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:10,370
totally underestimated the opportunities
for space travel especially to other

4002
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:10,380
for space travel especially to other
 

4003
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,350
for space travel especially to other
galaxies because they weren't thinking

4004
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:12,360
galaxies because they weren't thinking
 

4005
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,680
galaxies because they weren't thinking
about the possibility of AGI which just

4006
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:15,690
about the possibility of AGI which just
 

4007
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:18,560
about the possibility of AGI which just
makes it so much easier right yeah so

4008
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:18,570
makes it so much easier right yeah so
 

4009
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:22,310
makes it so much easier right yeah so
that goes to your view of AGI that

4010
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:22,320
that goes to your view of AGI that
 

4011
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,890
that goes to your view of AGI that
enables our progress that enables a

4012
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:24,900
enables our progress that enables a
 

4013
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,990
enables our progress that enables a
better life so that's a beautiful that's

4014
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:27,000
better life so that's a beautiful that's
 

4015
