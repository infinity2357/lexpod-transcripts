I mean I so you know your question

148

I mean I so you know your question
 

149
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,640
I mean I so you know your question
presupposes that there's this goal to

how I would state the goal I mean I

158
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:26,790
how I would state the goal I mean I
 

159
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,140
how I would state the goal I mean I
think that studying the goal good so I

160
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,150
think that studying the goal good so I
 

161
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,780
think that studying the goal good so I
think there are a few goals I think that

162

think there are a few goals I think that
 

163

understanding the human brain and how it
 

165
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,710
understanding the human brain and how it
works is important for us to be able to

166
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
works is important for us to be able to
 

167
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,170
works is important for us to be able to
diagnose and treat issues for us to

168
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,180
diagnose and treat issues for us to
 

169
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,210
diagnose and treat issues for us to
understand our own strengths and

170
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:47,220
understand our own strengths and
 

171
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,990
understand our own strengths and
weaknesses both intellectual

172
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,000
weaknesses both intellectual
 

173
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,960
weaknesses both intellectual
psychological and physical so

174
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:52,970
psychological and physical so
 

175
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,860
psychological and physical so
neuroscience and on sending the brain

176
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:54,870
neuroscience and on sending the brain
 

177
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,960
neuroscience and on sending the brain
from that perspective has a there's a

178
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,970
from that perspective has a there's a
 

179
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,810
from that perspective has a there's a
clear clear goal there from the

180
00:03:59,810 --> 00:03:59,820
clear clear goal there from the
 

181
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,060
clear clear goal there from the
perspective of saying I want to I want

182
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,070
perspective of saying I want to I want
 

183
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,070
perspective of saying I want to I want
to I want to mimic human intelligence

184
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
to I want to mimic human intelligence
 

185
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,170
to I want to mimic human intelligence
that one's a little bit more interesting

186
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,180
that one's a little bit more interesting
 

187
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,500
that one's a little bit more interesting
human intelligence certainly has a lot

188
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:09,510
human intelligence certainly has a lot
 

189
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,210
human intelligence certainly has a lot
of things we Envy it's also got a lot of

190
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:11,220
of things we Envy it's also got a lot of
 

191
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,330
of things we Envy it's also got a lot of
problems too so I think we're capable of

192
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:14,340
problems too so I think we're capable of
 

193
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,569
problems too so I think we're capable of
sort of stepping back and saying what do

194
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:17,579
sort of stepping back and saying what do
 

195
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,090
sort of stepping back and saying what do
we want out of it what do we want out of

196
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,100
we want out of it what do we want out of
 

197
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,850
we want out of it what do we want out of
an intelligence how do we want to

198
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:22,860
an intelligence how do we want to
 

199
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,440
an intelligence how do we want to
communicate with that intelligence how

200
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:24,450
communicate with that intelligence how
 

201
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,120
communicate with that intelligence how
do we want to behave how do we want it

202
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,130
do we want to behave how do we want it
 

203
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,580
do we want to behave how do we want it
to perform now of course it's it's

204
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:28,590
to perform now of course it's it's
 

205
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,020
to perform now of course it's it's
somewhat of an interesting argument

206
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,030
somewhat of an interesting argument
 

207
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,150
somewhat of an interesting argument
because I'm sitting here as a human with

208
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
because I'm sitting here as a human with
 

209
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,340
because I'm sitting here as a human with
a biological brain and I'm critiquing

210
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,350
a biological brain and I'm critiquing
 

211
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,650
a biological brain and I'm critiquing
this trends and weaknesses of human

212
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:36,660
this trends and weaknesses of human
 

213
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,110
this trends and weaknesses of human
intelligence and saying that we have the

214
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
intelligence and saying that we have the
 

215
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,480
intelligence and saying that we have the
capacity just the capacity to step back

216
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,490
capacity just the capacity to step back
 

217
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,150
capacity just the capacity to step back
and say gee what what is intelligence is

218
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
and say gee what what is intelligence is
 

219
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,590
and say gee what what is intelligence is
what do we really want out of it and

220
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
what do we really want out of it and
 

221
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,330
what do we really want out of it and
that even in and of itself suggests that

222
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,340
that even in and of itself suggests that
 

223
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,500
that even in and of itself suggests that
human intelligence is something quite

224
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:51,510
human intelligence is something quite
 

225
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,230
human intelligence is something quite
amiable that it could you know it can it

226
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
amiable that it could you know it can it
 

227
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,110
amiable that it could you know it can it
can it can introspect that it could

228
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
can it can introspect that it could
 

229
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,330
can it can introspect that it could
introspect that way and the flaws you

230
00:04:59,330 --> 00:04:59,340
introspect that way and the flaws you
 

231
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,950
introspect that way and the flaws you
mentioned the flaws the human self yeah

232
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
mentioned the flaws the human self yeah
 

233
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,200
mentioned the flaws the human self yeah
but I think I think that flaws that

234
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,210
but I think I think that flaws that
 

235
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,740
but I think I think that flaws that
humans wholeness house is extremely

236
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:05,750
humans wholeness house is extremely
 

237
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,810
humans wholeness house is extremely
prejudicial and bias and the way it

238
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:08,820
prejudicial and bias and the way it
 

239
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,940
prejudicial and bias and the way it
draws many inferences do you think those

240
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:10,950
draws many inferences do you think those
 

241
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,440
draws many inferences do you think those
are sorry to interrupt you think those

242
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:12,450
are sorry to interrupt you think those
 

243
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,510
are sorry to interrupt you think those
are features or are those bugs do you

244
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:14,520
are features or are those bugs do you
 

245
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,659
are features or are those bugs do you
think the the prejudice the

246
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:17,669
think the the prejudice the
 

247
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:22,190
think the the prejudice the
forgetfulness the fear what other flaws

248
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,200
forgetfulness the fear what other flaws
 

249
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,710
forgetfulness the fear what other flaws
list them all what love maybe that's a

250
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
list them all what love maybe that's a
 

251
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,230
list them all what love maybe that's a
flaw you think those are all things that

252
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,240
flaw you think those are all things that
 

253
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,870
flaw you think those are all things that
can be get gotten getting in the way of

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:29,880
can be get gotten getting in the way of
 

255
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,330
can be get gotten getting in the way of

of and
 

259
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,490
of and
well again if you go back and you define

260
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,500
well again if you go back and you define
 

261
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,490
well again if you go back and you define
intelligence as being able to sort of

265
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,520
accuracy accurately precisely rigorously
reason develop answers and justify those

266
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:44,530
reason develop answers and justify those
 

267
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,200

answers in an objective way
 

269
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,930
answers in an objective way
yeah then human intelligence has these

270
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:48,940
yeah then human intelligence has these
 

271
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,990
yeah then human intelligence has these
flaws and that it tends to be more

272
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
flaws and that it tends to be more
 

273
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,330
flaws and that it tends to be more
influenced by some of the things you

274
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,340
influenced by some of the things you
 

275
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,439
influenced by some of the things you
said and it's and it's largely an

00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:58,449
said and it's and it's largely an

00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:00,689
said and it's and it's largely an

278
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:00,699
inductive process meaning it takes past
 

279
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,870
inductive process meaning it takes past
data uses that to predict the future

280
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
data uses that to predict the future
 

281
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,120
data uses that to predict the future
very advantageous in some cases but

282
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,130
very advantageous in some cases but
 

283
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,520
very advantageous in some cases but
fundamentally biased and prejudicial in

284
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:08,530
fundamentally biased and prejudicial in
 

285
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,779
fundamentally biased and prejudicial in
other cases because it's gonna be

286
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:09,789
other cases because it's gonna be
 

287
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:11,249
other cases because it's gonna be
strongly influenced by its priors

288
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:11,259
strongly influenced by its priors
 

289
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,200
strongly influenced by its priors
whether they're whether they're right or

290
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,210
whether they're whether they're right or
 

291
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,659
whether they're whether they're right or
wrong from some you know objective

292
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:15,669
wrong from some you know objective
 

293
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,999
wrong from some you know objective
reasoning perspective you're gonna favor

294
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:18,009
reasoning perspective you're gonna favor
 

295
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,740
reasoning perspective you're gonna favor
them because that's those are the

296
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:19,750
them because that's those are the
 

297
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,290
them because that's those are the
decisions or those are the paths that

298
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:22,300
decisions or those are the paths that
 

299
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,020
decisions or those are the paths that
succeeded in the past and I think that

300
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,030
succeeded in the past and I think that
 

301
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,020
succeeded in the past and I think that
mode of intelligence makes a lot of

302
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,030
mode of intelligence makes a lot of
 

303
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,680
mode of intelligence makes a lot of
sense for when your primary goal is to

304
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:31,690
sense for when your primary goal is to
 

305
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,010
sense for when your primary goal is to
act quickly and and and survive and make

306
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,020
act quickly and and and survive and make
 

307
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,459
act quickly and and and survive and make
fast decisions and I think those create

308
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:38,469
fast decisions and I think those create
 

309
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:41,399
fast decisions and I think those create
problems when you want to think more

310
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:41,409
problems when you want to think more
 

311
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,140
problems when you want to think more
deeply and make more objective and

312
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,150
deeply and make more objective and
 

313
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,620
deeply and make more objective and
reasons that decisions of course humans

314
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:46,630
reasons that decisions of course humans
 

315
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,990
reasons that decisions of course humans
capable of doing both they do sort of

316
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,000
capable of doing both they do sort of
 

317
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,550
capable of doing both they do sort of
one more naturally than they do the

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
one more naturally than they do the
 

319
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,010
one more naturally than they do the
other but they're capable of doing both

320
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,020
other but they're capable of doing both
 

321
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,629
other but they're capable of doing both
you're saying they do the one that

322
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
you're saying they do the one that
 

323
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,249
you're saying they do the one that
responds quickly in it more naturally

in the world for example but I mean

better than we've we've learned to

science we train people to do that
 

337
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,629
science we train people to do that
I think that's harder for the individual

338
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:15,639
I think that's harder for the individual
 

339
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,899
I think that's harder for the individual
to do I think it requires training and

340
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:18,909
to do I think it requires training and
 

341
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:21,330
to do I think it requires training and
you know and and and teaching I think we

342
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:21,340
you know and and and teaching I think we
 

343
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,730
you know and and and teaching I think we
are human - certainly is capable of it

are human - certainly is capable of it
 

345
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,529
are human - certainly is capable of it
but we find more difficult and then

346
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:25,539
but we find more difficult and then

there are other weaknesses if you will

348
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
there are other weaknesses if you will
 

349
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,830
there are other weaknesses if you will
as you mentioned earlier it's just

350
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
as you mentioned earlier it's just
 

351
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,300
as you mentioned earlier it's just
memory capacity and how many chains of

352
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,310
memory capacity and how many chains of
 

353
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,430

354
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
inference can you actually go through
 

355
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,939
inference can you actually go through
without like losing your way so just

356
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:37,949
without like losing your way so just
 

357
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,219
without like losing your way so just
focus and so the way you think about

358
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:41,229
focus and so the way you think about
 

359
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,610
focus and so the way you think about
intelligence and we're really sort of

360
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:44,620
intelligence and we're really sort of
 

361
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,039
intelligence and we're really sort of
floating this philosophical slightly

362
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:47,049
floating this philosophical slightly
 

363
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,649
floating this philosophical slightly
but I think you're like the perfect

364
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:49,659
but I think you're like the perfect
 

365
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:53,399
but I think you're like the perfect
person to talk about this because we'll

366
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:53,409
person to talk about this because we'll
 

367
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,549
person to talk about this because we'll
get to jeopardy and beyond that's like

368
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:56,559
get to jeopardy and beyond that's like
 

369
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,019
get to jeopardy and beyond that's like
an incredible one of the most incredible

discussion so let me ask you've kind of

376
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:05,619
discussion so let me ask you've kind of
 

377
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,289
discussion so let me ask you've kind of
alluded to it but let me ask again

378
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:07,299
alluded to it but let me ask again
 

379
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:10,649
alluded to it but let me ask again
what is intelligence underlying the

00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:16,059
jeopardy and beyond how do you think
 

385
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:18,149
jeopardy and beyond how do you think
about intelligence is it a sufficiently

your way through solving that problem is
 

391
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:23,999
your way through solving that problem is
that kind of how you think about what it

392

that kind of how you think about what it
 

393
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:26,489
that kind of how you think about what it
means to be intelligent so I think of

means to be intelligent so I think of
 

395
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:29,939

toward a goal
what about picking a goal so again well

482
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:08,550
what about picking a goal so again well
 

483
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,769
what about picking a goal so again well
that's interesting about picking our

484
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:09,779
that's interesting about picking our
 

485
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:10,999
that's interesting about picking our
goal sort of an interesting thing I

486
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:11,009
goal sort of an interesting thing I
 

487
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:13,429
goal sort of an interesting thing I
think that's where you bring in what do

488
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:13,439
think that's where you bring in what do
 

489
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:15,319
think that's where you bring in what do
you pre-programmed to do we talked about

490
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:15,329
you pre-programmed to do we talked about
 

491
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,079
you pre-programmed to do we talked about
humans and humans a pre-programmed to

492
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:18,089
humans and humans a pre-programmed to
 

493
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:20,990
humans and humans a pre-programmed to
survive so sort of their primary you

494
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,000
survive so sort of their primary you
 

495
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,869
survive so sort of their primary you
know driving goal what do they have to

496
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:23,879
know driving goal what do they have to
 

497
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:26,179
know driving goal what do they have to
do to do that and that that could be

498
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:26,189
do to do that and that that could be
 

499
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:29,540
do to do that and that that could be
very complex right so it's not just it's

500
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:29,550
very complex right so it's not just it's
 

501
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,220
very complex right so it's not just it's
not just figuring out that you need to

502
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,230
not just figuring out that you need to
 

503
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,970
not just figuring out that you need to
run away from their ferocious tiger but

504
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:33,980
run away from their ferocious tiger but
 

505
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,879
run away from their ferocious tiger but
we survive in social context as an

506
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:37,889
we survive in social context as an
 

507
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:40,910
we survive in social context as an
example so understanding the subtleties

508
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:40,920
example so understanding the subtleties
 

509
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,800
example so understanding the subtleties
of social dynamics becomes something

510
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:42,810
of social dynamics becomes something
 

511
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,800
of social dynamics becomes something
that's important for surviving finding a

512
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:45,810
that's important for surviving finding a
 

513
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,139
that's important for surviving finding a
mate reproducing right so we're

514
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:48,149
mate reproducing right so we're
 

515
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:51,199
mate reproducing right so we're
continually challenged with complex sets

516
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:51,209
continually challenged with complex sets
 

517
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,960
continually challenged with complex sets
of variables complex constraints rules

00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:53,970
of variables complex constraints rules

if you will that we we or patterns and
 

521
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,329
if you will that we we or patterns and
we learn how to find the functions and

we learn how to find the functions and
 

523
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,040
we learn how to find the functions and
predict the things in other words

be able to predict what's going to
happen that's a form of intelligence

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
happen that's a form of intelligence

that doesn't really record that doesn't
 

533
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,540
that doesn't really record that doesn't
really require anything specific other

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:11,550
really require anything specific other
 

535
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,460
really require anything specific other
than ability to find that function and

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:13,470
than ability to find that function and
 

537
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,920
than ability to find that function and
and predict that right answer it's

and predict that right answer it's
 

539
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,559
and predict that right answer it's
certainly a form of intelligence but

00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:18,569
certainly a form of intelligence but

00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:22,309
certainly a form of intelligence but
then when we when we say well do we

542
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:22,319
then when we when we say well do we

then when we when we say well do we
understand each other in other words do

would you perceive me as as intelligent

546
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:28,500
would you perceive me as as intelligent
 

547
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,759
would you perceive me as as intelligent
beyond that ability to predict so now I

548
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:31,769
beyond that ability to predict so now I
 

549
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,889
beyond that ability to predict so now I
can predict but I can't really

550
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:33,899
can predict but I can't really
 

551

00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
what my underlying theory is for
 

555
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,259
what my underlying theory is for
predicting and I can't get you to

understand what I'm doing so that you
 

559
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,639
understand what I'm doing so that you
can follow you can figure out how to do

560
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:46,649
can follow you can figure out how to do
 

561
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:49,790
can follow you can figure out how to do
this yourself if you hadn't if you did

not have for example the right pattern
matching machinery that I did and now we

00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:54,149
matching machinery that I did and now we
 

567
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,340
matching machinery that I did and now we
have potentially have this breakdown

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,360
have potentially have this breakdown
where in effect I'm intelligent but I'm

where in effect I'm intelligent but I'm
 

571
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,280

00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,290
sort of an alien intelligence relative
 

573
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,769
sort of an alien intelligence relative
to you you're intelligent but nobody

574
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:03,779
to you you're intelligent but nobody
 

575
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,949
to you you're intelligent but nobody
knows about it or I can see the I can

576
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
knows about it or I can see the I can
 

577
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,230
knows about it or I can see the I can
see the output knowing so so you're

578
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:09,240
see the output knowing so so you're
 

579
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,249
see the output knowing so so you're
saying let's

580
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:10,259
saying let's
 

581
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,679
saying let's
to separate the two things one is you

582
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:12,689
to separate the two things one is you
 

583
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:16,340
to separate the two things one is you
explaining why you were able to predict

584
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:16,350
explaining why you were able to predict
 

585
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,219
explaining why you were able to predict
the future and and the second is me

586
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:21,229
the future and and the second is me
 

587
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:24,229
the future and and the second is me
being able to like impressing me that

00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:24,239
being able to like impressing me that
 

589
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:26,419
being able to like impressing me that
you're intelligent me being able to know

590
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:26,429
you're intelligent me being able to know
 

591
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:27,769
you're intelligent me being able to know
that you successfully predicted the

592
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:27,779
that you successfully predicted the
 

593
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,109
that you successfully predicted the
future do you think that's well it's not

594
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:30,119
future do you think that's well it's not
 

595
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,519
future do you think that's well it's not
a pressing you item intelligent in other

596
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:31,529
a pressing you item intelligent in other
 

597
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,009
a pressing you item intelligent in other
words you may be convinced that I'm

00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:34,019
words you may be convinced that I'm
 

599
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,710
words you may be convinced that I'm
intelligent in some form so high well

600
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
intelligent in some form so high well
 

601
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,019
intelligent in some form so high well
because of my ability to predict so I

602
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:39,029
because of my ability to predict so I
 

603
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,719
because of my ability to predict so I
would imagine that wow wow you're right

604
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:41,729
would imagine that wow wow you're right
 

605
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:43,729
would imagine that wow wow you're right
all here you're you're right more times

606
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:43,739
all here you're you're right more times
 

607
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,799
all here you're you're right more times
than I am you're doing something

608
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:45,809
than I am you're doing something
 

609
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:47,599
than I am you're doing something
interesting that's a form that's a form

610
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:47,609
interesting that's a form that's a form
 

611
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:50,479
interesting that's a form that's a form
of intelligence but then what happens is

612
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:50,489
of intelligence but then what happens is
 

613
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:53,749
of intelligence but then what happens is
if I say how are you doing that and you

614
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:53,759
if I say how are you doing that and you
 

615
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,109
if I say how are you doing that and you
can't communicate with me and you can't

616
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:56,119
can't communicate with me and you can't
 

617
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:59,210
can't communicate with me and you can't
describe that to me now I'm a label you

618
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,220
describe that to me now I'm a label you
 

619
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,879
describe that to me now I'm a label you
a savant I mean I may say well you're

620
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:01,889
a savant I mean I may say well you're
 

621
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:04,249
a savant I mean I may say well you're
doing something weird and it's and it's

622
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:04,259
doing something weird and it's and it's
 

623
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:06,499
doing something weird and it's and it's
just not very interesting to me because

624
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:06,509
just not very interesting to me because
 

625
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:09,129
just not very interesting to me because
you and I can't really communicate and

626
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:09,139
you and I can't really communicate and
 

627
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,139
you and I can't really communicate and
and so now this is interesting right

628
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:12,149
and so now this is interesting right
 

629
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,509
and so now this is interesting right
because now this is you're in this weird

630
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:14,519
because now this is you're in this weird
 

631
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,309
because now this is you're in this weird
place where for you to be recognized as

632
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:18,319
place where for you to be recognized as
 

633
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:21,499
place where for you to be recognized as
intelligent the way I'm intelligent then

634
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:21,509
intelligent the way I'm intelligent then
 

635
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,879
intelligent the way I'm intelligent then
you and I sort of have to be able to

636
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:22,889
you and I sort of have to be able to
 

637
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:26,720
you and I sort of have to be able to
communicate and then my we start to

638
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:26,730
communicate and then my we start to
 

639
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,029
communicate and then my we start to
understand each other and then my

640
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:29,039
understand each other and then my
 

641
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,619
understand each other and then my
respect and my my appreciation my

642
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:33,629
respect and my my appreciation my
 

643
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,539
respect and my my appreciation my
ability to relate to you starts to

644
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:35,549
ability to relate to you starts to
 

645
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,789
ability to relate to you starts to
change so now you're not an alien

646
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:37,799
change so now you're not an alien
 

647
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,710
change so now you're not an alien
intelligence anymore yours you're our

648
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:39,720
intelligence anymore yours you're our
 

649
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,229
intelligence anymore yours you're our
human intelligence now because you and I

650
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:42,239
human intelligence now because you and I
 

651
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,599
human intelligence now because you and I
can communicate and so I think when we

652
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:44,609
can communicate and so I think when we
 

653
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:46,909
can communicate and so I think when we
look at when we look at when we look at

654
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:46,919
look at when we look at when we look at
 

655
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,889
look at when we look at when we look at
animals for example animals can do

656
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:48,899
animals for example animals can do
 

657
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,779
animals for example animals can do
things we can't quite comprehend we

658
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:50,789
things we can't quite comprehend we
 

659
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,919
things we can't quite comprehend we
don't quite know how they do them but

660
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:51,929
don't quite know how they do them but
 

661
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:53,840
don't quite know how they do them but
they can't really communicate with us

662
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:53,850
they can't really communicate with us
 

663
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,329
they can't really communicate with us
they can't put what they're going

664
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:56,339
they can't put what they're going
 

665
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,119
they can't put what they're going
through in our terms and so we think of

666
00:13:59,119 --> 00:13:59,129
through in our terms and so we think of
 

667
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,229
through in our terms and so we think of
them in sort of low there are these

668
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:00,239
them in sort of low there are these
 

669
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,849
them in sort of low there are these
alien intelligences and they're not

670
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:01,859
alien intelligences and they're not
 

671
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,649
alien intelligences and they're not
really worthless so what we're worth we

672
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:03,659
really worthless so what we're worth we
 

673
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:04,939
really worthless so what we're worth we
don't treat them the same way as a

674
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:04,949
don't treat them the same way as a
 

675
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:08,119
don't treat them the same way as a
result of that but it's it's hard

676
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:08,129
result of that but it's it's hard
 

677
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,789
result of that but it's it's hard
because who knows what you know what's

678
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:10,799
because who knows what you know what's
 

679
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,229
because who knows what you know what's
going on so just a quick elaboration on

680
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:15,239
going on so just a quick elaboration on
 

681
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:17,059
going on so just a quick elaboration on
that the explaining that you're

00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:17,069
that the explaining that you're
 

683
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:20,119
that the explaining that you're
intelligent the explaining the the

intelligent the explaining the the

reasoning the one end to the prediction

686
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:22,580
reasoning the one end to the prediction
 

687
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,430
reasoning the one end to the prediction
is not some kind of mathematical proof

688
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:26,440
is not some kind of mathematical proof
 

689
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,650
is not some kind of mathematical proof
if we look at humans look at political

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:29,660
if we look at humans look at political

debates and discourse on Twitter it's

692
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,570
debates and discourse on Twitter it's
 

693
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,500
debates and discourse on Twitter it's
mostly just telling stories so you

694
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,510
mostly just telling stories so you
 

695
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,769
mostly just telling stories so you
usually your task is sorry that your

usually your task is sorry that your

depiction of how you reason but to tell

700
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:45,980
depiction of how you reason but to tell
 

701
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,210

a story real or not that convinces me

702
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,220
a story real or not that convinces me
 

703
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,490
a story real or not that convinces me
that there was a mechanism by which you

704
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:51,500
that there was a mechanism by which you
 

705
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,829
that there was a mechanism by which you
ultimately that's what a proof is I mean

706
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
ultimately that's what a proof is I mean
 

707
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,750
ultimately that's what a proof is I mean
even a mathematical proof is is that

708
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
even a mathematical proof is is that
 

709
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,370
even a mathematical proof is is that
because ultimately the other

710
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:57,380
because ultimately the other
 

711
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,230
because ultimately the other
mathematicians have to be convinced by

712
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,240
mathematicians have to be convinced by
 

713
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,470
mathematicians have to be convinced by
your proof otherwise in fact they're

714
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
your proof otherwise in fact they're
 

715
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,449
your proof otherwise in fact they're
been that the measurement success yeah

716
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:04,459
been that the measurement success yeah
 

717
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:05,800
been that the measurement success yeah
yeah there have been several proofs out

718
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:05,810
yeah there have been several proofs out
 

719
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,240
yeah there have been several proofs out
there where mathematicians would study

720
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,250
there where mathematicians would study
 

721
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,440
there where mathematicians would study
for a long time before they were

722
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,450
for a long time before they were
 

723
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,490
for a long time before they were
convinced that it actually proved

724
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:09,500
convinced that it actually proved
 

725
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,590
convinced that it actually proved
anything right you never know if it

726
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
anything right you never know if it
 

727
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
anything right you never know if it
proved anything until the community of

728
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,010
proved anything until the community of
 

729
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,009
proved anything until the community of
mathematicians decided that it did so I

730
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:15,019
mathematicians decided that it did so I
 

731
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,800
mathematicians decided that it did so I
mean so it's but it's it's a real thing

732
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,810
mean so it's but it's it's a real thing
 

733
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,410
mean so it's but it's it's a real thing
yeah and and that's sort of the point

734
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:20,420
yeah and and that's sort of the point
 

735
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,110
yeah and and that's sort of the point
right is that ultimately on you know

736
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
right is that ultimately on you know
 

737
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,519
right is that ultimately on you know
this notion of understanding us

738
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:24,529
this notion of understanding us
 

739
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,470
this notion of understanding us
understanding something there's

740
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
understanding something there's
 

741
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
understanding something there's
ultimately a social concept in other

742
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,490
ultimately a social concept in other
 

743
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,190
ultimately a social concept in other
words you I have to convince enough

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,200
words you I have to convince enough
 

745
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,400
words you I have to convince enough
people that I I did this in a reasonable

746
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,410
people that I I did this in a reasonable
 

747
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,050
people that I I did this in a reasonable
way I did this in a way that other

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,060
way I did this in a way that other
 

749
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,420
way I did this in a way that other
people can understand and and replicate

750
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:37,430
people can understand and and replicate
 

751
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,240
people can understand and and replicate
and that make sense to them so we're

752
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,250
and that make sense to them so we're
 

753
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,329
and that make sense to them so we're

in that way we're bound up in that sense
we sort of never really get away with it

we sort of never really get away with it
 

759
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,430
we sort of never really get away with it

useful if it could be incredible useful
 

797
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:39,879
useful if it could be incredible useful
it could be solving a problem we can't

798
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:39,889
it could be solving a problem we can't
 

799
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,730
it could be solving a problem we can't
otherwise solve and can solve it more

800
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:42,740
otherwise solve and can solve it more
 

801
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,189
otherwise solve and can solve it more
reliably than we can but then there's

802
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
reliably than we can but then there's
 

803
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,319
reliably than we can but then there's
this notion of can humans take

804
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:49,329
this notion of can humans take
 

805
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:51,819
this notion of can humans take
responsibility for the decision that

806
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:51,829
responsibility for the decision that
 

807
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:54,280
responsibility for the decision that
you're that you're making can we make

808
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,290
you're that you're making can we make
 

809
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,069
you're that you're making can we make
those decisions ourselves can we relate

810
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:57,079
those decisions ourselves can we relate
 

811
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,660
those decisions ourselves can we relate
to the process that you're going through

812
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:58,670
to the process that you're going through
 

813
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,569
to the process that you're going through
and now you as an agent whether you're a

814
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:01,579
and now you as an agent whether you're a
 

815
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,779
and now you as an agent whether you're a
machine or another human frankly are now

816
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:04,789
machine or another human frankly are now
 

817
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:09,159
machine or another human frankly are now
obliged to make me understand how it is

818
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:09,169
obliged to make me understand how it is
 

819
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:10,990
obliged to make me understand how it is
that you're arriving at that answer and

820
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,000
that you're arriving at that answer and
 

821
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,390
that you're arriving at that answer and
allow me I mean me or the obviously a

whether or not whether or not that makes

whether or not whether or not that makes
 

827
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,159
whether or not whether or not that makes
sense and by the way that happens with

828
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:18,169
sense and by the way that happens with
 

829
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,620
sense and by the way that happens with
the humans as well you're sitting down

the humans as well you're sitting down
 

831
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,449
the humans as well you're sitting down
with your staff for example and you ask

832
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:22,459
with your staff for example and you ask
 

833
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,270
with your staff for example and you ask
for suggestions about what to do next

834
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
for suggestions about what to do next
 

835

versus that product whatever decision
 

847
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:40,360
versus that product whatever decision
may be and you ask why and the person so

848
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,370
may be and you ask why and the person so
 

849
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,190
may be and you ask why and the person so
I just have a good feeling about it and

850
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,200
I just have a good feeling about it and
 

851
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,779
I just have a good feeling about it and
it's not you're not very satisfied now

it's not you're not very satisfied now
 

853
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:47,890
it's not you're not very satisfied now
that person could be you know you might

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:47,900
that person could be you know you might
 

855
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,419
that person could be you know you might
say well you've been right you know

856
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:49,429
say well you've been right you know
 

857
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:52,480
say well you've been right you know
before but I'm gonna put the company on

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:52,490
before but I'm gonna put the company on
 

859
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,570
before but I'm gonna put the company on
the line can you explain to me why I

860
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:55,580
the line can you explain to me why I
 

861
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,570
the line can you explain to me why I
should believe this and that explanation

862
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:58,580
should believe this and that explanation
 

863
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,430
should believe this and that explanation
may have nothing to do with the truth

864
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:00,440
may have nothing to do with the truth
 

865
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,029
may have nothing to do with the truth
just them and all them convinced the

866
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:03,039
just them and all them convinced the
 

867
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,710
just them and all them convinced the
wrong yes they'll be wrong she's got to

868

wrong yes they'll be wrong she's got to
 

869
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,390
wrong yes they'll be wrong she's got to
be convincing but it's ultimately got to

870
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:07,400
be convincing but it's ultimately got to
 

871
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,649
be convincing but it's ultimately got to
be convinced and that's why I'm saying

872
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:08,659
be convinced and that's why I'm saying
 

873
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:12,250
be convinced and that's why I'm saying
it's we're bound together right our

874
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,260
it's we're bound together right our
 

875
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,899
it's we're bound together right our
intelligences are bound together in that

876
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:13,909
intelligences are bound together in that
 

877
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:15,279
intelligences are bound together in that
sense we have to understand each other

878
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:15,289
sense we have to understand each other
 

879
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:17,830
sense we have to understand each other
and and if for example you're giving me

880
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
and and if for example you're giving me
 

881
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,630
and and if for example you're giving me
an explanation I mean this is a very

882
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:19,640
an explanation I mean this is a very
 

883
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,789
an explanation I mean this is a very
important point right you're giving me

884
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:21,799
important point right you're giving me
 

885
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,140
important point right you're giving me
an explanation and I'm and I and I and I

886
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,150
an explanation and I'm and I and I and I
 

887
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,159
an explanation and I'm and I and I and I
have iton I'm not good and then I'm not

888
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:30,169
have iton I'm not good and then I'm not
 

889
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:33,880
have iton I'm not good and then I'm not
good at reasoning well and being

890
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,890
good at reasoning well and being
 

891
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,690
good at reasoning well and being
objective and following logical paths

892
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:37,700
objective and following logical paths
 

893
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,240
objective and following logical paths
and consistent paths and I'm not good at

894
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,250
and consistent paths and I'm not good at
 

895
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,060
and consistent paths and I'm not good at
measuring and sort of computing

896
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,070
measuring and sort of computing
 

897
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,639
measuring and sort of computing
probabilities across those paths what

898
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:45,649
probabilities across those paths what
 

899
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:47,710
probabilities across those paths what
happens is collectively we're not going

900
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:47,720
happens is collectively we're not going
 

901
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,540
happens is collectively we're not going
to do we're not going to do well

902
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:49,550
to do we're not going to do well
 

903
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,900
to do we're not going to do well
how hard is that problem the second one

904
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:52,910
how hard is that problem the second one
 

905
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,720
how hard is that problem the second one
so we I think will talk quite a bit

906
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:55,730
so we I think will talk quite a bit
 

907
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,040
so we I think will talk quite a bit
about the the first on a specific

908
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,050
about the the first on a specific
 

909
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,800
about the the first on a specific
objective metric benchmark performing

910
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:02,810
objective metric benchmark performing
 

911
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,660
objective metric benchmark performing
well but being able to explain the steps

912
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:06,670
well but being able to explain the steps
 

913
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,210
well but being able to explain the steps
the reasoning how hard is that probably

914
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:10,220
the reasoning how hard is that probably
 

915
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,040
the reasoning how hard is that probably
that's I think that's very hard I mean I

916
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,050
that's I think that's very hard I mean I
 

917
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,660
that's I think that's very hard I mean I
think that that's um well it's hard for

918
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:16,670
think that that's um well it's hard for
 

919
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,780
think that that's um well it's hard for
humans the thing that's hard for humans

920
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:19,790
humans the thing that's hard for humans
 

921
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,270
humans the thing that's hard for humans
as you know may not necessarily be hard

922
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:22,280
as you know may not necessarily be hard
 

923
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,130
as you know may not necessarily be hard
for computers and vice-versa so sorry so

924
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,140
for computers and vice-versa so sorry so
 

925
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,510
for computers and vice-versa so sorry so
how hard is that problem for computers I

926
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:30,520
how hard is that problem for computers I
 

927
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,770
how hard is that problem for computers I
think it's hard for computers and the

928
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:32,780
think it's hard for computers and the
 

929
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,380
think it's hard for computers and the
reason why are related to or saying that

930
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:35,390
reason why are related to or saying that
 

931
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,850
reason why are related to or saying that
it's also hard for humans is because I

932
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:36,860
it's also hard for humans is because I
 

933
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,830
it's also hard for humans is because I
think when we step back and we say we

934
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:38,840
think when we step back and we say we
 

935
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,660
think when we step back and we say we
want to design computers to do that one

936
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:43,670
want to design computers to do that one
 

937
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,100
want to design computers to do that one
of the things we have to recognize is

938
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,110
of the things we have to recognize is
 

939
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,710
of the things we have to recognize is
we're not sure how to do it well I'm not

940
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
we're not sure how to do it well I'm not
 

941
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,010
we're not sure how to do it well I'm not
sure we have a recipe for that and even

942
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,020
sure we have a recipe for that and even
 

943
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,020
sure we have a recipe for that and even
if you wanted to learn it it's not clear

944
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,030
if you wanted to learn it it's not clear
 

945
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,770
if you wanted to learn it it's not clear
exactly what data we use and what

946
00:19:59,770 --> 00:19:59,780
exactly what data we use and what
 

947
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,130
exactly what data we use and what
judgments we use to learn that well and

948
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:03,140
judgments we use to learn that well and
 

949
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,950
judgments we use to learn that well and
so what I mean by that is if you look at

950
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:05,960
so what I mean by that is if you look at
 

951
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,700
so what I mean by that is if you look at
the entire enterprise of science science

952
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:09,710
the entire enterprise of science science
 

953
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,130
the entire enterprise of science science
is supposed to be at a bad objective

954
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:12,140
is supposed to be at a bad objective
 

955
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,990
is supposed to be at a bad objective
reason and reason right so we think

956
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
reason and reason right so we think
 

957
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,230
reason and reason right so we think
about who's the most intelligent person

958
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,240
about who's the most intelligent person
 

959
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,710
about who's the most intelligent person
or group of people in the world do we

960
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
or group of people in the world do we
 

961
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,500
or group of people in the world do we
think about the savants who can close

962
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,510
think about the savants who can close
 

963
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,660
think about the savants who can close
their eyes and give you a number we'd

964
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:25,670
their eyes and give you a number we'd
 

965
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,940
their eyes and give you a number we'd
think about the think tanks or the

966
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:27,950
think about the think tanks or the
 

967
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,770
think about the think tanks or the
scientists of the philosophers who kind

968
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:29,780
scientists of the philosophers who kind
 

969
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,980
scientists of the philosophers who kind
of work through the details and write

970
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:32,990
of work through the details and write
 

971
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,770
of work through the details and write
the papers and come up with the

972
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:34,780
the papers and come up with the
 

973
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,450
the papers and come up with the
thoughtful logical proves and use the

974
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:37,460
thoughtful logical proves and use the
 

975
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,970
thoughtful logical proves and use the
scientific method and I think it's the

976
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:39,980
scientific method and I think it's the
 

977
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,590
scientific method and I think it's the
latter and my point is that how do you

978
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:44,600
latter and my point is that how do you
 

979
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,060
latter and my point is that how do you
train someone to do that and that's what

980
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,070
train someone to do that and that's what
 

981
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,740
train someone to do that and that's what
I mean by it's hard how do you what's

982
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:47,750
I mean by it's hard how do you what's
 

983
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,600
I mean by it's hard how do you what's
the process of training people to do

984
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:49,610
the process of training people to do
 

985
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,900
the process of training people to do
that well that's a hard process we work

986
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:52,910
that well that's a hard process we work
 

987
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,290
that well that's a hard process we work
as a society we work pretty hard to get

988
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:56,300
as a society we work pretty hard to get
 

989
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,330
as a society we work pretty hard to get
other people to understand our thinking

990
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:58,340
other people to understand our thinking
 

991
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,380
other people to understand our thinking
and to convince them of things now we

992
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,390
and to convince them of things now we
 

993
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,250
and to convince them of things now we
could for so

994
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,260
could for so
 

995
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,080
could for so
weighed them obviously talked about this

996
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,090
weighed them obviously talked about this
 

997
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,340
weighed them obviously talked about this
like human flaws or weaknesses we can

998
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:08,350
like human flaws or weaknesses we can
 

999
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,570
like human flaws or weaknesses we can

emotional means but to but to get them

1002
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:13,580
emotional means but to but to get them
 

1003
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,480
emotional means but to but to get them
to understand and connect to and follow

to understand and connect to and follow
 

1005
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,410
to understand and connect to and follow
a logical argument is difficult we try

1006
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:20,420
a logical argument is difficult we try
 

1007
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,480
a logical argument is difficult we try
it we do it we do it as scientists we

1008
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:22,490
it we do it we do it as scientists we
 

1009
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,250
it we do it we do it as scientists we
try to do it as journalists we know we

1010
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:24,260
try to do it as journalists we know we
 

1011
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,440
try to do it as journalists we know we
try to do it as you know even artists in

1012
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,450
try to do it as you know even artists in
 

1013
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,010
try to do it as you know even artists in
many forms as writers as teachers we go

1014
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,020
many forms as writers as teachers we go
 

1015
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,940
many forms as writers as teachers we go
to a fairly significant training process

1016
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:32,950
to a fairly significant training process
 

1017
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,290
to a fairly significant training process
to do that and then we could ask what

1018
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:35,300
to do that and then we could ask what
 

1019
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,130
to do that and then we could ask what
why is that so hard

1020
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,140
why is that so hard
 

1021
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,010
why is that so hard
but it's hard and for humans it takes a

1022
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,020
but it's hard and for humans it takes a
 

1023
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,830
but it's hard and for humans it takes a
lot of work and when we step back and

1024
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:44,840
lot of work and when we step back and
 

1025
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,210
lot of work and when we step back and
say well step back and say well how do

1026
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:46,220
say well step back and say well how do
 

1027
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,740
say well step back and say well how do
we get a machine - how do we get a

1028
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:47,750
we get a machine - how do we get a
 

1029
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,750
we get a machine - how do we get a
machine to do that it's a vexing

1030
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
machine to do that it's a vexing
 

1031
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,310
machine to do that it's a vexing
question how would you begin to try to

1032
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
question how would you begin to try to
 

1033
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,740
question how would you begin to try to
solve that and maybe just a quick pause

1034
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:56,750
solve that and maybe just a quick pause
 

1035
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,650
solve that and maybe just a quick pause
because there's an optimistic notion in

1036
00:21:59,650 --> 00:21:59,660
because there's an optimistic notion in
 

1037
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,250
because there's an optimistic notion in
the things you're describing which is

the things you're describing which is
 

1039
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,390
the things you're describing which is
being able to explain something through

1040
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
being able to explain something through
 

1041
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,570
being able to explain something through
reason but if you look at algorithms

1042

reason but if you look at algorithms
 

1043
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,220
reason but if you look at algorithms
that recommend things that we look at

1044
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:09,230
that recommend things that we look at
 

1045
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,700
that recommend things that we look at
next

1046
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:09,710
next
 

1047
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,370
next
well there's Facebook Google advertising

1048
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:12,380
well there's Facebook Google advertising
 

1049
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,260
well there's Facebook Google advertising
based companies you know their goal is

1050
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,270
based companies you know their goal is
 

1051
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,010
based companies you know their goal is
to convince you to buy things based on

1052
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,020
to convince you to buy things based on
 

1053
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,510
to convince you to buy things based on
anything so that could be reason because

1054
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
anything so that could be reason because
 

1055
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,820
anything so that could be reason because
the best of advertisement is showing you

1056
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:27,830
the best of advertisement is showing you
 

1057
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,350
the best of advertisement is showing you
things that you really do need and

1058
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
things that you really do need and
 

1059
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,500
things that you really do need and
explain why you need it but it could

1060
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:32,510
explain why you need it but it could
 

1061
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,180
explain why you need it but it could
also be through emotional manipulation

1062
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,190
also be through emotional manipulation
 

1063
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,610
also be through emotional manipulation
the algorithm that describes why a

1064
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:39,620
the algorithm that describes why a
 

1065
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,890
the algorithm that describes why a
certain reason a certain decision was

1066
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:41,900
certain reason a certain decision was
 

1067
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,030
certain reason a certain decision was
was made how hard is it to do it through

1068
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,040
was made how hard is it to do it through
 

1069
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,350
was made how hard is it to do it through
emotional manipulation and why is that a

1070
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,360
emotional manipulation and why is that a
 

1071
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,320
emotional manipulation and why is that a
good or a bad thing so you've kind of

1072
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,330
good or a bad thing so you've kind of
 

1073
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,670
good or a bad thing so you've kind of
focused on reason logic really showing

1074
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:57,680
focused on reason logic really showing
 

1075
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,980
focused on reason logic really showing
in a clear way why something is good one

1076
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:02,990
in a clear way why something is good one
 

1077
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,930
in a clear way why something is good one
is that even a thing that us humans do

1078
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:04,940
is that even a thing that us humans do
 

1079
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,430
is that even a thing that us humans do
and and and - how do you think of the

1080
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
and and and - how do you think of the
 

1081
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,100
and and and - how do you think of the
differences in the reasoning aspect and

1082
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,110
differences in the reasoning aspect and
 

1083
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,730
differences in the reasoning aspect and
the emotional manipulation

1084
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:13,740
the emotional manipulation
 

1085
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,130
the emotional manipulation
well they you know so you call it

1086
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,140
well they you know so you call it
 

1087
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,899
well they you know so you call it
emotional manipulation but more

1088
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:17,909
emotional manipulation but more
 

1089
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,269
emotional manipulation but more
objectively is essentially saying you

1090
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:20,279
objectively is essentially saying you
 

1091
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,769
objectively is essentially saying you
know thing you know there are certain

1092
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:21,779
know thing you know there are certain
 

1093
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,450
know thing you know there are certain
features of things that seem to attract

1094
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:23,460
features of things that seem to attract
 

1095
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,159
features of things that seem to attract
your attention I'm gonna kind of give

1096
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:25,169
your attention I'm gonna kind of give
 

1097
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:26,380
your attention I'm gonna kind of give
you more of that stuff

1098
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:26,390
you more of that stuff
 

1099
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,669
you more of that stuff
manipulation is a bad word yeah I mean

1100
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:28,679
manipulation is a bad word yeah I mean
 

1101
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,110
manipulation is a bad word yeah I mean
I'm not saying it's good right or wrong

1102
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,120
I'm not saying it's good right or wrong
 

1103
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm not saying it's good right or wrong
is it it works to get your attention and

1104
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:32,850
is it it works to get your attention and
 

1105
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,490
is it it works to get your attention and
it works to get you to buy stuff and

1106
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:34,500
it works to get you to buy stuff and
 

1107
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,080
it works to get you to buy stuff and
when you think about algorithms that

1108
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,090
when you think about algorithms that
 

1109
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,960
when you think about algorithms that
look at the patterns of the you know

1110
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:38,970
look at the patterns of the you know
 

1111
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,789
look at the patterns of the you know
patterns of features that you seem to be

1112
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
patterns of features that you seem to be
 

1113
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,169
patterns of features that you seem to be
spending your money on and is there

1114
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:42,179
spending your money on and is there
 

1115
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,370
spending your money on and is there
going to give you something with a

1116
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:43,380
going to give you something with a
 

1117
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,260
going to give you something with a
similar pattern so I'm going to learn

1118
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,270
similar pattern so I'm going to learn
 

1119
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,060
similar pattern so I'm going to learn
that function because the objective is

1120
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,070
that function because the objective is
 

1121
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,649
that function because the objective is
to get you to click on and/or get you to

1122
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:48,659
to get you to click on and/or get you to
 

1123
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,440
to get you to click on and/or get you to
buy and or whatever it is I don't know I

1124
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,450
buy and or whatever it is I don't know I
 

1125
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,389
buy and or whatever it is I don't know I
mean that it is like it is what it is I

1126
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:53,399
mean that it is like it is what it is I
 

1127
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,340
mean that it is like it is what it is I
mean that's what the algorithm does

1128
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,350
mean that's what the algorithm does
 

1129
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,139
mean that's what the algorithm does
you can argue whether it's good or bad

1130
00:23:57,139 --> 00:23:57,149
you can argue whether it's good or bad
 

1131
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,180
you can argue whether it's good or bad
it depends what your you know what your

1132
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,190
it depends what your you know what your
 

1133
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,110
it depends what your you know what your
what your goal is

1134
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,120
what your goal is
 

1135
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,659
what your goal is
I guess this seems to very useful for

1136
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:02,669
I guess this seems to very useful for
 

1137
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:05,419
I guess this seems to very useful for
convincing telling us the thing for

1138
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:05,429
convincing telling us the thing for
 

1139
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:07,760
convincing telling us the thing for
convincing humans yeah it's good because

1140
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:07,770
convincing humans yeah it's good because
 

1141
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,649
convincing humans yeah it's good because
you gives again this goes back to how

1142
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:09,659
you gives again this goes back to how
 

1143
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,269
you gives again this goes back to how
does a human you know what is the human

1144
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:11,279
does a human you know what is the human
 

1145
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,360
does a human you know what is the human
behavior like how does a human you know

1146
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,370
behavior like how does a human you know
 

1147
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,450
behavior like how does a human you know
brain respond to things I think there's

1148
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:17,460
brain respond to things I think there's
 

1149
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,519
brain respond to things I think there's
a more optimistic view of that too which

1150
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:19,529
a more optimistic view of that too which
 

1151
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,310
a more optimistic view of that too which
is that if you're searching for certain

1152
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
is that if you're searching for certain
 

1153
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,260
is that if you're searching for certain
kinds of things you've already reasoned

1154
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,270
kinds of things you've already reasoned
 

1155
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,960
kinds of things you've already reasoned
that you need them and these these

1156
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:26,970
that you need them and these these
 

1157
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,600
that you need them and these these
algorithms are saying look that's up to

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:29,610
algorithms are saying look that's up to
 

1159

you
the reason whether you need something or

1162
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:31,770
the reason whether you need something or
 

1163
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,460
the reason whether you need something or
not that's your job you know you you met

1164
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:34,470
not that's your job you know you you met

not that's your job you know you you met
you may have an unhealthy addiction to

1166
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,270
you may have an unhealthy addiction to
 

1167
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,080
you may have an unhealthy addiction to
this stuff or you may have a reasoned

1168
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,090
this stuff or you may have a reasoned
 

1169
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,970
this stuff or you may have a reasoned
and thoughtful

1170
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:41,980

 

1171
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,770

explanation for why it's important to

1172
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:43,780
explanation for why it's important to
 

1173
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,930
explanation for why it's important to
you and the algorithms are saying hey

1174
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:45,940
you and the algorithms are saying hey
 

1175
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,610
you and the algorithms are saying hey
that's like whatever like that's your

1176
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:47,620
that's like whatever like that's your
 

1177
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,680
that's like whatever like that's your
problem all I know is you're buying

1178
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:49,690
problem all I know is you're buying
 

1179
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,240
problem all I know is you're buying
stuff like that you're interested in

1180
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,250
stuff like that you're interested in
 

1181
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,650
stuff like that you're interested in
stuff like that could be a bad reason

1182
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:52,660
stuff like that could be a bad reason
 

1183
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,660
stuff like that could be a bad reason
could be a good reason that's up to you

1184
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:54,670
could be a good reason that's up to you
 

1185
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,910
could be a good reason that's up to you
I'm gonna show you more of that stuff

1186
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:56,920
I'm gonna show you more of that stuff
 

1187
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,549
I'm gonna show you more of that stuff
and so and I and I and I think that

1188
00:24:59,549 --> 00:24:59,559
and so and I and I and I think that
 

1189
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,580
and so and I and I and I think that
that's it's not good or bad it it's not

1190
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:02,590
that's it's not good or bad it it's not
 

1191
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,080
that's it's not good or bad it it's not
reason or not reason the algorithm is

1192
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,090
reason or not reason the algorithm is
 

1193
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,910
reason or not reason the algorithm is
doing what it does which is saying you

1194
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:05,920
doing what it does which is saying you
 

1195
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,080
doing what it does which is saying you
seems to be interested in this I'm going

1196
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,090
seems to be interested in this I'm going
 

1197
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,570
seems to be interested in this I'm going
to show you more that stuff and I think

1198
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:09,580
to show you more that stuff and I think
 

1199
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,919
to show you more that stuff and I think
we're seeing it's not just in buying

1200
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:10,929
we're seeing it's not just in buying
 

1201
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:12,360
we're seeing it's not just in buying
stuff but even in social media you're

1202
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,370
stuff but even in social media you're
 

1203
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,740
stuff but even in social media you're
reading this kind of stuff I'm not

1204
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:13,750
reading this kind of stuff I'm not
 

1205
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,810
reading this kind of stuff I'm not
judging on whether it's good or bad I'm

1206
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:15,820
judging on whether it's good or bad I'm
 

1207
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,640
judging on whether it's good or bad I'm
not reasoning at all I'm just saying I'm

1208
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:17,650
not reasoning at all I'm just saying I'm
 

1209
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,799
not reasoning at all I'm just saying I'm
gonna show you other stuff with similar

1210
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:19,809
gonna show you other stuff with similar
 

1211
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,930
gonna show you other stuff with similar
features and you know and like and

1212
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:21,940
features and you know and like and
 

1213
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,520
features and you know and like and
that's it and I wash my hands from it

1214
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:23,530
that's it and I wash my hands from it
 

1215
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,960
that's it and I wash my hands from it
and I say that's all you know that's all

1216
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:24,970
and I say that's all you know that's all
 

1217
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,830
and I say that's all you know that's all
what's going on you know there is you

1218
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:28,840
what's going on you know there is you
 

1219
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,409
what's going on you know there is you
know people are so harsh on AI systems

1220
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:31,419
know people are so harsh on AI systems
 

1221
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:33,630
know people are so harsh on AI systems
so one the bar of performance is

1222
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:33,640
so one the bar of performance is
 

1223
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,299
so one the bar of performance is
extremely high and yet we also asked

1224
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:36,309
extremely high and yet we also asked
 

1225
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,720
extremely high and yet we also asked
them to in the case of social media to

1226
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:39,730
them to in the case of social media to
 

1227
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,330
them to in the case of social media to
help find the better angels of our

1228
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:42,340
help find the better angels of our
 

1229
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,049
help find the better angels of our
nature and help make a better society so

1230
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:46,059
nature and help make a better society so
 

1231
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:47,549
nature and help make a better society so
what do you think about the role of it

1232
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:47,559
what do you think about the role of it
 

1233
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:50,130
what do you think about the role of it
that so that agrees you that's that's

1234
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,140
that so that agrees you that's that's
 

1235
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,750
that so that agrees you that's that's
the interesting dichotomy right because

1236
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,760
the interesting dichotomy right because
 

1237
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,150
the interesting dichotomy right because
on one hand we're sitting there and

1238
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,160
on one hand we're sitting there and
 

1239
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,010
on one hand we're sitting there and
we're sort of doing the easy part which

1240
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,020
we're sort of doing the easy part which
 

1241
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,260
we're sort of doing the easy part which
is finding the patterns we're not

1242
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,270
is finding the patterns we're not
 

1243
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,419
is finding the patterns we're not
building the systems not building a

1244
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:00,429
building the systems not building a
 

1245
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,909
building the systems not building a
theory that it's consumable and

1246
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:02,919
theory that it's consumable and
 

1247
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:04,440
theory that it's consumable and
understandable other humans that could

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,630
being explained and justified and and so
on one hand to say oh you know AI is

1252
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:09,640
on one hand to say oh you know AI is
 

1253
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,630
on one hand to say oh you know AI is
doing this why isn't doing this other

1254
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:12,640
doing this why isn't doing this other
 

1255
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,549
doing this why isn't doing this other
thing well those other things a lot

1256
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
thing well those other things a lot
 

1257
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,520
thing well those other things a lot
harder and it's interesting to think

1258
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:17,530
harder and it's interesting to think
 

1259
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,180
harder and it's interesting to think
about why why why it's harder and

1260
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,190
about why why why it's harder and
 

1261
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,260
about why why why it's harder and
because you're interpreting you're

clicking on a bunch of stuff and I look
 

1287
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,230

right because you have to start getting

00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:46,880
right because you have to start getting
 

1335
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,590
right because you have to start getting

how humans interpret the content

how humans interpret the content

relative to their value system and
 

1343
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,970
relative to their value system and
deeper thought processes so that's what

1344
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:00,980
deeper thought processes so that's what
 

1345
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,950
deeper thought processes so that's what
meaning means is not just some kind of

1346
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:04,960
meaning means is not just some kind of
 

1347
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,580
meaning means is not just some kind of
deep timeless semantic thing that the

1348
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:09,590
deep timeless semantic thing that the
 

1349
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,980
deep timeless semantic thing that the
statement represents but also how a

1350
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:11,990
statement represents but also how a
 

1351
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,840
statement represents but also how a
large number of people are likely to

1352
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:13,850
large number of people are likely to
 

1353
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,140
large number of people are likely to
interpret so that's again even meaning

1354
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,150
interpret so that's again even meaning
 

1355
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,570
interpret so that's again even meaning
is a social construct it's so you have

1356
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:19,580
is a social construct it's so you have
 

1357
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,870
is a social construct it's so you have
to try to predict how most people would

1358
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880
to try to predict how most people would
 

1359
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,580
to try to predict how most people would
understand this kind of statement yeah

1360
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:24,590
understand this kind of statement yeah
 

1361
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,240
understand this kind of statement yeah
meaning is often relative but meaning

1362
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,250
meaning is often relative but meaning
 

1363
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,280
meaning is often relative but meaning
implies that the connections go beneath

1364
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,290
implies that the connections go beneath
 

1365
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,020
implies that the connections go beneath
the surface of the artifact so if I show

1366
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,030
the surface of the artifact so if I show
 

1367
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,330
the surface of the artifact so if I show
you a painting it's a bunch of colors in

1368
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:34,340
you a painting it's a bunch of colors in
 

1369
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,330
you a painting it's a bunch of colors in
a canvas what does it mean to you and it

1370
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:37,340
a canvas what does it mean to you and it
 

1371
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,560
a canvas what does it mean to you and it
may mean different things at different

1372
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:38,570
may mean different things at different
 

1373
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,020
may mean different things at different
people because of their different

1374
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,030
people because of their different
 

1375
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,380
people because of their different
experiences it may mean something even

1376
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:44,390
experiences it may mean something even
 

1377
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,000
experiences it may mean something even
different to the artist to who painted

1378
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,010
different to the artist to who painted
 

1379
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,360
different to the artist to who painted
it as we try to get more rigorous with

1380
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,370
it as we try to get more rigorous with
 

1381
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,760
it as we try to get more rigorous with
our communication we try to really nail

1382
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:51,770
our communication we try to really nail
 

1383
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,700
our communication we try to really nail
down that meaning so we go from abstract

1384
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:54,710
down that meaning so we go from abstract
 

1385
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,140
down that meaning so we go from abstract
art to precise mathematics precise

1386
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,150
art to precise mathematics precise
 

1387
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,610

engineering drawings and things like

1388
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:00,620
engineering drawings and things like
 

1389
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,730
engineering drawings and things like
that we're really trying to say I want

1390
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:03,740
that we're really trying to say I want
 

1391
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,790
that we're really trying to say I want
to narrow that that space of possible

1392
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:06,800
to narrow that that space of possible
 

1393
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,320
to narrow that that space of possible
interpretations

1394
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,330
interpretations
 

1395
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,399
interpretations
because the precision of the

1396
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:09,409
because the precision of the
 

1397
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:11,710
because the precision of the
communication ends up becoming more and

1398
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:11,720
communication ends up becoming more and
 

1399
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,370
communication ends up becoming more and
more important and so that means that I

1400
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:15,380
more important and so that means that I
 

1401
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,210
more important and so that means that I
have to specify and I think that's why

1402
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:19,220
have to specify and I think that's why
 

1403
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,450
have to specify and I think that's why
this becomes really hard because if I'm

1404
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:22,460
this becomes really hard because if I'm
 

1405
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,460
this becomes really hard because if I'm
just showing you an artifact and you're

1406
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,470
just showing you an artifact and you're
 

1407
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,320
just showing you an artifact and you're
looking at it superficially whether it's

1408
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,330
looking at it superficially whether it's
 

1409
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,570
looking at it superficially whether it's
a bunch of words on a page or whether

1410
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:28,580
a bunch of words on a page or whether
 

1411
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,690
a bunch of words on a page or whether
it's you know brushstrokes on a canvas

1412
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:31,700
it's you know brushstrokes on a canvas
 

1413
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,120
it's you know brushstrokes on a canvas
or pixels on a photograph you can sit

1414
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,130

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,380
or pixels on a photograph you can sit
there and you can interpret lots of

1416
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,390
there and you can interpret lots of
 

1417
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,940
there and you can interpret lots of
different ways at many many different

1418
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:36,950
different ways at many many different
 

1419
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,970
different ways at many many different
levels but when I want to when I want to

1420
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:41,980
levels but when I want to when I want to
 

1421
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,850
levels but when I want to when I want to
align our understanding of that I have

1422
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:45,860
align our understanding of that I have
 

1423
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,519
align our understanding of that I have
to specify a lot more stuff that's

1424
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:48,529
to specify a lot more stuff that's
 

1425
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:51,789
to specify a lot more stuff that's
actually not in it not directly in the

actually not in it not directly in the
 

1427
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,680
actually not in it not directly in the
artifact now I have to say well how you

1428
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:53,690
artifact now I have to say well how you
 

1429
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,470
artifact now I have to say well how you
were how are you interpreting this image

00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
were how are you interpreting this image
 

1431
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,120
were how are you interpreting this image
and that image and what about the colors

1432
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,130
and that image and what about the colors
 

1433
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,039
and that image and what about the colors
and what do they mean to you what's what

1434
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:00,049
and what do they mean to you what's what
 

1435
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,659
and what do they mean to you what's what
perspective are you bringing to the

saying well if this is the case then I
 

1453
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:16,899
saying well if this is the case then I
would conclude this and if that's the

so your reasoning processes and how they

1458
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:21,710
so your reasoning processes and how they
 

1459
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,730
so your reasoning processes and how they
work your prior models and what they are

1460
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:24,740
work your prior models and what they are
 

1461
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,250
work your prior models and what they are
your values and your assumptions all

1462
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:27,260
your values and your assumptions all
 

1463
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,529
your values and your assumptions all
those things now come together into the

1464
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:29,539
those things now come together into the
 

1465
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:32,500
those things now come together into the
interpretation getting in sick of that

00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:32,510
interpretation getting in sick of that
 

1467
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,430
interpretation getting in sick of that
is hard and yet humans able to intuit

1468
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:36,440
is hard and yet humans able to intuit
 

1469
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,879
is hard and yet humans able to intuit
some of that without any pre because

1470
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:39,889
some of that without any pre because
 

1471
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:41,680
some of that without any pre because
they have the shared experience me and

1472
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:41,690
they have the shared experience me and
 

1473
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,060
they have the shared experience me and
we're not talking about shared two

1474
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,070
we're not talking about shared two
 

1475
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,740
we're not talking about shared two
people have any shares know me as a

1476
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:44,750
people have any shares know me as a
 

1477
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,019
people have any shares know me as a
society that's correct we have this

1478
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:47,029
society that's correct we have this
 

1479
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:49,960
society that's correct we have this
shared experience and we have similar

1480
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:49,970
shared experience and we have similar
 

1481
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,320
shared experience and we have similar
brains so we tend to Institute in other

1482
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,330
brains so we tend to Institute in other
 

1483
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,299
brains so we tend to Institute in other
words part of our shared experiences are

1484
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:55,309
words part of our shared experiences are
 

1485
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:57,100
words part of our shared experiences are
shared local experience like we may live

1486
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,110
shared local experience like we may live
 

1487
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,360
shared local experience like we may live
in the same culture we may live in the

1488
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:58,370
in the same culture we may live in the
 

1489
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,799
in the same culture we may live in the
same society and therefore we have

1490
00:30:59,799 --> 00:30:59,809
same society and therefore we have
 

1491
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,860
same society and therefore we have
similar education we have similar what

1492
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:02,870
similar education we have similar what
 

1493
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,389
similar education we have similar what
we like to call prior models about the

1494
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
we like to call prior models about the
 

1495
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,549
we like to call prior models about the
world prior experiences and we use that

1496
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:06,559
world prior experiences and we use that
 

1497
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,639
world prior experiences and we use that
as a think of it as a wide collection of

1498
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:09,649
as a think of it as a wide collection of
 

1499
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:11,320
as a think of it as a wide collection of
interrelated variables and they're all

1500
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,330
interrelated variables and they're all
 

1501
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,539
interrelated variables and they're all
bound to similar things and so we take

1502
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:13,549
bound to similar things and so we take
 

1503
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:15,700
bound to similar things and so we take
that as our background and we start

1504
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:15,710
that as our background and we start
 

1505
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,919
that as our background and we start
interpreting things similarly but as

1506
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:17,929
interpreting things similarly but as
 

1507
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:20,220
interpreting things similarly but as
humans we have it we have

1508
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,230
humans we have it we have
 

1509
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,440
humans we have it we have
a lot of shared experience we do have

1510
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:22,450
a lot of shared experience we do have
 

1511
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,289
a lot of shared experience we do have
similar brains similar goals similar

1512
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:25,299
similar brains similar goals similar
 

1513
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:27,289
similar brains similar goals similar
emotions under similar circumstances

1514
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:27,299
emotions under similar circumstances
 

1515
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,580
emotions under similar circumstances
because we're both humans so now one of

1516
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:29,590
because we're both humans so now one of
 

1517
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,770
because we're both humans so now one of
the early questions you ask well how is

1518
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:31,780
the early questions you ask well how is
 

1519
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,530
the early questions you ask well how is
biological and you know computer

1520
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:34,540
biological and you know computer
 

1521
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,560
biological and you know computer
information systems fundamentally

1522
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:37,570
information systems fundamentally
 

1523
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,299
information systems fundamentally
different well one is you know one is

1524
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:39,309
different well one is you know one is
 

1525
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:42,150
different well one is you know one is
come you means come with a lot of

1526
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:42,160
come you means come with a lot of
 

1527
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,220
come you means come with a lot of
pre-programmed stuff yeah a ton of

1528
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,230
pre-programmed stuff yeah a ton of
 

1529
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,680
pre-programmed stuff yeah a ton of
program stuff and they were able to

1530
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:46,690
program stuff and they were able to
 

1531
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,970
program stuff and they were able to
communicate because they have a lot of

1532
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:47,980
communicate because they have a lot of
 

1533
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,520
communicate because they have a lot of
it because they share that stuff do you

1534
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:50,530
it because they share that stuff do you
 

1535
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,990
it because they share that stuff do you
think that shared knowledge if it can

1536
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:55,000
think that shared knowledge if it can
 

1537
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,659
think that shared knowledge if it can
maybe escape the hardware question how

1538
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:57,669
maybe escape the hardware question how
 

1539
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:59,760
maybe escape the hardware question how
much is encoded in the hardware just the

1540
00:31:59,760 --> 00:31:59,770
much is encoded in the hardware just the
 

1541
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,560
much is encoded in the hardware just the
shared knowledge in the software the the

1542
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:01,570
shared knowledge in the software the the
 

1543
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,620
shared knowledge in the software the the
history the many centuries of wars and

1544
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:04,630
history the many centuries of wars and
 

1545
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,200
history the many centuries of wars and
so on that came to today that shared

1546
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,210
so on that came to today that shared
 

1547
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:14,400
so on that came to today that shared
knowledge how hard is it to encode and

1548
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:14,410
knowledge how hard is it to encode and
 

1549
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,620
knowledge how hard is it to encode and
did you have a hope can you speak to how

1550
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:16,630
did you have a hope can you speak to how
 

1551
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,159
did you have a hope can you speak to how
hard is it to encode that knowledge

1552
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:19,169
hard is it to encode that knowledge
 

1553
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:20,909
hard is it to encode that knowledge
systematically in a way that could be

1554
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:20,919
systematically in a way that could be
 

1555
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:23,280
systematically in a way that could be
used by a computer so I think it is

1556
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,290
used by a computer so I think it is
 

1557
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,460
used by a computer so I think it is
possible to learn to form machine to

1558
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:26,470
possible to learn to form machine to
 

1559
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,890
possible to learn to form machine to
program machine to acquire that

1560
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:28,900
program machine to acquire that
 

1561
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,440
program machine to acquire that
knowledge with a similar foundation in

1562
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:31,450
knowledge with a similar foundation in
 

1563
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,690
knowledge with a similar foundation in
other words in a similar interpretive

1564
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:33,700
other words in a similar interpretive
 

1565
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,900
other words in a similar interpretive
interpretive foundation for processing

1566
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:36,910
interpretive foundation for processing
 

1567
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,700
interpretive foundation for processing
that knowledge but what do you mean by

1568
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:38,710
that knowledge but what do you mean by
 

1569
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,020
that knowledge but what do you mean by
that so in other in other words

1570
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,030
that so in other in other words
 

1571
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,690
that so in other in other words
foundation we view the world in a

1572
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:42,700
foundation we view the world in a
 

1573
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,280
foundation we view the world in a
particular way and so in other words we

1574
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,290
particular way and so in other words we
 

1575
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,440
particular way and so in other words we
we have i if you will as humans we have

1576
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,450
we have i if you will as humans we have
 

1577
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,909
we have i if you will as humans we have
a frame reference for bringing the world

1578
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:50,919
a frame reference for bringing the world
 

1579
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:54,539
a frame reference for bringing the world
around us so we have multiple frameworks

1580
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:54,549
around us so we have multiple frameworks
 

1581
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:56,060
around us so we have multiple frameworks
for interpreting the world around us but

1582
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,070
for interpreting the world around us but
 

1583
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,909
for interpreting the world around us but
if you're interpreting for example

1584
00:32:58,909 --> 00:32:58,919
if you're interpreting for example
 

1585
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,409
if you're interpreting for example
social political interactions you're

1586
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:01,419
social political interactions you're
 

1587
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:02,549
social political interactions you're
thinking about what there's people

1588
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
thinking about what there's people
 

1589
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,740
thinking about what there's people
there's collections and groups of people

1590
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:04,750
there's collections and groups of people
 

1591
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,440
there's collections and groups of people
they have goals the goals largely built

1592
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,450
they have goals the goals largely built
 

1593
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,950
they have goals the goals largely built
around survival and quality of life that

1594
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:10,960
around survival and quality of life that
 

1595
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,060
around survival and quality of life that
are their fundamental economics around

1596
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,070
are their fundamental economics around
 

1597
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,490
are their fundamental economics around
scarcity of resources and when when

1598
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:17,500
scarcity of resources and when when
 

1599
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,680
scarcity of resources and when when
humans come and start interpreting a

1600
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:19,690
humans come and start interpreting a
 

1601
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,970
humans come and start interpreting a
situation like that because you've

1602
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:20,980
situation like that because you've
 

1603
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,440
situation like that because you've
brought you've grown up like historical

1604
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:22,450
brought you've grown up like historical
 

1605
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,419
brought you've grown up like historical
events they start interpreting

1606
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:24,429
events they start interpreting
 

1607
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:26,580
events they start interpreting
situations like that they apply a lot of

1608
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:26,590
situations like that they apply a lot of
 

1609
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,070
situations like that they apply a lot of
this a lot of this this fundamental

1610
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,080
this a lot of this this fundamental
 

1611
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,500
this a lot of this this fundamental
framework for interpreting that well who

1612
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:31,510
framework for interpreting that well who
 

1613
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,100
framework for interpreting that well who
are the people

1614
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,110
are the people
 

1615
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,600
are the people
what were their goals what

1616
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:33,610
what were their goals what
 

1617
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,549
what were their goals what
users did they have how much power

1618
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:35,559
users did they have how much power
 

1619
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,930
users did they have how much power
influence that they have over the other

1620
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:36,940
influence that they have over the other
 

1621
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,750
influence that they have over the other
like this fundamental substrate if you

1622
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,760
like this fundamental substrate if you
 

1623
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,880
like this fundamental substrate if you
will for interpreting and reasoning

1624
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:41,890
will for interpreting and reasoning
 

1625
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,299
will for interpreting and reasoning
about that so I think it is possible to

1626
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:45,309
about that so I think it is possible to
 

1627
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,150
about that so I think it is possible to
in view a computer with that that stuff

1628
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:48,160
in view a computer with that that stuff
 

1629
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,850
in view a computer with that that stuff
that humans like take for granted when

1630
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:50,860
that humans like take for granted when
 

1631
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,799
that humans like take for granted when
they go and sit down and try to

1632
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:52,809
they go and sit down and try to
 

1633
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:55,289
they go and sit down and try to
interpret things and then and then with

1634
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:55,299
interpret things and then and then with
 

1635
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,200
interpret things and then and then with
that with that foundation they acquire

1636
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,210
that with that foundation they acquire
 

1637
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,390
that with that foundation they acquire
they start acquiring the details the

1638
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:00,400
they start acquiring the details the
 

1639
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,730
they start acquiring the details the
specifics in any given situation are

1640
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:02,740
specifics in any given situation are
 

1641
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,770
specifics in any given situation are
then able to interpret it with regard to

1642
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:04,780
then able to interpret it with regard to
 

1643
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,600
then able to interpret it with regard to
that framework and then given that

1644
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:06,610
that framework and then given that
 

1645
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,940
that framework and then given that
interpretation they can do what they can

1646
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:08,950
interpretation they can do what they can
 

1647
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,609
interpretation they can do what they can
predict but not only can they predict

1648
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:11,619
predict but not only can they predict
 

1649
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:15,080
predict but not only can they predict
they can predict now with an explanation

1650
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,090
they can predict now with an explanation
 

1651
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,030
they can predict now with an explanation
that can be given in those terms in the

1652
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,040
that can be given in those terms in the
 

1653
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,280
that can be given in those terms in the
terms of that underlying framework that

1654
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,290
terms of that underlying framework that
 

1655
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,919
terms of that underlying framework that
most humans share now you could find

1656
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:22,929
most humans share now you could find
 

1657
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,419
most humans share now you could find
humans that come in interpret events

1658
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:24,429
humans that come in interpret events
 

1659
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,220
humans that come in interpret events
very differently than other humans

1660
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,230
very differently than other humans
 

1661
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,139
very differently than other humans
because they're like using a different

1662
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:28,149
because they're like using a different
 

1663
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,869
because they're like using a different
different framework you know movie

1664
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
different framework you know movie
 

1665
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,210
different framework you know movie
matrix comes to mind where you know they

1666
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:33,220
matrix comes to mind where you know they
 

1667
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,310
matrix comes to mind where you know they
decided the humans were really just

1668
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:35,320
decided the humans were really just
 

1669
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,990
decided the humans were really just
batteries and that's how they

1670
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:37,000
batteries and that's how they
 

1671
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,020
batteries and that's how they
interpreted the value of humans as a

1672
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,030
interpreted the value of humans as a
 

1673
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,450
interpreted the value of humans as a
source of electrical energy so but um

1674
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:42,460
source of electrical energy so but um
 

1675
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,970
source of electrical energy so but um
but I think that you know for the most

1676
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:44,980
but I think that you know for the most
 

1677
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,399
but I think that you know for the most
part we we have a way of interpreting

1678
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:49,409
part we we have a way of interpreting
 

1679
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,960
part we we have a way of interpreting
the events or do social events around us

1680
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:51,970
the events or do social events around us
 

1681
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,180
the events or do social events around us
because we have to share at framework it

1682
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,190
because we have to share at framework it
 

1683
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,399
because we have to share at framework it
comes from again the fact that we're

1684
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:56,409
comes from again the fact that we're
 

1685
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,099
comes from again the fact that we're
we're similar beings that have similar

1686
00:34:59,099 --> 00:34:59,109
we're similar beings that have similar
 

1687
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:01,830
we're similar beings that have similar
goals similar emotions and we is we can

1688
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:01,840
goals similar emotions and we is we can
 

1689
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,390
goals similar emotions and we is we can
make sense out of these these frameworks

1690
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:03,400
make sense out of these these frameworks
 

1691
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,390
make sense out of these these frameworks
make sense to us so how much knowledge

1692
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400
make sense to us so how much knowledge
 

1693
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,700
make sense to us so how much knowledge
is there do you think so it's you said

1694
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:08,710
is there do you think so it's you said
 

1695
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,020
is there do you think so it's you said
it's possible well there's all its

1696
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,030
it's possible well there's all its
 

1697
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,310
it's possible well there's all its
tremendous amount of detailed knowledge

1698
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:11,320
tremendous amount of detailed knowledge
 

1699
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,820
tremendous amount of detailed knowledge
in the world there you know you can

1700
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:14,830
in the world there you know you can
 

1701
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,190
in the world there you know you can
imagine you know effectively infinite

1702
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,200
imagine you know effectively infinite
 

1703
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,040
imagine you know effectively infinite
number of unique situations and unique

1704
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,050
number of unique situations and unique
 

1705
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,680
number of unique situations and unique
configurations of these things but the

1706
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:22,690
configurations of these things but the
 

1707
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,890
configurations of these things but the
the knowledge that you need what I refer

1708
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:25,900
the knowledge that you need what I refer
 

1709
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,109
the knowledge that you need what I refer
to as like the frameworks for you for

1710
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:28,119
to as like the frameworks for you for
 

1711
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,910
to as like the frameworks for you for
interpreting them I don't think I think

1712
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:29,920
interpreting them I don't think I think
 

1713
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,890
interpreting them I don't think I think
that's those are finite you think the

1714
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:31,900
that's those are finite you think the
 

1715
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,550
that's those are finite you think the
frameworks I'm more important than the

1716
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:35,560
frameworks I'm more important than the
 

1717
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
frameworks I'm more important than the
bulk of them now so it's like framing

1718
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:37,570
bulk of them now so it's like framing
 

1719
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,450
bulk of them now so it's like framing
yeah because the frameworks do is they

1720
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:39,460
yeah because the frameworks do is they
 

1721
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,950
yeah because the frameworks do is they
give you now the ability to interpret

1722
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
give you now the ability to interpret
 

1723
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,359
give you now the ability to interpret
and reason and to interpret and

1724
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:42,369
and reason and to interpret and
 

1725
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:45,390
and reason and to interpret and
reasoning to interpret and reason over

1726
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:45,400
reasoning to interpret and reason over
 

1727
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,150
reasoning to interpret and reason over
the specific

1728
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,160
the specific
 

1729
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,070
the specific
in ways that other humans would

1730
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,080
in ways that other humans would
 

1731
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,680
in ways that other humans would
understand what about the specifics you

1732
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,690
understand what about the specifics you
 

1733
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,900
understand what about the specifics you
know who acquired the specifics by

1734
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:52,910
know who acquired the specifics by
 

1735
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,240
know who acquired the specifics by
reading and by talking to other people

1736
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,250
reading and by talking to other people
 

1737
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,940
reading and by talking to other people
and so mostly actually just even if we

1738
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:57,950
and so mostly actually just even if we
 

1739
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,370
and so mostly actually just even if we
can focus on even the beginning the

1740
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:00,380
can focus on even the beginning the
 

1741
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,020
can focus on even the beginning the
common-sense stuff the stuff that

1742
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,030
common-sense stuff the stuff that
 

1743
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,750
common-sense stuff the stuff that
doesn't even require reading or

1744
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:03,760
doesn't even require reading or
 

1745
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,370
doesn't even require reading or
animalistic requires playing around with

1746
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:06,380
animalistic requires playing around with
 

1747
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,200
animalistic requires playing around with
the world or something just being able

1748
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,210
the world or something just being able
 

1749
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,140
the world or something just being able
to sort of manipulate objects drink

1750
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,150
to sort of manipulate objects drink
 

1751
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,320
to sort of manipulate objects drink
water and so on all does that every time

1752
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,330
water and so on all does that every time
 

1753
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,240
water and so on all does that every time
we try to do that kind of thing in

1754
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,250
we try to do that kind of thing in
 

1755
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,900
we try to do that kind of thing in
robotics or AI it seems to be like an

1756
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:19,910
robotics or AI it seems to be like an
 

1757
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,600
robotics or AI it seems to be like an
onion you seem to realize how much

1758
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:22,610
onion you seem to realize how much
 

1759
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,580
onion you seem to realize how much
knowledge is really required to perform

1760
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:24,590
knowledge is really required to perform
 

1761
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,340
knowledge is really required to perform
you in some of these basic tasks do you

1762
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:27,350
you in some of these basic tasks do you
 

1763
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:32,500
you in some of these basic tasks do you
have that sense as well and if so how do

1764
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:32,510
have that sense as well and if so how do
 

1765
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,000
have that sense as well and if so how do
we get all those details are they

1766
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,010
we get all those details are they
 

1767
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,310
we get all those details are they
written down somewhere idea they have to

1768
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,320
written down somewhere idea they have to
 

1769
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,970
written down somewhere idea they have to
be learned through experience so I think

1770
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:39,980
be learned through experience so I think
 

1771
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,470
be learned through experience so I think
when like if you're talking about sort

1772
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:41,480
when like if you're talking about sort
 

1773
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,380
when like if you're talking about sort
of the physics the basic physics around

1774
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:44,390
of the physics the basic physics around
 

1775
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,000
of the physics the basic physics around
us for example acquiring information

1776
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,010
us for example acquiring information
 

1777
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,870
us for example acquiring information
about for acquiring how that works yeah

1778
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:49,880
about for acquiring how that works yeah
 

1779
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,980
about for acquiring how that works yeah
I think that I think there's a

1780
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:50,990
I think that I think there's a
 

1781
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,480
I think that I think there's a
combination of things going I think

1782
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,490
combination of things going I think
 

1783
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,920
combination of things going I think
there's a combination of things going on

1784
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:53,930
there's a combination of things going on
 

1785
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,680
there's a combination of things going on
I think there is like fundamental

1786
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:56,690
I think there is like fundamental
 

1787
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,210
I think there is like fundamental
pattern matching like what were you

1788
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:58,220
pattern matching like what were you
 

1789
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,040
pattern matching like what were you
talking about before where you see

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,050
talking about before where you see
 

1791
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,780
talking about before where you see
enough examples enough data about

1792
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:01,790
enough examples enough data about
 

1793
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,490
enough examples enough data about
something you start assuming that and

1794
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:03,500
something you start assuming that and
 

1795
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,100

with similar input I'm going to predict
 

1797
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,230
with similar input I'm going to predict
similar outputs you don't can't

1798
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,240
similar outputs you don't can't
 

1799
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,360
similar outputs you don't can't
necessarily explain it at all you may

1800
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,370
necessarily explain it at all you may
 

1801

learn very quickly that when you let

1802
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:12,440
learn very quickly that when you let
 

1803
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,690
learn very quickly that when you let
something go it falls to the ground

1804
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:15,700
something go it falls to the ground
 

1805
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,580
something go it falls to the ground
that's a that's a sickness is horribly

1806
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:18,590
that's a that's a sickness is horribly
 

1807
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,860
that's a that's a sickness is horribly
explained that but that's such a deep

1808
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:20,870
explained that but that's such a deep
 

1809
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,100
explained that but that's such a deep
idea if you let something go like they

1810
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,110
idea if you let something go like they
 

1811
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,460
idea if you let something go like they
do gravity I mean people were letting

1812
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:27,470
do gravity I mean people were letting
 

1813
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,960
do gravity I mean people were letting
things go and counting on them falling

1814
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:28,970
things go and counting on them falling
 

1815
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,910
things go and counting on them falling
well before they understood gravity but

1816
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:30,920
well before they understood gravity but
 

1817
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,280
well before they understood gravity but
that seems to be a that's exactly what I

1818
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,290
that seems to be a that's exactly what I
 

1819
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,860
that seems to be a that's exactly what I
mean is before you take a physics class

1820
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:35,870
mean is before you take a physics class
 

1821
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,920
mean is before you take a physics class
or the or study anything about Newton

1822
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:38,930
or the or study anything about Newton
 

1823
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,020
or the or study anything about Newton
just the idea that stuff falls to the

1824
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,030
just the idea that stuff falls to the
 

1825
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,110
just the idea that stuff falls to the
ground and they be able to generalize

1826
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,120
ground and they be able to generalize
 

1827
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,800
ground and they be able to generalize
that other all kinds of stuff falls to

1828
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:47,810
that other all kinds of stuff falls to
 

1829
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:52,030
that other all kinds of stuff falls to
the ground it just seems like a non if

1830
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,040
the ground it just seems like a non if
 

1831
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,370
the ground it just seems like a non if
without encoding it like hard coding it

1832
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:54,380
without encoding it like hard coding it
 

1833
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,410
without encoding it like hard coding it
in it seems like a difficult thing to

1834
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:56,420
in it seems like a difficult thing to
 

1835
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,750
in it seems like a difficult thing to
pick up it seemed like gift of Allah

1836
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:58,760
pick up it seemed like gift of Allah
 

1837
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,640
pick up it seemed like gift of Allah
of different knowledge to be able to

1838
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:02,650
of different knowledge to be able to
 

1839
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,590
of different knowledge to be able to
integrate that into the framework sort

1840
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:05,600
integrate that into the framework sort
 

1841
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,650
integrate that into the framework sort
of into everything else so both know

1842
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:08,660
of into everything else so both know
 

1843
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,990
of into everything else so both know
that stuff falls to the ground and start

1844
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,000
that stuff falls to the ground and start
 

1845
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,650
that stuff falls to the ground and start
to reason about social political

1846
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:14,660
to reason about social political
 

1847
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,430
to reason about social political
discourse so both like the very basic

1848
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:18,440
discourse so both like the very basic
 

1849
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,950
discourse so both like the very basic
and the high-level reasoning

1850
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
and the high-level reasoning
 

1851
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,350
and the high-level reasoning
decision-making I guess my question is

1852
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:23,360
decision-making I guess my question is
 

1853
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,340
decision-making I guess my question is
how hard is this problem and sorry to

00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,350
how hard is this problem and sorry to
 

1855
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,830
how hard is this problem and sorry to
linger on it because again and we'll get

00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:29,840
linger on it because again and we'll get
 

1857
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,320
linger on it because again and we'll get
to it for sure as well Watson with

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,330
to it for sure as well Watson with

00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,970
to it for sure as well Watson with
jeopardy did its take on a problem

1860
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:33,980
jeopardy did its take on a problem
 

1861
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,980
jeopardy did its take on a problem
that's much more constrained but has the

1862
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:35,990
that's much more constrained but has the
 

1863
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,130
that's much more constrained but has the
same hugeness of scale at least from the

1864
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:39,140
same hugeness of scale at least from the
 

1865
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,470
same hugeness of scale at least from the
outsider's perspective so I'm asking the

1866
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:41,480
outsider's perspective so I'm asking the
 

1867
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,110
outsider's perspective so I'm asking the
general life question of to be able to

1868
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,120
general life question of to be able to
 

1869
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,180
general life question of to be able to
be an intelligent being and reason in

1870
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,190
be an intelligent being and reason in
 

1871
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,230
be an intelligent being and reason in
the in the world about both gravity and

1872
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,240
the in the world about both gravity and
 

1873
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,100
the in the world about both gravity and
politics how hard is that problem

1874
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,110
politics how hard is that problem
 

1875
00:38:53,110 --> 00:39:00,190
politics how hard is that problem
so I think it's solvable okay now

1876
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,200
so I think it's solvable okay now
 

1877
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,670
so I think it's solvable okay now
beautiful so what about what about time

1878
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:03,680
beautiful so what about what about time
 

1879
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,450
beautiful so what about what about time
travel okay convinced not as convinced

1880
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:10,460
travel okay convinced not as convinced
 

1881
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,670
travel okay convinced not as convinced
yet okay no I said I I think it is I

1882
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:12,680
yet okay no I said I I think it is I
 

1883
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,410
yet okay no I said I I think it is I
mean I I took it as solvable I mean I

1884
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:14,420
mean I I took it as solvable I mean I
 

1885
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,810
mean I I took it as solvable I mean I
think that it's alert it's versatile

1886
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:16,820

00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:21,830
learning is fundamental and I think
 

1891
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,380
learning is fundamental and I think
we're already in a place that we

I think machine learnings for example
 

1939
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:26,890

with enough examples can start to learn

1953
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,299

of these class of architectures that are

frameworks if we think in terms of
 

1963
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,049
frameworks if we think in terms of
robust architectures like this I think

1964
00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:00,059
robust architectures like this I think
 

1965
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:02,660
robust architectures like this I think
there is a path toward getting there

1966
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:02,670
there is a path toward getting there
 

1967
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,150

like that do you think systems they were

1970
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,010
like that do you think systems they were
 

1971
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,059
like that do you think systems they were
able to do this will look like and you

1972
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:11,069
able to do this will look like and you
 

1973
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:15,140
able to do this will look like and you
know that works or representing if you

know that works or representing if you

00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,549
know that works or representing if you
look back to the eighties and nineties

1976
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:16,559
look back to the eighties and nineties
 

1977
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,309
look back to the eighties and nineties
of the expert systems so more like

1978
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:19,319
of the expert systems so more like
 

1979
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:22,670

1985
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,940

automated acquisition of that knowledge

1986

automated acquisition of that knowledge
 

1987
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,089
automated acquisition of that knowledge
the I guess the question is when you

1988
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:32,099
the I guess the question is when you
 

1989
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,130
the I guess the question is when you
collect both the frameworks and the

1990
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,140
collect both the frameworks and the
 

1991
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,630
collect both the frameworks and the
knowledge from the data what do you

1992
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:35,640
knowledge from the data what do you
 

1993
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,700
knowledge from the data what do you
think that thing will look like yeah so

1994
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:37,710
think that thing will look like yeah so
 

1995
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,020
think that thing will look like yeah so
I mean I think think is asking a

1996
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,030
I mean I think think is asking a
 

1997
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,279
I mean I think think is asking a
question they look like neural networks

1998
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:40,289
question they look like neural networks
 

1999
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,750
question they look like neural networks
is a bit of a red herring I mean I think

2000
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
is a bit of a red herring I mean I think
 

2001
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,029
is a bit of a red herring I mean I think
that they they will they will certainly

2002
00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:44,039
that they they will they will certainly
 

2003
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,130
that they they will they will certainly
do inductive or pattern match based

2004

2005
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,170
do inductive or pattern match based
reasoning and I've already experimented

00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:48,180
reasoning and I've already experimented
 

2007
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,819

with architectures that combine both
that use machine learning and neural

that use machine learning and neural
 

2011
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,950
that use machine learning and neural
networks to learn certain classes of

for it to make good inductive guesses
 

2019
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,670
for it to make good inductive guesses
but then ultimately to try to take those

2020
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:04,680
but then ultimately to try to take those
 

2021
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,710
but then ultimately to try to take those
learnings and and marry them in other

2022
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:06,720
learnings and and marry them in other
 

2023
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,859
learnings and and marry them in other
words connect them to frameworks so that

2024
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:09,869
words connect them to frameworks so that
 

2025
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:12,079
words connect them to frameworks so that
it can then reason over that in terms of

it can then reason over that in terms of
 

2027
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:14,359
it can then reason over that in terms of
their humans understand so for example

have architectures that that do both but
 

2033
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,870
have architectures that that do both but
both those things but also have a

ultimately I need to take this data I
need to interpret it in the form of

these frameworks so they can reason over
it so there is a fundamental knowledge

2046
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:32,520
it so there is a fundamental knowledge
 

2047
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,339
it so there is a fundamental knowledge
representation like what you saying like

2048
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:34,349
representation like what you saying like
 

2049
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:36,859
representation like what you saying like
these graphs of logic if you will there

2050
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:36,869
these graphs of logic if you will there
 

2051
00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:39,829
these graphs of logic if you will there
are also neural networks that acquire

2052
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
are also neural networks that acquire
 

2053
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,250
are also neural networks that acquire
certain class of information they then

2054
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:43,260
certain class of information they then
 

2055
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,539
certain class of information they then
they they and align them with these

2056
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:44,549
they they and align them with these
 

2057
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:46,970
they they and align them with these
frameworks but there's also a mechanism

2058
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:46,980
frameworks but there's also a mechanism
 

2059
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,309
frameworks but there's also a mechanism
to acquire the frameworks themselves yes

2060
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:49,319
to acquire the frameworks themselves yes
 

2061
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,280
to acquire the frameworks themselves yes
so it seems like the idea of framework

2062
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,290
so it seems like the idea of framework
 

2063
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,500
so it seems like the idea of framework
requires some kind of collaboration with

2064
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:54,510
requires some kind of collaboration with
 

2065
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,280
requires some kind of collaboration with
humans absolutely so do you think of

2066
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,290
humans absolutely so do you think of
 

2067
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,140
humans absolutely so do you think of
that collaboration as well and unless to

that ultimately make sense to humans of
course the machine is gonna have the

2146
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:37,980
course the machine is gonna have the
 

2147
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,580
course the machine is gonna have the
strength egg it has the richer or longer

2148
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:40,590
strength egg it has the richer or longer
 

2149
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,310
strength egg it has the richer or longer
memory but that you know it has the more

2150
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:43,320
memory but that you know it has the more
 

2151
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,770
memory but that you know it has the more
rigorous reasoning abilities the deeper

2152
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:45,780
rigorous reasoning abilities the deeper
 

2153
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,290
rigorous reasoning abilities the deeper
reasoning abilities so be it interesting

2154
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:48,300
reasoning abilities so be it interesting
 

2155
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,200

you know complementary relationship

2156
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,210
you know complementary relationship
 

2157
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,330
you know complementary relationship
between the human and the machine do you

2158
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:53,340
between the human and the machine do you
 

2159
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,650
between the human and the machine do you
think that ultimately needs explained

2160
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:54,660
think that ultimately needs explained
 

2161
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,750
think that ultimately needs explained
ability like a machine so if we look we

2162
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:56,760
ability like a machine so if we look we
 

2163
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,090
ability like a machine so if we look we
study for example Tesla autopilot a lot

2164
00:44:59,090 --> 00:44:59,100
study for example Tesla autopilot a lot
 

2165
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,430
study for example Tesla autopilot a lot
or humans I don't know if you've driven

2166
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:01,440
or humans I don't know if you've driven
 

2167
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,190
or humans I don't know if you've driven
the vehicle or are aware of what is it

2168
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:04,200
the vehicle or are aware of what is it
 

2169
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,320
the vehicle or are aware of what is it
so you basically

2170
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,330
so you basically
 

2171
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,410
so you basically
the human and machine are working

2172
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:09,420
the human and machine are working
 

2173
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,880
the human and machine are working
together there and the human is

2174
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:10,890
together there and the human is
 

2175
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,590
together there and the human is
responsible for their own life to

2176
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:12,600
responsible for their own life to
 

2177
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,410
responsible for their own life to
monitor the system and you know the

2178
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:15,420
monitor the system and you know the
 

2179
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,650
monitor the system and you know the
system fails every few miles and so

2180
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:18,660
system fails every few miles and so
 

2181
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,630
system fails every few miles and so
there's there's hundreds of there's

2182
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
there's there's hundreds of there's
 

2183
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,870
there's there's hundreds of there's
millions of those failures a day and so

2184
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:23,880
millions of those failures a day and so
 

2185
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,090
millions of those failures a day and so
that's like a moment of interaction DC

2186
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:26,100
that's like a moment of interaction DC
 

2187
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,130
that's like a moment of interaction DC
yeah that's exactly right that's a

2188
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:28,140
yeah that's exactly right that's a
 

2189
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,490
yeah that's exactly right that's a
moment of interaction where you know the

2190
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:31,500
moment of interaction where you know the
 

2191
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,850
moment of interaction where you know the
the the machine has learned some stuff

2192
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:33,860
the the machine has learned some stuff
 

2193
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,020
the the machine has learned some stuff
it has a failure

2194
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:36,030
it has a failure
 

2195
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,780
it has a failure
somehow the failures communicated the

2196
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:38,790
somehow the failures communicated the
 

2197
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,390
somehow the failures communicated the
human is now filling in the mistake if

2198
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:41,400
human is now filling in the mistake if
 

2199
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,130
human is now filling in the mistake if
you will or maybe correcting or doing

00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:43,140
you will or maybe correcting or doing
 

2201
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,690
you will or maybe correcting or doing
something that is more successful in

2202
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:44,700
something that is more successful in
 

2203
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,790
something that is more successful in
that case the computer takes that

2204
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:46,800
that case the computer takes that
 

2205
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,460
that case the computer takes that
learning so I believe that the

2206
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:49,470
learning so I believe that the
 

2207
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,230
learning so I believe that the
collaboration between human and machine

2208
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:51,240
collaboration between human and machine
 

2209
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,210
collaboration between human and machine
I mean that's sort of a permanent

2210
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:53,220
I mean that's sort of a permanent
 

2211
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,140
I mean that's sort of a permanent
example of sort of a more another

2212
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:57,150
example of sort of a more another
 

2213
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,370
example of sort of a more another
example is where the machine is

2214
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:58,380
example is where the machine is
 

2215
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,050
example is where the machine is
literally talking to you and saying look

2216
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:00,060
literally talking to you and saying look
 

2217
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,530
literally talking to you and saying look
I'm I'm reading this thing I know I know

2218
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:03,540
I'm I'm reading this thing I know I know
 

2219
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,080
I'm I'm reading this thing I know I know
that like the next word might be this or

2220
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:06,090
that like the next word might be this or
 

2221
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,390
that like the next word might be this or
that but I don't really understand why I

2222
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
that but I don't really understand why I
 

2223
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,940
that but I don't really understand why I
have my gas can you help me understand

2224
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:10,950
have my gas can you help me understand
 

2225
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,600
have my gas can you help me understand
the framework that supports this and

2226
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:13,610
the framework that supports this and
 

2227
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:16,190
the framework that supports this and
then can kind of take acquire that take

2228
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:16,200
then can kind of take acquire that take
 

2229
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,480
then can kind of take acquire that take
that and reason about it and reuse it

2230
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:17,490
that and reason about it and reuse it
 

2231
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,340
that and reason about it and reuse it
the next time it's reading to try to

2232
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:19,350
the next time it's reading to try to
 

2233
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:22,150
the next time it's reading to try to
understand something not on not unlike a

2234
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,160
understand something not on not unlike a
 

2235
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,310
understand something not on not unlike a
human student might do I mean I remember

2236
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:25,320
human student might do I mean I remember
 

2237
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,200
human student might do I mean I remember
like when my daughter was the first

2238
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,210
like when my daughter was the first
 

2239
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,780
like when my daughter was the first
great in she was had a reading

2240
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:29,790
great in she was had a reading
 

2241
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,080
great in she was had a reading
assignment about electricity and you

2242
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,090
assignment about electricity and you
 

2243
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,030
assignment about electricity and you
know somewhere in in the text it says

2244
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
know somewhere in in the text it says
 

2245
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,190
know somewhere in in the text it says
and electricity is produced by water

2246
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,200
and electricity is produced by water
 

2247
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,110
and electricity is produced by water
flowing over turbines or something like

2248
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:39,120
flowing over turbines or something like
 

2249
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,880
flowing over turbines or something like
that and then there's a question that

2250
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:40,890
that and then there's a question that
 

2251
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,530
that and then there's a question that
says well how was electricity created

2252
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:42,540
says well how was electricity created
 

2253
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,390
says well how was electricity created
and so my daughter comes to me and says

2254
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:44,400
and so my daughter comes to me and says
 

2255
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,030
and so my daughter comes to me and says
I mean I could you know created and

2256
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040
I mean I could you know created and
 

2257
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,440
I mean I could you know created and
produced or kind of synonyms in this

2258
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:48,450
produced or kind of synonyms in this
 

2259
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,720
produced or kind of synonyms in this
case so I can go back to the text and I

2260
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:50,730
case so I can go back to the text and I
 

2261
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,180
case so I can go back to the text and I
can copy by water flowing over turbines

2262
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,190
can copy by water flowing over turbines
 

2263
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,240
can copy by water flowing over turbines
but I have no idea what that means like

2264
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:56,250
but I have no idea what that means like
 

2265
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,800
but I have no idea what that means like
I don't know how to interpret water

2266
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:57,810
I don't know how to interpret water
 

2267
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,300
I don't know how to interpret water
flowing over turbines and what

2268
00:46:59,300 --> 00:46:59,310
flowing over turbines and what
 

2269
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,040
flowing over turbines and what
electricity even is I mean I can get the

2270
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,050
electricity even is I mean I can get the
 

2271
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:04,400
electricity even is I mean I can get the
answer right by matching the text but I

2272
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:04,410
answer right by matching the text but I
 

2273
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:05,570
answer right by matching the text but I
don't have any framework for

2274
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:05,580
don't have any framework for
 

2275
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,570
don't have any framework for
understanding what this means at all and

2276
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:07,580
understanding what this means at all and
 

2277
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,220
understanding what this means at all and
framework really I mean it's a set of

2278
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:10,230
framework really I mean it's a set of
 

2279
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,000
framework really I mean it's a set of
not to be mathematical but axioms of

2280
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,010
not to be mathematical but axioms of
 

2281
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,320
not to be mathematical but axioms of
ideas that you bring to the table and

2282
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:15,330
ideas that you bring to the table and
 

2283
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,850
ideas that you bring to the table and
interpreting stuff and then you build

2284
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:16,860
interpreting stuff and then you build
 

2285
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,550
interpreting stuff and then you build
those up somehow you build them up with

2286
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:19,560
those up somehow you build them up with
 

2287
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,120
those up somehow you build them up with
the expert

2288
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,130
the expert
 

2289
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,000
the expert
that there's a shared understanding of

2290
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,010
that there's a shared understanding of
 

2291
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,370
that there's a shared understanding of
what they are Sheriff it's the social

2292
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:25,380
what they are Sheriff it's the social
 

2293
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,210
what they are Sheriff it's the social
network that us humans do you have a

2294
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:29,220
network that us humans do you have a
 

2295
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,030
network that us humans do you have a
sense that humans on earth in general

2296
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:32,040
sense that humans on earth in general
 

2297
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,000
sense that humans on earth in general
share a set of like how many frameworks

2298
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,010
share a set of like how many frameworks
 

2299
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,280
share a set of like how many frameworks
are there I mean it depends on how you

2300
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,290
are there I mean it depends on how you
 

2301
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,200
are there I mean it depends on how you
bound them right so in other words how

2302
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:39,210
bound them right so in other words how
 

2303
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,090
bound them right so in other words how
big or small like their their individual

2304
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:41,100
big or small like their their individual
 

2305
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,760
big or small like their their individual
scope but there's lots and there are new

2306
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:43,770
scope but there's lots and there are new
 

2307
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,070
scope but there's lots and there are new
ones I think they're I think the way I

2308
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:46,080
ones I think they're I think the way I
 

2309
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,420
ones I think they're I think the way I
think about is kind of an a layer I

2310
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:47,430
think about is kind of an a layer I
 

2311
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,770
think about is kind of an a layer I
think that the architectures are being

2312
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:48,780
think that the architectures are being
 

2313
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,350
think that the architectures are being
layered in that there's there's a small

2314
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:51,360
layered in that there's there's a small
 

2315
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,110
layered in that there's there's a small
set of primitives that allow you the

2316
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:54,120
set of primitives that allow you the
 

2317
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,540
set of primitives that allow you the
foundation to build frameworks and then

2318
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:56,550
foundation to build frameworks and then
 

2319
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,130
foundation to build frameworks and then
there may be you know many frameworks

2320
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:58,140
there may be you know many frameworks
 

2321
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,080
there may be you know many frameworks
but you have the ability to acquire them

2322
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,090
but you have the ability to acquire them
 

2323
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,940
but you have the ability to acquire them
and then you have the ability to reuse

2324
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:01,950
and then you have the ability to reuse
 

2325
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:04,490
and then you have the ability to reuse
them I mean one of the most compelling

2326
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:04,500
them I mean one of the most compelling
 

2327
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,080
them I mean one of the most compelling
ways of thinking about this is or

2328
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,090
ways of thinking about this is or
 

2329
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,760
ways of thinking about this is or
reasoning by analogy where I could say

2330
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:07,770
reasoning by analogy where I could say
 

2331
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,050
reasoning by analogy where I could say
oh wow I've learned something very

2332
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:09,060
oh wow I've learned something very
 

2333
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,440
oh wow I've learned something very
similar you know I never heard of this I

2334
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:12,450
similar you know I never heard of this I
 

2335
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:16,100
similar you know I never heard of this I
never heard of this game soccer but if

2336
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,110
never heard of this game soccer but if
 

2337
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,810
never heard of this game soccer but if
it's like basketball in the sense that

2338
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:17,820
it's like basketball in the sense that
 

2339
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,090
it's like basketball in the sense that
the goals like the hoop and I have to

2340
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:20,100
the goals like the hoop and I have to
 

2341
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,350
the goals like the hoop and I have to
get the ball in the hoop and I have

2342
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:21,360
get the ball in the hoop and I have
 

2343
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,630
get the ball in the hoop and I have
guards and I have this and I have that

2344
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
guards and I have this and I have that
 

2345
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,610
guards and I have this and I have that
like we're weird is the where where are

2346
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:25,620
like we're weird is the where where are
 

2347
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,870
like we're weird is the where where are
the similarities and where the

2348
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
the similarities and where the
 

2349
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,400
the similarities and where the
difference is and I have a foundation

2350
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:28,410
difference is and I have a foundation
 

2351
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,080
difference is and I have a foundation
now for interpreting this new

2352
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,090
now for interpreting this new
 

2353
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,180
now for interpreting this new
information and then the different

2354
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:32,190
information and then the different
 

2355
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,580
information and then the different
groups like the Millennials will have a

2356
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,590
groups like the Millennials will have a
 

2357
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:37,520
groups like the Millennials will have a
framework and then and then well that

2358
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:37,530
framework and then and then well that
 

2359
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:40,490
framework and then and then well that
you never you know yeah well Kratz and

2360
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:40,500
you never you know yeah well Kratz and
 

2361
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,270
you never you know yeah well Kratz and
Republicans

2362
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
Republicans
 

2363
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,650
Republicans
well I Neal's nobody wants that

2364
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:42,660
well I Neal's nobody wants that
 

2365
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,390
well I Neal's nobody wants that
framework well I mean I think

2366
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
framework well I mean I think
 

2367
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,370
framework well I mean I think
understands it right I mean you're

2368
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:46,380
understands it right I mean you're
 

2369
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,930
understands it right I mean you're
talking about political and social ways

2370
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:47,940
talking about political and social ways
 

2371
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,280
talking about political and social ways
of interpreting the world around them

2372
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,290
of interpreting the world around them
 

2373
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,350
of interpreting the world around them
and I think these frameworks are still

2374
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:51,360
and I think these frameworks are still
 

2375
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,060
and I think these frameworks are still
largely largely similar I think they

2376
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,070
largely largely similar I think they
 

2377
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,430
largely largely similar I think they
differ in maybe what some fundamental

2378
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:55,440
differ in maybe what some fundamental
 

2379
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,730
differ in maybe what some fundamental
assumptions and values are now from a

2380
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:58,740
assumptions and values are now from a
 

2381
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,530
assumptions and values are now from a
reasoning perspective like the ability

2382
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:00,540
reasoning perspective like the ability
 

2383
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,690
reasoning perspective like the ability
to process the framework of Magna might

2384
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:02,700
to process the framework of Magna might
 

2385
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,880
to process the framework of Magna might
not be that different the implications

2386
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:04,890
not be that different the implications
 

2387
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,620
not be that different the implications
of different fundamental values or

2388
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:06,630
of different fundamental values or
 

2389
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:07,790
of different fundamental values or
fundamental assumptions in those

2390
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:07,800
fundamental assumptions in those
 

2391
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,280
fundamental assumptions in those
framework frameworks may reach very

2392
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:10,290
framework frameworks may reach very
 

2393
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,340
framework frameworks may reach very
different conclusions so from so from a

2394
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:13,350
different conclusions so from so from a
 

2395
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,530
different conclusions so from so from a
social perspective that conclusions may

2396
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:15,540
social perspective that conclusions may
 

2397
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,660
social perspective that conclusions may
be very different from an intelligence

2398
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:17,670
be very different from an intelligence
 

2399
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,850
be very different from an intelligence
perspective I you know I just followed

2400
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:19,860
perspective I you know I just followed
 

2401
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,830
perspective I you know I just followed
where my assumptions took me yeah the

2402
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:21,840
where my assumptions took me yeah the
 

2403
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,090
where my assumptions took me yeah the
product the process itself would look

2404
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:23,100
product the process itself would look
 

2405
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,710
product the process itself would look
similar but that's a fascinating idea

2406
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:24,720
similar but that's a fascinating idea
 

2407
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:31,040
similar but that's a fascinating idea
that frameworks really helped carve how

2408
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,050
that frameworks really helped carve how
 

2409
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,740
that frameworks really helped carve how
a statement will be interpreted

2410
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:33,750
a statement will be interpreted
 

2411
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,530
a statement will be interpreted
I mean having a Democrat and the

2412
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:36,540
I mean having a Democrat and the
 

2413
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:41,390
I mean having a Democrat and the
Republican framework and read the exact

2414
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:41,400
Republican framework and read the exact
 

2415
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,980
Republican framework and read the exact
same statement and the conclusions that

2416
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:42,990
same statement and the conclusions that
 

2417
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,020
same statement and the conclusions that
you derive would be totally different

2418
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,030
you derive would be totally different
 

2419
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,240
you derive would be totally different
from an ad respective is fascinating

2420
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:47,250
from an ad respective is fascinating
 

2421
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,670
from an ad respective is fascinating
what we would want out of the AI is to

2422
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:49,680
what we would want out of the AI is to
 

2423
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,680
what we would want out of the AI is to
be able to tell you that this

2424
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:51,690
be able to tell you that this
 

2425
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,140
be able to tell you that this
perspective one perspective one set of

2426
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,150
perspective one perspective one set of
 

2427
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,550
perspective one perspective one set of
assumptions is going to lead you here in

2428
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:55,560
assumptions is going to lead you here in
 

2429
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,080
assumptions is going to lead you here in
other setups as luncheons is gonna leave

2430
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,090
other setups as luncheons is gonna leave
 

2431
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:00,260
other setups as luncheons is gonna leave
you there and to and in fact you know to

2432
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:00,270
you there and to and in fact you know to
 

2433
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,910
you there and to and in fact you know to
help people reason and say oh I see

2434
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
help people reason and say oh I see
 

2435
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,340
help people reason and say oh I see
where I see where our differences lie

2436
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:04,350
where I see where our differences lie
 

2437
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,080
where I see where our differences lie
yeah you know I have this fundamental

2438
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,090
yeah you know I have this fundamental
 

2439
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,130
yeah you know I have this fundamental
belief about that I have this

2440
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:07,140
belief about that I have this
 

2441
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,320
belief about that I have this
fundamental belief about that yeah

2442
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:09,330
fundamental belief about that yeah
 

2443
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,340
fundamental belief about that yeah
that's quite brilliant from my

2444
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:10,350
that's quite brilliant from my
 

2445
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,040
that's quite brilliant from my
perspective and NLP there's this idea

2446
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,050
perspective and NLP there's this idea
 

2447
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,330
perspective and NLP there's this idea
that there's one way to really

2448
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:14,340
that there's one way to really
 

2449
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,600
that there's one way to really
understand a statement but there

2450
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:17,610
understand a statement but there
 

2451
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:19,280
understand a statement but there
probably isn't there's probably an

2452
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:19,290
probably isn't there's probably an
 

2453
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,480
probably isn't there's probably an
infinite number of ways then just as

2454
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:20,490
infinite number of ways then just as
 

2455
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,740
infinite number of ways then just as
well well there's a lot finding on

2456
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:21,750
well well there's a lot finding on
 

2457
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,550
well well there's a lot finding on
there's lots of different

2458
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:22,560
there's lots of different
 

2459
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,880
there's lots of different
interpretations and the you know the the

2460
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:25,890
interpretations and the you know the the
 

2461
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,890
interpretations and the you know the the
broader you know the broader to the the

2462
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:27,900
broader you know the broader to the the
 

2463
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,540
broader you know the broader to the the
contents the richer it is and so you

2464
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:32,550
contents the richer it is and so you
 

2465
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,310
contents the richer it is and so you
know you you and I can have very

2466
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:34,320
know you you and I can have very
 

2467
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,140
know you you and I can have very
different experiences with the same text

2468
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:36,150
different experiences with the same text
 

2469
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,070
different experiences with the same text
obviously and if we're committed to

2470
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:40,080
obviously and if we're committed to
 

2471
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,340
obviously and if we're committed to
understanding each other we start and

2472
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:43,350
understanding each other we start and
 

2473
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,930
understanding each other we start and
that's the other important point like if

2474
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:44,940
that's the other important point like if
 

2475
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,880
that's the other important point like if
we're committed to understanding each

2476
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:46,890
we're committed to understanding each
 

2477
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:50,060
we're committed to understanding each
other we start decomposing and breaking

2478
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:50,070
other we start decomposing and breaking
 

2479
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,310
other we start decomposing and breaking
down our interpretation towards more and

2480
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:52,320
down our interpretation towards more and
 

2481
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,680
down our interpretation towards more and
more primitive components until we get

2482
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:54,690
more primitive components until we get
 

2483
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,660
more primitive components until we get
to that point where we say oh I see why

2484
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:56,670
to that point where we say oh I see why
 

2485
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,780
to that point where we say oh I see why
we disagree and we try to understand how

2486
00:50:59,780 --> 00:50:59,790
we disagree and we try to understand how
 

2487
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,550
we disagree and we try to understand how
fundamental that disagreement really is

2488
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:01,560
fundamental that disagreement really is
 

2489
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,730
fundamental that disagreement really is
but that requires a commitment to

2490
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:04,740
but that requires a commitment to
 

2491
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,560
but that requires a commitment to
breaking down that interpretation in

2492
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:06,570
breaking down that interpretation in
 

2493
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,360
breaking down that interpretation in
terms of that framework in a logical way

2494
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:08,370
terms of that framework in a logical way
 

2495
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,970
terms of that framework in a logical way
otherwise you know and this is why I

2496
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:10,980
otherwise you know and this is why I
 

2497
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,160
otherwise you know and this is why I
like I think of a eyes is really

2498
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:13,170
like I think of a eyes is really
 

2499
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,020
like I think of a eyes is really
complementing and helping human

2500
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,030
complementing and helping human
 

2501
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,120
complementing and helping human
intelligence to overcome some of its

intelligence to overcome some of its
 

2503
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,120
intelligence to overcome some of its
biases and its predisposition to be

00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:23,790
persuaded by you know buys but more
 

2507
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,700
persuaded by you know buys but more
shallow reasoning in the sense that like

2508
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:25,710
shallow reasoning in the sense that like
 

2509
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,620
shallow reasoning in the sense that like
we get over this idea well I you know

2510
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:27,630
we get over this idea well I you know
 

2511
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,510
we get over this idea well I you know
you know I'm right because I'm a

you know I'm right because I'm a

you know I'm right because I'm a

machine can help us break that argument

2522
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:38,310
machine can help us break that argument
 

2523
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:41,000
machine can help us break that argument
down and say wait a second you know what

2524
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,010
down and say wait a second you know what
 

2525
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,460
down and say wait a second you know what
do you really think about this right so

2526
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:42,470
do you really think about this right so
 

2527
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,590
do you really think about this right so
essentially holding us accountable to

2528
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:45,600
essentially holding us accountable to
 

2529
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,690
essentially holding us accountable to
doing more critical thinking

2530
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:47,700
doing more critical thinking
 

2531
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,310
doing more critical thinking
to sit and think about that as fast

2532
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:49,320
to sit and think about that as fast
 

2533
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,770
to sit and think about that as fast
that's I love that I think that's really

2534
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:51,780
that's I love that I think that's really
 

2535
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,290
that's I love that I think that's really
empowering use of AI for the public

00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:54,300
empowering use of AI for the public

of the greatest accomplishments in the
history of AI is Watson competing

2546
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:11,430
history of AI is Watson competing
 

2547
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,220
history of AI is Watson competing
against in a game of Jeopardy against

00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:13,230
against in a game of Jeopardy against
 

2549
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,910
against in a game of Jeopardy against
humans and you were a lead in that

2550
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:16,920
humans and you were a lead in that
 

2551
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,370
humans and you were a lead in that
accrue at a critical part of that let's

2552
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:19,380
accrue at a critical part of that let's
 

2553
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,290
accrue at a critical part of that let's
start the very basics what is the game

2554
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:21,300
start the very basics what is the game
 

2555
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,710
start the very basics what is the game
of Jeopardy the game for us humans human

2556
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:24,720
of Jeopardy the game for us humans human
 

2557
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,630
of Jeopardy the game for us humans human
versus human right so it's to take a

2558
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:28,640
versus human right so it's to take a
 

2559
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:37,400
versus human right so it's to take a
question and answer it actually no but

2560
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:37,410
question and answer it actually no but
 

2561
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,589
question and answer it actually no but
it's not right it's really not it's

2562
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:39,599
it's not right it's really not it's
 

2563
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,540
it's not right it's really not it's
really it's really to get a question and

2564
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:41,550
really it's really to get a question and
 

2565
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,220
really it's really to get a question and
answer but it's what we call a factoid

2566
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:43,230
answer but it's what we call a factoid
 

2567
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,560
answer but it's what we call a factoid
questions so this notion of like it's it

2568
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:45,570
questions so this notion of like it's it
 

2569
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:46,940
questions so this notion of like it's it
really relates to some fact that

2570
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:46,950
really relates to some fact that
 

2571
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,890
really relates to some fact that
everything few people would argue

2572
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:48,900
everything few people would argue
 

2573
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,599
everything few people would argue
whether the facts are true or not in

2574
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:50,609
whether the facts are true or not in
 

2575
00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:52,130
whether the facts are true or not in
fact most people what and jeopardy kind

2576
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:52,140
fact most people what and jeopardy kind
 

2577
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,200
fact most people what and jeopardy kind
of counts on the idea that these these

2578
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,210
of counts on the idea that these these
 

2579
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:59,530
of counts on the idea that these these
statements have factual answers and and

2580
00:52:59,530 --> 00:52:59,540
statements have factual answers and and
 

2581
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,300
statements have factual answers and and
the idea is to first of all determine

2582
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,310
the idea is to first of all determine
 

2583
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,890
the idea is to first of all determine
whether or not you know the answer which

2584
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:03,900
whether or not you know the answer which
 

2585
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,559
whether or not you know the answer which
is sort of an interesting twist so first

2586
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:06,569
is sort of an interesting twist so first
 

2587
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:08,000
is sort of an interesting twist so first
of all understand the question you have

2588
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,010
of all understand the question you have
 

2589
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:09,109
of all understand the question you have
to understand the question what is it

2590
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
to understand the question what is it
 

2591
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,849
to understand the question what is it
asking and that's a good point because

2592
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:10,859
asking and that's a good point because
 

2593
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:13,970
asking and that's a good point because
the questions are not asked directly

2594
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:13,980
the questions are not asked directly
 

2595
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,890
the questions are not asked directly
right they're all like the way the

2596
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:15,900
right they're all like the way the
 

2597
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,470
right they're all like the way the
questions are asked is nonlinear it's

2598
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:18,480
questions are asked is nonlinear it's
 

2599
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,839
questions are asked is nonlinear it's
like it's a little bit witty it's a

2600
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:20,849
like it's a little bit witty it's a
 

2601
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:23,660
like it's a little bit witty it's a
little bit playful sometimes it's a it's

2602
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:23,670
little bit playful sometimes it's a it's
 

2603
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,510
little bit playful sometimes it's a it's
a little bit tricky yeah they're asked

2604
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:26,520
a little bit tricky yeah they're asked
 

2605
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,089
a little bit tricky yeah they're asked
and exactly in numerous witty tricky

2606
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:29,099
and exactly in numerous witty tricky
 

2607
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:31,910
and exactly in numerous witty tricky
ways exactly what they're asking is not

2608
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:31,920
ways exactly what they're asking is not
 

2609
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,309
ways exactly what they're asking is not
obvious it takes it takes an experienced

2610
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:34,319
obvious it takes it takes an experienced
 

2611
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,839
obvious it takes it takes an experienced
humans a while to go what is it even

2612
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:35,849
humans a while to go what is it even
 

2613
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,730
humans a while to go what is it even
asking right and it's sort of an

2614
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:37,740
asking right and it's sort of an
 

2615
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,500
asking right and it's sort of an
interesting realization that you have

2616
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:39,510
interesting realization that you have
 

2617
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,420
interesting realization that you have
was a missus Oh what's the Jeopardy is a

2618
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:41,430
was a missus Oh what's the Jeopardy is a
 

2619
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,950
was a missus Oh what's the Jeopardy is a
question answering Shou and there's a go

2620
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:42,960
question answering Shou and there's a go
 

2621
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,450
question answering Shou and there's a go
like I know a lot and then you read it

2622
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:44,460
like I know a lot and then you read it
 

2623
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,010
like I know a lot and then you read it
and you're you're still trying to

2624
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:46,020
and you're you're still trying to
 

2625
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,690
and you're you're still trying to
process the question and the champions

2626
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:47,700
process the question and the champions
 

2627
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,640
process the question and the champions
have answered and moved on there's like

2628
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:49,650
have answered and moved on there's like
 

2629
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,829
have answered and moved on there's like
there's three questions ahead at the

2630
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
there's three questions ahead at the
 

2631
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,150
there's three questions ahead at the
time you figured out what the question

2632
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:53,160
time you figured out what the question
 

2633
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,069
time you figured out what the question
even met so there's there's definitely

2634
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:55,079
even met so there's there's definitely
 

2635
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:57,829
even met so there's there's definitely
an ability there to just parse out what

2636
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
an ability there to just parse out what
 

2637
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,809
an ability there to just parse out what
the question even is so that was

2638
00:53:59,809 --> 00:53:59,819
the question even is so that was
 

2639
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,230
the question even is so that was
certainly challenging it's

2640
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:01,240
certainly challenging it's
 

2641
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,370
certainly challenging it's
interesting historically though if you

2642
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:02,380
interesting historically though if you
 

2643
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,620
interesting historically though if you
look back at the jeopardy games much

2644
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:04,630
look back at the jeopardy games much
 

2645
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:05,430
look back at the jeopardy games much
earlier

2646
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
earlier
 

2647
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,220
earlier
you know 63 yeah and I think the

2648
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:08,230
you know 63 yeah and I think the
 

2649
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,290
you know 63 yeah and I think the
questions were much more direct it

2650
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:10,300
questions were much more direct it
 

2651
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,790
questions were much more direct it
weren't quite like that they got sort of

2652
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:11,800
weren't quite like that they got sort of
 

2653
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,160
weren't quite like that they got sort of
more and more interesting the way they

2654
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,170
more and more interesting the way they
 

2655
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,359
more and more interesting the way they
asked them that sort of got more and

2656
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:15,369
asked them that sort of got more and
 

2657
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:18,270
asked them that sort of got more and
more interesting and subtle and nuanced

2658
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:18,280
more interesting and subtle and nuanced
 

2659
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,940
more interesting and subtle and nuanced
and humorous and witty over time which

2660
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:20,950
and humorous and witty over time which
 

2661
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,920
and humorous and witty over time which
really required the human to kind of

2662
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:22,930
really required the human to kind of
 

2663
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,660
really required the human to kind of
make the right connections and figuring

2664
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:24,670
make the right connections and figuring
 

2665
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,970
make the right connections and figuring
out what the question was even asking so

2666
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:26,980
out what the question was even asking so
 

2667
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,960
out what the question was even asking so
yeah you have to figure out the

2668
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:27,970
yeah you have to figure out the
 

2669
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:31,050
yeah you have to figure out the
questions even asking then you have to

2670
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:31,060
questions even asking then you have to
 

2671
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,670
questions even asking then you have to
determine whether or not you think you

2672
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:32,680
determine whether or not you think you
 

2673
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,300
determine whether or not you think you
know the answer and because you have to

2674
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:36,310
know the answer and because you have to
 

2675
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,800
know the answer and because you have to
buzz in really quickly you sort of have

2676
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:37,810
buzz in really quickly you sort of have
 

2677
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,470
buzz in really quickly you sort of have
to make that determination as quickly as

2678
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:40,480
to make that determination as quickly as
 

2679
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,090
to make that determination as quickly as
you possibly can otherwise you lose the

2680
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,100
you possibly can otherwise you lose the
 

2681
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,890
you possibly can otherwise you lose the
opportunity buzz in you've been going

2682
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:43,900
opportunity buzz in you've been going
 

2683
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,720
opportunity buzz in you've been going
before you really know if you know the

2684
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:45,730
before you really know if you know the
 

2685
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,070
before you really know if you know the
answer I think well I think a lot of

2686
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:47,080
answer I think well I think a lot of
 

2687
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,230
answer I think well I think a lot of
humans will will assume they'll they'll

look at the look at their process of

2690
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:52,060
look at the look at their process of
 

2691
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,180
look at the look at their process of
very superficially in other words what's

00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:54,190
very superficially in other words what's
 

2693
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,040
very superficially in other words what's
the topic what are some key words and

2694
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:56,050
the topic what are some key words and
 

2695
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,140
the topic what are some key words and
just say do I know this area or not

2696
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:58,150
just say do I know this area or not
 

2697
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,900
just say do I know this area or not
before they actually know the answer

2698
00:54:59,900 --> 00:54:59,910
before they actually know the answer
 

2699
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,280
before they actually know the answer
then they'll buzz in and then I'll buzz

2700
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:02,290
then they'll buzz in and then I'll buzz
 

2701
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,510
then they'll buzz in and then I'll buzz
in and think about it it's interesting

2702
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:03,520
in and think about it it's interesting
 

2703
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,849
in and think about it it's interesting
what humans do now some people who know

how many of all the Jeopardy questions
 

2727
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,290
how many of all the Jeopardy questions
you know how many did could we even find

2728
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:31,300
you know how many did could we even find
 

2729
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,510
you know how many did could we even find
like find the right answer for like

like find the right answer for like
 

2731
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,280
like find the right answer for like
anywhere like could we come up with if

2732
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,290
anywhere like could we come up with if
 

2733
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,740
anywhere like could we come up with if
we look you know we had up a big body of

2734
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:37,750
we look you know we had up a big body of
 

2735
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,000
we look you know we had up a big body of
knowledge some of the order of several

2736
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,010
knowledge some of the order of several

terabytes I mean from from a web scale

2738
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:41,410
terabytes I mean from from a web scale
 

2739
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,620
terabytes I mean from from a web scale
was actually very small but from like a

2740
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:43,630
was actually very small but from like a
 

2741
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,420

book scales talking about millions in
 

2743
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,070
book scales talking about millions in
bucks right so the equivalent millions

2744
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:47,080
bucks right so the equivalent millions
 

2745
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,770

books it's a ton of information and you

2748
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:52,630
books it's a ton of information and you
 

2749
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,500
books it's a ton of information and you
know for I think was 80 only 85% was the

00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:55,510
know for I think was 80 only 85% was the
 

2751
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,720
know for I think was 80 only 85% was the
answer anywhere to be found hmm so

2752
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:57,730
answer anywhere to be found hmm so
 

2753
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,910
answer anywhere to be found hmm so
you're ready down you're ready down at

2754
00:55:59,910 --> 00:55:59,920
you're ready down you're ready down at
 

2755
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,380
you're ready down you're ready down at
that level just to get just to get

2756
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:01,390
that level just to get just to get
 

2757
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:05,310
that level just to get just to get
started right so and so was important to

2758
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:05,320
started right so and so was important to
 

2759
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,760
started right so and so was important to
get a very quick sense of do you think

2760
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:08,770
get a very quick sense of do you think
 

2761
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:09,630
get a very quick sense of do you think
you know the right answer to this

2762
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:09,640
you know the right answer to this
 

2763
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,040
you know the right answer to this
question so we have to compute that

2764
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,050
question so we have to compute that
 

2765
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,320
question so we have to compute that
confidence as quickly as we possibly

2766
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:13,330
confidence as quickly as we possibly
 

2767
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:15,210
confidence as quickly as we possibly
could so it's in effect

2768
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:15,220
could so it's in effect
 

2769
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:19,650
could so it's in effect
to answer it and at least you know spend

2770
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:19,660
to answer it and at least you know spend
 

2771
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,690
to answer it and at least you know spend
some time essentially answering it and

2772
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:21,700
some time essentially answering it and
 

2773
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,390
some time essentially answering it and
then judging the confidence that we you

2774
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:24,400
then judging the confidence that we you
 

2775
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,370
then judging the confidence that we you
know that that our answer was right and

2776
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:26,380
know that that our answer was right and
 

2777
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,290
know that that our answer was right and
in deciding whether or not we were

2778
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:28,300
in deciding whether or not we were
 

2779
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,240
in deciding whether or not we were
confident enough to buzz in and that

2780
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:30,250
confident enough to buzz in and that
 

2781
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,589
confident enough to buzz in and that
would depend on what else was going on

2782
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:31,599
would depend on what else was going on
 

2783
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,550
would depend on what else was going on
in the game it could because it was a

2784
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:32,560
in the game it could because it was a
 

2785
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,470
in the game it could because it was a
risk so like if you're really in a

2786
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:34,480
risk so like if you're really in a
 

2787
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,720
risk so like if you're really in a
situation where I have to take a gas I

2788
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:36,730
situation where I have to take a gas I
 

2789
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,620
situation where I have to take a gas I
have very little to lose

2790
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:37,630
have very little to lose
 

2791
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,810
have very little to lose
then you'll buzz in with less confidence

2792
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:39,820
then you'll buzz in with less confidence
 

2793
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,970
then you'll buzz in with less confidence
so that was the counter for the the

2794
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:41,980
so that was the counter for the the
 

2795
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,410
so that was the counter for the the
financial standings of the different

2796
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:43,420
financial standings of the different
 

2797
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,900
financial standings of the different
competitors cracks yeah how much of the

2798
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:45,910
competitors cracks yeah how much of the
 

2799
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,250
competitors cracks yeah how much of the
game was laughs how much time was left

2800
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:47,260
game was laughs how much time was left
 

2801
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,500
game was laughs how much time was left
and where were you were in the standings

2802
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:49,510
and where were you were in the standings
 

2803
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:52,080
and where were you were in the standings
things like that what how many hundreds

2804
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,090
things like that what how many hundreds
 

2805
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:53,490
things like that what how many hundreds
of milliseconds that we're talking about

2806
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:53,500
of milliseconds that we're talking about
 

2807
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,099
of milliseconds that we're talking about
here do you have a sense of what is we

2808
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:56,109
here do you have a sense of what is we
 

2809
00:56:56,109 --> 00:56:58,290
here do you have a sense of what is we
targets because we yeah was the targeted

2810
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:58,300
targets because we yeah was the targeted
 

2811
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,170
targets because we yeah was the targeted
so I mean we targeted answering and

2812
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:01,180
so I mean we targeted answering and
 

2813
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:05,580
so I mean we targeted answering and
under three seconds and buzzing it so

2814
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:05,590
under three seconds and buzzing it so
 

2815
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,820
under three seconds and buzzing it so
the decision to buzz in and then the

2816
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:08,830
the decision to buzz in and then the
 

2817
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:11,280
the decision to buzz in and then the
actual answering are those two yes there

2818
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:11,290
actual answering are those two yes there
 

2819
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,390
actual answering are those two yes there
were two there were two different things

2820
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:12,400
were two there were two different things
 

2821
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,820
were two there were two different things
in fact we had multiple stages whereas

2822
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:14,830
in fact we had multiple stages whereas
 

2823
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,890
in fact we had multiple stages whereas
like we would say let's estimate our

2824
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:16,900
like we would say let's estimate our
 

2825
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,480
like we would say let's estimate our
confidence which which is sort of a

2826
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:18,490
confidence which which is sort of a
 

2827
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:21,510
confidence which which is sort of a
shallow answering process and then

2828
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:21,520
shallow answering process and then
 

2829
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,310
shallow answering process and then
ultimate and then ultimately decide to

2830
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:23,320
ultimate and then ultimately decide to
 

2831
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,050
ultimate and then ultimately decide to
buzz in and then we may take another

2832
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:25,060
buzz in and then we may take another
 

2833
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,500
buzz in and then we may take another
second or something it's kind of go in

2834
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:28,510
second or something it's kind of go in
 

2835
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:31,470
second or something it's kind of go in
there and and do that but by and large

2836
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:31,480
there and and do that but by and large
 

2837
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,599
there and and do that but by and large
we're saying like we can't play the game

2838
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:33,609
we're saying like we can't play the game
 

2839
00:57:33,609 --> 00:57:36,810
we're saying like we can't play the game
we can't even compete if we can't on

2840
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:36,820
we can't even compete if we can't on
 

2841
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,640
we can't even compete if we can't on
average answer these questions and

2842
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:38,650
average answer these questions and
 

2843
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,140
average answer these questions and
around three seconds or less

2844
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:40,150
around three seconds or less
 

2845
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,210
around three seconds or less
so you stepped in so there's this

2846
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:42,220
so you stepped in so there's this
 

2847
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,250
so you stepped in so there's this
there's these three humans playing a

2848
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:44,260
there's these three humans playing a
 

2849
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,890
there's these three humans playing a
game and you stepped in with the idea

2850
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:46,900
game and you stepped in with the idea
 

2851
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,260
game and you stepped in with the idea
that IBM Watson would be one of replaced

2852
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:49,270
that IBM Watson would be one of replaced
 

2853
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,700
that IBM Watson would be one of replaced
one of the humans and compete against

2854
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:50,710
one of the humans and compete against
 

2855
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:54,960
one of the humans and compete against
two can you tell the story of Watson

2856
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:54,970
two can you tell the story of Watson
 

2857
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,420
two can you tell the story of Watson
taking on this game sure seems

2858
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:57,430
taking on this game sure seems
 

2859
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,820
taking on this game sure seems
exceptionally difficult yeah so the

2860
00:57:59,820 --> 00:57:59,830
exceptionally difficult yeah so the
 

2861
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:03,089
exceptionally difficult yeah so the
story was that um it was or it was

2862
00:58:03,089 --> 00:58:03,099
story was that um it was or it was
 

2863
00:58:03,099 --> 00:58:04,410
story was that um it was or it was
coming up I think the 10-year

2864
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:04,420
coming up I think the 10-year
 

2865
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,920
coming up I think the 10-year
anniversary of a big blue an optical

2866
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:07,930
anniversary of a big blue an optical
 

2867
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,170
anniversary of a big blue an optical
deep blues IBM wanted to do sort of

2868
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:10,180
deep blues IBM wanted to do sort of
 

2869
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,210
deep blues IBM wanted to do sort of
another kind of really you know fun

2870
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:12,220
another kind of really you know fun
 

2871
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,520
another kind of really you know fun
challenge public challenge that can

2872
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:14,530
challenge public challenge that can
 

2873
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,530
challenge public challenge that can
bring attention to IBM research and the

2874
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:16,540
bring attention to IBM research and the
 

2875
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,520
bring attention to IBM research and the
kind of cool stuff that we were doing

2876
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,530
kind of cool stuff that we were doing
 

2877
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,520
kind of cool stuff that we were doing
I had been working in an AI at IBM for

2878
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:22,530
I had been working in an AI at IBM for
 

2879
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:26,090
I had been working in an AI at IBM for
some time I had a team doing what's

2880
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:26,100
some time I had a team doing what's
 

2881
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,920
some time I had a team doing what's
called open domain factoids

2882
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:27,930
called open domain factoids
 

2883
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,660
called open domain factoids
question-answering which is you know

2884
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:29,670
question-answering which is you know
 

2885
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:30,470
question-answering which is you know
we're not gonna tell you what the

2886
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:30,480
we're not gonna tell you what the
 

2887
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,610
we're not gonna tell you what the
questions are we're not even gonna tell

2888
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:31,620
questions are we're not even gonna tell
 

2889
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,930
questions are we're not even gonna tell
you what they're about

2890
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:32,940
you what they're about
 

2891
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,240
you what they're about
can you go off and get accurate answers

2892
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:35,250
can you go off and get accurate answers
 

2893
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,720
can you go off and get accurate answers
to these questions and it was an area of

2894
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:38,730
to these questions and it was an area of
 

2895
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,030
to these questions and it was an area of
AI research that I was involved in and

2896
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
AI research that I was involved in and
 

2897
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,130
AI research that I was involved in and
so it was a big Pat it was a very

2898
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:43,140
so it was a big Pat it was a very
 

2899
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,600
so it was a big Pat it was a very
specific passion of mine language

2900
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:44,610
specific passion of mine language
 

2901
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,070
specific passion of mine language
understanding and always always been a

2902
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:46,080
understanding and always always been a
 

2903
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,650
understanding and always always been a
passion of mine one sort of narrow slice

2904
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:48,660
passion of mine one sort of narrow slice
 

2905
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,510
passion of mine one sort of narrow slice
on whether or not you could do anything

2906
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:50,520
on whether or not you could do anything
 

2907
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,130
on whether or not you could do anything
was language was this notion of open

2908
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:52,140
was language was this notion of open
 

2909
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,780
was language was this notion of open
domain and meaning I could ask anything

2910
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:53,790
domain and meaning I could ask anything
 

2911
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,410
domain and meaning I could ask anything
about anything

2912
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:54,420
about anything
 

2913
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,540
about anything
factoids meaning it essentially had an

2914
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:56,550
factoids meaning it essentially had an
 

2915
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,600
factoids meaning it essentially had an
answer and and you know being able to do

2916
00:58:59,600 --> 00:58:59,610
answer and and you know being able to do
 

2917
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,520
answer and and you know being able to do
that accurately and quickly so that was

2918
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:01,530
that accurately and quickly so that was
 

2919
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:03,110
that accurately and quickly so that was
a research area that might even already

2920
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:03,120
a research area that might even already
 

2921
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,710
a research area that might even already
been in and so completely independently

2922
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:05,720
been in and so completely independently
 

2923
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,030
been in and so completely independently
several you know IBM exactly there's

2924
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:08,040
several you know IBM exactly there's
 

2925
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,320
several you know IBM exactly there's
like what are we gonna do what's the

2926
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:09,330
like what are we gonna do what's the
 

2927
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:11,900
like what are we gonna do what's the
next cool thing to do and Ken Jennings

2928
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:11,910
next cool thing to do and Ken Jennings
 

2929
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,360
next cool thing to do and Ken Jennings
was on his winning streak this was like

2930
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:14,370
was on his winning streak this was like
 

2931
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,180
was on his winning streak this was like
whatever was 2004 I think was on his win

2932
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:17,190
whatever was 2004 I think was on his win
 

2933
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:20,030
whatever was 2004 I think was on his win
winning streak when someone thought hey

2934
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:20,040
winning streak when someone thought hey
 

2935
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,370
winning streak when someone thought hey
that'd be really cool um if the computer

2936
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:22,380
that'd be really cool um if the computer
 

2937
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:25,070
that'd be really cool um if the computer
can play jeopardy and so this was like

2938
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:25,080
can play jeopardy and so this was like
 

2939
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,780
can play jeopardy and so this was like
in 2004 they were shopping this thing

2940
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:26,790
in 2004 they were shopping this thing
 

2941
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:29,570
in 2004 they were shopping this thing
around and everyone who's telling the

2942
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:29,580
around and everyone who's telling the
 

2943
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:34,070
around and everyone who's telling the
the research execs no way like this is

2944
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,080
the research execs no way like this is
 

2945
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,640
the research execs no way like this is
crazy

2946
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:34,650
crazy
 

2947
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,440
crazy
and we had some pretty you know senior

2948
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:36,450
and we had some pretty you know senior
 

2949
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:37,430
and we had some pretty you know senior
people know if you'll understand the

2950
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:37,440
people know if you'll understand the
 

2951
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,110
people know if you'll understand the
others crazy and he'll come across my

2952
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:39,120
others crazy and he'll come across my
 

2953
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,000
others crazy and he'll come across my
desk and I was like but that's kind of

2954
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,010
desk and I was like but that's kind of
 

2955
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,800
desk and I was like but that's kind of
what what I'm really interested in doing

2956
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:42,810
what what I'm really interested in doing
 

2957
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:46,160
what what I'm really interested in doing
and but there was such this prevailing

2958
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:46,170
and but there was such this prevailing
 

2959
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,900
and but there was such this prevailing
sense of this is nots we're not going to

2960
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:47,910
sense of this is nots we're not going to
 

2961
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,700
sense of this is nots we're not going to
risk IBM's reputation on this we're just

2962
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:49,710
risk IBM's reputation on this we're just
 

2963
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,770
risk IBM's reputation on this we're just
not doing it and this happened in 2004

2964
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:51,780
not doing it and this happened in 2004
 

2965
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:56,050
not doing it and this happened in 2004
it happened in 2005 at the end of 2006

2966
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:56,060
it happened in 2005 at the end of 2006
 

2967
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,810
it happened in 2005 at the end of 2006
it was coming around again and I was

2968
00:59:59,810 --> 00:59:59,820
it was coming around again and I was
 

2969
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,790
it was coming around again and I was
coming off of a I was doing that the

2970
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:01,800
coming off of a I was doing that the
 

2971
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,170
coming off of a I was doing that the
open domain question-answering stuff but

2972
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:03,180
open domain question-answering stuff but
 

2973
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,480
open domain question-answering stuff but
I was coming off a couple other projects

2974
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:05,490
I was coming off a couple other projects
 

2975
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:07,730
I was coming off a couple other projects
I had a lot more time to put into this

2976
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:07,740
I had a lot more time to put into this
 

2977
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,460
I had a lot more time to put into this
and I argued that it could be done and I

2978
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:10,470
and I argued that it could be done and I
 

2979
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,560
and I argued that it could be done and I
argue it would be crazy not to do this

2980
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:12,570
argue it would be crazy not to do this
 

2981
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,460
argue it would be crazy not to do this
can I

2982
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:13,470
can I
 

2983
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:16,010
can I
you could be honest at this point so

2984
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:16,020
you could be honest at this point so
 

2985
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,200
you could be honest at this point so
even though you argued for it what's the

2986
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:18,210
even though you argued for it what's the
 

2987
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:19,690
even though you argued for it what's the
confidence that you had yourself

2988
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:19,700
confidence that you had yourself
 

2989
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,200
confidence that you had yourself
privately that this could be done it was

2990
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:23,210
privately that this could be done it was
 

2991
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:25,730
privately that this could be done it was
we just totally told the story of how

2992
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:25,740
we just totally told the story of how
 

2993
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,980
we just totally told the story of how
you tell stories to convince others how

2994
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:27,990
you tell stories to convince others how
 

2995
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,420
you tell stories to convince others how
confident were you what was your

2996
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:29,430
confident were you what was your
 

2997
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:31,370
confident were you what was your
estimation of the problem

2998
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:31,380
estimation of the problem
 

2999
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,380
estimation of the problem
at that time so I thought it was

3000
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:33,390
at that time so I thought it was
 

3001
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,570
at that time so I thought it was
possible and a lot of people thought it

3002
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:35,580
possible and a lot of people thought it
 

3003
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,920
possible and a lot of people thought it
was impossible I thought it was possible

3004
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:36,930
was impossible I thought it was possible
 

3005
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,900
was impossible I thought it was possible
a reason why I thought it was possible

3006
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:38,910
a reason why I thought it was possible
 

3007
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,640
a reason why I thought it was possible
is because I did some brief

3008
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:40,650
is because I did some brief
 

3009
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,440
is because I did some brief
experimentation I knew a lot about how

3010
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:42,450
experimentation I knew a lot about how
 

3011
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:44,170
experimentation I knew a lot about how
we were approaching on open domain

3012
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:44,180
we were approaching on open domain
 

3013
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,190
we were approaching on open domain
factoids question asked me we have been

3014
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:46,200
factoids question asked me we have been
 

3015
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,170
factoids question asked me we have been
doing it for some years I looked at the

3016
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:48,180
doing it for some years I looked at the
 

3017
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,090
doing it for some years I looked at the
Japanese stuff I said this is going to

3018
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:50,100
Japanese stuff I said this is going to
 

3019
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,060
Japanese stuff I said this is going to
be hard for a lot of the points that you

3020
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:53,070
be hard for a lot of the points that you
 

3021
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,830
be hard for a lot of the points that you
mentioned earlier hard to interpret the

3022
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:54,840
mentioned earlier hard to interpret the
 

3023
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,520
mentioned earlier hard to interpret the
question hard to do it quickly enough

3024
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:58,530
question hard to do it quickly enough
 

3025
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,410
question hard to do it quickly enough
hard to compute an accurate confidence

3026
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:00,420
hard to compute an accurate confidence
 

3027
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,850
hard to compute an accurate confidence
none of this stuff had been done well

3028
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:01,860
none of this stuff had been done well
 

3029
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,620
none of this stuff had been done well
enough before but a lot of the

3030
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:03,630
enough before but a lot of the
 

3031
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:04,850
enough before but a lot of the
technologies were building with the

3032
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:04,860
technologies were building with the
 

3033
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,830
technologies were building with the
kinds of technologies that should work

3034
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:06,840
kinds of technologies that should work
 

3035
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,740
kinds of technologies that should work
but more to the point what was driving

3036
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:09,750
but more to the point what was driving
 

3037
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,070

me was I was an IBM research I was a

3038
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:13,080
me was I was an IBM research I was a
 

3039
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,170
me was I was an IBM research I was a
senior leader in IBM Research and this

3040
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:15,180
senior leader in IBM Research and this
 

3041
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,700
senior leader in IBM Research and this
is the kind of stuff we were supposed to

3042
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:16,710
is the kind of stuff we were supposed to
 

3043
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,950
is the kind of stuff we were supposed to
do we were basically supposed to the

3044
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960
do we were basically supposed to the
 

3045
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,870
do we were basically supposed to the
moonshot this is I mean we were supposed

3046
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:20,880
moonshot this is I mean we were supposed
 

3047
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
moonshot this is I mean we were supposed
to take things and say this is an active

3048
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:22,890
to take things and say this is an active
 

3049
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:27,020
to take things and say this is an active
research area it's our obligation to

3050
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,030
research area it's our obligation to
 

3051
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,910
research area it's our obligation to
kind of if we have the opportunity to

3052
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:28,920
kind of if we have the opportunity to
 

3053
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,920
kind of if we have the opportunity to
push it to the limits and if it doesn't

3054
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:30,930
push it to the limits and if it doesn't
 

3055
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,320
push it to the limits and if it doesn't
work to understand more deeply why we

3056
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:33,330
work to understand more deeply why we
 

3057
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:36,410
work to understand more deeply why we
can't do it and so I was very committed

3058
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:36,420
can't do it and so I was very committed
 

3059
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,870
can't do it and so I was very committed
to that notion saying folks this is what

3060
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:38,880
to that notion saying folks this is what
 

3061
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,590
to that notion saying folks this is what
we do it's crazy not not to do this is

3062
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:42,600
we do it's crazy not not to do this is
 

3063
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,180
we do it's crazy not not to do this is
an active research area we've been in

3064
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:44,190
an active research area we've been in
 

3065
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:46,310
an active research area we've been in
this for years why wouldn't we take this

3066
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:46,320
this for years why wouldn't we take this
 

3067
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,580
this for years why wouldn't we take this
Grand Challenge and and push it as hard

3068
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:49,590
Grand Challenge and and push it as hard
 

3069
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:52,070
Grand Challenge and and push it as hard
as we can at the very least we'd be able

3070
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:52,080
as we can at the very least we'd be able
 

3071
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,870
as we can at the very least we'd be able
to come out and say here's why this

3072
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:53,880
to come out and say here's why this
 

3073
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,530
to come out and say here's why this
problem is is way hard here's what we've

3074
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:57,540
problem is is way hard here's what we've
 

3075
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,660
problem is is way hard here's what we've
tried and here's how we failed so I was

3076
01:01:59,660 --> 01:01:59,670
tried and here's how we failed so I was
 

3077
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:02,720
tried and here's how we failed so I was
very driven as a scientist from that

3078
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:02,730
very driven as a scientist from that
 

3079
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:06,710
very driven as a scientist from that
perspective and then I also argued based

3080
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:06,720
perspective and then I also argued based
 

3081
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,630
perspective and then I also argued based
on what we did a feasibility study oh

3082
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:08,640
on what we did a feasibility study oh
 

3083
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,610
on what we did a feasibility study oh
why I thought it was hard but possible

3084
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:10,620
why I thought it was hard but possible
 

3085
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,340
why I thought it was hard but possible
and I showed examples of you know where

3086
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:13,350
and I showed examples of you know where
 

3087
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,990
and I showed examples of you know where
it succeeded where it failed why it

3088
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:15,000
it succeeded where it failed why it
 

3089
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,790
it succeeded where it failed why it
failed and sort of a high level

3090
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:16,800
failed and sort of a high level
 

3091
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,740
failed and sort of a high level
architecture approach for why we should

3092
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:18,750
architecture approach for why we should
 

3093
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,320
architecture approach for why we should
do it but for the most part that at that

3094
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:21,330
do it but for the most part that at that
 

3095
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,600
do it but for the most part that at that
point the execs really were just looking

3096
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:23,610
point the execs really were just looking
 

3097
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,130
point the execs really were just looking
for someone crazy enough to say yes

3098
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:25,140
for someone crazy enough to say yes
 

3099
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,650
for someone crazy enough to say yes
because for several years at that point

3100
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:27,660
because for several years at that point
 

3101
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,320
because for several years at that point
everyone has said no I'm not willing to

3102
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:30,330
everyone has said no I'm not willing to
 

3103
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:33,470
everyone has said no I'm not willing to
risk my reputation and my career you

3104
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:33,480
risk my reputation and my career you
 

3105
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,570
risk my reputation and my career you
know on this thing clearly you did not

3106
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:35,580
know on this thing clearly you did not
 

3107
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,180
know on this thing clearly you did not
have such fears okay I did not say you

3108
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:38,190
have such fears okay I did not say you
 

3109
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:41,510
have such fears okay I did not say you
died right in and yet for what I

3110
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:41,520
died right in and yet for what I
 

3111
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,970
died right in and yet for what I
understand it was

3112
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:43,980
understand it was
 

3113
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,859
understand it was
performing very poorly in the beginning

3114
01:02:45,859 --> 01:02:45,869
performing very poorly in the beginning
 

3115
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:48,470
performing very poorly in the beginning
so what were the initial approaches and

3116
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:48,480
so what were the initial approaches and
 

3117
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,970
so what were the initial approaches and
why did they fail well there were lots

3118
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:52,980
why did they fail well there were lots
 

3119
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,520
why did they fail well there were lots
of hard aspects to it I mean one of the

3120
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:55,530
of hard aspects to it I mean one of the
 

3121
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:58,700
of hard aspects to it I mean one of the
reasons why prior approaches that we had

3122
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:58,710
reasons why prior approaches that we had
 

3123
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,770
reasons why prior approaches that we had
worked on in the past

3124
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:00,780
worked on in the past
 

3125
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:05,870
worked on in the past
um failed was because of because the

3126
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:05,880
um failed was because of because the
 

3127
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,430
um failed was because of because the
questions were difficult difficult to

3128
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:07,440
questions were difficult difficult to
 

3129
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,960
questions were difficult difficult to
interpret like what are you even asking

3130
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:08,970
interpret like what are you even asking
 

3131
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:11,359
interpret like what are you even asking
for right very often like if if the

3132
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,369
for right very often like if if the
 

3133
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:13,790
for right very often like if if the
question was very direct like what city

3134
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:13,800
question was very direct like what city
 

3135
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,950
question was very direct like what city
you know or what you know even then it

3136
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:15,960
you know or what you know even then it
 

3137
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,810
you know or what you know even then it
could be tricky but but you know what

3138
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:17,820
could be tricky but but you know what
 

3139
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:22,580
could be tricky but but you know what
city or what person was often when it

3140
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:22,590
city or what person was often when it
 

3141
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,410
city or what person was often when it
would name it very clearly you would

3142
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:24,420
would name it very clearly you would
 

3143
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,990
would name it very clearly you would
know that and and if there was just a

3144
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:27,000
know that and and if there was just a
 

3145
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,700
know that and and if there was just a
small set of them in other words we're

3146
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:28,710
small set of them in other words we're
 

3147
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:31,670
small set of them in other words we're
gonna ask about these five types like

3148
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:31,680
gonna ask about these five types like
 

3149
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,099
gonna ask about these five types like
it's gonna be an answer and the answer

3150
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:34,109
it's gonna be an answer and the answer
 

3151
01:03:34,109 --> 01:03:37,160
it's gonna be an answer and the answer
will be a city in this state or a city

3152
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:37,170
will be a city in this state or a city
 

3153
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:38,570
will be a city in this state or a city
in this country the answer will be a

3154
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:38,580
in this country the answer will be a
 

3155
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:41,690
in this country the answer will be a
person of this type right like an actor

3156
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:41,700
person of this type right like an actor
 

3157
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,790
person of this type right like an actor
or whatever it is but turns out that in

3158
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:43,800
or whatever it is but turns out that in
 

3159
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,470
or whatever it is but turns out that in
jeopardy there were like tens of

3160
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:45,480
jeopardy there were like tens of
 

3161
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,960
jeopardy there were like tens of
thousands of these things and it was a

3162
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:47,970
thousands of these things and it was a
 

3163
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:51,140
thousands of these things and it was a
very very long tale meaning you know

3164
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:51,150
very very long tale meaning you know
 

3165
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:53,300
very very long tale meaning you know
that it just went on and on and and so

3166
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:53,310
that it just went on and on and and so
 

3167
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:55,730
that it just went on and on and and so
even if you focused on trying to encode

3168
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:55,740
even if you focused on trying to encode
 

3169
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,460
even if you focused on trying to encode
the types at the very top like there's

3170
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:58,470
the types at the very top like there's
 

3171
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,410
the types at the very top like there's
five that were the most let's say five

3172
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:00,420
five that were the most let's say five
 

3173
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,330
five that were the most let's say five
of the most frequent you still cover a

3174
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:02,340
of the most frequent you still cover a
 

3175
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,370
of the most frequent you still cover a
very small percentage of the data so you

3176
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:04,380
very small percentage of the data so you
 

3177
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,950
very small percentage of the data so you
couldn't take that approach of saying

3178
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
couldn't take that approach of saying
 

3179
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,260
couldn't take that approach of saying
I'm just going to try to collect facts

3180
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:09,270
I'm just going to try to collect facts
 

3181
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:12,380
I'm just going to try to collect facts
about these five or ten types or twenty

3182
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:12,390
about these five or ten types or twenty
 

3183
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,980
about these five or ten types or twenty
types or fifty types or whatever so that

3184
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:14,990
types or fifty types or whatever so that
 

3185
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:17,030
types or fifty types or whatever so that
was like one of the first things like

3186
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:17,040
was like one of the first things like
 

3187
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,040
was like one of the first things like
what do you do about that and so we came

3188
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:19,050
what do you do about that and so we came
 

3189
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:21,020
what do you do about that and so we came
up with a an approach toward that and

3190
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:21,030
up with a an approach toward that and
 

3191
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:24,050
up with a an approach toward that and
the approach to look promising and we we

3192
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:24,060
the approach to look promising and we we
 

3193
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,120
the approach to look promising and we we
continue to improve our abilities to

3194
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:26,130
continue to improve our abilities to
 

3195
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:28,220
continue to improve our abilities to
handle that problem throughout the

3196
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:28,230
handle that problem throughout the
 

3197
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:31,760
handle that problem throughout the
project the other issue was that right

3198
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:31,770
project the other issue was that right
 

3199
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,470
project the other issue was that right
from the outside I said we're not going

3200
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:33,480
from the outside I said we're not going
 

3201
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,349
from the outside I said we're not going
to I committed to doing this in three

3202
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:36,359
to I committed to doing this in three
 

3203
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:39,590
to I committed to doing this in three
five years so we did in four so I got

3204
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:39,600
five years so we did in four so I got
 

3205
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,010
five years so we did in four so I got
lucky

um but one of the things that that

3208
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:42,150
um but one of the things that that
 

3209
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,290
um but one of the things that that
putting that like stake in the ground

3210
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:44,300
putting that like stake in the ground
 

3211
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,910
putting that like stake in the ground
was I and I knew how hard the language

3212
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:46,920

01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:48,540
of the standard problem was I said we're
 

3215
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,200
of the standard problem was I said we're
not going to actually understand

and this was an issue of how do we

3290
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:10,830
and this was an issue of how do we
 

3291
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,040
and this was an issue of how do we
enhance them how do we integrate them

3292
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:13,050
enhance them how do we integrate them
 

3293
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,770
enhance them how do we integrate them
how do we advance them so I had one

3294
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:15,780
how do we advance them so I had one
 

3295
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,570
how do we advance them so I had one
researcher and came to me who had been

3296
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:17,580
researcher and came to me who had been
 

3297
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:18,920
researcher and came to me who had been
working on question answering with me

3298
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:18,930
working on question answering with me
 

3299
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:21,110
working on question answering with me
for a very long time

3300
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:21,120
for a very long time
 

3301
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,570
for a very long time
who had said we're gonna need Maxwell's

3302
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:23,580
who had said we're gonna need Maxwell's
 

3303
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,850
who had said we're gonna need Maxwell's
equations for question-answering and I

3304
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:25,860
equations for question-answering and I
 

3305
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,130
equations for question-answering and I
said if we if we need some fundamental

3306
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:28,140
said if we if we need some fundamental
 

3307
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,410
said if we if we need some fundamental
formula that breaks new ground and how

3308
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:30,420
formula that breaks new ground and how
 

3309
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,750

01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,340
we understand language we're screwed
yeah we're not gonna get there from here

3312
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:34,350
yeah we're not gonna get there from here
 

3313
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:38,180
yeah we're not gonna get there from here
like we I am not counting I am that my

3314
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:38,190
like we I am not counting I am that my
 

3315
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,160
like we I am not counting I am that my
assumption is I'm not counting on some

3316
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:40,170
assumption is I'm not counting on some

brand new invention what I'm counting on

3318
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:43,710
brand new invention what I'm counting on
 

3319
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:46,580
brand new invention what I'm counting on
is the ability to take everything that

3320
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:46,590
is the ability to take everything that
 

3321
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:49,340
is the ability to take everything that
has done before to figure out a an

3322
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:49,350
has done before to figure out a an

architecture on how to integrate it well

3324
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:51,630
architecture on how to integrate it well
 

3325
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,680
architecture on how to integrate it well
and then see where it breaks and make

3326
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:54,690
and then see where it breaks and make
 

3327
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,960
and then see where it breaks and make
the necessary advances we need to make

3328
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:56,970
the necessary advances we need to make
 

3329
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,430
the necessary advances we need to make
and sold this thing works

3330
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:58,440
and sold this thing works
 

3331
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,200
and sold this thing works
yeah push it hard to see where it breaks

3332
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:00,210
yeah push it hard to see where it breaks
 

3333
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:02,120
yeah push it hard to see where it breaks
and then patch it up I mean that's how

3334
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:02,130
and then patch it up I mean that's how
 

3335
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:03,770
and then patch it up I mean that's how
people change the world and that's the

we didn't know right but you kind of
 

3347
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,160
we didn't know right but you kind of
have to put a second or so how you gonna

01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:30,050
you search over so you have a question
how would you search the possible space

3358
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:30,060
how would you search the possible space

see but also you couldn't just get out

3394
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:10,170
see but also you couldn't just get out
 

3395
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,750

there you couldn't go off Network right

3396
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:11,760
there you couldn't go off Network right
 

3397
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,060
there you couldn't go off Network right
to kind of go so there was that

3398
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:14,070
to kind of go so there was that
 

3399
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,070
to kind of go so there was that
limitation but then we did it but the

3400
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
limitation but then we did it but the
 

3401
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,930
limitation but then we did it but the
basic thing was go go do what go do a

3402
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:17,940
basic thing was go go do what go do a
 

3403
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,420
basic thing was go go do what go do a
web search the problem was even when we

3404
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:20,430
web search the problem was even when we
 

3405
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:23,420
web search the problem was even when we
went and did a web search I don't

3406
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:23,430
went and did a web search I don't
 

3407
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:25,040
went and did a web search I don't
remember exactly the numbers but someone

3411
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,620
the order of 65% at a time the answer
would be somewhere you know in the top

answer you have you depth of confidence
 

3437
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:55,410
answer you have you depth of confidence
it was the right answer and and then

3438
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:55,420
it was the right answer and and then
 

3439
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,550
it was the right answer and and then
you'd have to do that fast enough to now

3440
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
you'd have to do that fast enough to now
 

3441
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,579
you'd have to do that fast enough to now
go buzz in and you'd still only get 65%

3442
01:08:59,579 --> 01:08:59,589
go buzz in and you'd still only get 65%

what content could we efficiently
 

3557
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,210
what content could we efficiently
include I mean there's a lot of popular

3558
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:03,220
include I mean there's a lot of popular

3560
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:05,590
cut like what is the church lady well I
 

3561
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:08,480
cut like what is the church lady well I
think was one of the end hey yeah what

3562
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:08,490
think was one of the end hey yeah what
 

3563
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:11,250
think was one of the end hey yeah what
we ready I guess that's probably an

3564
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:11,260
we ready I guess that's probably an
 

3565
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,830
we ready I guess that's probably an
encyclopedia so it's a pepino is that

3566
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:13,840
encyclopedia so it's a pepino is that
 

3567
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,510
encyclopedia so it's a pepino is that
but then we would but then we would take

3568
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:15,520
but then we would but then we would take
 

3569
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,950
but then we would but then we would take
that stuff when we would go out and we

3570
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:16,960
that stuff when we would go out and we
 

3571
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,810
that stuff when we would go out and we
would expand in other words we go find

3572
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:18,820
would expand in other words we go find
 

3573
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,240
would expand in other words we go find
other content that wasn't in the core

01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,400
other content that wasn't in the core
resources and expanded you know the

3576
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:23,410
resources and expanded you know the
 

3577
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:24,750
resources and expanded you know the
amount of content will grew it by an

3578
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:24,760
amount of content will grew it by an
 

3579
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,120
amount of content will grew it by an
order of magnitude but still so again

3580
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:27,130
order of magnitude but still so again
 

3581
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:28,710
order of magnitude but still so again
from a web scale perspective this is

3582
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:28,720
from a web scale perspective this is
 

3583
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,750
from a web scale perspective this is
very small amount of content it's very

3584
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:30,760
very small amount of content it's very

very small amount of content it's very
select we then we then took all that

3586
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:32,500

01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,690
out of it meaning we we we parsed it you
know broke it down into all this

3592
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:39,700
know broke it down into all this
 

3593
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,130
know broke it down into all this
individual words and then we did

3594
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:41,140
individual words and then we did
 

3595
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:43,710
individual words and then we did
semantic static and semantic parses on

3596
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:43,720
semantic static and semantic parses on
 

3597
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,780
semantic static and semantic parses on
it you know had computer algorithms that

3598
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:45,790
it you know had computer algorithms that
 

3599
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:48,480
it you know had computer algorithms that
annotated it and we in that we indexed

3600
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:48,490
annotated it and we in that we indexed
 

3601
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:52,190
annotated it and we in that we indexed
that in a very rich and very fast index

3602
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:52,200
that in a very rich and very fast index
 

3603
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,930
that in a very rich and very fast index
so we have a relatively huge amount of

3604
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:54,940
so we have a relatively huge amount of
 

3605
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,670
so we have a relatively huge amount of
you know let's say the equivalent of for

3606
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:56,680
you know let's say the equivalent of for
 

3607
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,050
you know let's say the equivalent of for
the sake of argument two to five million

3608
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:58,060
the sake of argument two to five million
 

3609
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:58,590
the sake of argument two to five million
bucks

3610
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:58,600
bucks
 

3611
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,930

we've now analyzed all that blowing up

3612
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:00,940
we've now analyzed all that blowing up
 

3613
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,460
we've now analyzed all that blowing up
at size even more because now with all

01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:02,470
at size even more because now with all
 

3615
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:04,500
at size even more because now with all
this metadata and we then we richly

3616
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:04,510
this metadata and we then we richly
 

3617
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:07,200
this metadata and we then we richly
indexed all of that and in by way in a

3618
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:07,210
indexed all of that and in by way in a
 

3619
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:10,230
indexed all of that and in by way in a
giant in-memory cache so Watson did not

01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:31,420
you know the Watson architects right so
 

3687
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:33,300
you know the Watson architects right so
we would take the question we would

3688
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:33,310
we would take the question we would
 

3689
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:35,490
we would take the question we would
analyze the question so which means that

3690
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:35,500
analyze the question so which means that
 

3691
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,740
analyze the question so which means that
we would parse it and interpret it a

3692
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:37,750
we would parse it and interpret it a
 

3693
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,300
we would parse it and interpret it a
bunch of different ways we try to figure

3694
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:39,310
bunch of different ways we try to figure
 

3695
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:41,390
bunch of different ways we try to figure
out what is it asking about so we would

3696
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:41,400
out what is it asking about so we would
 

3697
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,730
out what is it asking about so we would
come we had multiple strategies to kind

3698
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:44,740
come we had multiple strategies to kind
 

3699
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,340
come we had multiple strategies to kind
of determine what was it asking for that

3700
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:47,350
of determine what was it asking for that
 

3701
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,320
of determine what was it asking for that
might be represented as a simple string

3702
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:49,330
might be represented as a simple string
 

3703
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:52,260
might be represented as a simple string
and character string or was something we

3704
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:52,270
and character string or was something we
 

3705
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:53,970
and character string or was something we
would connect back to different semantic

3706
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:53,980
would connect back to different semantic
 

3707
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:56,100
would connect back to different semantic
types that were from existing resources

3708
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:56,110
types that were from existing resources
 

3709
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:58,110
types that were from existing resources
so anyway the bottom line is we would do

3710
01:13:58,110 --> 01:13:58,120
so anyway the bottom line is we would do
 

3711
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,510
so anyway the bottom line is we would do
a bunch of analysis and the question and

3712
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:00,520
a bunch of analysis and the question and
 

3713
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,340
a bunch of analysis and the question and
question analysis had to finish and had

3714
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:02,350
question analysis had to finish and had
 

3715
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:04,740
question analysis had to finish and had
to finish fast so we do the question

3716
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:04,750
to finish fast so we do the question
 

3717
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,930
to finish fast so we do the question
analysis because then from the question

3718
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:06,940
analysis because then from the question
 

3719
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,150
analysis because then from the question
analysis we would now produce searches

3720
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:09,160
analysis we would now produce searches
 

3721
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:13,410
analysis we would now produce searches
so we would and we had built using open

3722
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:13,420
so we would and we had built using open
 

3723
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,510
so we would and we had built using open
source search engines we modified them

3724
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:15,520
source search engines we modified them
 

3725
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,520
source search engines we modified them
we had a number of different search

3726
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:17,530
we had a number of different search
 

3727
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,590
we had a number of different search
engines we would use that had different

3728
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:19,600
engines we would use that had different
 

3729
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,420
engines we would use that had different
characteristics we went in there and

3730
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:21,430
characteristics we went in there and
 

3731
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:23,550
characteristics we went in there and
engineered and modified those search

3732
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:23,560
engineered and modified those search
 

3733
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:27,270
engineered and modified those search
engines ultimately to now take our

3734
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,280
engines ultimately to now take our
 

3735
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,070
engines ultimately to now take our
question analysis produce multiple

3736
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:29,080
question analysis produce multiple
 

3737
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,600
question analysis produce multiple
queries based on different

3738
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:30,610
queries based on different
 

3739
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:33,720
queries based on different
interpretations of the question and fire

3740
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:33,730
interpretations of the question and fire
 

3741
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,150
interpretations of the question and fire
out a whole bunch of searches in

3742
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:35,160
out a whole bunch of searches in
 

3743
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:39,150
out a whole bunch of searches in
parallel and they would produce combate

3744
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:39,160
parallel and they would produce combate
 

3745
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,760
parallel and they would produce combate
with passages so this is these are

3746
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:41,770
with passages so this is these are
 

3747
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,200
with passages so this is these are
passive search algorithms they would

3748
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:43,210
passive search algorithms they would
 

3749
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:45,450
passive search algorithms they would
come back with passages and so now you

3750
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:45,460
come back with passages and so now you
 

3751
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:47,610
come back with passages and so now you
let's say you had a thousand passages

3752
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:47,620
let's say you had a thousand passages
 

3753
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:50,610
let's say you had a thousand passages
now for each passage you you parallel

3754
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:50,620
now for each passage you you parallel
 

3755
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,980
now for each passage you you parallel
eyes again so you went out and you

3756
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:52,990
eyes again so you went out and you
 

3757
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:56,310
eyes again so you went out and you
paralyze those paralyze the search each

3758
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,320
paralyze those paralyze the search each
 

3759
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,020
paralyze those paralyze the search each
search would now come back with a whole

3760
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:58,030
search would now come back with a whole
 

3761
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,630
search would now come back with a whole
bunch of passages maybe you had a total

3762
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:00,640
bunch of passages maybe you had a total
 

3763
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,100
bunch of passages maybe you had a total
of a thousand or five thousand different

3764
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:02,110
of a thousand or five thousand different
 

3765
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:05,250
of a thousand or five thousand different
passages for each passage now you don't

3766
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:05,260
passages for each passage now you don't
 

3767
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,510
passages for each passage now you don't
figure out whether or not there was a

3768
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:06,520
figure out whether or not there was a
 

3769
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,950
figure out whether or not there was a
candidate it would call it candidate

3770
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:07,960
candidate it would call it candidate
 

3771
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,600
candidate it would call it candidate
answer in there so you had a whole bunch

3772
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:09,610
answer in there so you had a whole bunch
 

3773
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:10,950
answer in there so you had a whole bunch
of other a whole bunch of other

3774
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
of other a whole bunch of other
 

3775
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,810
of other a whole bunch of other
algorithms

3776
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:11,820
algorithms
 

3777
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,550
algorithms
that would find candidate answers

3778
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:13,560
that would find candidate answers
 

3779
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,760
that would find candidate answers
possible answers to the question and so

3780
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:15,770
possible answers to the question and so
 

3781
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:18,440
possible answers to the question and so
you had candidate answers jet cold

3782
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:18,450
you had candidate answers jet cold
 

3783
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:20,330
you had candidate answers jet cold
candidate answers generators a whole

3784
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:20,340
candidate answers generators a whole
 

3785
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,520
candidate answers generators a whole
bunch of those so for every one of these

3786
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:22,530
bunch of those so for every one of these
 

3787
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:24,650
bunch of those so for every one of these
components the team was constantly doing

3788
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:24,660
components the team was constantly doing
 

3789
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,810
components the team was constantly doing
research coming up better ways to

3790
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:26,820
research coming up better ways to
 

3791
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,070
research coming up better ways to
generate search queries from the

3792
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:28,080
generate search queries from the
 

3793
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,840
generate search queries from the
questions better ways to analyze the

3794
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:29,850
questions better ways to analyze the
 

3795
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:31,190
questions better ways to analyze the
question better ways to generate

3796
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:31,200
question better ways to generate
 

3797
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,070
question better ways to generate
candidates and speed so better is

3798
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:33,080
candidates and speed so better is
 

3799
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:37,580
candidates and speed so better is
accuracy and speed cracked so right and

3800
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:37,590
accuracy and speed cracked so right and
 

3801
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:39,530
accuracy and speed cracked so right and
speed and accuracy for the most part

3802
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:39,540
speed and accuracy for the most part
 

3803
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,960
speed and accuracy for the most part
we're separated we handle that sort of

3804
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:41,970
we're separated we handle that sort of
 

3805
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,030
we're separated we handle that sort of
in separate ways like I focus purely on

3806
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:44,040
in separate ways like I focus purely on
 

3807
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,830
in separate ways like I focus purely on
accuracy and to an accuracy are we

3808
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:45,840
accuracy and to an accuracy are we
 

3809
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,450
accuracy and to an accuracy are we
ultimately getting more questions and

3810
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:47,460
ultimately getting more questions and
 

3811
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,100
ultimately getting more questions and
producing more accurate confidences and

3812
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:49,110
producing more accurate confidences and
 

3813
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:50,870
producing more accurate confidences and
they had a whole nother team that was

3814
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:50,880
they had a whole nother team that was
 

3815
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,910
they had a whole nother team that was
constantly analyzing the workflow to

3816
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:52,920
constantly analyzing the workflow to
 

3817
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,680
constantly analyzing the workflow to
find the bottlenecks and then if you're

3818
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:54,690
find the bottlenecks and then if you're
 

3819
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,210
find the bottlenecks and then if you're
getting out of both parallel eyes and

3820
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:56,220
getting out of both parallel eyes and
 

3821
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,940
getting out of both parallel eyes and
drive the algorithm speed but anyway so

3822
01:15:58,940 --> 01:15:58,950
drive the algorithm speed but anyway so
 

3823
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,740
drive the algorithm speed but anyway so
so now think of it like you have this

3824
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:00,750
so now think of it like you have this
 

3825
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,660
so now think of it like you have this
big fan out now right because you have

3826
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:02,670
big fan out now right because you have
 

3827
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:04,430
big fan out now right because you have
you had multiple queries now you have

3828
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:04,440
you had multiple queries now you have
 

3829
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,900
you had multiple queries now you have
now you have thousands of candidate

3830
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:05,910
now you have thousands of candidate
 

3831
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:08,600
now you have thousands of candidate
answers for each candidate answer you're

3832
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:08,610
answers for each candidate answer you're
 

3833
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:11,360
answers for each candidate answer you're
gonna score it so you're gonna use all

3834
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:11,370
gonna score it so you're gonna use all
 

3835
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:13,370
gonna score it so you're gonna use all
the data that built up you're gonna use

3836
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:13,380
the data that built up you're gonna use
 

3837
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:16,430
the data that built up you're gonna use
the question analysis you can use how

3838
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:16,440
the question analysis you can use how
 

3839
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,320
the question analysis you can use how
the query was generated you're going to

3840
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:18,330
the query was generated you're going to
 

3841
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:20,630
the query was generated you're going to
use the passage itself and you're going

3842
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:20,640
use the passage itself and you're going
 

3843
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,280
use the passage itself and you're going
to use the candidate answer that was

3844
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:22,290
to use the candidate answer that was
 

3845
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:26,030
to use the candidate answer that was
generated and you're gonna score that so

3846
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:26,040
generated and you're gonna score that so
 

3847
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,100
generated and you're gonna score that so
now we have a group of researchers

3848
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:28,110
now we have a group of researchers
 

3849
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:30,710
now we have a group of researchers
coming up with scores there are hundreds

3850
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:30,720
coming up with scores there are hundreds
 

3851
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,840
coming up with scores there are hundreds
of different scores so now you're

3852
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:32,850
of different scores so now you're
 

3853
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:34,970
of different scores so now you're
getting a fan at it again from however

3854
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:34,980
getting a fan at it again from however
 

3855
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,940
getting a fan at it again from however
many candidate answers you have to all

3856
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:37,950
many candidate answers you have to all
 

3857
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,740
many candidate answers you have to all
the different scorers so if you have a

3858
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:39,750
the different scorers so if you have a
 

3859
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,540
the different scorers so if you have a
200 different scores and you never a

3860
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:41,550
200 different scores and you never a
 

3861
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:42,890
200 different scores and you never a
thousand candidates now you have two

3862
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:42,900
thousand candidates now you have two
 

3863
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:46,280
thousand candidates now you have two
thousand scores and and so now you got

3864
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:46,290
thousand scores and and so now you got
 

3865
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:49,730
thousand scores and and so now you got
to figure out you know how do I now rank

3866
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:49,740
to figure out you know how do I now rank
 

3867
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:52,820
to figure out you know how do I now rank
these rank these answers based on the

3868
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:52,830
these rank these answers based on the
 

3869
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:55,160
these rank these answers based on the
scores that came back and I want to rank

3870
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:55,170
scores that came back and I want to rank
 

3871
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:56,540
scores that came back and I want to rank
them based on the likelihood that there

3872
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:56,550
them based on the likelihood that there
 

3873
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:58,790
them based on the likelihood that there
are correct answer to the question so

3874
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:58,800
are correct answer to the question so
 

3875
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,160
are correct answer to the question so
every score was its own research project

3876
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:01,170
every score was its own research project
 

3877
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:03,020
every score was its own research project
what do you mean by score so is that the

3878
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:03,030
what do you mean by score so is that the
 

3879
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:05,690
what do you mean by score so is that the
annotation process of basically human

3880
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:05,700
annotation process of basically human
 

3881
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,960
annotation process of basically human
being saying that this this answer do

3882
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:07,970
being saying that this this answer do
 

3883
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:10,040
being saying that this this answer do
you think you think of if you want to

3884
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,050
you think you think of if you want to
 

3885
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:12,590
you think you think of if you want to
think of it what you're doing you know

3886
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:12,600
think of it what you're doing you know
 

3887
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,640
think of it what you're doing you know
if you want to think about what a human

3888
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:13,650
if you want to think about what a human
 

3889
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:15,050
if you want to think about what a human
would be doing human would be looking at

3890
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:15,060
would be doing human would be looking at
 

3891
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:18,280
would be doing human would be looking at
a possible answer they'd be reading the

3892
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:18,290
a possible answer they'd be reading the
 

3893
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:20,990
a possible answer they'd be reading the
you know Emily Dixon Dickinson they've

3894
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:21,000
you know Emily Dixon Dickinson they've
 

3895
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,550
you know Emily Dixon Dickinson they've
been reading the passage in which that

3896
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:22,560
been reading the passage in which that
 

3897
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,380
been reading the passage in which that
occurred they'd be looking at the

3898
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:24,390
occurred they'd be looking at the
 

3899
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,430
occurred they'd be looking at the
question

3900
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:25,440
question
 

3901
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,020
question
they'd be making a decision of how

3902
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:27,030
they'd be making a decision of how
 

3903
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:29,780
they'd be making a decision of how
likely it is that Emily Dixon Dickinson

3904
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:29,790
likely it is that Emily Dixon Dickinson
 

3905
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:32,060
likely it is that Emily Dixon Dickinson
given this evidence in this passage is

3906
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:32,070
given this evidence in this passage is
 

3907
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:34,400
given this evidence in this passage is
the right answer to that quad got it

3908
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:34,410
the right answer to that quad got it
 

3909
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:36,350
the right answer to that quad got it
so that that's the annotation task that

3910
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:36,360
so that that's the annotation task that
 

3911
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,560
so that that's the annotation task that
Stan Johnson scoring task so but scoring

3912
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:39,570
Stan Johnson scoring task so but scoring
 

3913
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:41,620
Stan Johnson scoring task so but scoring
implies zero to one kind of trite

3914
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:41,630
implies zero to one kind of trite
 

3915
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:45,350
implies zero to one kind of trite
continuance is not a binary no give it a

3916
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:45,360
continuance is not a binary no give it a
 

3917
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,229
continuance is not a binary no give it a
score give it a zero yeah exactly so

3918
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:48,239
score give it a zero yeah exactly so
 

3919
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,030
score give it a zero yeah exactly so
it's what humans did give different

3920
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:50,040
it's what humans did give different
 

3921
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,439
it's what humans did give different
scores so that you have to somehow

3922
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:51,449
scores so that you have to somehow
 

3923
01:17:51,449 --> 01:17:52,760
scores so that you have to somehow
normalize and all that kind of stuff

3924
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:52,770
normalize and all that kind of stuff
 

3925
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,979
normalize and all that kind of stuff
that deal with all that depends on what

3926
01:17:54,979 --> 01:17:54,989
that deal with all that depends on what
 

3927
01:17:54,989 --> 01:17:57,290
that deal with all that depends on what
your strategy is we both we could be

3928
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:57,300
your strategy is we both we could be
 

3929
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,870
your strategy is we both we could be
relative to it could be we actually

3930
01:17:59,870 --> 01:17:59,880
relative to it could be we actually
 

3931
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,700
relative to it could be we actually
looked at the raw scores as well

3932
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:01,710
looked at the raw scores as well
 

3933
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,439
looked at the raw scores as well
standardized scores because humans are

3934
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:03,449
standardized scores because humans are
 

3935
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:04,459
standardized scores because humans are
not involved in this

3936
01:18:04,459 --> 01:18:04,469
not involved in this
 

3937
01:18:04,469 --> 01:18:06,560
not involved in this
humans are not involved sorry so I mean

3938
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:06,570
humans are not involved sorry so I mean
 

3939
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:08,540
humans are not involved sorry so I mean
I'm misunderstanding the the the process

3940
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:08,550
I'm misunderstanding the the the process
 

3941
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:11,510
I'm misunderstanding the the the process
here this is passages where is the

3942
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:11,520
here this is passages where is the
 

3943
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,790
here this is passages where is the
ground truth coming from grass root

3944
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:13,800
ground truth coming from grass root
 

3945
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,930
ground truth coming from grass root
there's only there were answers to the

3946
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:14,940
there's only there were answers to the
 

3947
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,840
there's only there were answers to the
questions so it's end to end

3948
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:17,850
questions so it's end to end
 

3949
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:20,900
questions so it's end to end
it's end to end so we also I was always

3950
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:20,910
it's end to end so we also I was always
 

3951
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:22,700
it's end to end so we also I was always

say we wouldn't make hypotheses that

3962
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:39,320
say we wouldn't make hypotheses that
 

3963
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:42,320
say we wouldn't make hypotheses that
individual component performance was

3964
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:42,330
individual component performance was
 

3965
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:44,330
individual component performance was
related in some way to n10 performance

3966

related in some way to n10 performance
 

3967
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,830
related in some way to n10 performance
of course we would because people would

01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
of course we would because people would
 

3969
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,979
of course we would because people would
have to build individual components but

3970
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:48,989
have to build individual components but
 

3971

there's many very smart people work on

3980
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:58,080
there's many very smart people work on
 

3981
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,930
there's many very smart people work on
this and they're basically trying to

3982
01:18:59,930 --> 01:18:59,940
this and they're basically trying to
 

3983
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,330
this and they're basically trying to
sell their ideas as a component that

3984
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:02,340
sell their ideas as a component that
 

3985
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,530
sell their ideas as a component that
should be part of the system that's

3986

should be part of the system that's
 

3987
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:06,110
should be part of the system that's
right and and they would do research on

3988
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:06,120
right and and they would do research on
 

3989
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,000
right and and they would do research on
their component and they would say

3990

their component and they would say
 

3991
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:10,189
their component and they would say
things like you know I'm going to

3992
01:19:10,189 --> 01:19:10,199
things like you know I'm going to
 

3993
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:13,010
things like you know I'm going to
improve this as a candidate generator

3994
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:13,020
improve this as a candidate generator
 

3995
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,260
improve this as a candidate generator
I'm going to improve this as a question

3996
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:15,270
I'm going to improve this as a question
 

3997
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:17,990
I'm going to improve this as a question
score or as a passive scorer I'm going

3998
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
score or as a passive scorer I'm going
 

3999
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,340
score or as a passive scorer I'm going
to proved as or as a parser and I can

4000
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:21,350
to proved as or as a parser and I can
 

4001
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,229
to proved as or as a parser and I can
improve it by two percent on its

4002
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:24,239
improve it by two percent on its
 

4003
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,510
improve it by two percent on its
component metric like a better parse or

4004
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:26,520
component metric like a better parse or
 

4005
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,580

01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:30,590
better candidate or a better type
estimation or whatever it is and then I

4008
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:30,600
estimation or whatever it is and then I
 

4009
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,380
estimation or whatever it is and then I
would say I need to understand how the

4010
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:33,390
would say I need to understand how the
 

4011
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:35,000
would say I need to understand how the
improvement on that computer metric is

4012
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:35,010
improvement on that computer metric is
 

4013
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:36,350
improvement on that computer metric is
going to affect the end-to-end

4014
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:36,360
going to affect the end-to-end
 

4015
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,030
going to affect the end-to-end
performance if you can't estimate

4016
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:39,040
performance if you can't estimate
 

4017
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,560
performance if you can't estimate
that and can't do experiments to

4018
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:40,570
that and can't do experiments to
 

4019
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:42,570
that and can't do experiments to
demonstrate that it doesn't get in

4020
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:42,580
demonstrate that it doesn't get in
 

4021
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:47,010
demonstrate that it doesn't get in
that's like the best run AI project I've

4022
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:47,020
that's like the best run AI project I've
 

4023
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,620
that's like the best run AI project I've
ever heard that's awesome okay what

4024
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:49,630
ever heard that's awesome okay what
 

4025
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:52,860
ever heard that's awesome okay what
breakthrough would you say like I'm sure

4026
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:52,870
breakthrough would you say like I'm sure
 

4027
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:54,150
breakthrough would you say like I'm sure
there's a lot of day to day break this

4028
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:54,160
there's a lot of day to day break this
 

4029
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,230
there's a lot of day to day break this
but it was there like a breakthrough

4030
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:55,240
but it was there like a breakthrough
 

4031
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,420
but it was there like a breakthrough
that really helped improve performance

4032
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:57,430
that really helped improve performance
 

4033
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:00,140
that really helped improve performance
like wait what people began to believe

4034
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:00,150
like wait what people began to believe
 

4035
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:02,640
like wait what people began to believe
or is it just a gradual process well I

4036
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:02,650
or is it just a gradual process well I
 

4037
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:06,030

confidence that we can get there was

4042
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:10,180
confidence that we can get there was
 

4043
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,950
confidence that we can get there was
that as we fouled as as we follow this

that was going on with every other
 

4063
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:43,740
that was going on with every other

component and this is where we we
 

4065
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,450

leverage machine learning in a very
 

4067
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:48,210
leverage machine learning in a very
important way so while individual

important way so while individual
 

4069
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,190
important way so while individual
components could be statistically driven

4070
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:50,200
components could be statistically driven
 

4071
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,720
components could be statistically driven
machine learning components some of them

4072
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:51,730
machine learning components some of them
 

4073
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:53,250
machine learning components some of them
were your wrist ik some of them were

machine learning components the system
 

4077
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:57,440
machine learning components the system
has a whole combined all the scores

using machine learning this was critical

4080
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:01,120
using machine learning this was critical
 

4081
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,510
using machine learning this was critical
because that way you can divide and

4082
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:03,520
because that way you can divide and
 

4083
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,480
because that way you can divide and
conquer so you can say okay you work on

4084
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:06,490
conquer so you can say okay you work on
 

4085
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:08,130
conquer so you can say okay you work on

but when we you just plug it in and we
 

4097
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:22,260
but when we you just plug it in and we
had enough training data to say now we

4098
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:22,270
had enough training data to say now we
 

4099
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:24,780
had enough training data to say now we
can we can train and figure out how do

4100
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:24,790
can we can train and figure out how do
 

4101
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:28,320

we weigh all the scores relative to each

4102
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:28,330
we weigh all the scores relative to each
 

4103
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:31,560
we weigh all the scores relative to each
other based on the predicting the

4104
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:31,570
other based on the predicting the
 

4105
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:33,180
other based on the predicting the
outcome which is right right or wrong on

4106
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:33,190
outcome which is right right or wrong on
 

4107
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:35,220
outcome which is right right or wrong on
jeopardy and we had enough training data

4108
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:35,230
jeopardy and we had enough training data
 

4109
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:38,400
jeopardy and we had enough training data
to do that so this enabled people to

4110
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:38,410
to do that so this enabled people to
 

4111
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:41,190
to do that so this enabled people to
work independently and to let the

4112
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:41,200
work independently and to let the
 

4113
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,860
work independently and to let the
machine learning do the integration

4114
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:42,870
machine learning do the integration
 

4115
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,880
machine learning do the integration
beautiful so that yeah the machine

4116
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:44,890
beautiful so that yeah the machine
 

4117
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:46,590
beautiful so that yeah the machine
learning is doing the fusion and then

4118
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:46,600
learning is doing the fusion and then
 

4119
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,840
learning is doing the fusion and then
it's a human orchestrated ensemble

4120
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:48,850
it's a human orchestrated ensemble
 

4121
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:51,410
it's a human orchestrated ensemble
that's right friend approaches as a

4122
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:51,420
that's right friend approaches as a
 

4123
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:55,010
that's right friend approaches as a

4125
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,430

get it done a few years that not obvious

4126
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:58,440
get it done a few years that not obvious
 

4127
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,040
get it done a few years that not obvious
to me that it's doable if I just put

4128
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:01,050
to me that it's doable if I just put
 

4129
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:04,130
to me that it's doable if I just put
myself in that mindset but when you look

4130
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:04,140
myself in that mindset but when you look
 

4131
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:08,090
myself in that mindset but when you look
back at the Jeopardy challenge again

when you're looking up at the stars what
 

4135
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:14,600
when you're looking up at the stars what
are you most proud of looking back at

4136
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:14,610
are you most proud of looking back at
 

4137
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:28,060
are you most proud of looking back at
those days I'm most proud of my um my

to fail that's beautiful because there's

4144
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:40,110
to fail that's beautiful because there's
 

4145

understand that has success because it
came down to only one game and I knew

statistically speaking this can be a
 

4185
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,580
statistically speaking this can be a
huge technical success and we could

4186
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:42,590
huge technical success and we could
 

4187
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:44,200
huge technical success and we could
still lose that one game and that's a

still lose that one game and that's a

01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:50,720
journey but it was a success it was not

understanding but that was not the goal
 

4197
01:23:55,900 --> 01:24:00,330
understanding but that was not the goal
yeah that was but I would argue I

4198
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:00,340
yeah that was but I would argue I
 

4199
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:02,260
yeah that was but I would argue I
understand what you're saying in terms

01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:02,270
understand what you're saying in terms
 

4201
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,140
understand what you're saying in terms
of the science but I would argue that

4202
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:05,150
of the science but I would argue that
 

4203
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:09,550
of the science but I would argue that
the inspiration of it right the they not

01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:09,560
the inspiration of it right the they not

01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,530
the inspiration of it right the they not

language understanding there was a
 

4209
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,870
language understanding there was a

01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:21,790
future challenges absolutely drive
future efforts what's the difference

4214
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:21,800
future efforts what's the difference
 

4215
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,310
future efforts what's the difference
between how human being compete in

4216
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:24,320
between how human being compete in
 

4217
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,040
between how human being compete in
jeopardy and how Watson does it that's

01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:28,870
jeopardy and how Watson does it that's
important in terms of intelligence yeah

4220
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:28,880
important in terms of intelligence yeah
 

4221
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,790
important in terms of intelligence yeah
so thats that actually came out very

4222
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,800
so thats that actually came out very
 

4223
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,010
so thats that actually came out very
early on in the project also in fact I

4224
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:33,020
early on in the project also in fact I
 

4225
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:34,690
early on in the project also in fact I
had people who wanted to be on the

4226
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:34,700
had people who wanted to be on the
 

4227
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,870
had people who wanted to be on the
project who were

4228
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:36,880
project who were
 

4229
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,030
project who were
early on who has sort of approached me

4230
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,040
early on who has sort of approached me
 

4231
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,810
early on who has sort of approached me
once I committed to do it had wanted to

4232
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:42,820
once I committed to do it had wanted to
 

4233
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,550
once I committed to do it had wanted to
think about how humans do it and they

4234
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
think about how humans do it and they
 

4235
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,379
think about how humans do it and they
were you know from a cognition

4236
01:24:46,379 --> 01:24:46,389
were you know from a cognition
 

4237
01:24:46,389 --> 01:24:48,839
were you know from a cognition
perspective like human cognition and how

4238
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:48,849
perspective like human cognition and how
 

4239
01:24:48,849 --> 01:24:51,149
perspective like human cognition and how
that should play and I would not take

4240
01:24:51,149 --> 01:24:51,159
that should play and I would not take
 

4241
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:53,720
that should play and I would not take
them on the project because another

4242
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:53,730
them on the project because another
 

4243
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:56,129
them on the project because another
assumption or another stake I put in the

4244
01:24:56,129 --> 01:24:56,139
assumption or another stake I put in the
 

4245
01:24:56,139 --> 01:24:58,560
assumption or another stake I put in the
ground was I don't really care are you

4246
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:58,570
ground was I don't really care are you
 

4247
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:01,050
ground was I don't really care are you
into this at least in the context of

4248
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:01,060
into this at least in the context of
 

4249
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,850
into this at least in the context of
this prior need to build in the context

4250
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:02,860
this prior need to build in the context
 

4251
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:05,609
this prior need to build in the context
to this project in NLU and in building

4252
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:05,619
to this project in NLU and in building
 

4253
01:25:05,619 --> 01:25:08,100
to this project in NLU and in building
an AI that understands how it needs to

4254
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:08,110
an AI that understands how it needs to
 

4255
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:09,660
an AI that understands how it needs to
alter that communicate with humans I

4256
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:09,670
alter that communicate with humans I
 

4257
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:12,419
alter that communicate with humans I
very much care yeah so wasn't that I

4258
01:25:12,419 --> 01:25:12,429
very much care yeah so wasn't that I
 

4259
01:25:12,429 --> 01:25:17,220
very much care yeah so wasn't that I
didn't care in general in fact as an AI

4260
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:17,230
didn't care in general in fact as an AI
 

4261
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:20,910
didn't care in general in fact as an AI
scientist I care a lot about that but

4262
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:20,920
scientist I care a lot about that but
 

4263
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,100
scientist I care a lot about that but
I'm also a practical engineer and I

4264
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:23,110
I'm also a practical engineer and I
 

4265
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:25,080
I'm also a practical engineer and I
committed to getting this thing done and

4266
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:25,090
committed to getting this thing done and
 

4267
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:28,890
committed to getting this thing done and
I wasn't gonna get distracted I had to

4268
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:28,900
I wasn't gonna get distracted I had to
 

4269
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,479
I wasn't gonna get distracted I had to
kind of say look if I'm gonna get this

4270
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:30,489
kind of say look if I'm gonna get this
 

4271
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:31,830
kind of say look if I'm gonna get this
done and when it charts this path and

4272
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:31,840
done and when it charts this path and
 

4273
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,020
done and when it charts this path and
this path says we're gonna engineer a

4274
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:34,030
this path says we're gonna engineer a
 

4275
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:37,439
this path says we're gonna engineer a
machine that's gonna get this thing done

4276
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:37,449
machine that's gonna get this thing done
 

4277
01:25:37,449 --> 01:25:40,669
machine that's gonna get this thing done
and we know what search and NLP can do

4278
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:40,679
and we know what search and NLP can do
 

4279
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:44,370
and we know what search and NLP can do
we have to build on that foundation if I

4280
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:44,380
we have to build on that foundation if I
 

4281
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,870
we have to build on that foundation if I
come in and take a different approach

4282
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:45,880
come in and take a different approach
 

4283
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,729
come in and take a different approach
and start wondering about how the human

4284
01:25:47,729 --> 01:25:47,739
and start wondering about how the human
 

4285
01:25:47,739 --> 01:25:49,950
and start wondering about how the human
mind might or might not do this I'm not

4286
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:49,960
mind might or might not do this I'm not
 

4287
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,140
mind might or might not do this I'm not
going to get there from here in the time

4288
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:52,150
going to get there from here in the time
 

4289
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:54,660
going to get there from here in the time
and you know in the timeframe I think

4290
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:54,670
and you know in the timeframe I think
 

4291
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:56,850
and you know in the timeframe I think
that's a great way to lead the team but

4292
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:56,860
that's a great way to lead the team but
 

4293
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,399
that's a great way to lead the team but
now there's done and then one when you

4294
01:25:59,399 --> 01:25:59,409
now there's done and then one when you
 

4295
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:01,680
now there's done and then one when you
look back right so analyse what's the

4296
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:01,690
look back right so analyse what's the
 

4297
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,990
look back right so analyse what's the
difference sexy right so so I was a

4298
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,000
difference sexy right so so I was a
 

4299
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,609
difference sexy right so so I was a
little bit surprised actually to

4300
01:26:05,609 --> 01:26:05,619
little bit surprised actually to
 

4301
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:08,939
little bit surprised actually to
discover over time as this would come up

4302
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:08,949
discover over time as this would come up
 

4303
01:26:08,949 --> 01:26:10,589
discover over time as this would come up
from time to time and would reflect on

4304
01:26:10,589 --> 01:26:10,599
from time to time and would reflect on
 

4305
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:14,399
from time to time and would reflect on
it that and and talking to Ken Jennings

4306
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:14,409
it that and and talking to Ken Jennings
 

4307
01:26:14,409 --> 01:26:15,629
it that and and talking to Ken Jennings
a little bit and hearing Ken Jennings

4308
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:15,639
a little bit and hearing Ken Jennings
 

4309
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:17,790
a little bit and hearing Ken Jennings
talk about it about how he answered

4310
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:17,800
talk about it about how he answered
 

4311
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,770
talk about it about how he answered
questions that it might have been closer

4312
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:19,780
questions that it might have been closer
 

4313
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:22,109
questions that it might have been closer
to the way humans answer questions than

4314
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:22,119
to the way humans answer questions than
 

4315
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:24,780
to the way humans answer questions than
I might have imagined previously because

4316
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:24,790
I might have imagined previously because
 

4317
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:26,550
I might have imagined previously because
humans are probably in the game of

4318
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:26,560
humans are probably in the game of
 

4319
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,120
humans are probably in the game of
Jeopardy at the level of Ken Jennings

4320
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,130
Jeopardy at the level of Ken Jennings
 

4321
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:33,959
Jeopardy at the level of Ken Jennings
probably also cheating their weight into

4322
01:26:33,959 --> 01:26:33,969
probably also cheating their weight into
 

4323
01:26:33,969 --> 01:26:36,899
probably also cheating their weight into
winning right now one else is shallow

4324
01:26:36,899 --> 01:26:36,909
winning right now one else is shallow
 

4325
01:26:36,909 --> 01:26:39,000
winning right now one else is shallow
they're doing that fast as possible

4326
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:39,010
they're doing that fast as possible
 

4327
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:41,310
they're doing that fast as possible
they're doing shallow analysis so they

4328
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:41,320
they're doing shallow analysis so they
 

4329
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,760
they're doing shallow analysis so they
are very quickly analyzing the question

4330
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:44,770
are very quickly analyzing the question
 

4331
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:46,950
are very quickly analyzing the question
and coming up with some you know key you

4332
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:46,960
and coming up with some you know key you
 

4333
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,560
and coming up with some you know key you
know key vectors or cues if you will and

4334
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:49,570
know key vectors or cues if you will and
 

4335
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:50,940
know key vectors or cues if you will and
they're taking those cue

4336
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:50,950
they're taking those cue
 

4337
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:52,710
they're taking those cue
they're very quickly going through like

4338
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:52,720
they're very quickly going through like
 

4339
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:55,590
they're very quickly going through like
their library of stuff not deeply

4340
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:55,600
their library of stuff not deeply
 

4341
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,990
their library of stuff not deeply
reasoning about what's going on and then

4342
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,000
reasoning about what's going on and then
 

4343
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,690
reasoning about what's going on and then
sort of like a lots of different like

4344
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:00,700
sort of like a lots of different like
 

4345
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:03,330
sort of like a lots of different like
what we call these these scores which

4346
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:03,340
what we call these these scores which
 

4347
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,730
what we call these these scores which
kind of score that in a very shallow way

4348
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:05,740
kind of score that in a very shallow way
 

4349
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:07,380
kind of score that in a very shallow way
and then say oh boom you know that's

4350
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:07,390
and then say oh boom you know that's
 

4351
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:10,500
and then say oh boom you know that's
what it is and and so it's interesting

4352
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:10,510
what it is and and so it's interesting
 

4353
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:13,020
what it is and and so it's interesting
as we reflected on that so we may be

4354
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:13,030
as we reflected on that so we may be
 

4355
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:15,390
as we reflected on that so we may be
doing something that's not too far off

4356
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:15,400
doing something that's not too far off
 

4357
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,540
doing something that's not too far off
from the way humans do it but we certain

4358
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:18,550
from the way humans do it but we certain
 

4359
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:21,060
from the way humans do it but we certain
certainly didn't approach it by saying

4360
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:21,070
certainly didn't approach it by saying
 

4361
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:22,800
certainly didn't approach it by saying
you know how would you even do this now

4362
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:22,810
you know how would you even do this now
 

4363
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:25,260
you know how would you even do this now
in an elemental cognition like the

4364
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:25,270
in an elemental cognition like the
 

4365
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:27,720
in an elemental cognition like the
project I'm leading now we asked those

4366
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:27,730
project I'm leading now we asked those
 

4367
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:29,010
project I'm leading now we asked those
questions all the time because

4368
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,020
questions all the time because
 

4369
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,440
questions all the time because
ultimately we're trying to do something

4370
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:31,450
ultimately we're trying to do something
 

4371
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:34,500
ultimately we're trying to do something
that is to make the the the intelligence

4372
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:34,510
that is to make the the the intelligence
 

4373
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,790
that is to make the the the intelligence
in the machine and the intelligence of

4374
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:35,800
in the machine and the intelligence of
 

4375
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:36,960
in the machine and the intelligence of
the human very compatible

4376
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:36,970
the human very compatible
 

4377
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:38,940
the human very compatible
well compatible in the sense they can

4378
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:38,950
well compatible in the sense they can
 

4379
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:41,190
well compatible in the sense they can
communicate with one another and they

4380
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:41,200
communicate with one another and they
 

4381
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,050
communicate with one another and they
can reason with this shared

4382
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:43,060
can reason with this shared
 

4383
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:45,930
can reason with this shared
understanding so how they think about

4384
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:45,940
understanding so how they think about
 

4385
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:48,090
understanding so how they think about
things and how they build answers how

4386
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:48,100
things and how they build answers how
 

4387
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,280
things and how they build answers how
they build explanations becomes a very

4388
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:50,290
they build explanations becomes a very
 

4389
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:52,440
they build explanations becomes a very
important question to consider so what's

4390
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:52,450
important question to consider so what's
 

4391
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:56,090
important question to consider so what's
the difference between this open domain

4392
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:56,100
the difference between this open domain
 

4393
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:01,050
the difference between this open domain
but cold constructed question answering

4394
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:01,060
but cold constructed question answering
 

4395
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:05,940
but cold constructed question answering
or jeopardy and more something that

4396
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:05,950
or jeopardy and more something that
 

4397
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:07,950
or jeopardy and more something that
requires understanding for shared

4398
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:07,960
requires understanding for shared
 

4399
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,750
requires understanding for shared
communication with humans and machines

4400
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:09,760
communication with humans and machines
 

4401
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,760
communication with humans and machines
yeah well this goes back to the

4402
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:11,770
yeah well this goes back to the
 

4403
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:14,010
yeah well this goes back to the
interpretation of what we were talking

4404
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:14,020
interpretation of what we were talking
 

4405
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:16,710
interpretation of what we were talking
about before anyway jeopardy the systems

4406
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:16,720
about before anyway jeopardy the systems
 

4407
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,320
about before anyway jeopardy the systems
on trying to interpret the question and

4408
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:19,330
on trying to interpret the question and
 

4409
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:20,610
on trying to interpret the question and
that's not interpreting the content

4410
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:20,620
that's not interpreting the content
 

4411
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,680
that's not interpreting the content
that's reasoning and with regard to any

4412
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:22,690
that's reasoning and with regard to any
 

4413
01:28:22,690 --> 01:28:24,780
that's reasoning and with regard to any
particular framework I mean it's it is

4414
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:24,790
particular framework I mean it's it is
 

4415
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:26,820
particular framework I mean it's it is
parsing it and like parsing the contents

4416
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:26,830
parsing it and like parsing the contents
 

4417
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:28,890
parsing it and like parsing the contents
and using grammatical cues and stuff

4418
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:28,900
and using grammatical cues and stuff
 

4419
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,870
and using grammatical cues and stuff
like that so if you think of grammar as

4420
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:30,880
like that so if you think of grammar as
 

4421
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,340
like that so if you think of grammar as
a human framework in some sense and as

4422
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:32,350
a human framework in some sense and as
 

4423
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:35,190
a human framework in some sense and as
that but when you get into the richer

4424
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:35,200
that but when you get into the richer
 

4425
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,890
that but when you get into the richer
semantic frameworks what are people how

4426
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:37,900
semantic frameworks what are people how
 

4427
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:40,230
semantic frameworks what are people how
do they think what motivates them what

4428
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:40,240
do they think what motivates them what
 

4429
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:41,670
do they think what motivates them what
are the events that are occurring and

4430
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:41,680
are the events that are occurring and
 

4431
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,020
are the events that are occurring and
why are they occurring and what causes

4432
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:43,030
why are they occurring and what causes
 

4433
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:45,600
why are they occurring and what causes
what else to happen and and and when it

4434
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:45,610
what else to happen and and and when it
 

4435
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:47,520
what else to happen and and and when it
where are things in time and space and

4436
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:47,530
where are things in time and space and
 

4437
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:48,900
where are things in time and space and
it's like when you started thinking

4438
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:48,910
it's like when you started thinking
 

4439
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:51,780
it's like when you started thinking
about how humans formulate and structure

4440
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:51,790
about how humans formulate and structure
 

4441
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:53,070
about how humans formulate and structure
the knowledge that they acquire in their

4442
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:53,080
the knowledge that they acquire in their
 

4443
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:57,630
the knowledge that they acquire in their
head and wasn't doing any of that what

4444
01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:57,640
head and wasn't doing any of that what
 

4445
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,410
head and wasn't doing any of that what
do you think are the essential

4446
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:00,420
do you think are the essential
 

4447
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:03,180
do you think are the essential
challenges of like free flowing

4448
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:03,190
challenges of like free flowing
 

4449
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:04,700
challenges of like free flowing
communication free flowing

4450
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:04,710
communication free flowing

01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:08,300
communication free flowing
log versus question-answering even with

dialogue yep

4456
01:29:11,690 --> 01:29:11,700
dialogue yep
 

4457
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:16,690
dialogue yep
do you see free-flowing dialogue as a

4458
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:16,700
do you see free-flowing dialogue as a
 

4459
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,860
do you see free-flowing dialogue as a
fundamentally more difficult than

4460
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:18,870
fundamentally more difficult than
 

4461
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:23,750
fundamentally more difficult than
question answering even with shared so

4462
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:23,760
question answering even with shared so
 

4463
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,120
question answering even with shared so
dialogue is as important in number of

4464
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:26,130
dialogue is as important in number of
 

4465
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:27,380
dialogue is as important in number of
different ways I mean it's a challenge

4466
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:27,390
different ways I mean it's a challenge
 

4467
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:29,330
different ways I mean it's a challenge
so first of all when I think about the

4468
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:29,340
so first of all when I think about the
 

4469
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,010
so first of all when I think about the
machine that when I think about a

4470
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:31,020
machine that when I think about a
 

4471
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:32,800
machine that when I think about a
machine that understands language and

4472
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:32,810
machine that understands language and
 

4473
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:36,050
machine that understands language and
ultimately can reason in an objective

that system ultimately needs to be able
to talk to humans or I needs to be able

01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:59,000

01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,010
that it it that like sometimes people
 

4493
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,880
that it it that like sometimes people
talk about dialogue and they think you

4494
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:01,890
talk about dialogue and they think you
 

4495
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:03,470
talk about dialogue and they think you
know how do humans talk how do you

4496
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:03,480
know how do humans talk how do you
 

4497
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,050
know how do humans talk how do you
montork talk to each other in a casual

4498
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:06,060
montork talk to each other in a casual
 

4499
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:08,870
montork talk to each other in a casual
conversation then you could mimic casual

4500
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:08,880
conversation then you could mimic casual
 

4501
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,530

01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,750
to help you think and help you reason
about your answers and explain why so

4510
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:23,760
about your answers and explain why so
 

4511
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,580
about your answers and explain why so
instead of like talking to your friend

4512

instead of like talking to your friend

01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:31,040
having a small talk conversation with
your friend down the street this is more

your friend down the street this is more
 

4519
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:32,360
your friend down the street this is more
about like you would be communicating to

gonna ask you questions you're gonna

4532
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:41,220
gonna ask you questions you're gonna
 

4533
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:43,310
gonna ask you questions you're gonna
answer those questions I'm gonna go back

4534
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:43,320
answer those questions I'm gonna go back
 

4535
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,780
answer those questions I'm gonna go back
and forth with you I'm gonna figure out

4536
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:44,790
and forth with you I'm gonna figure out
 

4537
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:47,450
and forth with you I'm gonna figure out
what your mental model is I'm gonna I'm

4538
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:47,460
what your mental model is I'm gonna I'm
 

4539
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,340
what your mental model is I'm gonna I'm
gonna now relate that to the information

4540
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:49,350
gonna now relate that to the information
 

4541
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:51,410
gonna now relate that to the information
I have and present it to you in a way

4542
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:51,420
I have and present it to you in a way
 

4543
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:53,390
I have and present it to you in a way
that you can understand it and we could

4544
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:53,400
that you can understand it and we could
 

4545
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,760
that you can understand it and we could
ask follow-up questions so it's that

4546
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:55,770
ask follow-up questions so it's that
 

4547
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:57,230
ask follow-up questions so it's that
type of dialogue that you want to

4548
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:57,240
type of dialogue that you want to
 

4549
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:00,680
type of dialogue that you want to
construct it's more structured it's more

4550
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:00,690
construct it's more structured it's more
 

4551
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:03,830
construct it's more structured it's more
goal oriented but it needs to be fluid

4552
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:03,840
goal oriented but it needs to be fluid
 

4553
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,160

to be engaging and fluid it has to be
 

4557
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:13,640
to be engaging and fluid it has to be
productive and not distracting so there

4558
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:13,650
productive and not distracting so there
 

4559
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:16,220
productive and not distracting so there
has to be a model of the words the

has to be a model of the words the
 

4561
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:17,900

4573
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:42,290
to this pocket as in joking I'll ask you
about humor as well actually but what's

01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:42,300
about humor as well actually but what's
 

4575
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,610
about humor as well actually but what's
the hardest part of that because it

4576

the hardest part of that because it
 

4577
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:46,670
the hardest part of that because it
seems we were quite far away as a

were or maybe maybe any aspect of it you

4600
01:32:17,779 --> 01:32:17,789
were or maybe maybe any aspect of it you
 

4601
01:32:17,789 --> 01:32:19,309
were or maybe maybe any aspect of it you
can comment on because it's so shrouded

4602

can comment on because it's so shrouded
 

4603
01:32:19,319 --> 01:32:22,759

01:33:36,559 --> 01:33:36,569
recently came out IBM was the debate or
 

4663
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,359
recently came out IBM was the debate or
projects and surest thing right because

projects and surest thing right because
 

4665
01:33:38,369 --> 01:33:39,919
projects and surest thing right because
now you had you do have these structured

now you had you do have these structured
 

4667
01:33:39,929 --> 01:33:42,859
now you had you do have these structured
dialogues these debate things where they

debates dialogues are a little bit
 

4675
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:53,869

lots of other structural arguments like
 

4681
01:33:57,659 --> 01:33:59,149
lots of other structural arguments like
this you could potentially annotate that

I have to be responsive and I have to be

I have to be responsive and I have to be
 

4691
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:10,190
I have to be responsive and I have to be
opportunistic with regard to what is the

4692
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:10,200
opportunistic with regard to what is the
 

4693
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,800
opportunistic with regard to what is the
human saying what so I'm goal-oriented

4694
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:12,810
human saying what so I'm goal-oriented
 

4695
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,930
human saying what so I'm goal-oriented
and saying I want to solve the problem I

4696
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:14,940
and saying I want to solve the problem I
 

4697
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:15,860
and saying I want to solve the problem I
want to acquire the knowledge necessary

4698
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:15,870
want to acquire the knowledge necessary
 

4699
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:18,410
want to acquire the knowledge necessary
but I also have to be opportunistic and

4700
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:18,420
but I also have to be opportunistic and
 

4701
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:20,150
but I also have to be opportunistic and
responsive to what the human is saying

4702

responsive to what the human is saying
 

4703
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,240

so I think that it's not clear that we

4704
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:23,250
so I think that it's not clear that we
 

4705
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,070
so I think that it's not clear that we
could just train on a body of data to do

4706
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:25,080
could just train on a body of data to do
 

4707
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:28,130
could just train on a body of data to do
this but we could bootstrap it in other

4708
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:28,140
this but we could bootstrap it in other
 

4709
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,320
this but we could bootstrap it in other
words we can be creative and we could

4710
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:30,330
words we can be creative and we could
 

4711
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:32,090
words we can be creative and we could
say what do we think what do we think

4712
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:32,100
say what do we think what do we think
 

4713
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,130
say what do we think what do we think
the structure of a good dialogue is that

4714
01:34:34,130 --> 01:34:34,140
the structure of a good dialogue is that
 

4715
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:36,530
the structure of a good dialogue is that
does this well and we can start to

4716
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:36,540
does this well and we can start to
 

4717
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:39,290
does this well and we can start to
create that if we can if we can create

4718
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:39,300
create that if we can if we can create
 

4719
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,030
create that if we can if we can create
that more programmatic programmatically

4720
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:41,040
that more programmatic programmatically
 

4721
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:44,180
that more programmatic programmatically
at least to get this process started and

4722
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:44,190
at least to get this process started and
 

4723
01:34:44,190 --> 01:34:46,520
at least to get this process started and
I can create a tool that now engages

4724
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:46,530
I can create a tool that now engages
 

4725
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:49,130
I can create a tool that now engages
humans effectively I could start both I

4726
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:49,140
humans effectively I could start both I
 

4727
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:51,530
humans effectively I could start both I
could start generating data I could

4728
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:51,540
could start generating data I could
 

4729
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:52,880
could start generating data I could
start with the human learning process

4730
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:52,890
start with the human learning process
 

4731
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:55,370
start with the human learning process
and I can update my machine but I can

4732
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:55,380
and I can update my machine but I can
 

4733
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:56,600
and I can update my machine but I can
also start the automatic learning

4734
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:56,610
also start the automatic learning
 

4735
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:59,780
also start the automatic learning
process as well but I have to understand

4736
01:34:59,780 --> 01:34:59,790
process as well but I have to understand
 

4737
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:01,970
process as well but I have to understand
what features to even learn over so I

4738
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:01,980
what features to even learn over so I
 

4739
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,500
what features to even learn over so I
have to bootstrap the process a little

4740
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:03,510
have to bootstrap the process a little
 

4741
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:05,990
have to bootstrap the process a little
bit first and that's a creative design

4742
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:06,000
bit first and that's a creative design
 

4743
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,760
bit first and that's a creative design
task that I could then use as input into

4744
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:10,770
task that I could then use as input into
 

4745
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:13,580
task that I could then use as input into
a more automatic learning task this is

4746
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:13,590
a more automatic learning task this is
 

4747
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:16,190
a more automatic learning task this is
some creativity and bootstrapping all

4748
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:16,200
some creativity and bootstrapping all

4801
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,430
connect to the kind of creativity you
mentioned that's needed I think there's

4802
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:25,440
mentioned that's needed I think there's
 

4803
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,070
mentioned that's needed I think there's
a couple things going on there so I I I

4804
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:28,080
a couple things going on there so I I I
 

4805
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,770
a couple things going on there so I I I
sort of feel like and I might be too

4806
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:30,780
sort of feel like and I might be too
 

4807
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:32,510
sort of feel like and I might be too
optimistic this way but I think that

4808
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:32,520
optimistic this way but I think that
 

4809
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,050
optimistic this way but I think that
there are we did a little bit about with

4810
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:36,060
there are we did a little bit about with
 

4811
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,600
there are we did a little bit about with
with this and with puns and in jeopardy

4812
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:38,610
with this and with puns and in jeopardy
 

4813
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:41,150
with this and with puns and in jeopardy
we literally sat down and said well you

4814
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:41,160
we literally sat down and said well you
 

4815
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,939
we literally sat down and said well you
know how do puns work and you know it's

4816
01:36:43,939 --> 01:36:43,949
know how do puns work and you know it's
 

4817
01:36:43,949 --> 01:36:45,590
know how do puns work and you know it's
like wordplay and you could formalize

4818
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:45,600
like wordplay and you could formalize
 

4819
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,000
like wordplay and you could formalize
these things so I think there's a lot

4820
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:47,010
these things so I think there's a lot
 

4821
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:48,709
these things so I think there's a lot
aspects of humor that you could

4822
01:36:48,709 --> 01:36:48,719
aspects of humor that you could
 

4823
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:51,500
aspects of humor that you could
formalize you could also learn new Murr

4824
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:51,510
formalize you could also learn new Murr
 

4825
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:52,670
formalize you could also learn new Murr
you could just say what do people laugh

4826
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:52,680
you could just say what do people laugh
 

4827
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:55,010
you could just say what do people laugh
at and if you have enough again if you

4828
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:55,020
at and if you have enough again if you
 

4829
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:56,270
at and if you have enough again if you
have enough data to represent the

4830
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:56,280
have enough data to represent the
 

4831
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,310
have enough data to represent the
phenomenon you know might be able to you

4832
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:58,320
phenomenon you know might be able to you
 

4833
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,780
phenomenon you know might be able to you
know weigh the features and figure out

4834
01:36:59,780 --> 01:36:59,790
know weigh the features and figure out
 

4835

you know what humans find funny and what
 

4837
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:02,120
you know what humans find funny and what
they don't find funny

4838

01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:03,690
you might the Machine might not be able
 

4841
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:06,979
you might the Machine might not be able
to explain why the my buddy unless we

4842
01:37:06,979 --> 01:37:06,989
to explain why the my buddy unless we
 

4843
01:37:06,989 --> 01:37:09,080
to explain why the my buddy unless we
unless we sit back and think about that

4844
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:09,090
unless we sit back and think about that
 

4845
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:11,330
unless we sit back and think about that
more formally I think again I think you

4846
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:11,340
more formally I think again I think you
 

4847
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:13,100
more formally I think again I think you
do a combination of both and I'm always

4848
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:13,110
do a combination of both and I'm always
 

4849
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:14,540
do a combination of both and I'm always
a big proponent that I think you know

4850
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:14,550
a big proponent that I think you know
 

4851
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:16,760
a big proponent that I think you know
robust architectures and approaches are

4852
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:16,770
robust architectures and approaches are
 

4853
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:18,620
robust architectures and approaches are
always a little bit combination of us

4854
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:18,630
always a little bit combination of us
 

4855
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:20,720
always a little bit combination of us
reflecting and being creative about how

4856
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:20,730
reflecting and being creative about how
 

4857
01:37:20,730 --> 01:37:22,640
reflecting and being creative about how
things are structured and how to

4858
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:22,650
things are structured and how to
 

4859
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:24,500
things are structured and how to
formalize them and then taking advantage

4860
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:24,510
formalize them and then taking advantage
 

4861
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:26,270
formalize them and then taking advantage
of large data and doing learning and

4862
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:26,280
of large data and doing learning and
 

4863
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,080
of large data and doing learning and
figuring how to combine these two

4864
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:27,090
figuring how to combine these two
 

4865
01:37:27,090 --> 01:37:29,630
figuring how to combine these two
approaches I think there's another

4866
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:29,640
approaches I think there's another
 

4867
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:31,520
approaches I think there's another
aspect of human to human though which

4868
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:31,530
aspect of human to human though which
 

4869
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:33,890
aspect of human to human though which
goes to the idea that I feel like I can

4870
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:33,900
goes to the idea that I feel like I can
 

4871
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:35,540
goes to the idea that I feel like I can
relate to the person telling the story

4872
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:35,550
relate to the person telling the story
 

4873
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:38,479
relate to the person telling the story
telling the person telling the story and

01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:38,489
telling the person telling the story and
 

4875
01:37:38,489 --> 01:37:40,729
telling the person telling the story and
I think that's that's a interesting

4876
01:37:40,729 --> 01:37:40,739
I think that's that's a interesting
 

4877
01:37:40,739 --> 01:37:45,110
I think that's that's a interesting
theme in the whole AI theme which is do

I feel differently when I know it's a
 

4881
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,630
I feel differently when I know it's a
robot and when I know when I imagine

4882
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:50,640
robot and when I know when I imagine
 

4883
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,880
robot and when I know when I imagine
there's a row but is not conscious the

4884
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:52,890
there's a row but is not conscious the
 

4885
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:55,100
there's a row but is not conscious the
way I'm conscious when they imagine the

4886
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:55,110
way I'm conscious when they imagine the
 

4887
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,479
way I'm conscious when they imagine the
robot does not actually have the

4888
01:37:56,479 --> 01:37:56,489
robot does not actually have the
 

4889
01:37:56,489 --> 01:37:59,209
robot does not actually have the
experiences that I experience do I find

4890
01:37:59,209 --> 01:37:59,219
experiences that I experience do I find
 

4891
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:02,330
experiences that I experience do I find
it you know funny or do because it's not

4892
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:02,340
it you know funny or do because it's not
 

4893
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:05,209
it you know funny or do because it's not
as related I don't imagine that the

4894
01:38:05,209 --> 01:38:05,219
as related I don't imagine that the
 

4895
01:38:05,219 --> 01:38:06,709
as related I don't imagine that the
person is relating it to it the way I

4896
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:06,719
person is relating it to it the way I
 

4897
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:09,470
person is relating it to it the way I
relate to it I think this also you see

4898
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:09,480
relate to it I think this also you see
 

4899
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,200
relate to it I think this also you see
this in in the arts and in entertainment

4900
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:12,210
this in in the arts and in entertainment
 

4901
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:14,810
this in in the arts and in entertainment
where like you know sometimes you have

01:38:14,810 --> 01:38:14,820
where like you know sometimes you have
 

4903
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:16,820
where like you know sometimes you have
savants who are remarkable at a thing

way they
 

4917
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,200
way they
in other words who can basically make

01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:33,210
in other words who can basically make

in other words who can basically make
the connection from the artifact from

4920
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:35,970
the connection from the artifact from
 

4921
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:37,100
the connection from the artifact from
the music of the painting of the

4922
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:37,110
the music of the painting of the
 

4923
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:40,100
the music of the painting of the
sculpture to the to the emotion and get

4924
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:40,110
sculpture to the to the emotion and get
 

4925
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,870
sculpture to the to the emotion and get
you to share that emotion with them and

4926
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:41,880
you to share that emotion with them and
 

4927
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,640
you to share that emotion with them and
then and that's when it becomes

4928
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:43,650
then and that's when it becomes
 

4929
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:45,800
then and that's when it becomes
compelling so they're communicating at a

4930
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:45,810
compelling so they're communicating at a
 

4931
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:47,390
compelling so they're communicating at a
whole different level they're just not

4932
01:38:47,390 --> 01:38:47,400
whole different level they're just not
 

4933
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,430
whole different level they're just not
communicating the artifact they're

4934
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:49,440
communicating the artifact they're
 

4935
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,810
communicating the artifact they're
communicating their emotional response

4936
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:50,820
communicating their emotional response
 

4937
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:52,700
communicating their emotional response
to the artifact and then you feel like

4938
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:52,710
to the artifact and then you feel like
 

4939
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:54,740
to the artifact and then you feel like
oh wow I can relate to that person I can

4940
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:54,750
oh wow I can relate to that person I can
 

4941
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,270
oh wow I can relate to that person I can
connect to that I can connect to that

4942
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:56,280
connect to that I can connect to that
 

4943
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:58,730
connect to that I can connect to that
person so I think humor has that has

4944
01:38:58,730 --> 01:38:58,740
person so I think humor has that has
 

4945
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:02,780
person so I think humor has that has
that aspect as well so the idea that you

4946
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:02,790
that aspect as well so the idea that you
 

4947
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:05,270
that aspect as well so the idea that you
can connect to that person person being

4948
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:05,280
can connect to that person person being
 

4949
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:09,140
can connect to that person person being
the critical thing but we're also able

4950
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:09,150
the critical thing but we're also able
 

4951
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:11,950
the critical thing but we're also able
to anthropomorphize objects pretty

4952
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:11,960
to anthropomorphize objects pretty
 

4953
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:14,510
to anthropomorphize objects pretty
robots and AI systems pretty well

4954
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:14,520
robots and AI systems pretty well
 

4955
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,690
robots and AI systems pretty well
so we're almost looking to make them

4956
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:17,700
so we're almost looking to make them
 

4957
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:20,120
so we're almost looking to make them
human there may be from your experience

01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:23,000
human there may be from your experience
with Watson maybe you can comment on did

4960
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:23,010
with Watson maybe you can comment on did
 

4961
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:25,640
with Watson maybe you can comment on did
you consider that as part well obviously

4962
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:25,650
you consider that as part well obviously
 

4963
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:27,680
you consider that as part well obviously
the problem of Jeopardy doesn't require

4964
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:27,690
the problem of Jeopardy doesn't require
 

4965
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:29,600
the problem of Jeopardy doesn't require
int the promotoras ation but

4966
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:29,610
int the promotoras ation but
 

4967
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:31,280
int the promotoras ation but
nevertheless well there was some

4968
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:31,290
nevertheless well there was some
 

4969
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:32,630
nevertheless well there was some
interest in doing that and I've that's

4970
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:32,640
interest in doing that and I've that's
 

4971
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,430
interest in doing that and I've that's
an that's another thing I didn't want to

4972
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:34,440
an that's another thing I didn't want to
 

4973
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,590
an that's another thing I didn't want to
do so I didn't want to distract from the

4974
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:36,600
do so I didn't want to distract from the
 

4975
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,480
do so I didn't want to distract from the
from the actual scientific test nights

4976
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:38,490
from the actual scientific test nights
 

4977
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:40,730
from the actual scientific test nights
so you're absolutely right I mean humans

4978
01:39:40,730 --> 01:39:40,740
so you're absolutely right I mean humans
 

4979
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:44,510
so you're absolutely right I mean humans
do anthropomorphize and and without

4980
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:44,520
do anthropomorphize and and without
 

4981
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,430
do anthropomorphize and and without
necessarily a lot of work I mean just

4982
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:46,440
necessarily a lot of work I mean just
 

4983
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,140
necessarily a lot of work I mean just
put some eyes in a couple of eyebrow

4984
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:48,150
put some eyes in a couple of eyebrow
 

4985
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:50,270
put some eyes in a couple of eyebrow
movements and you're getting humans to

4986
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:50,280
movements and you're getting humans to
 

4987
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:52,850
movements and you're getting humans to
react emotionally and I and I think you

4988
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:52,860
react emotionally and I and I think you
 

4989
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:55,010
react emotionally and I and I think you
can do that so I didn't mean to suggest

4990
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:55,020
can do that so I didn't mean to suggest
 

4991
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:59,960
can do that so I didn't mean to suggest
that that that connection can't cannot

4992
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,970
that that that connection can't cannot
 

4993
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:01,610
that that that connection can't cannot
be mimicked I think that connection can

4994

be mimicked I think that connection can
 

4995
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:04,580
be mimicked I think that connection can
be mimicked and can get you to can

01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:04,590
be mimicked and can get you to can
 

4997
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:07,580
be mimicked and can get you to can
produce that emotional response I just

4998
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:07,590
produce that emotional response I just
 

4999
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:11,330
produce that emotional response I just
wonder though if you're told what's

5000
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:11,340
wonder though if you're told what's
 

5001
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:15,980
wonder though if you're told what's
really going on if you know that the

5002
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:15,990
really going on if you know that the
 

5003
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:17,720
really going on if you know that the
machine is not conscious not having the

01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:17,730
machine is not conscious not having the
 

5005
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:20,780
machine is not conscious not having the
same richness of emotional reactions and

5006
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:20,790
same richness of emotional reactions and
 

5007
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:22,130
same richness of emotional reactions and
understanding that doesn't really share

5008
01:40:22,130 --> 01:40:22,140
understanding that doesn't really share
 

5009
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:23,960
understanding that doesn't really share
the understanding but is essentially

01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:23,970
the understanding but is essentially

5051
01:41:08,789 --> 01:41:10,969
into the science fiction shop you're on
right now but yeah I think it's actually

5052
01:41:10,969 --> 01:41:10,979
right now but yeah I think it's actually

I think it's reality I think it's a

5058
01:41:15,409 --> 01:41:15,419
I think it's reality I think it's a
 

5059
01:41:15,419 --> 01:41:18,290
I think it's reality I think it's a
really powerful one that will have to be

01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:18,300
really powerful one that will have to be
 

5061
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:20,779
really powerful one that will have to be
exploring in the next few decades it's a

01:41:20,779 --> 01:41:20,789
exploring in the next few decades it's a
 

5063
01:41:20,789 --> 01:41:23,449
exploring in the next few decades it's a
very interesting element of intelligence

5064
01:41:23,449 --> 01:41:23,459
very interesting element of intelligence
 

5065
01:41:23,459 --> 01:41:25,759
very interesting element of intelligence
so what do you think we've talked about

5066
01:41:25,759 --> 01:41:25,769
so what do you think we've talked about
 

5067
01:41:25,769 --> 01:41:28,119
so what do you think we've talked about
social constructs of intelligences and

5068
01:41:28,119 --> 01:41:28,129
social constructs of intelligences and
 

5069
01:41:28,129 --> 01:41:31,339
social constructs of intelligences and
and frameworks and the way humans kind

5070
01:41:31,339 --> 01:41:31,349
and frameworks and the way humans kind
 

5071
01:41:31,349 --> 01:41:34,189
and frameworks and the way humans kind
of interpret information what do you

5072
01:41:34,189 --> 01:41:34,199
of interpret information what do you
 

5073
01:41:34,199 --> 01:41:35,779
of interpret information what do you
think is a good test of intelligence in

5074
01:41:35,779 --> 01:41:35,789
think is a good test of intelligence in
 

5075
01:41:35,789 --> 01:41:38,989
think is a good test of intelligence in
your view so there's the Alan Turing

5076
01:41:38,989 --> 01:41:38,999
your view so there's the Alan Turing
 

5077
01:41:38,999 --> 01:41:40,659
your view so there's the Alan Turing
with the Turing test

5078
01:41:40,659 --> 01:41:40,669
with the Turing test
 

5079
01:41:40,669 --> 01:41:42,379
with the Turing test
Watson accomplished something very

5080
01:41:42,379 --> 01:41:42,389
Watson accomplished something very
 

5081
01:41:42,389 --> 01:41:45,679
Watson accomplished something very
impressive with Jeopardy what do you

5082
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:45,689
impressive with Jeopardy what do you
 

5083
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:48,830
impressive with Jeopardy what do you
think is a test that would impress the

5084
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:48,840
think is a test that would impress the
 

5085
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:50,899
think is a test that would impress the
heck out of you that you saw that a

5086
01:41:50,899 --> 01:41:50,909
heck out of you that you saw that a
 

5087
01:41:50,909 --> 01:41:53,869
heck out of you that you saw that a
computer could do they say this is

5088
01:41:53,869 --> 01:41:53,879
computer could do they say this is
 

5089
01:41:53,879 --> 01:41:57,889
computer could do they say this is
crossing a kind of threshold that's that

5090
01:41:57,889 --> 01:41:57,899
crossing a kind of threshold that's that
 

5091
01:41:57,899 --> 01:42:02,839
crossing a kind of threshold that's that
gives me pause in a good way

5092
01:42:02,839 --> 01:42:02,849

 

5093
01:42:02,849 --> 01:42:05,199

expectations for a are generally high

5094
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:05,209
expectations for a are generally high
 

5095
01:42:05,209 --> 01:42:07,399
expectations for a are generally high
what does high look like by the way so

5096
01:42:07,399 --> 01:42:07,409
what does high look like by the way so
 

5097
01:42:07,409 --> 01:42:09,489
what does high look like by the way so
not the threshold test as a threshold

5098
01:42:09,489 --> 01:42:09,499
not the threshold test as a threshold
 

5099
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:12,009
not the threshold test as a threshold
what do you think is the destination

5100
01:42:12,009 --> 01:42:12,019
what do you think is the destination
 

5101
01:42:12,019 --> 01:42:14,479
what do you think is the destination
what do you think is the ceiling

5102
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:14,489
what do you think is the ceiling
 

5103
01:42:14,489 --> 01:42:18,379
what do you think is the ceiling
I think machines will in many measures

5104
01:42:18,379 --> 01:42:18,389
I think machines will in many measures
 

5105
01:42:18,389 --> 01:42:21,020
I think machines will in many measures
will be better than us will become more

5106
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:21,030
will be better than us will become more
 

5107
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:22,279
will be better than us will become more
effective in other words better

5108
01:42:22,279 --> 01:42:22,289
effective in other words better
 

5109
01:42:22,289 --> 01:42:25,310
effective in other words better
predictors about a lot of things and

5110
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:25,320
predictors about a lot of things and
 

5111
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,159
predictors about a lot of things and
then then then ultimately we can do I

5112
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:28,169
then then then ultimately we can do I
 

5113
01:42:28,169 --> 01:42:30,290
then then then ultimately we can do I
think where they're gonna struggle is

5114
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:30,300
think where they're gonna struggle is
 

5115
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:33,909
think where they're gonna struggle is
what we talked about before which is

5116
01:42:33,909 --> 01:42:33,919
what we talked about before which is
 

5117
01:42:33,919 --> 01:42:36,649
what we talked about before which is
relating to communicating with and

5118
01:42:36,649 --> 01:42:36,659
relating to communicating with and
 

5119
01:42:36,659 --> 01:42:40,729
relating to communicating with and
understanding humans in deeper ways and

5120
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:40,739
understanding humans in deeper ways and
 

5121
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:42,560
understanding humans in deeper ways and
and so I think that's a key point like

5122
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:42,570
and so I think that's a key point like
 

5123
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:44,989
and so I think that's a key point like
we can create the super parrot what I

5124
01:42:44,989 --> 01:42:44,999
we can create the super parrot what I
 

5125
01:42:44,999 --> 01:42:47,299
we can create the super parrot what I
mean by the super parrot is given enough

5126
01:42:47,299 --> 01:42:47,309
mean by the super parrot is given enough
 

5127
01:42:47,309 --> 01:42:49,129
mean by the super parrot is given enough

logical interpretation or understanding
 

5153
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:24,560
logical interpretation or understanding
that would ultimately satisfy a critical

01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:24,570
that would ultimately satisfy a critical

that would ultimately satisfy a critical
interrogation or a critical

understanding I think you guys describe

5158
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:28,590
understanding I think you guys describe
 

5159
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:30,080
understanding I think you guys describe
me in a nutshell

5160
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:30,090
me in a nutshell
 

5161
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:33,799
me in a nutshell
I think I think philosophically speaking

5162
01:43:33,799 --> 01:43:33,809
I think I think philosophically speaking
 

5163
01:43:33,809 --> 01:43:36,259
I think I think philosophically speaking
you could argue that that's all we're

5164
01:43:36,259 --> 01:43:36,269
you could argue that that's all we're
 

5165
01:43:36,269 --> 01:43:38,239
you could argue that that's all we're
doing as human beings to war so I was

5166
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:38,249
doing as human beings to war so I was
 

5167
01:43:38,249 --> 01:43:40,429
doing as human beings to war so I was
gonna say it's very possible you know

5168
01:43:40,429 --> 01:43:40,439
gonna say it's very possible you know
 

5169
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:42,919
gonna say it's very possible you know
humans do behave that way too and so

5170
01:43:42,919 --> 01:43:42,929
humans do behave that way too and so
 

5171
01:43:42,929 --> 01:43:44,959
humans do behave that way too and so
upon deeper probing and deeper

5172
01:43:44,959 --> 01:43:44,969
upon deeper probing and deeper
 

5173
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:46,849
upon deeper probing and deeper
interrogation you may find out that

5174
01:43:46,849 --> 01:43:46,859
interrogation you may find out that
 

5175
01:43:46,859 --> 01:43:48,129
interrogation you may find out that
there isn't a shared understanding

5176
01:43:48,129 --> 01:43:48,139
there isn't a shared understanding
 

5177
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:50,389
there isn't a shared understanding
because I think humans do both like

5178
01:43:50,389 --> 01:43:50,399
because I think humans do both like
 

5179
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:52,399
because I think humans do both like
humans are statistical language model

5180
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:52,409
humans are statistical language model
 

5181
01:43:52,409 --> 01:43:56,029
humans are statistical language model
machines and and and they are capable

5182
01:43:56,029 --> 01:43:56,039
machines and and and they are capable
 

5183
01:43:56,039 --> 01:43:59,060
machines and and and they are capable
reasoner's you know they're they're both

5184
01:43:59,060 --> 01:43:59,070
reasoner's you know they're they're both
 

5185
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:01,689
reasoner's you know they're they're both
and you don't know which is going on

5186
01:44:01,689 --> 01:44:01,699
and you don't know which is going on
 

5187
01:44:01,699 --> 01:44:05,629
and you don't know which is going on
right so and I think it's I think it's

5188
01:44:05,629 --> 01:44:05,639
right so and I think it's I think it's
 

5189
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:09,859
right so and I think it's I think it's
an interesting problem we talked earlier

5190
01:44:09,859 --> 01:44:09,869
an interesting problem we talked earlier
 

5191
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:12,409
an interesting problem we talked earlier
about like where we are in our social

5192
01:44:12,409 --> 01:44:12,419
about like where we are in our social
 

5193
01:44:12,419 --> 01:44:15,049
about like where we are in our social
and political landscape can you

5194
01:44:15,049 --> 01:44:15,059
and political landscape can you
 

5195
01:44:15,059 --> 01:44:16,490
and political landscape can you
distinguish some

5196
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:16,500
distinguish some
 

5197
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:19,820
distinguish some
who can string words together and sound

5198
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:19,830
who can string words together and sound
 

5199
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:20,960
who can string words together and sound
like they know what they're talking

5200
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:20,970
like they know what they're talking
 

5201
01:44:20,970 --> 01:44:24,170
like they know what they're talking
about from someone who actually does can

5202
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:24,180
about from someone who actually does can

01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:25,910
about from someone who actually does can
you do that without dialogue without

5204
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:25,920
you do that without dialogue without
 

5205
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,450
you do that without dialogue without
integrity of a programming dialogue so

5206
01:44:29,450 --> 01:44:29,460
integrity of a programming dialogue so
 

5207
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:31,040
integrity of a programming dialogue so
it's interesting because humans are

5208
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:31,050
it's interesting because humans are
 

5209
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:33,370
it's interesting because humans are
really good at in their own mind

5210
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:33,380
really good at in their own mind
 

5211
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:35,540
really good at in their own mind
justifying or explaining what they hear

5212
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:35,550
justifying or explaining what they hear
 

5213
01:44:35,550 --> 01:44:38,270
justifying or explaining what they hear
because they project their understanding

5214
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:38,280
because they project their understanding
 

5215
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,640
because they project their understanding
on onto yours so you could say you could

5216
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:40,650
on onto yours so you could say you could
 

5217
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:43,090
on onto yours so you could say you could
put together a string of words and and

5218
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:43,100
put together a string of words and and
 

5219
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:45,170
put together a string of words and and
someone will sit there and interpret in

5220
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:45,180
someone will sit there and interpret in
 

5221
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:47,180
someone will sit there and interpret in
a way that's extremely biased this is

5222
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:47,190
a way that's extremely biased this is
 

5223
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:48,230
a way that's extremely biased this is
the way they want to interpret it they

5224
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:48,240
the way they want to interpret it they
 

5225
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:49,490
the way they want to interpret it they
want to assuming you're an idiot and

5226
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:49,500
want to assuming you're an idiot and
 

5227
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,410
want to assuming you're an idiot and
they'll true put it one way they've all

01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:51,420
they'll true put it one way they've all
 

5229
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,090
they'll true put it one way they've all
seen you're a genius and interpreted

powerful framework that you could reason
over and justify your answers justify

you think they make sense can you

you think they make sense can you
 

5257
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,360
you think they make sense can you
convince me what the implications are

convince me what the implications are
 

5259

convince me what the implications are
you know can you

01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:30,270
you know can you
 

5261
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:33,950
you know can you
so can you reason intelligently and make

5262
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:33,960
so can you reason intelligently and make
 

5263
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:37,340
so can you reason intelligently and make
me believe that those um the

5264
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:37,350
me believe that those um the

you're saying that there should be a

accomplishment as well what are your
thoughts about that challenge I think it

5322
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:02,100
thoughts about that challenge I think it
 

5323
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:03,830
thoughts about that challenge I think it
was a giant lamare I I think it was

5324
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:03,840
was a giant lamare I I think it was
 

5325
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,720
was a giant lamare I I think it was
phenomenal I mean as one of those other

5326
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:05,730
phenomenal I mean as one of those other
 

5327
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:07,340

things nobody thought like solving go

5328
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:07,350
things nobody thought like solving go
 

5329
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:09,020
things nobody thought like solving go
was gonna be easy particularly because

5330
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:09,030
was gonna be easy particularly because
 

5331
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:10,760
was gonna be easy particularly because
it's again it's hard for particularly

5332
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:10,770
it's again it's hard for particularly
 

5333
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:13,670
it's again it's hard for particularly
hard for humans our team is to learn how

5334
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:13,680
hard for humans our team is to learn how
 

5335
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:16,640
hard for humans our team is to learn how
for humans to excel at and so it was up

5336
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:16,650
for humans to excel at and so it was up
 

5337
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:18,740
for humans to excel at and so it was up
another measure a measure of

intelligence it's very cool I mean it's

5340
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:22,830
intelligence it's very cool I mean it's
 

5341
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:24,920
intelligence it's very cool I mean it's
very interesting you know what they did

5342
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:24,930
very interesting you know what they did
 

5343
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:27,050
very interesting you know what they did
I mean and I loved how they solved like

5344
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:27,060
I mean and I loved how they solved like
 

5345
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:28,490
I mean and I loved how they solved like
the data problem which again they

5346
01:47:28,490 --> 01:47:28,500
the data problem which again they
 

5347
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:29,870
the data problem which again they
bootstrapped it and got the machine to

5348
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:29,880
bootstrapped it and got the machine to
 

5349
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,520
bootstrapped it and got the machine to
play itself to generate enough data to

5350
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:31,530
play itself to generate enough data to
 

5351
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:33,890
play itself to generate enough data to
learn from I think that was brilliant I

5352
01:47:33,890 --> 01:47:33,900
learn from I think that was brilliant I
 

5353
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:36,470
learn from I think that was brilliant I
think that was great and and and of

5354
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:36,480
think that was great and and and of
 

5355
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,690
think that was great and and and of
course the result speaks for itself I

5356
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:38,700
course the result speaks for itself I
 

5357
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:41,390
course the result speaks for itself I
think it makes us think about again it

5358
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:41,400
think it makes us think about again it
 

5359
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,490
think it makes us think about again it
is okay what's intelligence what aspects

5360
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:43,500
is okay what's intelligence what aspects
 

5361
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,890
is okay what's intelligence what aspects
of intelligence are important can the

5362
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:45,900
of intelligence are important can the
 

5363
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,810
of intelligence are important can the
can the go machine help me make me a

5364
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:47,820
can the go machine help me make me a
 

5365

better go player is it an alien
 

5367
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:52,340
better go player is it an alien
intelligence it was is am I even capable

5368
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:52,350
intelligence it was is am I even capable
 

5369
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:55,250
intelligence it was is am I even capable
of like again if we if we put in very

5370
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:55,260
of like again if we if we put in very
 

5371
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:57,500
of like again if we if we put in very
simple terms it found the function we

5372
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:57,510
simple terms it found the function we
 

5373
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:59,570
simple terms it found the function we
found the go function can I even

5374
01:47:59,570 --> 01:47:59,580
found the go function can I even
 

5375
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:01,340
found the go function can I even
comprehend the go function can I talk

5376
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:01,350
comprehend the go function can I talk
 

5377
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,420
comprehend the go function can I talk
about the go function can i

5378
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:02,430
about the go function can i
 

5379
01:48:02,430 --> 01:48:04,010
about the go function can i
conceptualize the go function like

5380
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:04,020
conceptualize the go function like
 

5381
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:06,140
conceptualize the go function like
whatever it might be so one of the

5382

whatever it might be so one of the
 

5383
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:08,270
whatever it might be so one of the
interesting ideas of that system is it

plays against itself right yeah but
 

5387
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:12,800
plays against itself right yeah but
there's no human in the loop there so

5388
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:12,810
there's no human in the loop there so
 

5389
01:48:12,810 --> 01:48:15,140
there's no human in the loop there so
like you're saying it could have by

like you're saying it could have by
 

5391
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:19,100
like you're saying it could have by

possible worlds that we have in the
 

5441
01:49:24,989 --> 01:49:27,830
possible worlds that we have in the
future one is where AI systems do like

5442
01:49:27,830 --> 01:49:27,840
future one is where AI systems do like
 

5443
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,709
future one is where AI systems do like
medical diagnosis or things like that

medical diagnosis or things like that
 

5445

01:49:35,969 --> 01:49:39,260
explaining to you why it fails when it
does that's one possible world then

does that's one possible world then
 

5451
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:41,359
does that's one possible world then
we're okay with it or the other where we

5452
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:41,369
we're okay with it or the other where we
 

5453
01:49:41,369 --> 01:49:43,970
we're okay with it or the other where we
are not okay with it and we really hold

5454
01:49:43,970 --> 01:49:43,980
are not okay with it and we really hold
 

5455
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:46,100
are not okay with it and we really hold
back the technology from getting to good

5456
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:46,110
back the technology from getting to good
 

5457
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:49,040
back the technology from getting to good
before it gets able to explain which of

before it gets able to explain which of
 

5459
01:49:49,050 --> 01:49:50,359
before it gets able to explain which of
those worlds are more likely do you

those worlds are more likely do you
 

5461
01:49:50,369 --> 01:49:53,240
those worlds are more likely do you
think and which are concerning to you or

01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:49,550
like I just don't know the specifics I
need the specifics of this case and I

5618
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:49,560
need the specifics of this case and I
 

5619
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,350
need the specifics of this case and I
want the deductive logical argument

5620
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,360
want the deductive logical argument
 

5621
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,089
want the deductive logical argument
about why you actually know he's brained

5622
01:52:53,089 --> 01:52:53,099
about why you actually know he's brained
 

5623
01:52:53,099 --> 01:52:54,620
about why you actually know he's brained
it so I wouldn't sign that do not

5624
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:54,630
it so I wouldn't sign that do not
 

5625
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:57,109
it so I wouldn't sign that do not
resuscitate and I don't know it was like

5626
01:52:57,109 --> 01:52:57,119
resuscitate and I don't know it was like
 

5627
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:58,669
resuscitate and I don't know it was like
they went through lots of procedures as

5628
01:52:58,669 --> 01:52:58,679
they went through lots of procedures as
 

5629
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:00,740
they went through lots of procedures as
a big long story but the bottom was a

5630
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:00,750
a big long story but the bottom was a
 

5631
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,390
a big long story but the bottom was a
fascinating story by the way but how I

5632
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:02,400
fascinating story by the way but how I
 

5633
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,280
fascinating story by the way but how I
reasoned and how the doctors reasoned

5634
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:04,290
reasoned and how the doctors reasoned
 

5635
01:53:04,290 --> 01:53:06,290
reasoned and how the doctors reasoned
through this whole process but I don't

5636
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:06,300
through this whole process but I don't
 

5637
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:07,939
through this whole process but I don't
know somewhere around 24 hours later or

5638
01:53:07,939 --> 01:53:07,949
know somewhere around 24 hours later or
 

5639
01:53:07,949 --> 01:53:09,170
know somewhere around 24 hours later or
something he was sitting up

5640
01:53:09,170 --> 01:53:09,180
something he was sitting up
 

5641
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:14,000
something he was sitting up
that would zero bushido brain damage any

5642
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,010
that would zero bushido brain damage any
 

5643
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:17,270
that would zero bushido brain damage any
what lessons do you draw from that story

5644
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:17,280
what lessons do you draw from that story
 

5645
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:20,360
what lessons do you draw from that story
that experience that the data that

5646
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:20,370
that experience that the data that
 

5647
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:22,160
that experience that the data that
they're you that the data that's being

they're you that the data that's being
 

5649
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:23,960
they're you that the data that's being
used to make sophistical inferences

5650
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:23,970
used to make sophistical inferences

doesn't adequately reflect the
 

5653
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:27,620
doesn't adequately reflect the
phenomenon so in other words you're

5654
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:27,630
phenomenon so in other words you're
 

5655
01:53:27,630 --> 01:53:30,050
phenomenon so in other words you're
getting [\h__\h] Ramsar you're getting stuff

01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:30,060
getting [\h__\h] Ramsar you're getting stuff
 

5657
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:33,380
getting [\h__\h] Ramsar you're getting stuff
wrong because you're your model is not

5658
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:33,390
wrong because you're your model is not
 

5659
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:37,250
wrong because you're your model is not
robust enough and you might be better

01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:37,260
robust enough and you might be better
 

5661
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:41,390
robust enough and you might be better
off not using statistical inference and

5662
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:41,400
off not using statistical inference and
 

5663
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:42,830
off not using statistical inference and
statistical averages in certain cases

5664
01:53:42,830 --> 01:53:42,840
statistical averages in certain cases
 

5665
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:44,540
statistical averages in certain cases
when you know the models insufficient

5666
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:44,550
when you know the models insufficient
 

5667
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:46,670
when you know the models insufficient
and that you should be reasoning at

5668
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:46,680
and that you should be reasoning at
 

5669
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:49,130
and that you should be reasoning at
about the specific case more logically

5670
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:49,140
about the specific case more logically
 

5671
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:51,770
about the specific case more logically
and more deductively and hold yourself

5672
01:53:51,770 --> 01:53:51,780
and more deductively and hold yourself
 

5673
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:53,000
and more deductively and hold yourself
responsible to hold yourself accountable

5674
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,010
responsible to hold yourself accountable
 

5675
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:57,560
responsible to hold yourself accountable
to doing that and perhaps AI has a role

5676
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:57,570
to doing that and perhaps AI has a role
 

5677
01:53:57,570 --> 01:54:00,020
to doing that and perhaps AI has a role
to say the exact thing we just said

5678
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:00,030
to say the exact thing we just said
 

5679
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:03,050
to say the exact thing we just said
which is perhaps this is a case you

5680
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:03,060
which is perhaps this is a case you
 

5681
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:05,810
which is perhaps this is a case you
should think for yourself you should

5682
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:05,820
should think for yourself you should
 

5683
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:08,690
should think for yourself you should
reason deductively so it's hard it's

5684
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:08,700
reason deductively so it's hard it's
 

5685
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:11,930
reason deductively so it's hard it's
it's so it's hard because it's hard to

5686
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:11,940
it's so it's hard because it's hard to
 

5687
01:54:11,940 --> 01:54:15,380
it's so it's hard because it's hard to
know that you know you'd have to go back

5688
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:15,390
know that you know you'd have to go back
 

5689
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:17,300
know that you know you'd have to go back
and you'd have to have enough data to

5690
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:17,310
and you'd have to have enough data to
 

5691
01:54:17,310 --> 01:54:18,860
and you'd have to have enough data to
essentially say and this goes back to

5692
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:18,870
essentially say and this goes back to
 

5693
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:21,320
essentially say and this goes back to
how do we this goes back to the case of

5694
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:21,330
how do we this goes back to the case of
 

5695
01:54:21,330 --> 01:54:22,760
how do we this goes back to the case of
how do we decide whether the AI is good

5696
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:22,770
how do we decide whether the AI is good
 

5697
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:25,780
how do we decide whether the AI is good
enough to do a particular task and

5698
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:25,790
enough to do a particular task and
 

5699
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:27,710
enough to do a particular task and
regardless of whether or not it produces

5700
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:27,720
regardless of whether or not it produces
 

5701
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:28,840
regardless of whether or not it produces
an explanation

5702
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:28,850
an explanation
 

5703
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:32,480
an explanation
so um and and what standards do we hold

5704
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:32,490
so um and and what standards do we hold
 

5705
01:54:32,490 --> 01:54:39,530
so um and and what standards do we hold
right for that so um you know if you

5706
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:39,540
right for that so um you know if you
 

5707
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:41,870
right for that so um you know if you
look at you you look more broadly for

5708
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:41,880
look at you you look more broadly for
 

5709
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,630
look at you you look more broadly for
example as my father as a metal kick

5710
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:44,640
example as my father as a metal kick
 

5711
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:48,920
example as my father as a metal kick
medical case the medical system

5712
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:48,930
medical case the medical system
 

5713
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:50,300
medical case the medical system
ultimately helped him a lot throughout

5714
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:50,310
ultimately helped him a lot throughout
 

5715
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:53,300
ultimately helped him a lot throughout
his life without it he probably would

5716
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:53,310
his life without it he probably would
 

5717
01:54:53,310 --> 01:54:54,820
his life without it he probably would
have died much sooner

5718
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:54,830
have died much sooner
 

5719
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:58,250
have died much sooner
so overall sort of you know work for him

5720
01:54:58,250 --> 01:54:58,260
so overall sort of you know work for him
 

5721
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:01,690
so overall sort of you know work for him
and sort of a net in that kind of way

5722
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:01,700
and sort of a net in that kind of way
 

5723
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:04,970
and sort of a net in that kind of way
actually I don't know that's fair um but

5724
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:04,980
actually I don't know that's fair um but
 

5725
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:06,890
actually I don't know that's fair um but
it maybe not in that particular case but

5726
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:06,900
it maybe not in that particular case but
 

5727
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,780
it maybe not in that particular case but
overall like oh the medical system

5728
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:08,790
overall like oh the medical system
 

5729
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:11,240
overall like oh the medical system
overall that's more given a system

5730
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:11,250
overall that's more given a system
 

5731
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:13,700
overall that's more given a system
overall you know was doing more more

5732
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:13,710
overall you know was doing more more
 

5733
01:55:13,710 --> 01:55:15,170
overall you know was doing more more
good than bad now is another argument

5734
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:15,180
good than bad now is another argument
 

5735
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:17,390
good than bad now is another argument
that suggests that wasn't the case but

5736
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:17,400
that suggests that wasn't the case but
 

5737
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:18,650
that suggests that wasn't the case but
for the for the sake of argument let's

5738
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:18,660
for the for the sake of argument let's
 

5739
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:20,570
for the for the sake of argument let's
say like that's let's say a net positive

5740
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:20,580
say like that's let's say a net positive
 

5741
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:22,220
say like that's let's say a net positive
and I think you have to sit there and

5742
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:22,230
and I think you have to sit there and
 

5743
01:55:22,230 --> 01:55:22,790
and I think you have to sit there and
there and take

5744
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:22,800
there and take
 

5745
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,040
there and take
take that into consideration now you

5746
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:25,050
take that into consideration now you
 

5747
01:55:25,050 --> 01:55:26,930
take that into consideration now you
look at a particular use case like for

5748
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:26,940
look at a particular use case like for
 

5749
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:30,140
look at a particular use case like for
example making this this decision have

5750
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:30,150
example making this this decision have
 

5751
01:55:30,150 --> 01:55:33,950
example making this this decision have
you done enough studies to know how good

5752
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:33,960
you done enough studies to know how good
 

5753
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:37,550
you done enough studies to know how good
that prediction really is right and how

5754
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:37,560
that prediction really is right and how
 

5755
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:38,960
that prediction really is right and how
you have you done enough studies to

5756
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:38,970
you have you done enough studies to
 

5757
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:41,690
you have you done enough studies to
compare it to say well what if we what

5758
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:41,700
compare it to say well what if we what
 

5759
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:45,200
compare it to say well what if we what
if we dug in and in a more direct you

5760
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:45,210
if we dug in and in a more direct you
 

5761
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:46,910
if we dug in and in a more direct you
know let's get the evidence let's let's

5762
01:55:46,910 --> 01:55:46,920
know let's get the evidence let's let's
 

5763
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,560
know let's get the evidence let's let's
do the deductive thing and not use the

5764
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:48,570
do the deductive thing and not use the
 

5765
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:50,420
do the deductive thing and not use the
statistics here how often would that

5766
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:50,430
statistics here how often would that
 

5767
01:55:50,430 --> 01:55:52,640
statistics here how often would that
have done better right you just so you

5768
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:52,650
have done better right you just so you
 

5769
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:54,410
have done better right you just so you
have to do this studies to know how good

5770
01:55:54,410 --> 01:55:54,420
have to do this studies to know how good
 

5771
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:57,260
have to do this studies to know how good
the AI actually is and it's complicated

5772
01:55:57,260 --> 01:55:57,270
the AI actually is and it's complicated
 

5773
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:58,730
the AI actually is and it's complicated
because depends how fast you have to

5774
01:55:58,730 --> 01:55:58,740
because depends how fast you have to
 

5775
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:00,260
because depends how fast you have to
make decision so if you have to make the

5776
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:00,270
make decision so if you have to make the
 

5777
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:02,810
make decision so if you have to make the
decision superfast do you have no choice

5778
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:02,820
decision superfast do you have no choice
 

5779
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:06,950
decision superfast do you have no choice
right if you have more time right but if

5780
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:06,960
right if you have more time right but if
 

5781
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,260
right if you have more time right but if
you're ready to pull the plug and this

5782
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:09,270
you're ready to pull the plug and this
 

5783
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:10,670
you're ready to pull the plug and this
is a lot of the argument that I had was

5784
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:10,680
is a lot of the argument that I had was
 

5785
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:12,590
is a lot of the argument that I had was
a doctor I said what's he gonna do if

5786
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:12,600
a doctor I said what's he gonna do if
 

5787
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:14,210
a doctor I said what's he gonna do if
you do it what's gonna happen to him in

5788
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:14,220
you do it what's gonna happen to him in
 

5789
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:16,700
you do it what's gonna happen to him in
that room if you do it my way you know

5790
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:16,710
that room if you do it my way you know
 

5791
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:18,590
that room if you do it my way you know
if you do well he's gonna die anyway so

5792
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:18,600
if you do well he's gonna die anyway so
 

5793
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,170
if you do well he's gonna die anyway so
let's do it my way though I mean it

5794
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:21,180
let's do it my way though I mean it
 

5795
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:22,970
let's do it my way though I mean it
raises questions for our society to

5796
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:22,980
raises questions for our society to
 

5797
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:25,550
raises questions for our society to
struggle with as was the case with your

5798
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:25,560
struggle with as was the case with your
 

5799
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:28,010
struggle with as was the case with your
father but also when things like race

5800
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:28,020
father but also when things like race
 

5801
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:29,870
father but also when things like race
and gender start coming into play when

5802
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:29,880
and gender start coming into play when
 

5803
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,510
and gender start coming into play when
when certain when when judgments are

5804
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:32,520
when certain when when judgments are
 

5805
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:37,120
when certain when when judgments are
made made based on things that are

5806
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:37,130
made made based on things that are
 

5807
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:39,440
made made based on things that are
complicated in our society at least in

5808
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:39,450
complicated in our society at least in
 

5809
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:41,720
complicated in our society at least in
this course and it starts you know I

5810
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:41,730
this course and it starts you know I
 

5811
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:44,480
this course and it starts you know I
think I think I'm safe to say that most

5812
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:44,490
think I think I'm safe to say that most
 

5813
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:48,220
think I think I'm safe to say that most
of the violent crimes committed by males

5814
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:48,230
of the violent crimes committed by males
 

5815
01:56:48,230 --> 01:56:51,800
of the violent crimes committed by males
so if you discriminate based you know as

5816
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:51,810
so if you discriminate based you know as
 

5817
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:54,170
so if you discriminate based you know as
a male versus female saying that if it's

5818
01:56:54,170 --> 01:56:54,180
a male versus female saying that if it's
 

5819
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:55,820
a male versus female saying that if it's
a male more likely to commit the crime

5820
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:55,830
a male more likely to commit the crime
 

5821
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:59,390
a male more likely to commit the crime
so this is one of my my very positive

5822
01:56:59,390 --> 01:56:59,400
so this is one of my my very positive
 

5823
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:02,810
so this is one of my my very positive
and optimistic view views of why the

5824
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:02,820
and optimistic view views of why the
 

5825
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:05,600
and optimistic view views of why the
study of artificial intelligence the

5826
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:05,610
study of artificial intelligence the
 

5827
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:07,480
study of artificial intelligence the
process of thinking and reasoning

5828
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:07,490
process of thinking and reasoning
 

5829
01:57:07,490 --> 01:57:10,010
process of thinking and reasoning
logically and statistically and how to

5830
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:10,020
logically and statistically and how to
 

5831
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:11,450
logically and statistically and how to
combine them is so important for the

5832
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:11,460
combine them is so important for the
 

5833
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:13,280
combine them is so important for the
discourse today because it's causing a

01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:21,959

it's causing this dialogue to happen

01:57:21,959 --> 01:57:21,969
it's causing this dialogue to happen
 

5841
01:57:21,969 --> 01:57:23,700
it's causing this dialogue to happen
this is one of the most important

5842
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:23,710
this is one of the most important
 

5843
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:26,340
this is one of the most important
dialogues that in my view the human

5844
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:26,350
dialogues that in my view the human
 

5845
01:57:26,350 --> 01:57:29,640
dialogues that in my view the human
species can have right now which is how

5846
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:29,650
species can have right now which is how
 

5847
01:57:29,650 --> 01:57:33,479
species can have right now which is how
to think well yeah how to reason well

5848
01:57:33,479 --> 01:57:33,489
to think well yeah how to reason well
 

5849
01:57:33,489 --> 01:57:37,379
to think well yeah how to reason well
how to understand our own cognitive

5850
01:57:37,379 --> 01:57:37,389
how to understand our own cognitive
 

5851
01:57:37,389 --> 01:57:41,100
how to understand our own cognitive
biases and what to do about them that

5852
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:41,110
biases and what to do about them that
 

5853
01:57:41,110 --> 01:57:43,020
biases and what to do about them that
has got to be one of the most important

5854
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:43,030
has got to be one of the most important
 

5855
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:45,689
has got to be one of the most important
things we as as as a species can be

5856
01:57:45,689 --> 01:57:45,699
things we as as as a species can be
 

5857
01:57:45,699 --> 01:57:48,510
things we as as as a species can be
doing honestly we are reached we've

doing honestly we are reached we've
 

5859
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,580
doing honestly we are reached we've
created an incredibly complex society

5860
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:50,590
created an incredibly complex society
 

5861
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:53,580
created an incredibly complex society
we've created amazing abilities to

important dialogue you know to be having

01:58:30,869 --> 01:58:33,660
easily becomes fundamentally bias and
there are statistics and we shouldn't

there are statistics and we shouldn't

01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:35,669
there are statistics and we shouldn't
blind our so we shouldn't discard

blind our so we shouldn't discard
 

5895
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:37,830
blind our so we shouldn't discard
statistical inference but we should

statistical inference but we should
 

5897
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,419
statistical inference but we should
understand the nature of such this

5898
01:58:39,419 --> 01:58:39,429
understand the nature of such this

conference as us as a society as you
 

5901
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,070
conference as us as a society as you
know we decided to reject statistical

5902
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:47,080
know we decided to reject statistical
 

5903
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:50,990
know we decided to reject statistical
inference to favor individual

01:58:59,139 --> 01:59:02,340
individual yes we we consciously make
that choice so even if the statistics

5910

that choice so even if the statistics
 

5911

that choice so even if the statistics
said even if the Cystic said males are

more likely to have you know to be

01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:10,560
more likely to have you know to be
violent criminals we still take each

01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:10,570
violent criminals we still take each
 

5917
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:13,470
violent criminals we still take each
person as an individual and we treat

5918

person as an individual and we treat
 

5919
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,520
person as an individual and we treat
them based on the logic and the

knowledge of that situation we
 

5923
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:25,310
knowledge of that situation we
purposefully and intentionally reject

purposefully and intentionally reject

01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,919
purposefully and intentionally reject

ideas for next grand challenges for

5950
01:59:59,109 --> 01:59:59,119
ideas for next grand challenges for
 

5951
01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:01,089
ideas for next grand challenges for
future challenges of that oh you know I

5952
02:00:01,089 --> 02:00:01,099
future challenges of that oh you know I
 

5953
02:00:01,099 --> 02:00:03,310
future challenges of that oh you know I
look I mean I think there are lots of

5954
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:03,320
look I mean I think there are lots of
 

5955
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:04,839
look I mean I think there are lots of
really great ideas for Grand Challenges

5956
02:00:04,839 --> 02:00:04,849
really great ideas for Grand Challenges
 

5957
02:00:04,849 --> 02:00:08,140
really great ideas for Grand Challenges
I'm particularly focused on one right

5958
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:08,150
I'm particularly focused on one right
 

5959
02:00:08,150 --> 02:00:10,779
I'm particularly focused on one right
now which is Kent you know can you

5960
02:00:10,779 --> 02:00:10,789
now which is Kent you know can you
 

5961
02:00:10,789 --> 02:00:12,609
now which is Kent you know can you
demonstrate that they understand that

5962
02:00:12,609 --> 02:00:12,619
demonstrate that they understand that
 

5963
02:00:12,619 --> 02:00:15,250
demonstrate that they understand that
they could read and understand that they

5964
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:15,260
they could read and understand that they
 

5965
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:17,080
they could read and understand that they
can they can acquire these frameworks

5966
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:17,090
can they can acquire these frameworks
 

5967
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:19,870
can they can acquire these frameworks
and communicate you know reason and

5968
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:19,880
and communicate you know reason and
 

5969
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:22,270
and communicate you know reason and
communicate with humans so it is kind of

5970
02:00:22,270 --> 02:00:22,280
communicate with humans so it is kind of
 

5971
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:23,979
communicate with humans so it is kind of
like the Turing test but it's a little

5972
02:00:23,979 --> 02:00:23,989
like the Turing test but it's a little
 

5973
02:00:23,989 --> 02:00:26,080
like the Turing test but it's a little
bit more demanding than the Turing test

5974
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:26,090
bit more demanding than the Turing test
 

5975
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:28,449
bit more demanding than the Turing test
it's not enough it's not enough to

5976
02:00:28,449 --> 02:00:28,459
it's not enough it's not enough to
 

5977
02:00:28,459 --> 02:00:30,939
it's not enough it's not enough to
convince me that you might be human

5978
02:00:30,939 --> 02:00:30,949
convince me that you might be human
 

5979
02:00:30,949 --> 02:00:32,620
convince me that you might be human
because you could you know you can

5980
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:32,630
because you could you know you can
 

5981
02:00:32,630 --> 02:00:35,679
because you could you know you can
parrot a conversation I think you know

5982
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:35,689
parrot a conversation I think you know
 

5983
02:00:35,689 --> 02:00:37,719
parrot a conversation I think you know
the the this standard is a little bit

5984
02:00:37,719 --> 02:00:37,729
the the this standard is a little bit
 

5985
02:00:37,729 --> 02:00:42,009
the the this standard is a little bit
higher is for example can you you know

5986
02:00:42,009 --> 02:00:42,019
higher is for example can you you know
 

5987
02:00:42,019 --> 02:00:44,649
higher is for example can you you know
the santa is higher and I think one of

5988
02:00:44,649 --> 02:00:44,659
the santa is higher and I think one of
 

5989
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,839
the santa is higher and I think one of
the challenges of devising this grand

5990
02:00:46,839 --> 02:00:46,849
the challenges of devising this grand
 

5991
02:00:46,849 --> 02:00:52,120
the challenges of devising this grand
challenge is that we're not sure what

5992
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:52,130
challenge is that we're not sure what
 

5993
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:54,939
challenge is that we're not sure what
intelligence is we're not sure how to

5994
02:00:54,939 --> 02:00:54,949
intelligence is we're not sure how to
 

5995
02:00:54,949 --> 02:00:57,250
intelligence is we're not sure how to
determine whether or not two people

5996
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:57,260
determine whether or not two people
 

5997
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:59,379
determine whether or not two people
actually understand each other and then

5998
02:00:59,379 --> 02:00:59,389
actually understand each other and then
 

5999
02:00:59,389 --> 02:01:01,779
actually understand each other and then
what depth they understand it they you

6000
02:01:01,779 --> 02:01:01,789
what depth they understand it they you
 

6001
02:01:01,789 --> 02:01:02,890
what depth they understand it they you
know and what to what depth they

6002
02:01:02,890 --> 02:01:02,900
know and what to what depth they
 

6003
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:05,799
know and what to what depth they
understand each other so the challenge

6004
02:01:05,799 --> 02:01:05,809
understand each other so the challenge
 

6005
02:01:05,809 --> 02:01:08,589
understand each other so the challenge
becomes something along the lines of can

6006
02:01:08,589 --> 02:01:08,599
becomes something along the lines of can
 

6007
02:01:08,599 --> 02:01:13,299
becomes something along the lines of can
you satisfy me that we have a shared

6008
02:01:13,299 --> 02:01:13,309
you satisfy me that we have a shared
 

6009
02:01:13,309 --> 02:01:16,359
you satisfy me that we have a shared
understanding so if I were to probe and

6010
02:01:16,359 --> 02:01:16,369
understanding so if I were to probe and
 

6011
02:01:16,369 --> 02:01:20,229
understanding so if I were to probe and
probe and you probe me can can can can

6012
02:01:20,229 --> 02:01:20,239
probe and you probe me can can can can
 

6013
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:22,000
probe and you probe me can can can can
machines really act like thought

6014
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,010
machines really act like thought
 

6015
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:25,509
machines really act like thought
partners where they could satisfy me

6016
02:01:25,509 --> 02:01:25,519
partners where they could satisfy me
 

6017
02:01:25,519 --> 02:01:27,339
partners where they could satisfy me
that they that we have a share our

6018
02:01:27,339 --> 02:01:27,349
that they that we have a share our
 

6019
02:01:27,349 --> 02:01:29,799
that they that we have a share our
understanding is shared enough that we

6020
02:01:29,799 --> 02:01:29,809
understanding is shared enough that we
 

6021
02:01:29,809 --> 02:01:32,140
understanding is shared enough that we
can collaborate and produce the answers

6022
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:32,150
can collaborate and produce the answers
 

6023
02:01:32,150 --> 02:01:34,600
can collaborate and produce the answers
together and that you know they they can

6024
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:34,610
together and that you know they they can
 

6025
02:01:34,610 --> 02:01:36,129
together and that you know they they can
help me explain and justify those

6026
02:01:36,129 --> 02:01:36,139
help me explain and justify those
 

6027
02:01:36,139 --> 02:01:39,009
help me explain and justify those
answers so maybe here's an idea so we'll

6028
02:01:39,009 --> 02:01:39,019
answers so maybe here's an idea so we'll
 

6029
02:01:39,019 --> 02:01:41,090
answers so maybe here's an idea so we'll
have a Isis

6030
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:41,100
have a Isis
 

6031
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:44,580
have a Isis
run for president and convinced that's

6032
02:01:44,580 --> 02:01:44,590
run for president and convinced that's
 

6033
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:45,360
run for president and convinced that's
too easy

6034
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:45,370
too easy
 

6035
02:01:45,370 --> 02:01:47,520
too easy
from sorry oh no you have to convince

6036
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:47,530
from sorry oh no you have to convince
 

6037
02:01:47,530 --> 02:01:51,510
from sorry oh no you have to convince
the voters that they should vote for it

6038
02:01:51,510 --> 02:01:51,520
the voters that they should vote for it
 

6039
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:54,060
the voters that they should vote for it
so they s what I would again again I

6040
02:01:54,060 --> 02:01:54,070
so they s what I would again again I
 

6041
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:55,260
so they s what I would again again I
that's why I think this is such a

6042
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:55,270
that's why I think this is such a
 

6043
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:58,050
that's why I think this is such a
challenge because we go back to the

6044
02:01:58,050 --> 02:01:58,060
challenge because we go back to the
 

6045
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:01,320
challenge because we go back to the
emotional persuasion we go back to you

6046
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:01,330
emotional persuasion we go back to you
 

6047
02:02:01,330 --> 02:02:05,630
emotional persuasion we go back to you
know now we're checking off an aspect of

6048
02:02:05,630 --> 02:02:05,640
know now we're checking off an aspect of
 

6049
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:10,110
know now we're checking off an aspect of
human cognition that is in many ways

6050
02:02:10,110 --> 02:02:10,120
human cognition that is in many ways
 

6051
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:12,630
human cognition that is in many ways
weak or flawed right we're so easily

6052
02:02:12,630 --> 02:02:12,640
weak or flawed right we're so easily
 

6053
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:17,160
weak or flawed right we're so easily
manipulated our minds are drawn for

6054
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:17,170
manipulated our minds are drawn for
 

6055
02:02:17,170 --> 02:02:19,950
manipulated our minds are drawn for
often the wrong reasons right not the

6056
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:19,960
often the wrong reasons right not the
 

6057
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:21,990
often the wrong reasons right not the
reasons that ultimately matter to us but

6058
02:02:21,990 --> 02:02:22,000
reasons that ultimately matter to us but
 

6059
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,910
reasons that ultimately matter to us but
the reasons that can easily persuade us

6060
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:23,920
the reasons that can easily persuade us
 

6061
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,850
the reasons that can easily persuade us
I think we can be persuaded to believe

6062
02:02:26,850 --> 02:02:26,860
I think we can be persuaded to believe
 

6063
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:28,230
I think we can be persuaded to believe
one thing or another

6064
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:28,240
one thing or another
 

6065
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:30,600
one thing or another
for reasons that ultimately don't serve

6066
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:30,610
for reasons that ultimately don't serve
 

6067
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:34,110
for reasons that ultimately don't serve
us well in the long term and a good

6068
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:34,120
us well in the long term and a good
 

6069
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:37,070
us well in the long term and a good
benchmark should not play with those

6070
02:02:37,070 --> 02:02:37,080
benchmark should not play with those
 

6071
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:40,320
benchmark should not play with those
elements of emotional manipulation I

6072
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:40,330
elements of emotional manipulation I
 

6073
02:02:40,330 --> 02:02:42,270
elements of emotional manipulation I
don't think so I think that's where we

6074
02:02:42,270 --> 02:02:42,280
don't think so I think that's where we
 

6075
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:44,310
don't think so I think that's where we
have to set the set the higher standard

6076
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:44,320
have to set the set the higher standard
 

6077
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,680
have to set the set the higher standard
for ourselves of what you know what does

6078
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:46,690
for ourselves of what you know what does
 

6079
02:02:46,690 --> 02:02:48,870
for ourselves of what you know what does
it mean this goes back to rationality

6080
02:02:48,870 --> 02:02:48,880
it mean this goes back to rationality
 

6081
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,550
it mean this goes back to rationality
and it goes back to objective thinking

6082
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:50,560
and it goes back to objective thinking
 

6083
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,560
and it goes back to objective thinking
and can you produce can you acquire

6084

it wasn't that so there's an element of

it wasn't that so there's an element of
 

6217
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:44,730
it wasn't that so there's an element of

have you could have an intelligence

6240
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:13,660
have you could have an intelligence
 

6241
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:15,950
have you could have an intelligence
capability and a capability to learn I

6242
02:06:15,950 --> 02:06:15,960
capability and a capability to learn I
 

6243
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:19,980
capability and a capability to learn I
capability to predict but I think

6244
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:19,990
capability to predict but I think
 

6245
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:24,060
capability to predict but I think
without I mean again you get a fear but

6246
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:24,070
without I mean again you get a fear but
 

6247
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:26,120
without I mean again you get a fear but
essentially without the goal to survive

6248
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:26,130
essentially without the goal to survive
 

6249
02:06:26,130 --> 02:06:28,400
essentially without the goal to survive
so you think you can just encode that

6250
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:28,410
so you think you can just encode that
 

6251
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:31,140
so you think you can just encode that
without having to million code I mean

6252
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:31,150
without having to million code I mean
 

6253
02:06:31,150 --> 02:06:33,180
without having to million code I mean
can you create a robot now and you could

6254
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:33,190
can you create a robot now and you could
 

6255
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:36,510
can you create a robot now and you could
say you know and plug it in and say

6256
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:36,520
say you know and plug it in and say
 

6257
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:38,610
say you know and plug it in and say
protect your power source you know and

6258
02:06:38,610 --> 02:06:38,620
protect your power source you know and
 

6259
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:40,140
protect your power source you know and
give it some capabilities and we'll sit

6260
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:40,150
give it some capabilities and we'll sit
 

6261
02:06:40,150 --> 02:06:41,610
give it some capabilities and we'll sit
there and operate to try to protect this

6262
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:41,620
there and operate to try to protect this
 

6263
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:43,740
there and operate to try to protect this
power source and survive I mean I so I

6264
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:43,750
power source and survive I mean I so I
 

6265
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:45,660
power source and survive I mean I so I
don't know that that's false awfully a

6266
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:45,670
don't know that that's false awfully a
 

6267
02:06:45,670 --> 02:06:47,010
don't know that that's false awfully a
hard thing to demonstrate it sounds like

6268
02:06:47,010 --> 02:06:47,020
hard thing to demonstrate it sounds like
 

6269
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:49,110
hard thing to demonstrate it sounds like
a fairly easy thing to demonstrate that

6270
02:06:49,110 --> 02:06:49,120
a fairly easy thing to demonstrate that
 

6271
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:50,430
a fairly easy thing to demonstrate that
you can give it that goal we'll come up

6272
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:50,440
you can give it that goal we'll come up
 

6273
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:52,890
you can give it that goal we'll come up
with that goal by itself as you have to

6274
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:52,900
with that goal by itself as you have to
 

6275
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:54,870
with that goal by itself as you have to
program that goal in but there's

6276
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:54,880
program that goal in but there's
 

6277
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:58,320
program that goal in but there's
something because I think as we touched

6278
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:58,330
something because I think as we touched
 

6279
02:06:58,330 --> 02:07:00,000
something because I think as we touched
on intelligence is kind of like a social

6280
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,010
on intelligence is kind of like a social
 

6281
02:07:00,010 --> 02:07:03,480
on intelligence is kind of like a social
construct the the fact that a robot will

6282
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:03,490
construct the the fact that a robot will
 

6283
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:06,260
construct the the fact that a robot will
be protecting its power source

6284
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:06,270
be protecting its power source
 

6285
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:11,430
be protecting its power source
would would add depth and grounding to

6286
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:11,440
would would add depth and grounding to
 

6287
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:14,580
would would add depth and grounding to
its intelligence in terms of us being

6288
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:14,590
its intelligence in terms of us being
 

6289
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:17,280
its intelligence in terms of us being
able to respect I mean ultimately it

6290
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:17,290
able to respect I mean ultimately it
 

6291
02:07:17,290 --> 02:07:19,200
able to respect I mean ultimately it
boils down to us acknowledging that it's

6292
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:19,210
boils down to us acknowledging that it's
 

6293
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:22,560
boils down to us acknowledging that it's
intelligent and the fact that it can die

6294
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:22,570
intelligent and the fact that it can die
 

6295
02:07:22,570 --> 02:07:26,250
intelligent and the fact that it can die
I think is an important part of that the

6296
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:26,260
I think is an important part of that the
 

6297
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:28,080
I think is an important part of that the
interesting thing to reflect on is how

6298
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:28,090
interesting thing to reflect on is how
 

6299
02:07:28,090 --> 02:07:30,120
interesting thing to reflect on is how
trivial that would be and and I don't

6300
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:30,130
trivial that would be and and I don't
 

6301
02:07:30,130 --> 02:07:31,950
trivial that would be and and I don't
think if you knew how trivial that was

6302
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:31,960
think if you knew how trivial that was
 

6303
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:33,750
think if you knew how trivial that was
you would associate that with being

6304
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:33,760
you would associate that with being
 

6305
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:36,570
you would associate that with being
intelligence I mean I literally put in a

6306
02:07:36,570 --> 02:07:36,580
intelligence I mean I literally put in a
 

6307
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:38,070
intelligence I mean I literally put in a
statement of code that says you know you

6308
02:07:38,070 --> 02:07:38,080
statement of code that says you know you
 

6309
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,050
statement of code that says you know you
have the following actions you can take

6310
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:40,060
have the following actions you can take
 

6311
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:42,540
have the following actions you can take
you give it a bunch of actions like you

6312
02:07:42,540 --> 02:07:42,550
you give it a bunch of actions like you
 

6313
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:45,210
you give it a bunch of actions like you
mount a laser gun on her or you may do

6314
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:45,220
mount a laser gun on her or you may do
 

6315
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:48,030
mount a laser gun on her or you may do
you the ability to scream a screech or

6316
02:07:48,030 --> 02:07:48,040
you the ability to scream a screech or
 

6317
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:50,520
you the ability to scream a screech or
whatever and you know and you you say

6318
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:50,530
whatever and you know and you you say
 

6319
02:07:50,530 --> 02:07:52,430
whatever and you know and you you say
you know if you see your power source

6320
02:07:52,430 --> 02:07:52,440
you know if you see your power source
 

6321
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:55,280
you know if you see your power source
then you could program that in and you

6322
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:55,290
then you could program that in and you
 

6323
02:07:55,290 --> 02:07:56,360
then you could program that in and you
know you're gonna print it you're gonna

6324
02:07:56,360 --> 02:07:56,370
know you're gonna print it you're gonna
 

6325
02:07:56,370 --> 02:07:59,090
know you're gonna print it you're gonna
take these actions to protect it you

6326
02:07:59,090 --> 02:07:59,100
take these actions to protect it you
 

6327
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:01,730
take these actions to protect it you
know you teach it checking it on a bunch

6328
02:08:01,730 --> 02:08:01,740
know you teach it checking it on a bunch
 

6329
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:03,350
know you teach it checking it on a bunch
of things so and and now you're gonna

6330
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:03,360
of things so and and now you're gonna
 

6331
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,430
of things so and and now you're gonna
look at that and you say well you know

6332
02:08:04,430 --> 02:08:04,440
look at that and you say well you know
 

6333
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:05,810
look at that and you say well you know
that's intelligence because it's

6334
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:05,820
that's intelligence because it's
 

6335
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:07,610
that's intelligence because it's
protecting power source maybe but that's

6336
02:08:07,610 --> 02:08:07,620
protecting power source maybe but that's
 

6337
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:10,280
protecting power source maybe but that's
again at this human bias that says the

6338
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:10,290
again at this human bias that says the
 

6339
02:08:10,290 --> 02:08:12,860
again at this human bias that says the
thing I had then I identify my

6340
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:12,870
thing I had then I identify my
 

6341
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:14,690
thing I had then I identify my
intelligence and my conscious so

6342
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:14,700
intelligence and my conscious so
 

6343
02:08:14,700 --> 02:08:17,060
intelligence and my conscious so

fundamentally with the desire or at
 

6345

fundamentally with the desire or at
least the behaviors associated with the

least the behaviors associated with the
 

6347
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:22,370
least the behaviors associated with the
desire to survive that if I see another

desire to survive that if I see another
 

6349
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:25,340
desire to survive that if I see another
thing doing that I'm going to assume

02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:25,350
thing doing that I'm going to assume
 

6351
02:08:25,350 --> 02:08:26,440
thing doing that I'm going to assume
it's intelligent

02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:26,450
it's intelligent

02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:31,810
it's intelligent
what timeline year will society have a

02:08:31,810 --> 02:08:31,820
what timeline year will society have a
 

6355
02:08:31,820 --> 02:08:35,150
what timeline year will society have a
something that would that you would be

02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:35,160
something that would that you would be
 

6357
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:36,470
something that would that you would be
comfortable calling an artificial

comfortable calling an artificial

comfortable calling an artificial
general intelligence system well what's

6360
02:08:39,980 --> 02:08:39,990
general intelligence system well what's
 

6361
02:08:39,990 --> 02:08:41,930
general intelligence system well what's
your intuition nobody can predict the

certainly not next few months or twenty
 

6367
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:47,690
certainly not next few months or twenty
years away but what's your intuition how

6368
02:08:47,690 --> 02:08:47,700
years away but what's your intuition how
 

6369
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:48,620
years away but what's your intuition how
far away are we

I the ideas hearts make these
 

6373
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:53,900
I the ideas hearts make these
predictions and I would be you know I

02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:53,910
predictions and I would be you know I
 

6375
02:08:53,910 --> 02:08:55,370
predictions and I would be you know I
would be guessing and there's so many

6376
02:08:55,370 --> 02:08:55,380
would be guessing and there's so many
 

6377
02:08:55,380 --> 02:08:57,710
would be guessing and there's so many
different variables including just how

6378
02:08:57,710 --> 02:08:57,720
different variables including just how
 

6379
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:59,270
different variables including just how
much we want to invest in it and how

6380
02:08:59,270 --> 02:08:59,280
much we want to invest in it and how
 

6381
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:00,980
much we want to invest in it and how
important it you know and how important

6382
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:00,990
important it you know and how important
 

6383
02:09:00,990 --> 02:09:02,560
important it you know and how important
we think it is

6384
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:02,570
we think it is
 

6385
02:09:02,570 --> 02:09:04,700
we think it is
what kind of investment are willing to

6386
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:04,710
what kind of investment are willing to
 

6387
02:09:04,710 --> 02:09:07,100
what kind of investment are willing to
make in it what kind of talent we end up

6388
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:07,110
make in it what kind of talent we end up
 

6389
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:08,480
make in it what kind of talent we end up
bringing to the table all you know the

6390
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:08,490
bringing to the table all you know the
 

6391
02:09:08,490 --> 02:09:10,250
bringing to the table all you know the
incentive structure all these things so

6392
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:10,260
incentive structure all these things so
 

6393
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:13,820
incentive structure all these things so
I think it is possible to do this sort

6394
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:13,830
I think it is possible to do this sort
 

6395
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:18,260
I think it is possible to do this sort
of thing I think it's I think trying to

6396
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:18,270
of thing I think it's I think trying to
 

6397
02:09:18,270 --> 02:09:22,160
of thing I think it's I think trying to
sort of ignore many of the variables and

6398
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:22,170
sort of ignore many of the variables and
 

6399
02:09:22,170 --> 02:09:22,850
sort of ignore many of the variables and
things like that

6400
02:09:22,850 --> 02:09:22,860
things like that
 

6401
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:25,430
things like that
is it a ten-year thing as a 23 it's

6402
02:09:25,430 --> 02:09:25,440
is it a ten-year thing as a 23 it's
 

6403
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:26,840
is it a ten-year thing as a 23 it's
probably closer to a 20-year thing I

6404
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:26,850
probably closer to a 20-year thing I
 

6405
02:09:26,850 --> 02:09:30,230
probably closer to a 20-year thing I
guess but not as little no I don't think

6406
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:30,240
guess but not as little no I don't think
 

6407
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:32,570
guess but not as little no I don't think
it's several hundred years I don't think

6408
02:09:32,570 --> 02:09:32,580
it's several hundred years I don't think
 

6409
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:34,850
it's several hundred years I don't think
it's several hundred years but again so

6410
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:34,860
it's several hundred years but again so
 

6411
02:09:34,860 --> 02:09:38,590
it's several hundred years but again so
much depends on how committed we are to

6412
02:09:38,590 --> 02:09:38,600
much depends on how committed we are to
 

6413
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:40,910
much depends on how committed we are to
investing and incentivizing this type of

6414
02:09:40,910 --> 02:09:40,920
investing and incentivizing this type of
 

6415
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:44,420
investing and incentivizing this type of
work this type of work and it's sort of

6416
02:09:44,420 --> 02:09:44,430
work this type of work and it's sort of
 

6417
02:09:44,430 --> 02:09:46,310
work this type of work and it's sort of
interesting like I don't think it's

6418
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:46,320
interesting like I don't think it's
 

6419
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,600
interesting like I don't think it's
obvious

6420
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:48,610
obvious
 

6421
02:09:48,610 --> 02:09:50,700
obvious
how incentivize we are I think from a

6422
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:50,710
how incentivize we are I think from a
 

6423
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:54,840
how incentivize we are I think from a
task perspective you know if we see

6424
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:54,850
task perspective you know if we see
 

6425
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:57,420
task perspective you know if we see
business opportunities to take this

6426
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:57,430
business opportunities to take this
 

6427
02:09:57,430 --> 02:09:58,830
business opportunities to take this
technique is a technique to solve that

6428
02:09:58,830 --> 02:09:58,840
technique is a technique to solve that
 

6429
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:00,330
technique is a technique to solve that
problem I think that's the main driver

6430
02:10:00,330 --> 02:10:00,340
problem I think that's the main driver
 

6431
02:10:00,340 --> 02:10:03,540
problem I think that's the main driver
for many from any of these things from a

6432
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:03,550
for many from any of these things from a
 

6433
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:05,910
for many from any of these things from a
from a general Tosta seems kind of an

6434
02:10:05,910 --> 02:10:05,920
from a general Tosta seems kind of an
 

6435
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,560
from a general Tosta seems kind of an
interesting question are we really

6436
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:07,570
interesting question are we really
 

6437
02:10:07,570 --> 02:10:10,890
interesting question are we really
motivated to do that and and like we

6438
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:10,900
motivated to do that and and like we
 

6439
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:12,510
motivated to do that and and like we
just struggled ourselves right now to

6440
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:12,520
just struggled ourselves right now to
 

6441
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:15,360
just struggled ourselves right now to
even define what it is so it's hard to

6442
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:15,370
even define what it is so it's hard to
 

6443
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:17,040
even define what it is so it's hard to
incentivize when we don't even know what

6444
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:17,050
incentivize when we don't even know what
 

6445
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:18,720
incentivize when we don't even know what
it is we're incentivized to create and

6446
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:18,730
it is we're incentivized to create and
 

6447
02:10:18,730 --> 02:10:22,419
it is we're incentivized to create and
if you said mimic a human intelligence

6448
02:10:22,419 --> 02:10:22,429
if you said mimic a human intelligence
 

6449
02:10:22,429 --> 02:10:24,479
if you said mimic a human intelligence
I just think there are so many

6450
02:10:24,479 --> 02:10:24,489
I just think there are so many
 

6451
02:10:24,489 --> 02:10:26,859
I just think there are so many
challenges with the the significance and

6452
02:10:26,859 --> 02:10:26,869
challenges with the the significance and
 

6453
02:10:26,869 --> 02:10:28,750
challenges with the the significance and
meaning of that there's not a clear

6454
02:10:28,750 --> 02:10:28,760
meaning of that there's not a clear
 

6455
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:30,790
meaning of that there's not a clear
directive there's no clear directive to

6456
02:10:30,790 --> 02:10:30,800
directive there's no clear directive to
 

6457
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:33,399
directive there's no clear directive to
do precisely that thing so assistance in

6458
02:10:33,399 --> 02:10:33,409
do precisely that thing so assistance in
 

6459
02:10:33,409 --> 02:10:36,609
do precisely that thing so assistance in
a larger and larger number of tasks so

6460
02:10:36,609 --> 02:10:36,619
a larger and larger number of tasks so
 

6461
02:10:36,619 --> 02:10:38,679
a larger and larger number of tasks so
being able to a system that's

6462
02:10:38,679 --> 02:10:38,689
being able to a system that's
 

6463
02:10:38,689 --> 02:10:40,359
being able to a system that's
particularly able to operate my

6464
02:10:40,359 --> 02:10:40,369
particularly able to operate my
 

6465
02:10:40,369 --> 02:10:42,009
particularly able to operate my
microwave and making a grilled cheese

6466
02:10:42,009 --> 02:10:42,019
microwave and making a grilled cheese
 

6467
02:10:42,019 --> 02:10:43,479
microwave and making a grilled cheese
sandwich I don't even know how to make

6468
02:10:43,479 --> 02:10:43,489
sandwich I don't even know how to make
 

6469
02:10:43,489 --> 02:10:46,149
sandwich I don't even know how to make
one of those and then the same system

6470
02:10:46,149 --> 02:10:46,159
one of those and then the same system
 

6471
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:47,679
one of those and then the same system
would be doing the vacuum cleaning and

6472
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:47,689
would be doing the vacuum cleaning and
 

6473
02:10:47,689 --> 02:10:52,679
would be doing the vacuum cleaning and
then the same system would be teaching

6474
02:10:52,679 --> 02:10:52,689
then the same system would be teaching
 

6475
02:10:52,689 --> 02:10:56,319
then the same system would be teaching
my kids that I don't have math I think

6476
02:10:56,319 --> 02:10:56,329
my kids that I don't have math I think
 

6477
02:10:56,329 --> 02:10:59,290
my kids that I don't have math I think
that when when when you get into a

6478
02:10:59,290 --> 02:10:59,300
that when when when you get into a
 

6479
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:02,250
that when when when you get into a
general intelligence for learning

6480
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:02,260
general intelligence for learning
 

6481
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:05,020
general intelligence for learning
physical tasks and again yeah I want to

6482
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:05,030
physical tasks and again yeah I want to
 

6483
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:06,250
physical tasks and again yeah I want to
go back to your body questions it's on

6484
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:06,260
go back to your body questions it's on
 

6485
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:07,949
go back to your body questions it's on
your body question was interesting but

6486
02:11:07,949 --> 02:11:07,959
your body question was interesting but
 

6487
02:11:07,959 --> 02:11:10,629
your body question was interesting but
you want to go back to you know learning

6488
02:11:10,629 --> 02:11:10,639
you want to go back to you know learning
 

6489
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:12,129
you want to go back to you know learning
abilities do physical tasks you might

6490
02:11:12,129 --> 02:11:12,139
abilities do physical tasks you might
 

6491
02:11:12,139 --> 02:11:15,459
abilities do physical tasks you might
have we might get Majan in that

6492
02:11:15,459 --> 02:11:15,469
have we might get Majan in that
 

6493
02:11:15,469 --> 02:11:17,080
have we might get Majan in that
timeframe we will get better and better

6494
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:17,090
timeframe we will get better and better
 

6495
02:11:17,090 --> 02:11:19,119
timeframe we will get better and better
at learning these kinds of tasks whether

6496
02:11:19,119 --> 02:11:19,129
at learning these kinds of tasks whether
 

6497
02:11:19,129 --> 02:11:20,889
at learning these kinds of tasks whether
it's mowing your lawn or driving a car

6498
02:11:20,889 --> 02:11:20,899
it's mowing your lawn or driving a car
 

6499
02:11:20,899 --> 02:11:23,439
it's mowing your lawn or driving a car
or whatever it is I think we will get

6500
02:11:23,439 --> 02:11:23,449
or whatever it is I think we will get
 

6501
02:11:23,449 --> 02:11:24,669
or whatever it is I think we will get
better and better at that where it's

6502
02:11:24,669 --> 02:11:24,679
better and better at that where it's
 

6503
02:11:24,679 --> 02:11:25,899
better and better at that where it's
learning how to make predictions over

6504
02:11:25,899 --> 02:11:25,909
learning how to make predictions over
 

6505
02:11:25,909 --> 02:11:27,399
learning how to make predictions over
large bodies of data as if we're going

6506
02:11:27,399 --> 02:11:27,409
large bodies of data as if we're going
 

6507
02:11:27,409 --> 02:11:28,659
large bodies of data as if we're going
to continue to get better and better at

6508
02:11:28,659 --> 02:11:28,669
to continue to get better and better at
 

6509
02:11:28,669 --> 02:11:32,560
to continue to get better and better at
that and machines will out you know

6510
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:32,570
that and machines will out you know
 

6511
02:11:32,570 --> 02:11:34,540
that and machines will out you know
outpace humans and and a variety of

6512
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:34,550
outpace humans and and a variety of
 

6513
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:37,209
outpace humans and and a variety of
those things the underlying mechanisms

6514
02:11:37,209 --> 02:11:37,219
those things the underlying mechanisms
 

6515
02:11:37,219 --> 02:11:41,049
those things the underlying mechanisms
for doing that may be the same meaning

6516
02:11:41,049 --> 02:11:41,059
for doing that may be the same meaning
 

6517
02:11:41,059 --> 02:11:42,879
for doing that may be the same meaning
that you know maybe these are deep Nats

6518
02:11:42,879 --> 02:11:42,889
that you know maybe these are deep Nats
 

6519
02:11:42,889 --> 02:11:45,810
that you know maybe these are deep Nats
there's infrastructure to train them

6520
02:11:45,810 --> 02:11:45,820
there's infrastructure to train them
 

6521
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:48,270
there's infrastructure to train them
reusable components to get them to

6522
02:11:48,270 --> 02:11:48,280
reusable components to get them to
 

6523
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:51,310
reusable components to get them to
different classes of tasks and we get

6524
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:51,320
different classes of tasks and we get
 

6525
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:52,359
different classes of tasks and we get
better and better at building these

6526
02:11:52,359 --> 02:11:52,369
better and better at building these
 

6527
02:11:52,369 --> 02:11:54,939
better and better at building these
kinds of machines you could see argue

6528
02:11:54,939 --> 02:11:54,949
kinds of machines you could see argue
 

6529
02:11:54,949 --> 02:11:56,529
kinds of machines you could see argue
that the general learning infrastructure

6530
02:11:56,529 --> 02:11:56,539
that the general learning infrastructure
 

6531
02:11:56,539 --> 02:11:59,259
that the general learning infrastructure
in there is a form of a general type of

6532
02:11:59,259 --> 02:11:59,269
in there is a form of a general type of
 

6533
02:11:59,269 --> 02:12:02,589
in there is a form of a general type of
intelligence I think what starts getting

6534
02:12:02,589 --> 02:12:02,599
intelligence I think what starts getting
 

6535
02:12:02,599 --> 02:12:06,759
intelligence I think what starts getting
harder is this notion of you know can we

6536
02:12:06,759 --> 02:12:06,769
harder is this notion of you know can we
 

6537
02:12:06,769 --> 02:12:08,560
harder is this notion of you know can we
can we effectively communicate and

6538
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:08,570
can we effectively communicate and
 

6539
02:12:08,570 --> 02:12:09,790
can we effectively communicate and
understand and build that shared

6540
02:12:09,790 --> 02:12:09,800
understand and build that shared
 

6541
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:11,830
understand and build that shared
understanding because of the layers of

6542
02:12:11,830 --> 02:12:11,840
understanding because of the layers of
 

6543
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,359
understanding because of the layers of
interpretation that are required to do

6544
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:13,369
interpretation that are required to do
 

6545
02:12:13,369 --> 02:12:15,790
interpretation that are required to do
that and the need for the machine to be

6546
02:12:15,790 --> 02:12:15,800
that and the need for the machine to be
 

6547
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:18,479
that and the need for the machine to be
engaged with humans at that level at a

6548
02:12:18,479 --> 02:12:18,489
engaged with humans at that level at a
 

6549
02:12:18,489 --> 02:12:21,310
engaged with humans at that level at a
continuous basis so how do you get in

6550
02:12:21,310 --> 02:12:21,320
continuous basis so how do you get in
 

6551
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:22,899
continuous basis so how do you get in
how do you get the machine in the game

6552
02:12:22,899 --> 02:12:22,909
how do you get the machine in the game
 

6553
02:12:22,909 --> 02:12:24,669
how do you get the machine in the game
how do you get the machine in the

6554
02:12:24,669 --> 02:12:24,679
how do you get the machine in the
 

6555
02:12:24,679 --> 02:12:28,869
how do you get the machine in the
intellectual game yeah and to solve AGI

6556
02:12:28,869 --> 02:12:28,879
intellectual game yeah and to solve AGI
 

6557
02:12:28,879 --> 02:12:30,429
intellectual game yeah and to solve AGI
you probably have to solve that problem

6558
02:12:30,429 --> 02:12:30,439
you probably have to solve that problem
 

6559
02:12:30,439 --> 02:12:32,199
you probably have to solve that problem
you have to get the machine so it's a

6560
02:12:32,199 --> 02:12:32,209
you have to get the machine so it's a
 

6561
02:12:32,209 --> 02:12:34,209
you have to get the machine so it's a
little bit of a bootstrapping can we get

6562
02:12:34,209 --> 02:12:34,219
little bit of a bootstrapping can we get
 

6563
02:12:34,219 --> 02:12:36,100
little bit of a bootstrapping can we get
the machine engaged and

6564
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:36,110
the machine engaged and
 

6565
02:12:36,110 --> 02:12:38,680
the machine engaged and
you know in the intellectual calling a

6566
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:38,690
you know in the intellectual calling a
 

6567
02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:40,720
you know in the intellectual calling a
game but in the intellectual dialogue

6568
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:40,730
game but in the intellectual dialogue
 

6569
02:12:40,730 --> 02:12:42,879
game but in the intellectual dialogue
with the humans are the humans

6570
02:12:42,879 --> 02:12:42,889
with the humans are the humans
 

6571
02:12:42,889 --> 02:12:44,770
with the humans are the humans
sufficiently an intellectual dialogue

6572
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:44,780
sufficiently an intellectual dialogue
 

6573
02:12:44,780 --> 02:12:46,750
sufficiently an intellectual dialogue
with each other to generate enough to

6574
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:46,760
with each other to generate enough to
 

6575
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:49,209
with each other to generate enough to
generate enough data in this context and

6576
02:12:49,209 --> 02:12:49,219
generate enough data in this context and
 

6577
02:12:49,219 --> 02:12:52,060
generate enough data in this context and
how do you bootstrap that because every

6578
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:52,070
how do you bootstrap that because every
 

6579
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:54,550
how do you bootstrap that because every
one of those conversations every one of

6580
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:54,560
one of those conversations every one of
 

6581
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:56,649
one of those conversations every one of
those conversations those intelligent

6582
02:12:56,649 --> 02:12:56,659
those conversations those intelligent
 

6583
02:12:56,659 --> 02:12:59,169
those conversations those intelligent
interactions require so much prior

6584
02:12:59,169 --> 02:12:59,179
interactions require so much prior
 

6585
02:12:59,179 --> 02:13:00,310
interactions require so much prior
knowledge that is a challenge to

6586
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:00,320
knowledge that is a challenge to
 

6587
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:03,040
knowledge that is a challenge to
bootstrap it so that's so as so the

6588
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:03,050
bootstrap it so that's so as so the
 

6589
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:06,070
bootstrap it so that's so as so the
question is and how committed so I think

6590
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:06,080
question is and how committed so I think
 

6591
02:13:06,080 --> 02:13:07,930
question is and how committed so I think
that's possible but when I go back to

6592
02:13:07,930 --> 02:13:07,940
that's possible but when I go back to
 

6593
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:10,990
that's possible but when I go back to
are we incentivized to do that I know

6594
02:13:10,990 --> 02:13:11,000
are we incentivized to do that I know
 

6595
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,120
are we incentivized to do that I know
we're incentivized to do the former are

6596
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:13,130
we're incentivized to do the former are
 

6597
02:13:13,130 --> 02:13:14,470
we're incentivized to do the former are
we incentivize to do the latter

6598
02:13:14,470 --> 02:13:14,480
we incentivize to do the latter
 

6599
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:16,180
we incentivize to do the latter
significantly enough to people

6600
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:16,190
significantly enough to people
 

6601
02:13:16,190 --> 02:13:17,470
significantly enough to people
understand what the latter really is

6602
02:13:17,470 --> 02:13:17,480
understand what the latter really is
 

6603
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:19,479
understand what the latter really is
well enough part of the elemental

6604
02:13:19,479 --> 02:13:19,489
well enough part of the elemental
 

6605
02:13:19,489 --> 02:13:21,310
well enough part of the elemental
cognition mission is to try to

6606
02:13:21,310 --> 02:13:21,320
cognition mission is to try to
 

6607
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:23,020
cognition mission is to try to
articulate that better and better you

6608
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:23,030
articulate that better and better you
 

6609
02:13:23,030 --> 02:13:24,729
articulate that better and better you
know through demonstrations and to

6610
02:13:24,729 --> 02:13:24,739
know through demonstrations and to
 

6611
02:13:24,739 --> 02:13:25,840
know through demonstrations and to
trying to craft these grand challenges

6612
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:25,850
trying to craft these grand challenges
 

6613
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:28,390
trying to craft these grand challenges
and get people to say look this is a

6614
02:13:28,390 --> 02:13:28,400
and get people to say look this is a
 

6615
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:30,910
and get people to say look this is a
class of intelligence this is a class of

6616
02:13:30,910 --> 02:13:30,920
class of intelligence this is a class of
 

6617
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:34,060
class of intelligence this is a class of
AI do we do we want this what what is

6618
02:13:34,060 --> 02:13:34,070
AI do we do we want this what what is
 

6619
02:13:34,070 --> 02:13:36,100
AI do we do we want this what what is
the potential of this what are the

6620
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:36,110
the potential of this what are the
 

6621
02:13:36,110 --> 02:13:37,330
the potential of this what are the
business what's the business potential

6622
02:13:37,330 --> 02:13:37,340
business what's the business potential
 

6623
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:39,520
business what's the business potential
what's the societal potential to that

6624
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:39,530
what's the societal potential to that
 

6625
02:13:39,530 --> 02:13:41,950
what's the societal potential to that
and so you know and to build up that

6626
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:41,960
and so you know and to build up that
 

6627
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:45,220
and so you know and to build up that
incentive system around that yeah I

6628
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:45,230
incentive system around that yeah I
 

6629
02:13:45,230 --> 02:13:46,750
incentive system around that yeah I
think if people don't understand yet I

6630
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:46,760
think if people don't understand yet I
 

6631
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:48,669
think if people don't understand yet I
think they will and is a huge business

6632
02:13:48,669 --> 02:13:48,679
think they will and is a huge business
 

6633
02:13:48,679 --> 02:13:50,919
think they will and is a huge business
potential here so it's exciting that

6634
02:13:50,919 --> 02:13:50,929
potential here so it's exciting that
 

6635
02:13:50,929 --> 02:13:54,280
potential here so it's exciting that
you're working on it you've kind of

6636
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:54,290
you're working on it you've kind of
 

6637
02:13:54,290 --> 02:13:56,700
you're working on it you've kind of
skipped over but I'm a huge fan of

6638
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:56,710
skipped over but I'm a huge fan of
 

6639
02:13:56,710 --> 02:14:00,450
skipped over but I'm a huge fan of
physical presence of things do you think

6640
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:00,460
physical presence of things do you think
 

6641
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:03,609
physical presence of things do you think
you know Watson head of body do you

6642
02:14:03,609 --> 02:14:03,619
you know Watson head of body do you
 

6643
02:14:03,619 --> 02:14:08,050
you know Watson head of body do you
think having a body as to the

6644
02:14:08,050 --> 02:14:08,060
think having a body as to the
 

6645
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:10,240
think having a body as to the
interactive element between the AI

6646
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:10,250
interactive element between the AI
 

6647
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:12,669
interactive element between the AI
system and a human or just in general to

6648
02:14:12,669 --> 02:14:12,679
system and a human or just in general to
 

6649
02:14:12,679 --> 02:14:16,930
system and a human or just in general to
intelligence so I think I think going

6650
02:14:16,930 --> 02:14:16,940
intelligence so I think I think going
 

6651
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:19,200
intelligence so I think I think going
back to that shared understanding bit

6652
02:14:19,200 --> 02:14:19,210
back to that shared understanding bit
 

6653
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:21,129
back to that shared understanding bit
humans are very connected to their

6654
02:14:21,129 --> 02:14:21,139
humans are very connected to their
 

6655
02:14:21,139 --> 02:14:23,590
humans are very connected to their
bodies I mean is one of the reasons one

6656
02:14:23,590 --> 02:14:23,600
bodies I mean is one of the reasons one
 

6657
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:26,140
bodies I mean is one of the reasons one
of the challenges in getting an AI to

6658
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:26,150
of the challenges in getting an AI to
 

6659
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:27,939
of the challenges in getting an AI to
kind of be a compatible human

6660
02:14:27,939 --> 02:14:27,949
kind of be a compatible human
 

6661
02:14:27,949 --> 02:14:31,090
kind of be a compatible human
intelligence is that our physical bodies

6662
02:14:31,090 --> 02:14:31,100
intelligence is that our physical bodies
 

6663
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:33,240
intelligence is that our physical bodies
are generating a lot of features that

6664
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:33,250
are generating a lot of features that
 

6665
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:38,410
are generating a lot of features that
make up the input so in other words

6666
02:14:38,410 --> 02:14:38,420
make up the input so in other words
 

6667
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:40,870
make up the input so in other words
where our bodies are are the the tool we

6668
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:40,880
where our bodies are are the the tool we
 

6669
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:43,240
where our bodies are are the the tool we
use to affect output but they're also

6670
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:43,250
use to affect output but they're also
 

6671
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:45,220
use to affect output but they're also
but they also generate a lot of input

6672
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:45,230
but they also generate a lot of input
 

6673
02:14:45,230 --> 02:14:48,220
but they also generate a lot of input
for our brains so we generate emotion we

6674
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:48,230
for our brains so we generate emotion we
 

6675
02:14:48,230 --> 02:14:50,140
for our brains so we generate emotion we
generate all these feelings we

6676
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:50,150
generate all these feelings we
 

6677
02:14:50,150 --> 02:14:52,120
generate all these feelings we
generate all these signals that machines

6678
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:52,130
generate all these signals that machines
 

6679
02:14:52,130 --> 02:14:53,979
generate all these signals that machines
don't have so missions that have this as

6680
02:14:53,979 --> 02:14:53,989
don't have so missions that have this as
 

6681
02:14:53,989 --> 02:14:57,580
don't have so missions that have this as
the input data and they don't have the

6682
02:14:57,580 --> 02:14:57,590
the input data and they don't have the
 

6683
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:59,439
the input data and they don't have the
the feedback that says okay I've gotten

6684
02:14:59,439 --> 02:14:59,449
the feedback that says okay I've gotten
 

6685
02:14:59,449 --> 02:15:01,390
the feedback that says okay I've gotten
this I've gotten this emotion or I've

6686
02:15:01,390 --> 02:15:01,400
this I've gotten this emotion or I've
 

6687
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:04,000
this I've gotten this emotion or I've
gotten this idea I now want to process

6688
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:04,010
gotten this idea I now want to process
 

6689
02:15:04,010 --> 02:15:07,090
gotten this idea I now want to process
that and then I can it then affects me

6690
02:15:07,090 --> 02:15:07,100
that and then I can it then affects me
 

6691
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:09,970
that and then I can it then affects me
as a physical being and then I and I and

6692
02:15:09,970 --> 02:15:09,980
as a physical being and then I and I and
 

6693
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:12,640
as a physical being and then I and I and
I can play that out in other words I

6694
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:12,650
I can play that out in other words I
 

6695
02:15:12,650 --> 02:15:13,990
I can play that out in other words I
could realize the implications of tax

6696
02:15:13,990 --> 02:15:14,000
could realize the implications of tax
 

6697
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,390
could realize the implications of tax
implications again on my bond mind body

6698
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:16,400
implications again on my bond mind body
 

6699
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:19,209
implications again on my bond mind body
complex I then process that and the

6700
02:15:19,209 --> 02:15:19,219
complex I then process that and the
 

6701
02:15:19,219 --> 02:15:21,160
complex I then process that and the
implications again are internal features

6702
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:21,170
implications again are internal features
 

6703
02:15:21,170 --> 02:15:23,709
implications again are internal features
are generated I learned from them they

6704
02:15:23,709 --> 02:15:23,719
are generated I learned from them they
 

6705
02:15:23,719 --> 02:15:26,020
are generated I learned from them they

6707
02:15:26,030 --> 02:15:29,020

so it's interesting when we think do we

6708
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:29,030
so it's interesting when we think do we
 

6709
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:31,510
so it's interesting when we think do we
want a human intelligence well if we

6710
02:15:31,510 --> 02:15:31,520
want a human intelligence well if we
 

6711
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:33,100
want a human intelligence well if we
want a human compatible intelligence

6712
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:33,110
want a human compatible intelligence
 

6713
02:15:33,110 --> 02:15:34,510
want a human compatible intelligence
probably the best thing to do is to

6714
02:15:34,510 --> 02:15:34,520
probably the best thing to do is to
 

6715
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,250
probably the best thing to do is to
embed it embedded in a human body

6716
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:36,260
embed it embedded in a human body
 

6717
02:15:36,260 --> 02:15:39,040

substrate part of that substrate you
 

6745
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:19,840
substrate part of that substrate you
know is the idea that it generates these

I'm at but but but the the important
 

6785
02:16:58,490 --> 02:17:01,990
I'm at but but but the the important
point is that a big part of how of what

point is that a big part of how of what
 

6787
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,190
point is that a big part of how of what
we process is that physical experience

we process is that physical experience

is that something that gets in the way
 

6809
02:17:33,980 --> 02:17:37,720
is that something that gets in the way
of the the rational discourse is there

of the the rational discourse is there
 

6811
02:17:37,730 --> 02:17:39,610

something that's useful I worry about

6812
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:39,620
something that's useful I worry about
 

6813
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:42,220
something that's useful I worry about
biases you know obviously so in other

6814
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:42,230
biases you know obviously so in other
 

6815
02:17:42,230 --> 02:17:43,360
biases you know obviously so in other
words if you develop an emotional

02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:47,240
a sudden you start are more likely to
 

6821
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:48,730
a sudden you start are more likely to
believe what it's saying even if it

6822
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:48,740
believe what it's saying even if it
 

6823
02:17:48,740 --> 02:17:49,840
believe what it's saying even if it
doesn't make any sense

6824
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:49,850
doesn't make any sense
 

6825
02:17:49,850 --> 02:17:53,831
doesn't make any sense
so I you know I worry about that but at

6826
02:17:53,831 --> 02:17:53,841
so I you know I worry about that but at
 

6827
02:17:53,841 --> 02:17:55,750
so I you know I worry about that but at
the same time I think the opportunity to

02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:55,760
the same time I think the opportunity to
 

6829
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:57,130
the same time I think the opportunity to
use machines to provide human

6830
02:17:57,130 --> 02:17:57,140
use machines to provide human
 

6831

02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:45,791
leverage is a problem and what I mean by
leverage is is too much control for

6864
02:18:45,791 --> 02:18:45,801
leverage is is too much control for
 

6865
02:18:45,801 --> 02:18:47,650
leverage is is too much control for
things that can hurt us whether it's

6866
02:18:47,650 --> 02:18:47,660
things that can hurt us whether it's
 

6867
02:18:47,660 --> 02:18:50,200
things that can hurt us whether it's
socially psychological intellectually or

6868
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:50,210
socially psychological intellectually or
 

6869
02:18:50,210 --> 02:18:52,541
socially psychological intellectually or
physically and if you give them machines

6870
02:18:52,541 --> 02:18:52,551
physically and if you give them machines
 

6871
02:18:52,551 --> 02:18:54,190
physically and if you give them machines
too much control I think that's a

6872
02:18:54,190 --> 02:18:54,200
too much control I think that's a
 

6873
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:56,470
too much control I think that's a
concern you forget about the AI just

6874
02:18:56,470 --> 02:18:56,480
concern you forget about the AI just
 

6875
02:18:56,480 --> 02:18:57,930
concern you forget about the AI just
when you give them too much control

6876
02:18:57,930 --> 02:18:57,940
when you give them too much control
 

6877
02:18:57,940 --> 02:19:01,690
when you give them too much control
human bad actors can hack them and

6878
02:19:01,690 --> 02:19:01,700
human bad actors can hack them and
 

6879
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:06,520
human bad actors can hack them and
produce havoc so um you know that's a

6880
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:06,530
produce havoc so um you know that's a
 

6881
02:19:06,530 --> 02:19:09,911
produce havoc so um you know that's a
problem and you imagine hackers taking

6882
02:19:09,911 --> 02:19:09,921
problem and you imagine hackers taking
 

6883
02:19:09,921 --> 02:19:11,680
problem and you imagine hackers taking
over the driverless car Network and you

6884
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:11,690
over the driverless car Network and you
 

6885
02:19:11,690 --> 02:19:15,430
over the driverless car Network and you
know creating all kinds of havoc but you

6886
02:19:15,430 --> 02:19:15,440
know creating all kinds of havoc but you
 

6887
02:19:15,440 --> 02:19:19,510
know creating all kinds of havoc but you
could also imagine given given the ease

6888
02:19:19,510 --> 02:19:19,520
could also imagine given given the ease
 

6889
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:21,670
could also imagine given given the ease
at which humans could be persuaded one

6890
02:19:21,670 --> 02:19:21,680
at which humans could be persuaded one
 

6891
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:23,260
at which humans could be persuaded one
way or the other and now we have

6892
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:23,270
way or the other and now we have
 

6893
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:25,630
way or the other and now we have
algorithms that can easily take control

6894
02:19:25,630 --> 02:19:25,640
algorithms that can easily take control
 

6895
02:19:25,640 --> 02:19:28,260
algorithms that can easily take control
over over that over that and amplify

6896
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:28,270
over over that over that and amplify
 

6897
02:19:28,270 --> 02:19:31,150
over over that over that and amplify
noise and move people one direction or

6898
02:19:31,150 --> 02:19:31,160
noise and move people one direction or
 

6899
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:33,100
noise and move people one direction or
another I mean humans do that to other

6900
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:33,110
another I mean humans do that to other
 

6901
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:34,450
another I mean humans do that to other
humans all the time and we have

6902
02:19:34,450 --> 02:19:34,460
humans all the time and we have
 

6903
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:35,710
humans all the time and we have
marketing campaigns we have political

6904
02:19:35,710 --> 02:19:35,720
marketing campaigns we have political
 

6905
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:38,440
marketing campaigns we have political
campaigns that take it to image of our

6906
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:38,450
campaigns that take it to image of our
 

6907
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:42,490
campaigns that take it to image of our
our emotions or our fears and this is

6908
02:19:42,490 --> 02:19:42,500
our emotions or our fears and this is
 

6909
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:45,400
our emotions or our fears and this is
done all the time when but with machines

6910
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:45,410
done all the time when but with machines
 

6911
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:47,320
done all the time when but with machines
machines are like giant mecha phones

6912
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:47,330
machines are like giant mecha phones
 

6913
02:19:47,330 --> 02:19:49,450
machines are like giant mecha phones
right we can amplify this and orders of

6914
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:49,460
right we can amplify this and orders of
 

6915
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:52,661
right we can amplify this and orders of
magnitude and can fine-tune its control

6916
02:19:52,661 --> 02:19:52,671
magnitude and can fine-tune its control
 

6917
02:19:52,671 --> 02:19:55,270
magnitude and can fine-tune its control
so we can tailor the message we can now

6918
02:19:55,270 --> 02:19:55,280
so we can tailor the message we can now
 

6919
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:58,180
so we can tailor the message we can now
very rapidly and efficiently tailor the

6920
02:19:58,180 --> 02:19:58,190
very rapidly and efficiently tailor the
 

6921
02:19:58,190 --> 02:20:01,001
very rapidly and efficiently tailor the
message to the audience taking taking

6922
02:20:01,001 --> 02:20:01,011
message to the audience taking taking
 

6923
02:20:01,011 --> 02:20:03,700
message to the audience taking taking
advantage of you know of their biases

6924
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:03,710
advantage of you know of their biases
 

6925
02:20:03,710 --> 02:20:05,921
advantage of you know of their biases
and amplifying them and using them to

6926
02:20:05,921 --> 02:20:05,931
and amplifying them and using them to
 

6927
02:20:05,931 --> 02:20:07,240
and amplifying them and using them to
pursue a them in one direction or

6928
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:07,250
pursue a them in one direction or
 

6929
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:10,871
pursue a them in one direction or
another in ways that are not fair not

02:20:10,871 --> 02:20:10,881
another in ways that are not fair not
 

6931
02:20:10,881 --> 02:20:13,900
another in ways that are not fair not
logical not objective not meaningful and

6932
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:13,910
logical not objective not meaningful and
 

6933
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:17,770
logical not objective not meaningful and
humans the machines and power that so so

6934
02:20:17,770 --> 02:20:17,780
humans the machines and power that so so
 

6935
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:19,331
humans the machines and power that so so
that's what I mean by leverage like it's

6936
02:20:19,331 --> 02:20:19,341
that's what I mean by leverage like it's
 

6937
02:20:19,341 --> 02:20:22,900
that's what I mean by leverage like it's
not new but wow it's powerful because

6938
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:22,910
not new but wow it's powerful because
 

6939
02:20:22,910 --> 02:20:24,490
not new but wow it's powerful because
machines can do it more effectively more

6940
02:20:24,490 --> 02:20:24,500
machines can do it more effectively more
 

6941
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:26,680
machines can do it more effectively more
more you know more quickly and we see

6942
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:26,690
more you know more quickly and we see
 

6943
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:28,600
more you know more quickly and we see
that already going on and and and social

6944
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:28,610
that already going on and and and social
 

6945
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:30,810
that already going on and and and social
media not the plays and other places

6946
02:20:30,810 --> 02:20:30,820
media not the plays and other places
 

6947
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:35,230
media not the plays and other places
that's scary and and that's why like I'm

6948
02:20:35,230 --> 02:20:35,240
that's scary and and that's why like I'm
 

6949
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:41,950
that's scary and and that's why like I'm
I'm that's why I go back to saying one

6950
02:20:41,950 --> 02:20:41,960
I'm that's why I go back to saying one
 

6951
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:43,570
I'm that's why I go back to saying one
of the most important public dialogues

6952
02:20:43,570 --> 02:20:43,580
of the most important public dialogues
 

6953
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:46,600
of the most important public dialogues
we could be having is about the nature

6954
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:46,610
we could be having is about the nature
 

6955
02:20:46,610 --> 02:20:49,650
we could be having is about the nature
of intelligence and the nature of

6956
02:20:49,650 --> 02:20:49,660
of intelligence and the nature of
 

6957
02:20:49,660 --> 02:20:52,751
of intelligence and the nature of
inference and logic and reason and

6958
02:20:52,751 --> 02:20:52,761
inference and logic and reason and
 

6959
02:20:52,761 --> 02:20:56,440
inference and logic and reason and
rationality and us understanding our own

6960
02:20:56,440 --> 02:20:56,450
rationality and us understanding our own
 

6961
02:20:56,450 --> 02:20:58,751
rationality and us understanding our own
biases us understanding our own

6962
02:20:58,751 --> 02:20:58,761
biases us understanding our own
 

6963
02:20:58,761 --> 02:21:00,850
biases us understanding our own
cognitive biases and how they work and

6964
02:21:00,850 --> 02:21:00,860
cognitive biases and how they work and
 

6965
02:21:00,860 --> 02:21:03,730
cognitive biases and how they work and
then how machines work and how do we use

6966
02:21:03,730 --> 02:21:03,740
then how machines work and how do we use
 

6967
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:06,131
then how machines work and how do we use
them to complement and sit basically so

6968
02:21:06,131 --> 02:21:06,141
them to complement and sit basically so
 

6969
02:21:06,141 --> 02:21:08,200
them to complement and sit basically so
that in the end we have a stronger

6970
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:08,210
that in the end we have a stronger
 

6971
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:10,511
that in the end we have a stronger
overall system that's just incredibly

6972
02:21:10,511 --> 02:21:10,521
overall system that's just incredibly
 

6973
02:21:10,521 --> 02:21:13,360
overall system that's just incredibly
important I don't

6974
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:13,370
important I don't
 

6975
02:21:13,370 --> 02:21:16,600
important I don't
most people understand that so so like

6976
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:16,610
most people understand that so so like
 

6977
02:21:16,610 --> 02:21:18,850
most people understand that so so like
telling telling your kids or telling

6978
02:21:18,850 --> 02:21:18,860
telling telling your kids or telling
 

6979
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:21,400
telling telling your kids or telling
your students this goes back to the

02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:21,410
your students this goes back to the
 

6981
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:23,700
your students this goes back to the
cognition here's how your brain works

6982
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:23,710
cognition here's how your brain works
 

6983
02:21:23,710 --> 02:21:26,350
cognition here's how your brain works
here's how easy it is to trick your

6984
02:21:26,350 --> 02:21:26,360
here's how easy it is to trick your
 

6985
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:28,900
here's how easy it is to trick your
brain right there are fundamental

6986
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:28,910
brain right there are fundamental
 

6987
02:21:28,910 --> 02:21:31,390
brain right there are fundamental
cognitive but you should appreciate the

6988
02:21:31,390 --> 02:21:31,400
cognitive but you should appreciate the
 

6989
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:32,920
cognitive but you should appreciate the
different the different types of

6990
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:32,930
different the different types of
 

6991
02:21:32,930 --> 02:21:35,830
different the different types of
thinking and how they work and what

6992
02:21:35,830 --> 02:21:35,840
thinking and how they work and what
 

6993
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:38,200
thinking and how they work and what
you're prone to and you know and what

6994
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:38,210
you're prone to and you know and what
 

6995
02:21:38,210 --> 02:21:39,551
you're prone to and you know and what
and what do you prefer

6996
02:21:39,551 --> 02:21:39,561
and what do you prefer
 

6997
02:21:39,561 --> 02:21:42,040
and what do you prefer
and under what conditions does this make

6998
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:42,050
and under what conditions does this make
 

6999
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:43,900
and under what conditions does this make
sense versus that makes sense and then

7000
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:43,910
sense versus that makes sense and then
 

7001
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:47,020
sense versus that makes sense and then
say here's what AI can do here's how it

7002
02:21:47,020 --> 02:21:47,030
say here's what AI can do here's how it
 

7003
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:49,210
say here's what AI can do here's how it
can make this worse and here's how it

7004
02:21:49,210 --> 02:21:49,220
can make this worse and here's how it
 

7005
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:51,520
can make this worse and here's how it
can make this better and then that's

7006
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:51,530
can make this better and then that's
 

7007
02:21:51,530 --> 02:21:53,470
can make this better and then that's
where the as a role is to reveal that

7008
02:21:53,470 --> 02:21:53,480
where the as a role is to reveal that
 

7009
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:57,551
where the as a role is to reveal that
then the that trade-off so if you

7010
02:21:57,551 --> 02:21:57,561
then the that trade-off so if you
 

7011
02:21:57,561 --> 02:22:02,350
then the that trade-off so if you
imagine a system that is able to beyond

7012
02:22:02,350 --> 02:22:02,360
imagine a system that is able to beyond
 

7013
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:05,980
imagine a system that is able to beyond
any definition of the Turing test of the

7014
02:22:05,980 --> 02:22:05,990
any definition of the Turing test of the
 

7015
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:08,980
any definition of the Turing test of the
benchmark really an AGI system as a

7016
02:22:08,980 --> 02:22:08,990
benchmark really an AGI system as a
 

7017
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:12,250
benchmark really an AGI system as a
thought partner that you one day will

7018

7023
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:24,370
discussion if you get to pick one would
you have with that system what would you

7024
02:22:24,370 --> 02:22:24,380
you have with that system what would you
 

7025
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:28,950
you have with that system what would you
ask and you get to find out the truth

7026

together so you threw me a little bit
 

7029
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:38,310
together so you threw me a little bit
with finding the truth at the end but

7030
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:38,320
with finding the truth at the end but
 

7031
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:42,130
with finding the truth at the end but
this is a whole nother topic but the I

7032
02:22:42,130 --> 02:22:42,140
this is a whole nother topic but the I
 

7033
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:43,900
this is a whole nother topic but the I
think the beauty of it I think what

excites me is the beauty of it is if I
 

7037
02:22:46,311 --> 02:22:48,280
excites me is the beauty of it is if I
really have that system I don't have to

7038
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:48,290
really have that system I don't have to
 

7039
02:22:48,290 --> 02:22:50,410
really have that system I don't have to
pick so in other words I can you know I

7040
02:22:50,410 --> 02:22:50,420
pick so in other words I can you know I
 

7041
02:22:50,420 --> 02:22:52,450
pick so in other words I can you know I
can go to and say this is where I care

can go to and say this is where I care
about today and and and that's what we

7044
02:22:55,390 --> 02:22:55,400
about today and and and that's what we
 

7045
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:57,370
about today and and and that's what we
mean by like this general capability go

7046
02:22:57,370 --> 02:22:57,380
mean by like this general capability go
 

7047
