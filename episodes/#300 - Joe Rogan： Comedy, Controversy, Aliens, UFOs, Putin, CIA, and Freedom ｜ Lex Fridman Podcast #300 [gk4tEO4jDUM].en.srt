1603
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,950
of times in the cosmos well first of all
it's not certain that that's true it's

1604
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
it's not certain that that's true it's
 

1605
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,950
it's not certain that that's true it's
it's possible possible uh like sean

1606
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
it's possible possible uh like sean
 

1607
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,830
it's possible possible uh like sean
carroll you know uh

1608
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:29,840
carroll you know uh
 

1609
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,149
carroll you know uh
especially with quantum mechanics

1610
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:32,159
especially with quantum mechanics
 

1611
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,430
especially with quantum mechanics
based on certain interpretation of

1612
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
based on certain interpretation of
 

1613
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,110
based on certain interpretation of
quantum mechanics that's that's very

1614
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
quantum mechanics that's that's very
 

1615
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,870
quantum mechanics that's that's very
possible but the question is can you

1616
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:36,880
possible but the question is can you
 

1617
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,070
possible but the question is can you
access

1618
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
access
 

1619
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,190
access
those

1620
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,200
those
 

1621
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,430
those
universes right and so how far away are

1622
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,440
universes right and so how far away are
 

1623
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,750
universes right and so how far away are
they the more the more sort of specific

1624
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:43,760
they the more the more sort of specific
 

1625
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,230
they the more the more sort of specific
practical question is this local pocket

1626
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
practical question is this local pocket
 

1627
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,789
practical question is this local pocket
of the universe our galaxy or our

1628
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,799
of the universe our galaxy or our
 

1629
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,269
of the universe our galaxy or our
neighboring galaxies are there aliens

1630
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
neighboring galaxies are there aliens
 

1631
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,990
neighboring galaxies are there aliens
there what do they look like are they so

1632
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
there what do they look like are they so
 

1633
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,389
there what do they look like are they so
you can have this panspermia idea where

1634
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:56,399
you can have this panspermia idea where
 

1635
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,350
you can have this panspermia idea where
a much larger like

1636
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
a much larger like
 

1637
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,630
a much larger like
uh like daddy civilization

1638
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
uh like daddy civilization
 

1639
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,909
uh like daddy civilization
uh like uh rolled by and just planted a

1640
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:05,919
uh like uh rolled by and just planted a
 

1641
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,310
uh like uh rolled by and just planted a
few aliens at a similar time like

1642
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,320
few aliens at a similar time like
 

1643
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,310
few aliens at a similar time like
prometheus yes yeah

1644
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
prometheus yes yeah
 

1645
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,669
prometheus yes yeah
a different you know throughout the

1646
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:11,679
a different you know throughout the
 

1647
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,830
a different you know throughout the
galaxy and those are the ones we might

1648
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:13,840
galaxy and those are the ones we might
 

1649
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,750
galaxy and those are the ones we might
be interacting with they're all

1650
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760
be interacting with they're all
 

1651
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,110
be interacting with they're all
kind of dumb

1652
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,120
kind of dumb
 

1653
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,830
kind of dumb
as we are relatively you know maybe um a

1654
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:19,840
as we are relatively you know maybe um a
 

1655
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,590
as we are relatively you know maybe um a
few million years apart

1656
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
few million years apart
 

1657
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,870
few million years apart
and then those are the ones we're

1658
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
and then those are the ones we're
 

1659
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,149
and then those are the ones we're
interacting with and then we have a

1660
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
interacting with and then we have a
 

1661
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,750
interacting with and then we have a
chance to actually connect with them and

1662
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:25,760
chance to actually connect with them and
 

1663
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,909
chance to actually connect with them and
communicate with them or it could be

1664
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
communicate with them or it could be
 

1665
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:28,870
communicate with them or it could be
like

1666
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
like
 

1667
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,269
like
much more wide open and you have these

1668
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
much more wide open and you have these
 

1669
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,350
much more wide open and you have these
gigantic alien civilizations that are

1670
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
gigantic alien civilizations that are
 

1671
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,510
gigantic alien civilizations that are
expanding very very quickly and the

1672
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,520
expanding very very quickly and the
 

1673
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,029
expanding very very quickly and the
interesting thing is when you look up at

1674
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:37,039
interesting thing is when you look up at
 

1675
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,430
interesting thing is when you look up at
the sky and you see the stars that's

1676
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440
the sky and you see the stars that's
 

1677
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,269
the sky and you see the stars that's
light

1678
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:41,279
light
 

1679
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,269
light
from those stars

1680
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
from those stars
 

1681
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,710
from those stars
we might not be seeing the alien

1682
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
we might not be seeing the alien
 

1683
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,510
we might not be seeing the alien
civilizations until they're already here

1684
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,520
civilizations until they're already here
 

1685
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,470
civilizations until they're already here
meaning

1686
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:48,480
meaning
 

1687
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,269
meaning
right like you start expanding once you

1688
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:51,279
right like you start expanding once you
 

1689
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,789
right like you start expanding once you
get really good at expanding you're

1690
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
get really good at expanding you're
 

1691
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,149
get really good at expanding you're
going to be expanding very close to the

1692
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
going to be expanding very close to the
 

1693
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,310
going to be expanding very close to the
speed of light so right now we don't see

1694
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
speed of light so right now we don't see
 

1695
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,470
speed of light so right now we don't see
much in the in the sky but there could

1696
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:58,480
much in the in the sky but there could
 

1697
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,470
much in the in the sky but there could
be one one day we wake up and it's just

1698
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
be one one day we wake up and it's just
 

1699
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,669
be one one day we wake up and it's just
like everywhere and they're here right

1700
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
like everywhere and they're here right
 

1701
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,789
like everywhere and they're here right
right because the amount of time the

1702
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
right because the amount of time the
 

1703
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,190
right because the amount of time the
light takes to reach us yeah and then

1704
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,200
light takes to reach us yeah and then
 

1705
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,510
light takes to reach us yeah and then
the the thing that i've been really

1706
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
the the thing that i've been really
 

1707
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,630
the the thing that i've been really
fascinated by is these

1708
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:12,640
fascinated by is these
 

1709
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,110
fascinated by is these
alternative forms of transportation that

1710
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,120
alternative forms of transportation that
 

1711
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,269
alternative forms of transportation that
they're discussing like

1712
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
they're discussing like
 

1713
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,830
they're discussing like
the the ability to harness wormholes and

1714
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,840
the the ability to harness wormholes and
 

1715
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,750
the the ability to harness wormholes and
the the ability to

1716
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:21,760
the the ability to
 

1717
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,470
the the ability to
to do things that what

1718
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,480
to do things that what
 

1719
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,470
to do things that what
a type three civilization is capable of

1720
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
a type three civilization is capable of
 

1721
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,950
a type three civilization is capable of

he's so good at taking extremely complex
 

1727
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,350
he's so good at taking extremely complex
concepts and boiling them down for

1728
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
concepts and boiling them down for

yeah he's all in on this ufo phenomenon

1740
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
yeah he's all in on this ufo phenomenon
 

1741
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,510
yeah he's all in on this ufo phenomenon
now he's now he's like now the burden of

1742
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
now he's now he's like now the burden of
 

1743
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,669
now he's now he's like now the burden of
proof is to people for people to come up

1744
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
proof is to people for people to come up
 

1745
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,310
proof is to people for people to come up
with some sort of a conventional

with some sort of a conventional
 

1747
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,470
with some sort of a conventional
explanation for these things he goes

1748
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
explanation for these things he goes
 

1749
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,710
explanation for these things he goes
because these things are defying all the

because these things are defying all the
 

1751
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,190
because these things are defying all the
concepts of physics that that we're we

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,590
that you know what we know about what
current science is capable of

1762
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:17,600
current science is capable of
 

1763
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,149
current science is capable of
reproducing as far as what we know the

1764
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:20,159
reproducing as far as what we know the
 

1765
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,830
reproducing as far as what we know the
problem is like

1766
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,840
problem is like
 

1767
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,149
problem is like
these um military

1768
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:24,159
these um military
 

1769
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,830
these um military
projects that are

1770
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:25,840
projects that are
 

1771
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,029
projects that are
top secret

1772
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039
top secret
 

1773
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,630
top secret
like how much money do they have they

1774
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,640
like how much money do they have they
 

1775
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,669
like how much money do they have they
have a lot of money like but

1776
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:31,679
have a lot of money like but
 

1777
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,669
have a lot of money like but
is it possible and maybe you could speak

1778
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:33,679
is it possible and maybe you could speak
 

1779
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,310
is it possible and maybe you could speak
to this is it possible that there could

1780
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,320
to this is it possible that there could
 

1781
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,110
to this is it possible that there could
be

1782
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,120
be
 

1783
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,669
be
some propulsion systems that have been

1784
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
some propulsion systems that have been
 

1785
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,710
some propulsion systems that have been
developed and implemented that are far

1786
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
developed and implemented that are far
 

1787
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,669
developed and implemented that are far
beyond just the simple burning of rocket

1788
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
beyond just the simple burning of rocket
 

1789
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,470
beyond just the simple burning of rocket
fuel pushing the fire out the back which

1790
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,480
fuel pushing the fire out the back which
 

1791
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,789
fuel pushing the fire out the back which
forces the rocket at extreme speeds

1792
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:50,799
forces the rocket at extreme speeds
 

1793
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,990
forces the rocket at extreme speeds
forward that's something that does

1794
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
forward that's something that does
 

1795
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,470
forward that's something that does
harness gravity something that can

1796
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
harness gravity something that can
 

1797
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,430
harness gravity something that can
distort space and time and can make

1798
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
distort space and time and can make
 

1799
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,509
distort space and time and can make
travel from one point to another uh like

1800
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
travel from one point to another uh like
 

1801
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,350
travel from one point to another uh like
preposterously fast

1802
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,360
preposterously fast
 

1803
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,029
preposterously fast
well not only is it possible i think

1804
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
well not only is it possible i think
 

1805
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,950
well not only is it possible i think
it's likely that that kind of stuff

1806
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
it's likely that that kind of stuff
 

1807
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,990
it's likely that that kind of stuff
would be

1808
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
would be
 

1809
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,470
would be
kept a secret yeah it's just everything

1810
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,480
kept a secret yeah it's just everything
 

1811
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,470
kept a secret yeah it's just everything
you see about these um

1812
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:16,480
you see about these um
 

1813
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,470
you see about these um
about the way

1814
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
about the way
 

1815
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,389
about the way
either if it's contractors like lockheed

1816
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
either if it's contractors like lockheed
 

1817
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,029
either if it's contractors like lockheed
martin or if it's dodea the the the

1818
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:23,039
martin or if it's dodea the the the
 

1819
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,950
martin or if it's dodea the the the
actual departments of defense they

1820
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:24,960
actual departments of defense they
 

1821
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,029
actual departments of defense they
operate in complete secrecy just even

1822
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:27,039
operate in complete secrecy just even
 

1823
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,710
operate in complete secrecy just even
looking at the

1824
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
looking at the
 

1825
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,950
looking at the
the history of the stealth fighter just

1826
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
the history of the stealth fighter just
 

1827
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,630
the history of the stealth fighter just
even stealth technology was kept a

1828
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
even stealth technology was kept a
 

1829
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,710
even stealth technology was kept a
secret for a very very long time

1830
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720
secret for a very very long time
 

1831
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,430
secret for a very very long time
and

1832
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,440
and
 

1833
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,870
and
not until you're ready to use it

1834
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:38,880
not until you're ready to use it
 

1835
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,870
not until you're ready to use it
and need to use it

1836
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:40,880
and need to use it
 

1837
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,029
and need to use it
does it become public and not officially

1838
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039
does it become public and not officially
 

1839
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,350
does it become public and not officially
public it just is being detected out in

1840
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,360
public it just is being detected out in
 

1841
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,029
public it just is being detected out in
the wild so

1842
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,039
the wild so
 

1843
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,389
the wild so
there's going to be a process where

1844
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:48,399
there's going to be a process where
 

1845
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,389
there's going to be a process where
you're secretly testing it and that

1846
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:50,399
you're secretly testing it and that
 

1847
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,630
you're secretly testing it and that
might creep up which is maybe what we're

1848
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,640
might creep up which is maybe what we're
 

1849
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,389
might creep up which is maybe what we're
seeing and then it's waiting for the

1850
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:54,399
seeing and then it's waiting for the
 

1851
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,789
seeing and then it's waiting for the
next big war

1852
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:56,799
next big war
 

1853
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,070
next big war
the next big

1854
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
the next big
 

1855
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,310
the next big
reason to use the thing yeah

1856
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
reason to use the thing yeah
 

1857
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,310
reason to use the thing yeah
and so yeah this there's definitely

1858
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,320
and so yeah this there's definitely
 

1859
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,669
and so yeah this there's definitely
technologies now there might not be

1860
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:03,679
technologies now there might not be
 

1861
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,909
technologies now there might not be
propulsion technologies there could be

1862
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
propulsion technologies there could be
 

1863
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,990
propulsion technologies there could be
ai surveillance technologies there could

1864
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
ai surveillance technologies there could
 

1865
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,710
ai surveillance technologies there could
be

1866
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:08,720
be
 

1867
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,389
be
different kinds of

1868
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399
different kinds of
 

1869
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,630
different kinds of
uh stealth drones

1870
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
uh stealth drones
 

1871
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,190
uh stealth drones
there could be uh it could be also in

1872
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,200
there could be uh it could be also in
 

1873
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,110
there could be uh it could be also in
cyberspace like cyber war weapons

1874
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
cyberspace like cyber war weapons
 

1875
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,630
cyberspace like cyber war weapons
all that kind of stuff they're obviously

1876
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
all that kind of stuff they're obviously
 

1877
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,230
all that kind of stuff they're obviously
going to be kept secret

1878
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
going to be kept secret
 

1879
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,590
going to be kept secret
i'm i'm very skeptical lately and the

1880
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:25,600
i'm i'm very skeptical lately and the
 

1881
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,870
i'm i'm very skeptical lately and the
reason why i'm skeptical is the

1882
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
reason why i'm skeptical is the
 

1883
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,110
reason why i'm skeptical is the
government keeps talking about it the

1884
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
government keeps talking about it the
 

1885
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,029
government keeps talking about it the
pentagon keeps talking about it nasa

1886
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,039
pentagon keeps talking about it nasa
 

1887
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,630
pentagon keeps talking about it nasa
keeps talking about it in which

1888
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:32,640
keeps talking about it in which
 

1889
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,789
keeps talking about it in which
direction you're skeptical i'm skeptical

1890
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:34,799
direction you're skeptical i'm skeptical
 

1891
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,430
direction you're skeptical i'm skeptical
that it's their aliens i think most

1892
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:37,440
that it's their aliens i think most
 

1893
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,110
that it's their aliens i think most
likely it's a smoke screen and most

1894
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120
likely it's a smoke screen and most
 

1895
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,870
likely it's a smoke screen and most
likely these are some sort of like

1896
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,880
likely these are some sort of like
 

1897
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,950
likely these are some sort of like
incredibly advanced drones that they've

1898
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:42,960
incredibly advanced drones that they've
 

1899
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,950
incredibly advanced drones that they've
developed that they

1900
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
developed that they
 

1901
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,190
developed that they
want to pretend don't exist

1902
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,200
want to pretend don't exist
 

1903
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,110
want to pretend don't exist
that seems the more likely scenario

1904
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,120
that seems the more likely scenario
 

1905
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,470
that seems the more likely scenario
because otherwise

1906
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,480
because otherwise
 

1907
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,549
because otherwise
my take is like what's the benefit of

1908
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
my take is like what's the benefit of
 

1909
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,029
my take is like what's the benefit of
them discussing these things like what's

1910
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
them discussing these things like what's
 

1911
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,549
them discussing these things like what's
the benefit of them discussing these

1912
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:56,559
the benefit of them discussing these
 

1913
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,909
the benefit of them discussing these
things openly these are you know

1914
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
things openly these are you know
 

1915
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,070
things openly these are you know
what the way they described it off-world

1916
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,080
what the way they described it off-world
 

1917
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,190
what the way they described it off-world
crafts

1918
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,200
crafts
 

1919
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,029
crafts
not made from this earth

1920
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
not made from this earth
 

1921
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,389
not made from this earth
like

1922
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
like
 

1923

start to realize
the scale

2038
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
the scale
 

2039
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,069
the scale
of surveillance and manipulation now a

2040
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079
of surveillance and manipulation now a
 

2041

of surveillance and manipulation now a
lot of them also talk about the

incompetence of those organizations the
 

2045

usual bureaucracy creeps in but the
 

2047
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,109
usual bureaucracy creeps in but the
point is

carl jung talked about the shadow it's

3888
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:53,120
carl jung talked about the shadow it's
 

3889
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,550
carl jung talked about the shadow it's
the unconscious

3890
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:54,560
the unconscious
 

3891
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,829
the unconscious
where you have

3892
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:55,839
where you have
 

3893
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,669
where you have
dark stuff and

3894
01:08:57,669 --> 01:08:57,679
dark stuff and
 

3895
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,510
dark stuff and
oftentimes you used to project there's

3896
01:08:59,510 --> 01:08:59,520
oftentimes you used to project there's
 

3897
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,669
oftentimes you used to project there's
stuff that you're very self-critical

3898
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:01,679
stuff that you're very self-critical
 

3899
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,470
stuff that you're very self-critical
about yourself but because it's in your

3900
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:04,480
about yourself but because it's in your
 

3901
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,470
about yourself but because it's in your
unconscious you use it to project onto

3902
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
unconscious you use it to project onto
 

3903
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,430
unconscious you use it to project onto
others you see it as flaws in others

3904
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:09,440
others you see it as flaws in others
 

3905
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,189
others you see it as flaws in others
and that's a good way to like whatever

3906
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:11,199
and that's a good way to like whatever
 

3907
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,070
and that's a good way to like whatever
um it gives a a quote like everything

3908
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:14,080
um it gives a a quote like everything
 

3909
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,470
um it gives a a quote like everything
that irritates us about others can lead

3910
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:16,480
that irritates us about others can lead
 

3911
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,550
that irritates us about others can lead
us to an understanding of ourselves

3912
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:18,560
us to an understanding of ourselves
 

3913
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,669
us to an understanding of ourselves
so that's that's a nice way to

3914
01:09:21,669 --> 01:09:21,679
so that's that's a nice way to
 

3915
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,189
so that's that's a nice way to
investigate yourself like something that

3916
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:23,199
investigate yourself like something that
 

3917
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,110
investigate yourself like something that
pisses you off

3918
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:25,120
pisses you off
 

3919
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,030
pisses you off
you start asking questions of your mind

3920
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:27,040
you start asking questions of your mind
 

3921
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,149
you start asking questions of your mind
and that's how you bring it to the

3922
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:28,159
and that's how you bring it to the
 

3923
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:30,789
and that's how you bring it to the
surface but anyway from that those are

3924
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:30,799
surface but anyway from that those are
 

3925
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,709
surface but anyway from that those are
formative years

3926
01:09:32,709 --> 01:09:32,719
formative years
 

3927
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,709
formative years
from that time is there still stuff in

3928
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:34,719
from that time is there still stuff in
 

3929
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,070
from that time is there still stuff in
your unconscious you think you haven't

3930
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:36,080
your unconscious you think you haven't
 

3931
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,510
your unconscious you think you haven't
examined

3932
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:37,520
examined
 

3933
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,229
examined
some dark [\h__\h] i don't think so

3934
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:40,239

thing is
 

5187
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,870
thing is
it actually makes sense after eight

5188
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:16,880
it actually makes sense after eight
 

5189
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,430
it actually makes sense after eight
years you've gained the wisdom yeah you

5190
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:19,440
years you've gained the wisdom yeah you
 

5191
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,870
years you've gained the wisdom yeah you
would actually be a pretty good leader

5192
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:20,880
would actually be a pretty good leader
 

5193
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,870
would actually be a pretty good leader
to keep going yeah but there is some

5194
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:22,880
to keep going yeah but there is some
 

5195
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,950
to keep going yeah but there is some
problem where you the power gets started

5196
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:24,960
problem where you the power gets started
 

5197
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,110
problem where you the power gets started
getting to your head yeah and so like

5198
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:27,120
getting to your head yeah and so like
 

5199
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,030
getting to your head yeah and so like
from putin's perspective

5200
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
from putin's perspective
 

5201
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,189
from putin's perspective
i think he genuinely wants the best for

5202
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:31,199
i think he genuinely wants the best for
 

5203
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:34,629
i think he genuinely wants the best for
russia i don't think he's lost his mind

5204
01:32:34,629 --> 01:32:34,639
russia i don't think he's lost his mind
 

5205
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,149
russia i don't think he's lost his mind
in terms of like it's all about greed

5206
01:32:36,149 --> 01:32:36,159
in terms of like it's all about greed
 

5207
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:38,390
in terms of like it's all about greed
and so on uh same as stalin i think

5208
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:38,400
and so on uh same as stalin i think
 

5209
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,189
and so on uh same as stalin i think
stalin until the end of his days wanted

5210
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:41,199
stalin until the end of his days wanted
 

5211
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,350
stalin until the end of his days wanted
the best for the soviet union so it's

5212
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:43,360
the best for the soviet union so it's
 

5213
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,430
the best for the soviet union so it's
not like you become hitler i think lost

5214
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:45,440
not like you become hitler i think lost
