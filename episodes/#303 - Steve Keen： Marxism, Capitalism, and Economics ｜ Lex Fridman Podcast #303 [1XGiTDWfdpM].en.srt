economics
 

107
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,190
economics
or maybe

108
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
or maybe
 

109
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,109
or maybe
what is or should be the goal of

110
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
what is or should be the goal of
 

111
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,870
what is or should be the goal of
economics well it should be understand

112
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
economics well it should be understand
 

113
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,709
economics well it should be understand
how human civilization comes about and

how human civilization comes about and
 

115
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,190
how human civilization comes about and
how it can be maintained

116

how it can be maintained
 

117
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,389
how it can be maintained
and that's not what it's been at all so

118
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
and that's not what it's been at all so
 

119
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,389
and that's not what it's been at all so
we have a discipline which has the right

we have a discipline which has the right
 

121

build a civilization that elevates us so
 

131
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,470
build a civilization that elevates us so
far above the energy and

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
far above the energy and
 

133
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,750

atmospheric physicist and his idea is
 

151
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,229
atmospheric physicist and his idea is
that we have these we exploit these

what we'd have if we're just still

00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
what we'd have if we're just still
 

163

what we'd have if we're just still
running around with rocks and stones and

so it's that elevation above the base

168
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
so it's that elevation above the base
 

169
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,470
so it's that elevation above the base
level of the planet which is human

170
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
level of the planet which is human
 

171
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,949
level of the planet which is human
civilization and if we didn't have this

172
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
civilization and if we didn't have this
 

173
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,350
civilization and if we didn't have this
energy we were exploiting if we didn't

174
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
energy we were exploiting if we didn't
 

175
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,750
energy we were exploiting if we didn't
use the environment to elevate ourselves

176
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
use the environment to elevate ourselves
 

177
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,990
use the environment to elevate ourselves
above what's possible in the background

178
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
above what's possible in the background
 

179
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,350
above what's possible in the background
then you and i wouldn't be talking into

180
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
then you and i wouldn't be talking into
 

181
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,550
then you and i wouldn't be talking into
microphones

182
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
microphones
 

183
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,149
microphones
you know yeah we might be doing drum

184
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
you know yeah we might be doing drum
 

185
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,509
you know yeah we might be doing drum
beats and stuff like this but we

186
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
beats and stuff like this but we
 

187
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,110
beats and stuff like this but we
wouldn't be having the sort of

188
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
wouldn't be having the sort of
 

189
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,190
wouldn't be having the sort of
conversation we have so it explained how

190
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
conversation we have so it explained how
 

191
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,229
conversation we have so it explained how
they came about that what's the

192
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
they came about that what's the
 

193
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,030
they came about that what's the
economics should be doing and it's not

194
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
economics should be doing and it's not
 

195
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,550
economics should be doing and it's not
so this is the greatest thing that the

196
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
so this is the greatest thing that the
 

197
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,830
so this is the greatest thing that the
earth has ever created is what you're

198
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
earth has ever created is what you're
 

199
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,670
earth has ever created is what you're
saying this conversation yeah we're the

200
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
saying this conversation yeah we're the
 

201
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,110
saying this conversation yeah we're the
most elaborate

202
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
most elaborate
 

203
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,030
most elaborate
construction on the planet and like

204
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
construction on the planet and like
 

205
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,390
construction on the planet and like
that's not what we've done we've

206
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
that's not what we've done we've
 

207
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,390
that's not what we've done we've
denigrated the planet itself

208
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
denigrated the planet itself
 

209
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,910
denigrated the planet itself
we don't have respect for the fact that

210
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
we don't have respect for the fact that
 

211
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,390
we don't have respect for the fact that
life itself is an incredible creation

212
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
life itself is an incredible creation
 

213
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,350
life itself is an incredible creation
and i i my ultimate if i had to see how

214
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
and i i my ultimate if i had to see how
 

215
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,869
and i i my ultimate if i had to see how
humanity is going to survive what we're

216
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
humanity is going to survive what we're
 

217
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,789
humanity is going to survive what we're
putting ourselves through then it would

218
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
putting ourselves through then it would
 

219
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,030
putting ourselves through then it would
we'd have to come out of it as a species

220
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
we'd have to come out of it as a species
 

221
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,430
we'd have to come out of it as a species
which sees its role as preserving and

222
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
which sees its role as preserving and
 

223
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,190
which sees its role as preserving and
respecting life

224
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
respecting life
 

225
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,789
respecting life
i like how you took my

226
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
i like how you took my
 

227
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,350
i like how you took my
silly incredible statement and made it

228
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
silly incredible statement and made it
 

229
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,149
silly incredible statement and made it
into a uh

230
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
into a uh
 

231
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,670
into a uh
a serious one about how amazing life is

232
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
a serious one about how amazing life is
 

233
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,149
a serious one about how amazing life is
life is incredible and when humans don't

234
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
life is incredible and when humans don't
 

235
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,309
life is incredible and when humans don't
respect it enough we trash it

236
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
respect it enough we trash it
 

237
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,630
respect it enough we trash it
and and that's what economics i think

238
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
and and that's what economics i think
 

239
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,630
and and that's what economics i think
has played a huge role in that so i

240
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
has played a huge role in that so i
 

241
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,390
has played a huge role in that so i
actually regard my discipline i would

242
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
actually regard my discipline i would
 

243
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,990
actually regard my discipline i would
never call it a profession let alone a

244
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
never call it a profession let alone a
 

245
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,469
never call it a profession let alone a
science uh my discipline

246
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
science uh my discipline
 

247
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,789
science uh my discipline
has probably helped bring about the

248
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
has probably helped bring about the
 

249
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,469
has probably helped bring about the

human civilization strong words okay

254
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
human civilization strong words okay
 

255
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,030
human civilization strong words okay
let's return to the basics

256
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
let's return to the basics
 

257
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,990
let's return to the basics
of economics so what is

258
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
of economics so what is
 

259
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,830
of economics so what is
the soul and the practice of economics

260
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
the soul and the practice of economics
 

261
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,830
the soul and the practice of economics
what what should what should be the goal

262
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
what what should what should be the goal
 

263
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,189
what what should what should be the goal
of it because

264
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
of it because
 

265
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,030
of it because
you're speaking very poetically but

266
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
you're speaking very poetically but
 

267
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,310
you're speaking very poetically but
we'll also speak pragmatically

268
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
we'll also speak pragmatically
 

269
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,310
we'll also speak pragmatically
about the tools of economics the

270
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
about the tools of economics the
 

271
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,710
about the tools of economics the
variables of economics the metrics the

272
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
variables of economics the metrics the
 

273
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,629
variables of economics the metrics the
goals the models

274
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
goals the models
 

275
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,629
goals the models
practically speaking

276
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
practically speaking
 

277
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,629
practically speaking
what are the goals of economics well in

278
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
what are the goals of economics well in
 

279
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,390
what are the goals of economics well in
terms of the tools we use we should be

280
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
terms of the tools we use we should be
 

281
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,870
terms of the tools we use we should be
using the tools that engineers use

282
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
using the tools that engineers use
 

283
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,629
using the tools that engineers use
frankly and that's which sounds

284
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
frankly and that's which sounds
 

285
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,110
frankly and that's which sounds
ridiculously simple because you would

286
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
ridiculously simple because you would
 

287
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,950
ridiculously simple because you would
expect that economists are using

288
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
expect that economists are using
 

289
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,749
expect that economists are using
up-to-date techniques that are common in

290
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
up-to-date techniques that are common in
 

291
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,990
up-to-date techniques that are common in
other sciences where you're

292
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
other sciences where you're
 

293
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,670
other sciences where you're
dealing with similar ideas of stocks and

294
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
dealing with similar ideas of stocks and
 

295
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,710
dealing with similar ideas of stocks and
flows

296
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
flows
 

297
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,950
flows
and interactions between the environment

298
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
and interactions between the environment
 

299
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,870
and interactions between the environment
and a system and so on and that's

300
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
and a system and so on and that's
 

301
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,950
and a system and so on and that's
fundamentally systems engineering and

302
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
fundamentally systems engineering and
 

303
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,550
fundamentally systems engineering and
that's what we should be using as the

304
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
that's what we should be using as the
 

305
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,390
that's what we should be using as the
tools of economics now if you look at

306
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
tools of economics now if you look at
 

307
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,390
tools of economics now if you look at
what economists actually do

308
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
what economists actually do
 

309
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,990
what economists actually do
the sophisticated stuff involves

310
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
the sophisticated stuff involves
 

311
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,710
the sophisticated stuff involves
difference equations

312
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
difference equations
 

313
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,550
difference equations
and like difference equations you know

314
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
and like difference equations you know
 

315
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,710
and like difference equations you know
if you've done enough mathematics as you

316
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
if you've done enough mathematics as you
 

317
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,790
if you've done enough mathematics as you
have you know difference equations

318
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
have you know difference equations
 

319
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,110
have you know difference equations
are useful for like individual level

320
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
are useful for like individual level
 

321
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,270
are useful for like individual level
processes if you're talking about a

322
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
processes if you're talking about a
 

323
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,189
processes if you're talking about a
autonomous one it'll go from state t to

324
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
autonomous one it'll go from state t to
 

325
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,510
autonomous one it'll go from state t to
t plus one t plus two and so on but not

326
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
t plus one t plus two and so on but not
 

327
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,710
t plus one t plus two and so on but not
when you're talking at the aggregate

328
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
when you're talking at the aggregate
 

329
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,150
when you're talking at the aggregate
level there you use differential

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,909
level there you use differential
equations to measure it all

332
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
equations to measure it all

economists have been using difference

334
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
economists have been using difference
 

335
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,590
economists have been using difference
equations so there's like a book i think

336
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
equations so there's like a book i think
 

337
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,590
equations so there's like a book i think
it's by sergeant and one other are

338
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
it's by sergeant and one other are
 

339
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,150
it's by sergeant and one other are
called advanced methods in economics

340
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
called advanced methods in economics

00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
using python 2 volume set
 

343
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,590
using python 2 volume set
it's about close to 2 000 pages and four

344
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
it's about close to 2 000 pages and four
 

345
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,110
it's about close to 2 000 pages and four
of those pages are on differential

346
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
of those pages are on differential
 

347
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,469
of those pages are on differential

348
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
equations
 

349
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,950
equations
the rest is all difference equations so

350
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
the rest is all difference equations so
 

351
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,990
the rest is all difference equations so
they're using entirely the wrong

352
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
they're using entirely the wrong

listening what is difference equations

356
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
listening what is difference equations
 

357
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,990
listening what is difference equations
versus differential okay a difference

358
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
versus differential okay a difference
 

359
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,830
versus differential okay a difference
equation is is like you can do in a

360
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
equation is is like you can do in a
 

361
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,749
equation is is like you can do in a
spreadsheet you'll have this is without

362
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
spreadsheet you'll have this is without
 

363
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,629
spreadsheet you'll have this is without
even 1990 this is the value for 1991 92

364
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
even 1990 this is the value for 1991 92
 

365
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,909
even 1990 this is the value for 1991 92
and 93 94. so you have you have discrete

366
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
and 93 94. so you have you have discrete
 

367
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,909
and 93 94. so you have you have discrete
jumps in time uh whereas the

368
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
jumps in time uh whereas the
 

369
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,350
jumps in time uh whereas the
differential equation says there's a

370
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
differential equation says there's a
 

371
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,270
differential equation says there's a
process moving through time

372
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
process moving through time
 

373
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,590
process moving through time
and you will have a rate of change of

374
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
and you will have a rate of change of
 

375
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,110
and you will have a rate of change of
the of a

376
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
the of a
 

377
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,749
the of a
variable is a function of the state of

378
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
variable is a function of the state of
 

379
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,830
variable is a function of the state of
itself and other variables and rates of

380
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
itself and other variables and rates of
 

381
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,309
itself and other variables and rates of
change of those variables and that is

382
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
change of those variables and that is
 

383
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,430
change of those variables and that is
what you use when you're doing an

384
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
what you use when you're doing an
 

385
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,189
what you use when you're doing an
aggregate model so if you're modeling

386
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
aggregate model so if you're modeling
 

387
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,749
aggregate model so if you're modeling
water for example or fluid dynamics you

388
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
water for example or fluid dynamics you
 

389
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,350
water for example or fluid dynamics you
have a set of differential equations

390
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
have a set of differential equations
 

391
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,070
have a set of differential equations
describing the entire body of fluid

392
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
describing the entire body of fluid
 

393
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,909
describing the entire body of fluid
moving through time you don't try to

394
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919
moving through time you don't try to
 

395
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,309
moving through time you don't try to
model the discrete motion of each

396
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
model the discrete motion of each
 

397
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,230
model the discrete motion of each
molecule of h2o

398
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
molecule of h2o
 

399
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,990
molecule of h2o
so at the aggregate level you use

400
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
so at the aggregate level you use
 

401
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,589
so at the aggregate level you use
differential equations for processes

402
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
differential equations for processes
 

403
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,189
differential equations for processes
that occur through time

404
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
that occur through time
 

405
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,110
that occur through time
and that's economics it occurs through

406
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
and that's economics it occurs through
 

407
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,110
and that's economics it occurs through
time you should be using that particular

408
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
time you should be using that particular
 

409
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,790
time you should be using that particular
technology but

410
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
technology but
 

411
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,950
technology but
some economists do learn differential

412
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
some economists do learn differential
 

413
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,110
some economists do learn differential
equations but they don't learn stability

414
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
equations but they don't learn stability
 

415
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,629
equations but they don't learn stability
analysis so they simply assume

416
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
analysis so they simply assume
 

417
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,390
analysis so they simply assume
equilibrium is stable and they work in

418
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
equilibrium is stable and they work in
 

419
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,029
equilibrium is stable and they work in
equilibrium terms all the time and

420
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
equilibrium terms all the time and
 

421
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,029
equilibrium terms all the time and
that's uh it is the the the technical

422
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
that's uh it is the the the technical
 

423
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,309
that's uh it is the the the technical
level it's it's an incredibly

424
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
level it's it's an incredibly
 

425
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,070
level it's it's an incredibly
complicated

426
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
complicated
 

427
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,390
complicated
uh way of modeling the world using

428
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
uh way of modeling the world using
 

429
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,469
uh way of modeling the world using
entirely the wrong tools okay we'll

430
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
entirely the wrong tools okay we'll
 

431
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,469
entirely the wrong tools okay we'll
we'll talk about that because it's

432
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
we'll talk about that because it's
 

433
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,830
we'll talk about that because it's
unclear

434
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
unclear
 

435
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,670
unclear
what the right tools are yeah maybe it's

436
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
what the right tools are yeah maybe it's
 

437
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,749
what the right tools are yeah maybe it's
more clear to you but i've got to make

438
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
more clear to you but i've got to make
 

439
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,150
more clear to you but i've got to make
it clear to an audience well

440
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
it clear to an audience well
 

441
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,629
it clear to an audience well
so this is a very complicated world it's

442
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
so this is a very complicated world it's
 

443
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,350
so this is a very complicated world it's
a complex world you talk about their

444
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
a complex world you talk about their
 

445
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,870
a complex world you talk about their
uh some of the most complex

446
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
uh some of the most complex
 

447
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,710
uh some of the most complex
systems on earth are the human mind

448
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
systems on earth are the human mind
 

449
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,150
systems on earth are the human mind
the economy and the biosphere yep so

450
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
the economy and the biosphere yep so
 

451
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,469
the economy and the biosphere yep so
we'll we'll we'll go you know i'm we'll

452
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
we'll we'll we'll go you know i'm we'll
 

453
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,189
we'll we'll we'll go you know i'm we'll
go to that place i'm uh fascinated by

454
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
go to that place i'm uh fascinated by
 

455
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,550
go to that place i'm uh fascinated by
complex systems

456
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
complex systems
 

457
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,749
complex systems
i'm humbled

458
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
i'm humbled
 

459
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,309
i'm humbled
by them even at their simplest level of

00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
by them even at their simplest level of
 

461
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,469
by them even at their simplest level of

like cellular automata
 

463
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,950

um i'm not sure what the right tools are

464
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
um i'm not sure what the right tools are
 

465
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,309
um i'm not sure what the right tools are
to understand that especially when part

466
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
to understand that especially when part
 

467
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,749
to understand that especially when part
uh

468
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
uh
 

469
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,670
uh
part of the complex system is like a

470
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
part of the complex system is like a
 

471
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,749
part of the complex system is like a
hierarchy of other complex systems yeah

472
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
hierarchy of other complex systems yeah
 

473
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,390
hierarchy of other complex systems yeah
you said the economy is a fascinating

474
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
you said the economy is a fascinating
 

475
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,790
you said the economy is a fascinating
complex system but it's made up of human

476
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
complex system but it's made up of human
 

477
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,749
complex system but it's made up of human
minds

478
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
minds
 

479
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,589

00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
and those are interesting those are
 

481
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,350
and those are interesting those are
those are interesting perhaps impossible

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
those are interesting perhaps impossible

00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
to model
 

485
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,790
to model
but we can try and we can try to figure

486
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
but we can try and we can try to figure
 

487
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,309
but we can try and we can try to figure
out how to approximate them and maybe

488
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
out how to approximate them and maybe
 

489
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,710
out how to approximate them and maybe
that's the challenge of economics okay

490
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
that's the challenge of economics okay
 

491
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,029
that's the challenge of economics okay
we'll keep returning to the basics let

492
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039

they're called the physiocrats

if you go back far enough in history we
 

561
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,389
if you go back far enough in history we
didn't we didn't do autopsies but when

didn't we didn't do autopsies but when
 

563
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,070
didn't we didn't do autopsies but when
you started doing autopsies they found

564
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
you started doing autopsies they found
 

565
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,509
you started doing autopsies they found
wires they found tubes etc etc and they

566
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
wires they found tubes etc etc and they
 

567
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,509
wires they found tubes etc etc and they
started seeing the body as a circulation

568
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
started seeing the body as a circulation
 

569
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,269
started seeing the body as a circulation
system and they applied the same sort of

570
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
system and they applied the same sort of
 

571
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,230
system and they applied the same sort of
logic to the economy and they became out

572
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
logic to the economy and they became out
 

573
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,829
logic to the economy and they became out
of an agricultural economy which was

574
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
of an agricultural economy which was
 

575
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,190
of an agricultural economy which was
france and they saw that the wealth came

576
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
france and they saw that the wealth came
 

577
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,790
france and they saw that the wealth came
effectively from the sun

578
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
effectively from the sun
 

579
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,389
effectively from the sun
so they saw all wealth comes from they

580
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
so they saw all wealth comes from they
 

581
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,990
so they saw all wealth comes from they
said the soil but what they really mean

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,069
said the soil but what they really mean
is sun the soil absorbs the energy of

is sun the soil absorbs the energy of

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,630
is sun the soil absorbs the energy of

don't extract value you simply change
 

621
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,910
don't extract value you simply change
the shape of value so the the value

622
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
the shape of value so the the value
 

623
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,910
the shape of value so the the value
comes from the soil the only comes from

and we then distribute the free gifts of
 

631
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,550
and we then distribute the free gifts of
nature around and we need carriages

nature around and we need carriages
 

633
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,310

which was the manufacturing term they

634
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
which was the manufacturing term they
 

635
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,750
which was the manufacturing term they
used at the time

so we to make the carriages we take

642
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
so we to make the carriages we take
 

643
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,190
so we to make the carriages we take
what's been

644

what's been
 

645
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,350
what's been
taken from the soil and we convert it to

taken from the soil and we convert it to
 

647
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,190
taken from the soil and we convert it to
a different form but there is no value

648
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
a different form but there is no value
 

649
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,509
a different form but there is no value
added in manufacturing so smith looked

650
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
added in manufacturing so smith looked
 

651
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,230
added in manufacturing so smith looked
at that and said well i'm from scotland

652
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
at that and said well i'm from scotland

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,470
industries you know we make stuff and
it's machinery and he said no it's not

658
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
it's machinery and he said no it's not
 

659
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,990
it's machinery and he said no it's not
land that gives it the source of value

660
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
land that gives it the source of value
 

661
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,750
land that gives it the source of value
it's labor

662
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
it's labor
 

663
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,990
it's labor
yeah now that led to the classical

664
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
yeah now that led to the classical
 

665
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,150
yeah now that led to the classical
school of thought and that said that all

666
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
school of thought and that said that all
 

667
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,389
school of thought and that said that all
value comes from labor

668
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
value comes from labor
 

669
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,829
value comes from labor
uh that

670
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
uh that
 

671
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,150
uh that
value is uh is objective so it's the

672
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
value is uh is objective so it's the
 

673
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,990
value is uh is objective so it's the
amount of effort you put in that the

674
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
amount of effort you put in that the
 

675
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,590
amount of effort you put in that the
price two things will exchange for

676
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600

reflects the relative effort that's
 

679
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,949

involved in the manufacturing so this

680
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
involved in the manufacturing so this
 

681
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,949

computer takes two hours to make and

682
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
computer takes two hours to make and
 

683
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,870
computer takes two hours to make and
this bottle takes two minutes to make

684
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
this bottle takes two minutes to make
 

685
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,790
this bottle takes two minutes to make
then there's this is worth 60 times as

686
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
then there's this is worth 60 times as
 

687
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,629
then there's this is worth 60 times as
much as that okay they didn't talk about

688
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
much as that okay they didn't talk about
 

689
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,550
much as that okay they didn't talk about
marginal cost it was absolute cost

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
marginal cost it was absolute cost
 

691
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,150
marginal cost it was absolute cost
effectively they didn't talk about

692
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
effectively they didn't talk about
 

693
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,829
effectively they didn't talk about
utility as a subjective thing they

694
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
utility as a subjective thing they
 

695
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,590
utility as a subjective thing they
ridiculed subjective utility theory

696
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
ridiculed subjective utility theory
 

697
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,629

they say money illusion so they they

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,790
you all the points of the same pressure

so you can be you can be here or you can
 

795

809
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,350
utility as lots of coconuts and very few
bananas and you draw a basically a like

810
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
bananas and you draw a basically a like
 

811
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,750

a hyperbola running down and linking the
 

813
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,750
a hyperbola running down and linking the
two and they'll say well that's that's

814
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
two and they'll say well that's that's
 

815
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,150
two and they'll say well that's that's
your utility that describes your tastes

your utility that describes your tastes
 

817
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,910
your utility that describes your tastes
and then we have your income and there's

you like visor or whatever a particular
drink you want to have you know the

986
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
drink you want to have you know the
 

987
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,710
drink you want to have you know the
current situation but to invest you must

988
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
current situation but to invest you must
 

989
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,790
current situation but to invest you must
be making guesses about the future

990
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
be making guesses about the future
 

991
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,870
be making guesses about the future
but you don't know the future so what do

992
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
but you don't know the future so what do
 

993
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,949
but you don't know the future so what do
you do you extrapolate what you

994
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
you do you extrapolate what you
 

995
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,150
you do you extrapolate what you
currently know

996
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
currently know
 

997
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,910
currently know
and that's he said this is a terrible

998
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
and that's he said this is a terrible
 

999
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,509
and that's he said this is a terrible
basis on which to

1000
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
basis on which to
 

1001
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,110
basis on which to
plan for the future

1002
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
plan for the future
 

1003
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,829
plan for the future
but

1004
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
but
 

1005
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,270
but
this is the only thing you can do when

1006
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
this is the only thing you can do when
 

1007
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,949
this is the only thing you can do when
there where there is no possibility of

1008
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
there where there is no possibility of
 

1009
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,549
there where there is no possibility of
solid calculation

1010
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
solid calculation
 

1011
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,390
solid calculation
so investment is therefore subject to

1012
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
so investment is therefore subject to
 

1013
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,750
so investment is therefore subject to
uncertainty

1014
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
uncertainty
 

1015
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,829
uncertainty
and therefore you will get volatility

1016
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
and therefore you will get volatility
 

1017
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,949
and therefore you will get volatility
out of out of investment you will get

1018
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
out of out of investment you will get
 

1019
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,270
out of out of investment you will get
fads of course booms and slumps coming

1020
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
fads of course booms and slumps coming
 

1021
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,710
fads of course booms and slumps coming
out of that because people extrapolate

1022
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
out of that because people extrapolate
 

1023
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,470
out of that because people extrapolate
forward the current conditions and

1024
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
forward the current conditions and
 

1025
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,230
forward the current conditions and
that's the normal state of a capitalist

1026
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
that's the normal state of a capitalist
 

1027
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,309
that's the normal state of a capitalist
economy and schumpeter argued that

1028
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
economy and schumpeter argued that
 

1029
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,990
economy and schumpeter argued that
that's what gives us this creativity as

1030
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
that's what gives us this creativity as
 

1031
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,190
that's what gives us this creativity as
well the fact that you can perceive a

1032
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
well the fact that you can perceive a
 

1033
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,830
well the fact that you can perceive a
potential demand but you don't first of

1034
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
potential demand but you don't first of
 

1035
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,029
potential demand but you don't first of
all you don't know whether that demand

1036
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
all you don't know whether that demand
 

1037
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,029
all you don't know whether that demand
is going to work secondly you don't know

1038
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
is going to work secondly you don't know
 

1039
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,230
is going to work secondly you don't know
who your competitor's going to be

1040
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
who your competitor's going to be
 

1041
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,430
who your competitor's going to be
whether somebody's going to be ahead of

1042
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
whether somebody's going to be ahead of
 

1043
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,590
whether somebody's going to be ahead of
you or behind if there's a fad you'll

1044
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
you or behind if there's a fad you'll
 

1045
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,510
you or behind if there's a fad you'll
over invest okay

1046
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
over invest okay
 

1047
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,470
over invest okay
um

1048
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
um
 

1049
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,230
um
all this stuff is the real nature of

1050
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
all this stuff is the real nature of
 

1051
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,590
all this stuff is the real nature of
capitalism and that's what we should be

1052
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
capitalism and that's what we should be
 

1053
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,430
capitalism and that's what we should be
trying to capture the dynamic

1054
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
trying to capture the dynamic
 

1055
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,390
trying to capture the dynamic
non-equilibrium monetary

violence and creativity of capitalism

1058
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
violence and creativity of capitalism
 

1059
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,630
violence and creativity of capitalism
that's what we should be analyzing and

1060
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
that's what we should be analyzing and
 

1061
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,630
that's what we should be analyzing and
the keynesian school

1062
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
the keynesian school
 

1063
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,510
the keynesian school
has gone in that orientation

1064
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
has gone in that orientation
 

1065
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,710
has gone in that orientation
they've been in my opinion inhibited by

1066
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
they've been in my opinion inhibited by
 

1067
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,549
they've been in my opinion inhibited by
learning their mathematics from

1068
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
learning their mathematics from
 

1069
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,310
learning their mathematics from
neoclassical economists so they don't

1070
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
neoclassical economists so they don't
 

1071
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,230
neoclassical economists so they don't
have enough of the technology of complex

1072
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
have enough of the technology of complex
 

1073
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,150
have enough of the technology of complex
systems there's only a really tiny

1074
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
systems there's only a really tiny
 

1075
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,750
systems there's only a really tiny
handful of people working in complex

1076
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
handful of people working in complex
 

1077
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,070
handful of people working in complex
systems analysis in post keynesian

1078
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
systems analysis in post keynesian
 

1079
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,990
systems analysis in post keynesian
economics but that is to me the most

1080
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
economics but that is to me the most
 

1081
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,830
economics but that is to me the most
interesting area so their their tools

1082
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
interesting area so their their tools
 

1083
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,750
interesting area so their their tools
may be lacking but they fundamentally

1084
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
may be lacking but they fundamentally
 

1085
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,310
may be lacking but they fundamentally
accept the instability of that's right

1086
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,320
accept the instability of that's right
 

1087
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,590
accept the instability of that's right
that's right and so that's what makes

1088
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
that's right and so that's what makes
 

1089
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,430
that's right and so that's what makes
them interesting so let me let me try to

1090
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
them interesting so let me let me try to
 

1091
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,110
them interesting so let me let me try to
summarize what you said and then you say

1092
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
summarize what you said and then you say
 

1093
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,070
summarize what you said and then you say
how stupid i am okay so then there was

1094
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
how stupid i am okay so then there was
 

1095
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,350
how stupid i am okay so then there was
the uh

1096
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
the uh
 

1097
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,870
the uh
physiocrats

1098
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
physiocrats
 

1099
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,789
physiocrats
that thought value

1100
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
that thought value
 

1101
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,590
that thought value
came from the land yep then there's adam

1102
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
came from the land yep then there's adam
 

1103

smith
 

1105
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,150
smith
who said

who said
 

1107
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,430
who said
nah

1108
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
nah
 

1109
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,710
nah
value comes from human labor

1110
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
value comes from human labor
 

1111
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,669
value comes from human labor
uh

1112
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
uh
 

1113
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,390
uh
that was that was the classical school

1114
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
that was that was the classical school
 

1115
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,710
that was that was the classical school
and then neoclassical

1116
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
and then neoclassical
 

1117
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,510
and then neoclassical
is uh value comes from

1118
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
is uh value comes from
 

1119
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,430
is uh value comes from
like bananas and coconuts the prefer

1120
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
like bananas and coconuts the prefer
 

1121
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,029
like bananas and coconuts the prefer
human preference is

1122
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
human preference is
 

1123
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,830
human preference is
like human happiness how happy

1124
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
like human happiness how happy
 

1125
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,150
like human happiness how happy
how happy a banana makes you mm-hmm and

1126

how happy a banana makes you mm-hmm and
 

1127
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,110
how happy a banana makes you mm-hmm and
then uh the kenzian and the post-kansan

1128
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
then uh the kenzian and the post-kansan
 

1129
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,549
then uh the kenzian and the post-kansan
were like

1130
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
were like
 

1131
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,630
were like
yeah well you can't

1132
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
yeah well you can't
 

1133
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,630
yeah well you can't
you can't you can never the moment you

1134
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
you can't you can never the moment you
 

1135
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,789
you can't you can never the moment you
try to put value to a banana and a

1136
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
try to put value to a banana and a
 

1137
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,270
try to put value to a banana and a
coconut you're already working in the

1138
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,280
coconut you're already working in the
 

1139
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,310
coconut you're already working in the
past

1140
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
past
 

1141
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,510
past
yeah yeah

1142
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
yeah yeah
 

1143
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,190
yeah yeah
it's always going to be chaos and

1144
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
it's always going to be chaos and
 

1145
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,669
it's always going to be chaos and
stability and then you just

1146
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
stability and then you just
 

1147

consumers everybody's both a producer
 

1203
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,950
consumers everybody's both a producer
and a consumer and you try to work out a

1204
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
and a consumer and you try to work out a
 

1205
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,470
and a consumer and you try to work out a
vector of prices that will give you

1206
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
vector of prices that will give you
 

1207
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,110
vector of prices that will give you
equilibrium in all markets

1208
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,120
equilibrium in all markets
 

1209
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,630
equilibrium in all markets
instantaneously and that's his

1210
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
instantaneously and that's his
 

1211
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,950
instantaneously and that's his
equilibrium orientation jevons is also

1212
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
equilibrium orientation jevons is also
 

1213
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,470
equilibrium orientation jevons is also
on about equilibrium but he worked more

1214
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
on about equilibrium but he worked more
 

1215
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,310
on about equilibrium but he worked more
at the aggregate level so there's a

1216
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
at the aggregate level so there's a
 

1217
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,830
at the aggregate level so there's a
supply curve in a demand curve and

1218
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,840
supply curve in a demand curve and
 

1219
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,430
supply curve in a demand curve and
that's what gabe marshall ultimately

1220
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
that's what gabe marshall ultimately
 

1221
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,710
that's what gabe marshall ultimately
codified

1222
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
codified
 

1223
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,870

menger was pretty much saying that well

1224
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
menger was pretty much saying that well
 

1225
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,390
menger was pretty much saying that well
yes there might be an equilibrium but

1226
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
yes there might be an equilibrium but
 

1227
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,590
yes there might be an equilibrium but
you're going to get disturbed from it

1228
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
you're going to get disturbed from it
 

1229
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,110
you're going to get disturbed from it
all the time you'll be above or below

all the time you'll be above or below

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,950
all the time you'll be above or below
the equilibrium and what came out of the

1232
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
the equilibrium and what came out of the
 

1233
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,710
the equilibrium and what came out of the
austrian school was an acceptance of

1234
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
austrian school was an acceptance of
 

1235
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,950
austrian school was an acceptance of
that sort of vision that the market

1236
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
that sort of vision that the market
 

1237
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,390
that sort of vision that the market
should reach equilibrium

1238
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
should reach equilibrium
 

1239
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,830
should reach equilibrium
but then said well you'll get disturbed

1240
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
but then said well you'll get disturbed
 

1241
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,070
but then said well you'll get disturbed
away from the equilibrium and it's

1242
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
away from the equilibrium and it's
 

1243
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,430
away from the equilibrium and it's
that's what gives you

1244
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
that's what gives you
 

1245
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,510
that's what gives you
the vitality of capitalism because an

1246
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
the vitality of capitalism because an
 

1247
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,669
the vitality of capitalism because an
entrepreneur will see an arbitrage

1248
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
entrepreneur will see an arbitrage
 

1249
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,149
entrepreneur will see an arbitrage
advantage and try to close that gap and

1250
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
advantage and try to close that gap and
 

1251
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,070
advantage and try to close that gap and
that will give you innovation over time

1252
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
that will give you innovation over time
 

1253
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,230
that will give you innovation over time
and schumpeter went beyond that and saw

1254
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
and schumpeter went beyond that and saw
 

1255
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,909
and schumpeter went beyond that and saw
the role of money and said that

1256
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
the role of money and said that
 

1257
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,510
the role of money and said that
entrepreneur an entrepreneur is somebody

1258
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
entrepreneur an entrepreneur is somebody
 

1259
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,149
entrepreneur an entrepreneur is somebody
with a great idea and no money

1260
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
with a great idea and no money
 

1261
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,789
with a great idea and no money
yeah okay so to become a capitalist

1262
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
yeah okay so to become a capitalist
 

1263
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,270
yeah okay so to become a capitalist
you've got to get money and therefore

1264
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
you've got to get money and therefore
 

1265
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,630
you've got to get money and therefore
you've got to approach the finance

1266
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
you've got to approach the finance
 

1267
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,710
you've got to approach the finance
sector to get the money and the finance

1268
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
sector to get the money and the finance
 

1269
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,430
sector to get the money and the finance
sector creates money and also creates a

1270
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
sector creates money and also creates a
 

1271
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,190
sector creates money and also creates a
debt for the entrepreneur

1272
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
debt for the entrepreneur
 

1273
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,430
debt for the entrepreneur
and so you get this financial

1274
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
and so you get this financial
 

1275
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,669
and so you get this financial
engine turning up as well

1276
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
engine turning up as well
 

1277
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,029
engine turning up as well
and you will get movements away from

1278
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
and you will get movements away from
 

1279
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,870
and you will get movements away from
equilibrium out of that you won't

1280
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
equilibrium out of that you won't
 

1281
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,149
equilibrium out of that you won't
necessarily head back towards the

1282
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
necessarily head back towards the
 

1283
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,750
necessarily head back towards the
equilibrium so schumpeter has a rich

1284
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
equilibrium so schumpeter has a rich
 

1285
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,909
equilibrium so schumpeter has a rich
vision of capitalism in which money

1286
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
vision of capitalism in which money
 

1287
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,909
vision of capitalism in which money
plays an essential role

1288
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
plays an essential role
 

1289
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,909
plays an essential role
in which you will

1290
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
in which you will
 

1291
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,590
in which you will
be disturbed from equilibrium all the

1292
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
be disturbed from equilibrium all the
 

1293
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,789
be disturbed from equilibrium all the
time

1294
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
time
 

1295
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,750
time
and that is really i think a much closer

1296
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
and that is really i think a much closer
 

1297
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,830
and that is really i think a much closer
vision of actual capitalism than

1298
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
vision of actual capitalism than
 

1299
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,110
vision of actual capitalism than
anything by

1300
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
anything by
 

1301
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,110
anything by
even even the the industry-leading

1302
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
even even the the industry-leading

you know hayek uh et cetera et cetera

sean peter's argument is the deviation
from equilibrium that's where all the

and like the austrians because they
 

1347
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,950
and like the austrians because they
focus on the deviation from equilibrium

1397
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,990
i want to summarize it's bluntly it's
simply saying let's do the accounting

1398
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
simply saying let's do the accounting

who did it
 

1411
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,149
who did it
based on some arabic ideas as well but

1412
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
based on some arabic ideas as well but
 

1413
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,430
based on some arabic ideas as well but
the thing is if you want to keep track

1414
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
the thing is if you want to keep track
 

1415
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,149
the thing is if you want to keep track
of your uh financial flows

1416
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:02,159
of your uh financial flows
 

1417
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,470
of your uh financial flows
then you divide

1418
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
then you divide
 

1419
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,149
then you divide
what you uh

1420
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:06,159
what you uh
 

1421
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,149
what you uh
all the financial claims on you you

1422
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
all the financial claims on you you
 

1423
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,909
all the financial claims on you you
divide into claims you have on somebody

1424
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
divide into claims you have on somebody
 

1425
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,830
divide into claims you have on somebody
else which are your assets claims

1426
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
else which are your assets claims
 

1427
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,350
else which are your assets claims
somebody else has on you which are your

1428
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
somebody else has on you which are your
 

1429
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,590
somebody else has on you which are your
liabilities and the gap between you two

1430
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
liabilities and the gap between you two
 

1431
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,750
liabilities and the gap between you two
the two is your equity so you record

1432
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
the two is your equity so you record
 

1433
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,630
the two is your equity so you record
every transaction twice on one row okay

1434
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
every transaction twice on one row okay
 

1435
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,269
every transaction twice on one row okay
so for example if you and i uh do a

1436
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
so for example if you and i uh do a
 

1437
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,669
so for example if you and i uh do a
financial transfer uh you have a bank

1438
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
financial transfer uh you have a bank
 

1439
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,830
financial transfer uh you have a bank
account i have a bank account uh your

1440
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
account i have a bank account uh your
 

1441
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,149
account i have a bank account uh your
bank account will go down mine goes up

1442
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:30,159
bank account will go down mine goes up
 

1443
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,669
bank account will go down mine goes up
okay and that's

1444
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
okay and that's
 

1445
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,630
okay and that's
the sum of the operation is zero okay

1446
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
the sum of the operation is zero okay
 

1447
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,230
the sum of the operation is zero okay
but on the other hand if i go to a bank

1448
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,240
but on the other hand if i go to a bank
 

1449
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,149
but on the other hand if i go to a bank
and borrow money then my account goes up

1450
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
and borrow money then my account goes up
 

1451
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,909
and borrow money then my account goes up
they put money in my deposit account the

1452
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
they put money in my deposit account the
 

1453
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,470
they put money in my deposit account the
bank's assets go up okay and they're

1454
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
bank's assets go up okay and they're
 

1455
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,470
bank's assets go up okay and they're
still the same sum applies assets minus

1456
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
still the same sum applies assets minus
 

1457
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,110
still the same sum applies assets minus
liabilities minus equity equals zero now

1458
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,120
liabilities minus equity equals zero now
 

1459
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,669
liabilities minus equity equals zero now
that's simply saying money is a an

1460
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
that's simply saying money is a an
 

1461
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,909
that's simply saying money is a an

1463
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,070

not a creature of a commodity so if you

1464

not a creature of a commodity so if you
 

1465
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,510
not a creature of a commodity so if you
think about how austrians think about

1466
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
think about how austrians think about
 

1467
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,909
think about how austrians think about
money and how gold bugs think about

1468
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
money and how gold bugs think about
 

1469
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,909
money and how gold bugs think about
money and bitcoin enthusiasts if there

1470
00:24:59,909 --> 00:24:59,919
money and bitcoin enthusiasts if there
 

1471
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,470
money and bitcoin enthusiasts if there
are any left think about money uh what

1472
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,480
are any left think about money uh what
 

1473
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,750
are any left think about money uh what
they see is money as an object okay and

1474
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
they see is money as an object okay and
 

1475
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,390
they see is money as an object okay and
uh you you and i can both have more gold

1476
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
uh you you and i can both have more gold
 

1477
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,909
uh you you and i can both have more gold
if we're both willing to go to this you

1478
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
if we're both willing to go to this you
 

1479
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,390
if we're both willing to go to this you
know a mine somewhere and dig a few

1480
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,400
know a mine somewhere and dig a few
 

1481
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,630
know a mine somewhere and dig a few
holes and get a few specks of gold out

1482
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
holes and get a few specks of gold out
 

1483
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,510
holes and get a few specks of gold out
so there's no competition or no

1484
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
so there's no competition or no
 

1485
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,269
so there's no competition or no
interaction between you and me if money

1486
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
interaction between you and me if money
 

1487
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,269
interaction between you and me if money
is gold and i think money should be an

1488
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:21,279
is gold and i think money should be an
 

1489
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,590
is gold and i think money should be an
object a commodity but money

1490
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
object a commodity but money
 

1491
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,510
object a commodity but money
fundamentally is not a commodity it's a

1492
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
fundamentally is not a commodity it's a
 

1493
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,149
fundamentally is not a commodity it's a
it's a claim on somebody else that's

1494
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:28,159
it's a claim on somebody else that's
 

1495
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,230
it's a claim on somebody else that's
money's essence so when you do it you

1496
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
money's essence so when you do it you
 

1497
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,990
money's essence so when you do it you
must use double entry bookkeeping to do

1498
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,000
must use double entry bookkeeping to do
 

1499
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,990
must use double entry bookkeeping to do
it and then when you do you find all the

1500
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,000
it and then when you do you find all the
 

1501
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,269
it and then when you do you find all the
answers that come out of thinking as

1502
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
answers that come out of thinking as
 

1503
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,190
answers that come out of thinking as
money as a commodity you're wrong

1504
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
money as a commodity you're wrong
 

1505
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,029
money as a commodity you're wrong
so for example i've got elon on this one

1506
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
so for example i've got elon on this one
 

1507
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,710
so for example i've got elon on this one
so i want to get this rid of elon

1508
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
so i want to get this rid of elon
 

1509
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,070
so i want to get this rid of elon
because i saw him making a comment about

1510
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,080
because i saw him making a comment about
 

1511
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,470
because i saw him making a comment about
this a few weeks ago on twitter he said

1512
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:44,480
this a few weeks ago on twitter he said
 

1513
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,750
this a few weeks ago on twitter he said
that it's wrong for the government

1514
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
that it's wrong for the government
 

1515
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,950
that it's wrong for the government
effectively it seems wrong for the

1516
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
effectively it seems wrong for the
 

1517
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,590
effectively it seems wrong for the
government to always be in deficit

1518
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600
government to always be in deficit
 

1519
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,190
government to always be in deficit
okay now when you look at it and say

1520
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
okay now when you look at it and say
 

1521
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,909
okay now when you look at it and say
well

1522
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
well
 

1523
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,149
well
how is money created

1524
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
how is money created
 

1525
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,950
how is money created
how does money come about when it's not

1526
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
how does money come about when it's not
 

1527
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,269
how does money come about when it's not
a commodity like gold would you dig up

1528
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
a commodity like gold would you dig up
 

1529
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,029
a commodity like gold would you dig up
out of the ground when it's actually

1530
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
out of the ground when it's actually
 

1531
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,630
out of the ground when it's actually
social relations between people that

1532
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
social relations between people that
 

1533
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,909
social relations between people that
create money

1534
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
create money
 

1535
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,870
create money
well money is the

1536
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880
well money is the
 

1537
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,149
well money is the
fundamentally

1538
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
fundamentally
 

1539
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,789
fundamentally
the liabilities of the banking sector

1540
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
the liabilities of the banking sector
 

1541
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,110
the liabilities of the banking sector
when you if we make a transfer between

1542
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,120
when you if we make a transfer between
 

1543
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,149
when you if we make a transfer between
us

1544
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
us
 

1545
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,070
us
your deposit account goes down my

1546
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,080
your deposit account goes down my
 

1547
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,230
your deposit account goes down my
deposit account goes up

1548
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
deposit account goes up
 

1549
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,990
deposit account goes up
those are exchanges on the liability

1550
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
those are exchanges on the liability
 

1551
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,990
those are exchanges on the liability
side of the banking of the of the

1552
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000
side of the banking of the of the
 

1553
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,350
side of the banking of the of the
banking sector

1554
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360
banking sector
 

1555
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,830
banking sector
but if we have a transaction with a bank

1556
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
but if we have a transaction with a bank
 

1557
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,590
but if we have a transaction with a bank
uh then if the bank lends us money it's

1558
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
uh then if the bank lends us money it's
 

1559
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,549
uh then if the bank lends us money it's
as its loans go up its deposits go up

1560
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
as its loans go up its deposits go up
 

1561
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,390
as its loans go up its deposits go up
again that same balance so you've got to

1562
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,400
again that same balance so you've got to
 

1563
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,549
again that same balance so you've got to
look and say money therefore is

1564
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:34,559
look and say money therefore is
 

1565
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,310
look and say money therefore is
fundamentally the liabilities of the

1566
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,320
fundamentally the liabilities of the
 

1567
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,549
fundamentally the liabilities of the
banking sector so how do you create

1568
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
banking sector so how do you create
 

1569
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,630
banking sector so how do you create
create additional liabilities you must

1570
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
create additional liabilities you must
 

1571
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,870
create additional liabilities you must
have an operation which occurs both on

1572
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:42,880
have an operation which occurs both on
 

1573
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,590
have an operation which occurs both on
the liability side and the asset side of

1574
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
the liability side and the asset side of
 

1575
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,669
the liability side and the asset side of
the banking sector so if you and i make

1576
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
the banking sector so if you and i make
 

1577
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,470
the banking sector so if you and i make
a transaction no money is created

1578
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,480
a transaction no money is created
 

1579
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,350
a transaction no money is created
money

1580
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
money
 

1581
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,750
money
existing money is redistributed but if

1582
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
existing money is redistributed but if
 

1583
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,430
existing money is redistributed but if
you go to a bank and by taking out a

1584
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
you go to a bank and by taking out a
 

1585
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,590
you go to a bank and by taking out a
bank loan then money is created by the

1586
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
bank loan then money is created by the
 

1587
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,510
bank loan then money is created by the
bank loan so the liabilities of the

1588
00:26:59,510 --> 00:26:59,520
bank loan so the liabilities of the
 

1589
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,510
bank loan so the liabilities of the
banking sector rise the assets rise

1590
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
banking sector rise the assets rise
 

1591
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,950
banking sector rise the assets rise
they're balanced but more liabilities

1592
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:02,960
they're balanced but more liabilities
 

1593
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,549
they're balanced but more liabilities
means for the banking sector means more

1594
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559
means for the banking sector means more
 

1595
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,510
means for the banking sector means more
money

1596
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
money
 

1597
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,669
money
okay so that's what that's how private

1598
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
okay so that's what that's how private
 

1599
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,350
okay so that's what that's how private
banks create money and that's what i

1600
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
banks create money and that's what i
 

1601
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,909
banks create money and that's what i
first started working on when i became

00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
first started working on when i became

first started working on when i became
an academic about 35 years ago

1604
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:14,720
an academic about 35 years ago
 

1605
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,549
an academic about 35 years ago
the actual dynamics of private money

1606
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
the actual dynamics of private money
 

1607
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,230
the actual dynamics of private money
creation but the government has the same

1608
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
creation but the government has the same
 

1609
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,230
creation but the government has the same
sort of story if the government runs a

1610
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,240
sort of story if the government runs a
 

1611
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,510
sort of story if the government runs a
deficit it spends more money

1612
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
deficit it spends more money
 

1613
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,269
deficit it spends more money
on the individuals

1614

on the individuals
 

1615
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,990
on the individuals
in the economy than it taxes them which

in the economy than it taxes them which
 

1617
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,430
in the economy than it taxes them which
means

1618
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
means
 

1619
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,510
means
their bank accounts increase so a

1620
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
their bank accounts increase so a
 

1621
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,389
their bank accounts increase so a
government deficit creates money for the

1622

government deficit creates money for the
 

1623
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,070
government deficit creates money for the
private sector

1624
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,080
private sector
 

1625
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,830
private sector
okay so that's where money creation

1626
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:37,840
okay so that's where money creation
 

1627
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,710
okay so that's where money creation
occurs from the government so it's it's

1628
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
occurs from the government so it's it's
 

1629
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,710
occurs from the government so it's it's
it puts money in people's it puts more

1630
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:42,720
it puts money in people's it puts more
 

1631
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,230
it puts money in people's it puts more
money into people's bank accounts by

1632
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
money into people's bank accounts by
 

1633
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,870
money into people's bank accounts by
spending by welfare payments than it

1634
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:46,880
spending by welfare payments than it
 

1635
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,750
spending by welfare payments than it
takes out by taxation so that's creating

1636
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
takes out by taxation so that's creating
 

1637
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,830
takes out by taxation so that's creating
new money and then on the other side on

1638
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
new money and then on the other side on
 

1639
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,029
new money and then on the other side on
the bank

1640
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
the bank
 

1641
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,630
the bank
the money turns up in the reserve

1642
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
the money turns up in the reserve
 

1643
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,389
the money turns up in the reserve
accounts of the banks which are

1644
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
accounts of the banks which are
 

1645
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,149
accounts of the banks which are
basically the private bank's bank

1646
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
basically the private bank's bank
 

1647
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,230
basically the private bank's bank
accounts at the central bank

1648
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
accounts at the central bank
 

1649
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,029
accounts at the central bank
so

1650
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,039
so
 

1651
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,430
so
rather than the asset of

1652
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:03,440
rather than the asset of
 

1653
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,909
rather than the asset of
private money creation being loans the

1654
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
private money creation being loans the
 

1655
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,510
private money creation being loans the
asset of government money creation is

1656
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,520
asset of government money creation is
 

1657
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,430
asset of government money creation is
reserves

1658
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
reserves
 

1659
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,029
reserves
okay

1660
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
okay
 

1661
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,310
okay
right money creation money creation is a

1662
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,320
right money creation money creation is a
 

1663
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,470
right money creation money creation is a
good thing so you mentioned a bunch of

1664
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
good thing so you mentioned a bunch of
 

1665
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,149
good thing so you mentioned a bunch of
stuff like private money creation with

1666
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:18,159
stuff like private money creation with
 

1667
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,750
stuff like private money creation with
the liabilities and the banks and then

1668
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
the liabilities and the banks and then
 

1669
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,190
the liabilities and the banks and then
the how the government is doing the

1670
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,200
the how the government is doing the
 

1671
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,310
the how the government is doing the
reserves

1672
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
reserves
 

1673
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,909
reserves
blah blah blah

1674
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:23,919
blah blah blah
 

1675
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,350
blah blah blah
at the end of the day is there's a bunch

1676
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,360
at the end of the day is there's a bunch
 

1677
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,669
at the end of the day is there's a bunch
of printers that are printing money

1678
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679
of printers that are printing money
 

1679
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,750
of printers that are printing money
uh what is money and then you also said

1680
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
uh what is money and then you also said
 

1681
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,269
uh what is money and then you also said
something interesting which is social

1682
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
something interesting which is social
 

1683
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,630
something interesting which is social
relations

1684
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:32,640
relations
 

1685
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,350
relations
between humans is what creates money

1686
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,360
between humans is what creates money
 

1687
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,909
between humans is what creates money
i think my mind was blown several times

1688
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
i think my mind was blown several times
 

1689
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,590
i think my mind was blown several times
over the past minute

1690
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
over the past minute
 

1691
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,590
over the past minute
um so it's difficult for me to

1692
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
um so it's difficult for me to
 

1693
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,070
um so it's difficult for me to
reconstruct the pieces of my mind back

1694
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
reconstruct the pieces of my mind back
 

1695
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,710
reconstruct the pieces of my mind back
together but um

1696
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
together but um
 

1697
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,029
together but um
basic question is money creation a good

1698
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,039
basic question is money creation a good
 

1699
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,590
basic question is money creation a good
thing or a bad thing money creation is a

1700
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
thing or a bad thing money creation is a
 

1701
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,350
thing or a bad thing money creation is a
good thing

1702
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,360
good thing
 

1703
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,190
good thing
because money creation is what allows

1704
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,200
because money creation is what allows
 

1705
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,950
because money creation is what allows
commerce to happen isn't there a

1706
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
commerce to happen isn't there a
 

1707
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,669
commerce to happen isn't there a
conservation of no there isn't i had

1708
00:28:59,669 --> 00:28:59,679
conservation of no there isn't i had
 

1709
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,269
conservation of no there isn't i had
arguments with physicists over this and

1710
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
arguments with physicists over this and
 

1711
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,190
arguments with physicists over this and
it took me a long time to answer it they

1712
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,200
it took me a long time to answer it they
 

1713
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,870
it took me a long time to answer it they
thought the sum total of all money is

1714
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
thought the sum total of all money is
 

1715
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,830
thought the sum total of all money is
zero yeah okay uh it's the sum time

1716
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:07,840
zero yeah okay uh it's the sum time
 

1717
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,669
zero yeah okay uh it's the sum time
title of all assets and liabilities of

1718
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:09,679
title of all assets and liabilities of
 

1719
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,630
title of all assets and liabilities of
zero so if you imagine um

1720
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:12,640
zero so if you imagine um
 

1721
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,110
zero so if you imagine um
your assets minus your liabilities as

1722
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
your assets minus your liabilities as
 

1723
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,470
your assets minus your liabilities as
your equity

1724
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
your equity
 

1725
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,310
your equity
and your asset is somebody else's

1726
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
and your asset is somebody else's
 

1727
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,470
and your asset is somebody else's
liability and your liability is somebody

1728
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
liability and your liability is somebody
 

1729
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,470
liability and your liability is somebody
else's asset when we're talking about

1730
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,480
else's asset when we're talking about
 

1731
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,990
else's asset when we're talking about
financial assets and this is another

1732
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
financial assets and this is another
 

1733
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,669
financial assets and this is another
mind-blowing thing that i've just

1734
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
mind-blowing thing that i've just
 

1735
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,669
mind-blowing thing that i've just
recently solved myself

1736
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:27,679
recently solved myself
 

1737
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,149
recently solved myself
so the sum total of all financial assets

1738
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:30,159
so the sum total of all financial assets
 

1739
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,630
so the sum total of all financial assets
and liabilities is zero

1740
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,640
and liabilities is zero
 

1741
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,470
and liabilities is zero
okay wait i'm going to interrupt you

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,950
so uh specific you mean
give me an example of an asset okay uh

1752
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
give me an example of an asset okay uh
 

1753
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,269
give me an example of an asset okay uh
do you have a mortgage for this house no

1754
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
do you have a mortgage for this house no

well if you had a mortgage that would be

1758
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240
well if you had a mortgage that would be
 

1759
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,789
well if you had a mortgage that would be
your your liability that would be mellow

right okay if you add the two together
 

1765
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,070
right okay if you add the two together
you get zero okay so that's zero that's

1766
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,080
you get zero okay so that's zero that's
 

1767
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,710
you get zero okay so that's zero that's
zero the money is the liability side of

1768
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:02,720
zero the money is the liability side of
 

1769
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,710
zero the money is the liability side of
the banking sector

1770

okay okay assets are the
the the the assets on the other side can

1774
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,000
the the the assets on the other side can
 

1775
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,669
the the the assets on the other side can
be either created by the banking sector

1776
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:11,679
be either created by the banking sector
 

1777
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,909
be either created by the banking sector
which is where you get bank loans or

1778
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:13,919
which is where you get bank loans or
 

1779

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,830
created by the government where you get
reserves but money is the liabilities

1782
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
reserves but money is the liabilities
 

1783
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,990

will exist in society and that unity can
be an individual it can be a commodity

anything at all
 

2291
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,870
anything at all
the unity will be understood by that

2292
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:02,880
the unity will be understood by that
 

2293
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,109
the unity will be understood by that
society

love and all the other things that
 

2315
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,030
love and all the other things that
humans do is pushed into the background

2316
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,040
humans do is pushed into the background
 

2317
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,030

there's a tension between the two of

there's a tension between the two of
 

2319

those
 

2321
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,470
those
and that can transform that unity over

2322
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,480
and that can transform that unity over
 

2323
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,710
and that can transform that unity over
time and that's a beautiful dynamic

2324
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:34,720
time and that's a beautiful dynamic
 

2325
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,230

what does every idea have
 

2333
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,310
what does every idea have
a counter argument yeah there's a

2334
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:46,320
a counter argument yeah there's a

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,670
a counter argument yeah there's a
positive and negative and you bring them

2336
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:47,680
positive and negative and you bring them
 

2337
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,069
positive and negative and you bring them
together somehow and then mark says this

2338
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:50,079
together somehow and then mark says this
 

2339
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,870
together somehow and then mark says this
foreground background foreground

foreground background foreground
 

2341
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,270

is all what we think of as economics and

2342
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280
is all what we think of as economics and
 

2343
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,030
is all what we think of as economics and
backgrounds all the love making we do as

backgrounds all the love making we do as
 

2345
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,950
backgrounds all the love making we do as
humans that sort of thing and and why is

2346
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:58,960
humans that sort of thing and and why is
 

2347
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,870
humans that sort of thing and and why is
what's why is there attention well

2348
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:00,880
what's why is there attention well
 

2349
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,710
what's why is there attention well
because you you mentioned if you imagine

2350
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:02,720
because you you mentioned if you imagine
 

2351
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,230
because you you mentioned if you imagine
the unity like if you take a human

2352
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,240
the unity like if you take a human
 

2353
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,910
the unity like if you take a human
in a any preview it could go back to

2354
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:07,920
in a any preview it could go back to
 

2355
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,670
in a any preview it could go back to
cro-magnon days when we're you know

2356
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:09,680
cro-magnon days when we're you know
 

2357
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,510
cro-magnon days when we're you know
living in caves and yep

2358
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,520
living in caves and yep
 

2359
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,870
living in caves and yep
and we've got to go hunting and cook

2360
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:12,880
and we've got to go hunting and cook
 

2361
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,870
and we've got to go hunting and cook
food and stuff like that but there's no

2362
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:14,880
food and stuff like that but there's no
 

2363
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,910
food and stuff like that but there's no
social hierarchy as we've become used to

2364
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:17,920
social hierarchy as we've become used to
 

2365
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,589
social hierarchy as we've become used to
so you don't get labored as a worker or

2366
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:19,599
so you don't get labored as a worker or
 

2367
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,430
so you don't get labored as a worker or
a capitalist you're just a human in that

2368
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,440
a capitalist you're just a human in that
 

2369
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,990
a capitalist you're just a human in that
situation then you'll you've got more of

2370
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000
situation then you'll you've got more of
 

2371
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,069
situation then you'll you've got more of
an integrated view of who you are

2372
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:26,079
an integrated view of who you are
 

2373
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,750
an integrated view of who you are
and i think that's one of the appeals of

2374
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
and i think that's one of the appeals of
 

2375
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,150
and i think that's one of the appeals of
a tribal a genuine tribal culture that

2376
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,160
a tribal a genuine tribal culture that
 

2377
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,150
a tribal a genuine tribal culture that
you get treated for the whole of who you

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,670
you get treated for the whole of who you
are you've certainly categorized you're

2380
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:33,680

old you're a hunter you're a you're a
 

2385
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,910
old you're a hunter you're a you're a
tool maker etc etc but you're treated as

tool maker etc etc but you're treated as
 

2387
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,910
tool maker etc etc but you're treated as
more an integrated object when you get

2388
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
more an integrated object when you get
 

2389
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,670
more an integrated object when you get
put in a complex society like a

2390
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
put in a complex society like a
 

2391
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,990
put in a complex society like a
capitalist society then one side of you

2392
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,000
capitalist society then one side of you
 

2393
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,589
capitalist society then one side of you
is emphasized and the others are

2394
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:47,599
is emphasized and the others are
 

2395
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,990
is emphasized and the others are
de-emphasized so is it fair to say that

2396
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,000
de-emphasized so is it fair to say that
 

2397
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,309
de-emphasized so is it fair to say that
the background is like our basic

2398
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:52,319
the background is like our basic
 

2399
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,069
the background is like our basic
fundamental humanity

2400
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:54,079
fundamental humanity
 

2401
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,829
fundamental humanity
and the foreground is the machine of

and the foreground is the machine of
 

2403
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,670
and the foreground is the machine of
capitalism effectively and when you look

2404
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:57,680
capitalism effectively and when you look
 

2405
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,150
capitalism effectively and when you look
at in terms of a human but what marx did

2406
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
at in terms of a human but what marx did
 

2407
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,309
at in terms of a human but what marx did
is apply this to a commodity

2408
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
is apply this to a commodity

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,750
unity is a commodity okay that's just
the essential unit the essential unity

2416
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:11,760
the essential unit the essential unity
 

2417
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,190
the essential unit the essential unity
was the unit unity an object in society

2418
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,200
was the unit unity an object in society
 

2419
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,109
was the unit unity an object in society
okay okay so he started from the point

2420
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
okay okay so he started from the point
 

2421
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,630
okay okay so he started from the point
of view of trying to understand what how

2422
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,640
of view of trying to understand what how
 

2423
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,670
of view of trying to understand what how
exchange occurs how do we set prices and

2424
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:21,680
exchange occurs how do we set prices and
 

2425
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,150
exchange occurs how do we set prices and
his starting vision was to say that a

2426
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,160
his starting vision was to say that a
 

2427
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,550
his starting vision was to say that a
commodity is a unity

2428
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:26,560
commodity is a unity
 

2429
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,470
commodity is a unity
in a capitalist economy

2430
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:28,480
in a capitalist economy
 

2431
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,430
in a capitalist economy
the part of the unity

2432
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
the part of the unity
 

2433
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,069
the part of the unity
that we focus upon is the its exchange

2434
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:34,079
that we focus upon is the its exchange
 

2435
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,109
that we focus upon is the its exchange
value

2436
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:35,119
value
 

2437
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,069
value
a capitalist produces a commodity not

2438
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
a capitalist produces a commodity not
 

2439
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,349
a capitalist produces a commodity not
because of its

2440
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:39,359
because of its
 

2441
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,109
because of its
qualitative characteristics but because

2442
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:41,119
qualitative characteristics but because
 

2443
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,790
qualitative characteristics but because
it be sold for a profit

2444
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,800
it be sold for a profit
 

2445
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,710
it be sold for a profit
so the foreground aspect of a commodity

2446
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:44,720
so the foreground aspect of a commodity
 

2447
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,790
so the foreground aspect of a commodity
is its exchange value

2448
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
is its exchange value
 

2449
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,030
is its exchange value
the background aspect of it it won't

2450
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,040
the background aspect of it it won't
 

2451
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,710
the background aspect of it it won't
succeed as a commodity unless it has a

2452
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
succeed as a commodity unless it has a
 

2453
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,470
succeed as a commodity unless it has a
use value

2454
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:52,480
use value
 

2455
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,710
use value
so the the background is the utility

2456
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:54,720
so the the background is the utility
 

2457
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,390
so the the background is the utility
thing yeah i see

2458
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
thing yeah i see
 

2459
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,230
thing yeah i see
if you made something which didn't work

2460
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,240
if you made something which didn't work
 

2461
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,950
if you made something which didn't work
okay yeah then it has you might be able

2462
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
okay yeah then it has you might be able
 

2463
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,950
okay yeah then it has you might be able
to sell it but it has no utility that

2464
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:02,960
to sell it but it has no utility that
 

2465
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,309
to sell it but it has no utility that
can't you can't make that into a

2466
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:04,319
can't you can't make that into a
 

2467
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,069
can't you can't make that into a
commodity a broken thing can't be sold

2468
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:06,079
commodity a broken thing can't be sold
 

2469
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,069
commodity a broken thing can't be sold
does that have the subjective yeah the

2470
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
does that have the subjective yeah the
 

2471
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,910
does that have the subjective yeah the
it has to have the subjective side for

2472
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:09,920
it has to have the subjective side for
 

2473
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,230
it has to have the subjective side for
people as well as the objective so the

2474
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
people as well as the objective so the
 

2475
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,670
people as well as the objective so the
objective is what capitalists worry

2476
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,680
objective is what capitalists worry

and rubies and emeralds during the
scratching yeah and that's that's a

2528
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640
scratching yeah and that's that's a
 

2529
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,870
scratching yeah and that's that's a
commodity in a feudal society

2530
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:10,880
commodity in a feudal society
 

2531
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,109
commodity in a feudal society
okay the cost doesn't matter

2532
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:13,119
okay the cost doesn't matter
 

2533
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,870
okay the cost doesn't matter
you want the most elaborate beautiful

2534
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:14,880
you want the most elaborate beautiful
 

2535
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,550
you want the most elaborate beautiful
thing because you're the emperor

2536
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,560
thing because you're the emperor
 

2537
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,030
thing because you're the emperor
so you in that in a feudal society the

2538
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,040
so you in that in a feudal society the
 

2539
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,950
so you in that in a feudal society the
commodity what's focused upon is the

2540
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:20,960
commodity what's focused upon is the
 

2541
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,390
commodity what's focused upon is the
utility

2542
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:22,400
utility
 

2543
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,750
utility
and the cost of production when you're

2544
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:23,760
and the cost of production when you're
 

2545
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,829
and the cost of production when you're
when you're the emperor is immaterial

2546
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:25,839
when you're the emperor is immaterial
 

2547
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,990
when you're the emperor is immaterial
capitalism reverses that

2548
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,000
capitalism reverses that
 

2549
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,069
capitalism reverses that
so the commodity in a capitalist economy

2550
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:30,079
so the commodity in a capitalist economy
 

2551
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,470
so the commodity in a capitalist economy
is a plastic two dollar scratcher you

2552
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
is a plastic two dollar scratcher you
 

2553
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,990
is a plastic two dollar scratcher you
can get from kmart

2554
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,000
can get from kmart
 

2555
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,670
can get from kmart
or target yeah and so the the use value

2556
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
or target yeah and so the the use value
 

2557
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,630
or target yeah and so the the use value
is

2558
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:38,640
is
 

2559
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,470
is
necessary but

2560
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,480
necessary but
 

2561
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,790
necessary but
irrelevant to forming the price now that

2562
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
irrelevant to forming the price now that
 

2563
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,950
irrelevant to forming the price now that
was a completely different vision of

2564
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:44,960
was a completely different vision of
 

2565
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,510
was a completely different vision of
exchanging capitalism to what i found in

2566
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
exchanging capitalism to what i found in
 

2567
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,109
exchanging capitalism to what i found in
the neoclassical theory because that

2568
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:49,119
the neoclassical theory because that
 

2569
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,829
the neoclassical theory because that
says it's the marginal utility and the

2570
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
says it's the marginal utility and the
 

2571
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,069
says it's the marginal utility and the
marginal cost of everything that

2572
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:54,079
marginal cost of everything that
 

2573
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,030
marginal cost of everything that
determines the exchange ratio and the

00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,040
determines the exchange ratio and the
 

2575
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,710
determines the exchange ratio and the
crazy thing about that is not so much

2576
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
crazy thing about that is not so much
 

2577
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,589
crazy thing about that is not so much
the

00:43:59,589 --> 00:43:59,599
the
 

2579
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,510
the
marginal utility but

00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
marginal utility but
 

2581
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,430
marginal utility but
the argument in the neoclassical theory

2582
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
the argument in the neoclassical theory
 

2583
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,550
the argument in the neoclassical theory
is that the price ratio the price will

00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:06,560
is that the price ratio the price will
 

2585
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,750
is that the price ratio the price will
when there's an exchange going on

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,670
when there's an exchange going on
there's two person two commodity

there's two person two commodity
 

2589
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,230
there's two person two commodity
exchange of two commodities for between

uh
they will

00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:15,680
they will
 

2597
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,750
they will
cha the the price will change until such

2598
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:17,760
cha the the price will change until such
 

2599
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,750
cha the the price will change until such
time as the ratio of the marginal

2600
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:19,760
time as the ratio of the marginal
 

2601
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,990
time as the ratio of the marginal
utilities is equal to the ratio of the

2602
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,000
utilities is equal to the ratio of the
 

2603
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,750

ancient trial or two tribes meeting for

2622
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:41,680
ancient trial or two tribes meeting for
 

2623
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,990
ancient trial or two tribes meeting for
the very first time and one tribe can

2624
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:44,000
the very first time and one tribe can
 

2625
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,430
the very first time and one tribe can
make something the other tribe can't

2626
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:45,440
make something the other tribe can't
 

2627
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,069
make something the other tribe can't
make and they will therefore

2628
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:48,079
make and they will therefore
 

2629
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,069
make and they will therefore
the price they were willing to pay will

2630
00:44:50,069 --> 00:44:50,079
the price they were willing to pay will
 

2631
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,790
the price they were willing to pay will
reflect how unique this other object is

2632
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:52,800
reflect how unique this other object is
 

2633
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,309
reflect how unique this other object is
that the this one tribe can make and the

2634
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
that the this one tribe can make and the
 

2635
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,470
that the this one tribe can make and the
other can't so for example the story of

2636
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:56,480
other can't so for example the story of
 

2637
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,589
other can't so for example the story of
manhattan being sold for 40 glass beads

2638
00:44:59,589 --> 00:44:59,599
manhattan being sold for 40 glass beads
 

2639
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,910
manhattan being sold for 40 glass beads
it's actually 40 glass trading beads i

2640
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:01,920
it's actually 40 glass trading beads i
 

2641
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,309
it's actually 40 glass trading beads i
do believe it is a true story but the

2642
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
do believe it is a true story but the
 

2643
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,309
do believe it is a true story but the
thing is the indians couldn't make glass

2644
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:06,319
thing is the indians couldn't make glass
 

2645
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,430
thing is the indians couldn't make glass
beads

2646
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:07,440
beads
 

2647
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,349
beads
so they value the glass beads of the

2648
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
so they value the glass beads of the
 

2649
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,430
so they value the glass beads of the
island of manhattan okay which is a

2650
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440
island of manhattan okay which is a
 

2651
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,829
island of manhattan okay which is a
utility-based comparison what mark said

2652
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:13,839
utility-based comparison what mark said
 

2653
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,309
utility-based comparison what mark said
that's the very initial contact over

2654
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:16,319
that's the very initial contact over
 

2655
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,589
that's the very initial contact over
time even if you don't know the

2656
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:17,599
time even if you don't know the
 

2657
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,870
time even if you don't know the
technology

2658
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:18,880
technology
 

2659
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,870
technology
over time you you start to realize how

2660
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:20,880
over time you you start to realize how
 

2661
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,030
over time you you start to realize how
much work goes involved to making what

2662
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,040
much work goes involved to making what
 

2663
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,630
much work goes involved to making what
they're selling you versus what you're

2664
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:24,640
they're selling you versus what you're
 

2665
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,230
they're selling you versus what you're
selling to them

2666
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,240
selling to them
 

2667
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,390
selling to them
and you start making stuff specifically

2668
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:28,400
and you start making stuff specifically
 

2669
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,670
and you start making stuff specifically
for sale

2670
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
for sale
 

2671
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,990
for sale
so you know elon's not losing personal

2672
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,000
so you know elon's not losing personal
 

2673
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,030
so you know elon's not losing personal
utility each time a model 3 goes out the

2674
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
utility each time a model 3 goes out the
 

2675
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,990
utility each time a model 3 goes out the
door

2676
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000

2677
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,990
door
there's no he might get utility out of

2678
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
there's no he might get utility out of
 

2679
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,309
there's no he might get utility out of
the fact that he's created that vehicle

2680
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
the fact that he's created that vehicle
 

2681
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,309
the fact that he's created that vehicle
that concept and manufactures it and so

2682
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:42,319
that concept and manufactures it and so
 

2683
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,069
that concept and manufactures it and so
on but he's not losing utility each time

2684
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:44,079
on but he's not losing utility each time
 

2685
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,950
on but he's not losing utility each time
a model t ford goes out the door for

2686
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:46,960
a model t ford goes out the door for
 

2687
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,550
a model t ford goes out the door for
going back for the ancient

2688
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:48,560
going back for the ancient
 

2689
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,589
going back for the ancient
ancient commodity there so

2690
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
ancient commodity there so
 

2691
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,670
ancient commodity there so
the utility plays no role in setting

2692
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:53,680
the utility plays no role in setting
 

2693
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,150
the utility plays no role in setting

price in marx's model
 

2695
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,750
price in marx's model

whereas it's essential in the
 

2697
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,510
whereas it's essential in the
neoclassical model what's the difference

2698
00:45:59,510 --> 00:45:59,520
neoclassical model what's the difference
 

2699
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,670
neoclassical model what's the difference
between utility and marginal utility

2700
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:01,680
between utility and marginal utility
 

2701
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,230
between utility and marginal utility
what does the word marginal mean

2702
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,240
what does the word marginal mean
 

2703
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,870
what does the word marginal mean
and why is this such a problem it turns

2704
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
and why is this such a problem it turns
 

2705
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,910
and why is this such a problem it turns
marginal utility well the utility itself

2706
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:09,920
marginal utility well the utility itself
 

2707
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,270
marginal utility well the utility itself
has different meanings in the two

2708
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:11,280
has different meanings in the two
 

2709
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,470
has different meanings in the two
schools of thought if you take the

2710
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,480
schools of thought if you take the
 

2711
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,309
schools of thought if you take the
classical school of thought which when

2712
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
classical school of thought which when
 

2713
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,710
classical school of thought which when
marx comes from utility is effectively

2714
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:16,720
marx comes from utility is effectively
 

2715
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,910
marx comes from utility is effectively
objective

2716
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:17,920
objective
 

2717
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,510
objective
so the utility of a chair is that you

2718
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:19,520
so the utility of a chair is that you
 

2719
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,710
so the utility of a chair is that you
can sit in it

2720
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:20,720
can sit in it
 

2721
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,790
can sit in it
okay not how comfortable it makes you

2722
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:22,800
okay not how comfortable it makes you
 

2723
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,069
okay not how comfortable it makes you
feel

2724
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:24,079
feel
 

2725
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,349
feel
yeah okay now if you think about the

2726
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
yeah okay now if you think about the
 

2727
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,870
yeah okay now if you think about the
utility of the chairs we're both sitting

2728
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,880
utility of the chairs we're both sitting
 

2729
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,550
utility of the chairs we're both sitting
and they're identical from a classical

2730
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:28,560
and they're identical from a classical
 

2731
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,470
and they're identical from a classical
point of view we're both sitting okay

2732
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
point of view we're both sitting okay
 

2733
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,230
point of view we're both sitting okay
but from the neoclassical point of view

2734
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
but from the neoclassical point of view
 

2735
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,309
but from the neoclassical point of view
it's how comfortable it makes you feel

2736
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:34,319
it's how comfortable it makes you feel
 

2737
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,790
it's how comfortable it makes you feel
and that depends upon your subjective

2738
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,800
and that depends upon your subjective
 

2739
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,309
and that depends upon your subjective
feelings of comfort you might be far

2740
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:38,319
feelings of comfort you might be far
 

2741
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,230
feelings of comfort you might be far
more comfortable in the identical chair

2742
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,240
more comfortable in the identical chair
 

2743
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,910
more comfortable in the identical chair
that i'm sitting in then i am yeah and

2744
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:41,920
that i'm sitting in then i am yeah and
 

2745
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,829
that i'm sitting in then i am yeah and
therefore the comparison is difficult

2746
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:43,839
therefore the comparison is difficult
 

2747
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,309
therefore the comparison is difficult
and therefore working out a ratio

2748
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
and therefore working out a ratio
 

2749
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,829
and therefore working out a ratio
involves you've got a

2750
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:47,839
involves you've got a
 

2751
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,990
involves you've got a
decline in your each time you give away

2752
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
decline in your each time you give away
 

2753
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,630
decline in your each time you give away
a chair in exchange for a

2754
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:52,640
a chair in exchange for a
 

2755
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,670
a chair in exchange for a
iphone

2756
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:53,680
iphone
 

2757
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,910
iphone
you have a fall in your utility okay but

2758
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:57,920
you have a fall in your utility okay but
 

2759
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,829
you have a fall in your utility okay but
and then therefore you want a higher

2760
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
and then therefore you want a higher
 

2761
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,670
and then therefore you want a higher
return because you're losing more

2762
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:01,680
return because you're losing more
 

2763
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,829
return because you're losing more
utility each time the more chairs you

2764
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:03,839
utility each time the more chairs you
 

2765
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,270
utility each time the more chairs you
give away the less utility you're

2766
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,280
give away the less utility you're
 

2767
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,430
give away the less utility you're
getting from chairs so there's a decline

2768
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
getting from chairs so there's a decline
 

2769
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,030
getting from chairs so there's a decline
in your utility that's your your

2770
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,040
in your utility that's your your
 

2771
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,790
in your utility that's your your
marginal utility

2772
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:10,800
marginal utility
 

2773
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,470
marginal utility
so it's including your subjective

2774
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:12,480
so it's including your subjective
 

2775
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,030
so it's including your subjective
valuation in setting the price

2776
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,040
valuation in setting the price
 

2777
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,030
valuation in setting the price
and what mark's pointed out is this is a

2778
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:17,040
and what mark's pointed out is this is a
 

2779
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,309
and what mark's pointed out is this is a
caricature

2780
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:18,319
caricature
 

2781
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,829
caricature
of actual change in the capitalist

2782
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:19,839
of actual change in the capitalist
 

2783
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,829
of actual change in the capitalist
economy because we have in a capitalist

2784
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:21,839
economy because we have in a capitalist
 

2785
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,829
economy because we have in a capitalist
economy huge factories turning out huge

2786
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:23,839
economy huge factories turning out huge
 

2787
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,630

quantities specifically for sale they've

2788
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:26,640
quantities specifically for sale they've
 

2789
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,710
quantities specifically for sale they've
got no utility to the

2790
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:28,720
got no utility to the
 

2791
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,670
got no utility to the
um seller unless they're sold

2792
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:31,680
um seller unless they're sold
 

2793
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,750
um seller unless they're sold
okay so it's a it's a very different

2794
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:33,760
okay so it's a it's a very different
 

2795
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,470
okay so it's a it's a very different
vision of where how prices said and marx

2796
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:36,480
vision of where how prices said and marx
 

2797
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,030
vision of where how prices said and marx
used that to explain where profit comes

2798
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,040
used that to explain where profit comes
 

2799
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,150
used that to explain where profit comes
from but he made a mistake

2800
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,160
from but he made a mistake
 

2801
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,309
from but he made a mistake
and his argument was that

2802
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:44,319
and his argument was that
 

2803
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,870
and his argument was that
talking about a worker uh

2804
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:46,880
talking about a worker uh
 

2805
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,030
talking about a worker uh
as an ally or unity this foreground

2806
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,040
as an ally or unity this foreground
 

2807
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,430
as an ally or unity this foreground
background tension thing the foreground

2808
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440
background tension thing the foreground
 

2809
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,750
background tension thing the foreground
is that you hire a worker

2810
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:53,760
is that you hire a worker
 

2811
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,750
is that you hire a worker
for their cost of production and their

2812
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:55,760
for their cost of production and their
 

2813
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,150
for their cost of production and their
cost of production is a subsistence wage

2814
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,160
cost of production is a subsistence wage
 

2815
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,069
cost of production is a subsistence wage
okay

2816
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:00,079
okay
 

2817
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,950
okay
the utility to the buyer

2818
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:02,960
the utility to the buyer
 

2819
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,030
the utility to the buyer
is the fact that they can work

2820
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
is the fact that they can work
 

2821
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,589
is the fact that they can work
in a factory now it might take

2822
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:07,599
in a factory now it might take
 

2823
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,349
in a factory now it might take
six hours let's say to make the means of

2824
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:09,359
six hours let's say to make the means of
 

2825
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,349
six hours let's say to make the means of
subsistence and that's the exchange

2826
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:11,359
subsistence and that's the exchange
 

2827
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,790
subsistence and that's the exchange
value and that's what the capitalist

2828
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:12,800
value and that's what the capitalist
 

2829
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,670
value and that's what the capitalist
pays as a wage to the worker but they

2830
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:15,680
pays as a wage to the worker but they
 

2831
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,990
pays as a wage to the worker but they
can work in the factory for 12 hours

2832
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,000
can work in the factory for 12 hours
 

2833
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,549
can work in the factory for 12 hours
that's the utility

2834
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:20,559
that's the utility
 

2835
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,790
that's the utility
12-6 is six

2836
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:22,800
12-6 is six
 

2837
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,030
12-6 is six
surplus of value hours and that's where

2838
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:25,040
surplus of value hours and that's where
 

2839
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,470
surplus of value hours and that's where
profit comes from

2840
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:26,480
profit comes from
 

2841
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,910
profit comes from
and that was marx's argument and i

2842
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:27,920
and that was marx's argument and i
 

2843
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,829
and that was marx's argument and i
thought it was brilliant

2844
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:29,839
thought it was brilliant
 

2845
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,230
thought it was brilliant
but it also applied to machinery

2846
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
but it also applied to machinery
 

2847
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,549
but it also applied to machinery
right okay let's

2848
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:34,559
right okay let's
 

2849
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,670
right okay let's
say no no

2850
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:35,680
say no no
 

2851
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,589
say no no
deep is good just want to define

2852
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:37,599
deep is good just want to define
 

2853
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,670
deep is good just want to define
uh terms don't take that statement out

2854
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:39,680
uh terms don't take that statement out
 

2855
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,510
uh terms don't take that statement out
of context the internet please

2856
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,520
of context the internet please
 

2857
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,829
of context the internet please
okay uh

2858
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:43,839
okay uh
 

2859
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,670
okay uh
you said buyer

2860
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:45,680
you said buyer
 

2861
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,030
you said buyer
seller

2862
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,040
seller
 

2863
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,829
seller
worker in a factory who's the seller

2864
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:49,839
worker in a factory who's the seller
 

2865
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,710
worker in a factory who's the seller
who's the buyer well you know

2866
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:52,720
who's the buyer well you know
 

2867
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,950
who's the buyer well you know
why is the worker

2868
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960
why is the worker
 

2869
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,950
why is the worker
the buyer well the work is the commodity

2870
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:56,960
the buyer well the work is the commodity
 

2871
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,790
the buyer well the work is the commodity
in this case because when a when if

2872
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:58,800
in this case because when a when if
 

2873
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,990
in this case because when a when if
you're going to make stuff in a factory

2874
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,000
you're going to make stuff in a factory
 

2875
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,670
you're going to make stuff in a factory
you've got to hire workers

2876
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
you've got to hire workers
 

2877
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,510
you've got to hire workers
yes okay and what marx is saying the

2878
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:03,520
yes okay and what marx is saying the
 

2879
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,829
yes okay and what marx is saying the
buyer in that situation is a capitalist

2880
00:49:05,829 --> 00:49:05,839
buyer in that situation is a capitalist
 

2881
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,829
buyer in that situation is a capitalist
so what does the buyer pay he says he

2882
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:07,839
so what does the buyer pay he says he
 

2883
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,230
so what does the buyer pay he says he
pays the exchange value that's they get

2884
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:10,240
pays the exchange value that's they get
 

2885
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,829
pays the exchange value that's they get
back to the commodity thing that this is

2886
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:11,839
back to the commodity thing that this is
 

2887
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,030
back to the commodity thing that this is
because that's the starting point is

2888
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,040
because that's the starting point is
 

2889
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,190
because that's the starting point is
that the essential unity in a capitalist

2890
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,200
that the essential unity in a capitalist
 

2891
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,950
that the essential unity in a capitalist
economy is the commodity

2892
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:16,960
economy is the commodity
 

2893
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,950
economy is the commodity
a commodity has two characteristics

2894
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:18,960
a commodity has two characteristics
 

2895
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,990
a commodity has two characteristics
exchange value and use value okay

2896
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:22,000
exchange value and use value okay
 

2897
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,990
exchange value and use value okay
exchange value of a commodity in a

2898
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:24,000
exchange value of a commodity in a
 

2899
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,589
exchange value of a commodity in a
capitalist economy will be its cost of

2900
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:25,599
capitalist economy will be its cost of
 

2901
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,790
capitalist economy will be its cost of
production

2902
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:26,800
production
 

2903
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,589
production
the use value is what you do with it

2904
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:29,599
the use value is what you do with it
 

2905
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,230
the use value is what you do with it
okay once you've purchased it but labor

2906
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:32,240
okay once you've purchased it but labor
 

2907
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,870
okay once you've purchased it but labor
is a commodity in this case when you're

2908
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:34,880
is a commodity in this case when you're
 

2909
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,270
is a commodity in this case when you're
when a worker is being hired for a job

2910
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:37,280
when a worker is being hired for a job
 

2911
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,670
when a worker is being hired for a job
yes so the workers

2912
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:39,680
yes so the workers
 

2913
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,790
yes so the workers
labor

2914
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:40,800
labor
 

2915
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,950
labor
has an exchange value and a used value

2916
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
has an exchange value and a used value
 

2917
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,470
has an exchange value and a used value
as well yeah youth value use value of a

2918
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
as well yeah youth value use value of a
 

2919
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,309
as well yeah youth value use value of a
worker's labor exchange value

2920
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
worker's labor exchange value
 

2921
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,069
worker's labor exchange value
let me think about that so if that

2922
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:54,079
let me think about that so if that
 

2923
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,470
let me think about that so if that
so the hours they put in

2924
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,480
so the hours they put in
 

2925
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,870
so the hours they put in
is the use value

2926
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:58,880
is the use value
 

2927
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,349
is the use value
interesting so what uh

2928
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:01,359
interesting so what uh
 

2929
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,109
interesting so what uh
what does the worker

2930
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:03,119
what does the worker
 

2931
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,710
what does the worker
want in this

2932
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:04,720
want in this
 

2933
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,230
want in this
what are the motivations are we not

2934
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,240
what are the motivations are we not
 

2935
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,630
what are the motivations are we not
considering the worker in this context

2936
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:08,640
considering the worker in this context
 

2937
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,470
considering the worker in this context
as a human being

2938
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:10,480
as a human being
 

2939
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,470
as a human being
and that's actually that's that's the

2940
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:12,480
and that's actually that's that's the
 

2941
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,549
and that's actually that's that's the
next layer you what what marks give was

2942
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:14,559
next layer you what what marks give was
 

2943
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,950
next layer you what what marks give was
just like a a layered cake

2944
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:16,960
just like a a layered cake
 

2945
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,030
just like a a layered cake
starting from a foundation of saying

2946
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:19,040
starting from a foundation of saying
 

2947
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,190
starting from a foundation of saying
straight commodity exchange and then

2948
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,200
straight commodity exchange and then
 

2949
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,710
straight commodity exchange and then
saying well you're treating a worker as

2950
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:22,720
saying well you're treating a worker as
 

2951
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,870
saying well you're treating a worker as
a commodity now a commodity is something

2952
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:24,880
a commodity now a commodity is something
 

2953
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,030
a commodity now a commodity is something
you know like this

2954
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:27,040
you know like this
 

2955
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,190
you know like this
okay that has so far as i'm aware no

2956
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,200
okay that has so far as i'm aware no
 

2957
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,870
okay that has so far as i'm aware no
soul okay yeah i'm not going to be

2958
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
soul okay yeah i'm not going to be
 

2959
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,470
soul okay yeah i'm not going to be
complaining if i turn it upside down

2960
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:32,480
complaining if i turn it upside down
 

2961
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,150
complaining if i turn it upside down
it'll fall over but it yeah

2962
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:34,160
it'll fall over but it yeah
 

2963
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,829
it'll fall over but it yeah
so that's there's no soul there as a

2964
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:35,839
so that's there's no soul there as a
 

2965
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,829
so that's there's no soul there as a
human is both a commodity and a

2966
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:37,839
human is both a commodity and a
 

2967
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,829
human is both a commodity and a
non-commodity yeah and therefore

2968
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:39,839
non-commodity yeah and therefore
 

2969
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,589
non-commodity yeah and therefore
there'll be a tension in the person i'm

2970
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599
there'll be a tension in the person i'm
 

2971
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,030
there'll be a tension in the person i'm
being treated as a commodity here i'm

2972
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:43,040
being treated as a commodity here i'm
 

2973
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,670
being treated as a commodity here i'm
being paid just enough to stay alive

2974
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
being paid just enough to stay alive
 

2975
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,190
being paid just enough to stay alive
you know i've got a wife and kids back

2976
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:47,200
you know i've got a wife and kids back
 

2977
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,549
you know i've got a wife and kids back
at home yeah

2978
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:48,559
at home yeah
 

2979
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,030
at home yeah
so that that is another layer of of

2980
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:51,040
so that that is another layer of of
 

2981
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,109
so that that is another layer of of
thinking in marks and on that lady then

2982
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:53,119
thinking in marks and on that lady then
 

2983
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,270
thinking in marks and on that lady then
says well workers will therefore demand

2984
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:55,280
says well workers will therefore demand
 

2985
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,430
says well workers will therefore demand
more than their value so that's when you

2986
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:57,440
more than their value so that's when you
 

2987
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,510
more than their value so that's when you
get like political you get political and

2988
00:50:59,510 --> 00:50:59,520
get like political you get political and
 

2989
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,109
get like political you get political and
you get money coming above that and so

2990
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:01,119
you get money coming above that and so
 

2991
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,349
you get money coming above that and so
on but the basic idea starts from the

2992
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:03,359
on but the basic idea starts from the
 

2993
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,030
on but the basic idea starts from the
commodities the fundamental unity and

2994
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,040
commodities the fundamental unity and
 

2995
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,030
commodities the fundamental unity and
capitalism

2996
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
capitalism
 

2997
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,829
capitalism
the

2998
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:07,839
the
 

2999
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,549
the
important commodity in marx's thinking

3000
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:10,559
important commodity in marx's thinking
 

3001
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,069
important commodity in marx's thinking
was the worker because that's where he

3002
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:12,079
was the worker because that's where he
 

3003
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,470
was the worker because that's where he
said profit came from yeah okay and then

3004
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:14,480
said profit came from yeah okay and then
 

3005
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,829
said profit came from yeah okay and then
that explains the motivation of the

3006
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:15,839
that explains the motivation of the
 

3007
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,670
that explains the motivation of the
capitalist and that ultimately sort of

3008
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:17,680
capitalist and that ultimately sort of
 

3009
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,750
capitalist and that ultimately sort of
labor theory of value and

3010
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:19,760
labor theory of value and
 

3011
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,069
labor theory of value and
marx's arguments about how capitalism

3012
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
marx's arguments about how capitalism
 

3013
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,309
marx's arguments about how capitalism
will come to an end okay okay

3014
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:24,319
will come to an end okay okay
 

3015
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,549
will come to an end okay okay
so first of all what is the labor theory

3016
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:26,559
so first of all what is the labor theory
 

3017
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,190
so first of all what is the labor theory
of value and actually before that yeah

3018
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200
of value and actually before that yeah
 

3019
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,549
of value and actually before that yeah
what is value is that um this is like me

3020
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:32,559
what is value is that um this is like me
 

3021
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,549
what is value is that um this is like me
asking what's happiness

3022
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:34,559
asking what's happiness
 

3023
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,549
asking what's happiness
uh is there something interesting to say

3024
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
uh is there something interesting to say
 

3025
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,030
uh is there something interesting to say
about trying to define value you vary

3026
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:39,040
about trying to define value you vary
 

3027
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,750
about trying to define value you vary
and this is a huge problem in economics

3028
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
and this is a huge problem in economics
 

3029
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,910
and this is a huge problem in economics
there's arguments of what does value

3030
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:43,920
there's arguments of what does value
 

3031
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,790
there's arguments of what does value
mean

3032
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,800
mean
 

3033
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,549
mean
and the neoclassicals came down and said

3034
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:46,559
and the neoclassicals came down and said
 

3035
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,150
and the neoclassicals came down and said
it's subjective

3036
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:48,160
it's subjective
 

3037
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,950
it's subjective
its value is whatever you get out of it

3038
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
its value is whatever you get out of it
 

3039
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,510
its value is whatever you get out of it
it's your personal evaluation of

3040
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:53,520
it's your personal evaluation of
 

3041
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,430
it's your personal evaluation of
something your personal feelings so

3042
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:55,440
something your personal feelings so
 

3043
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,589
something your personal feelings so
they've got that very subjective idea of

3044
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
they've got that very subjective idea of
 

3045
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,190
they've got that very subjective idea of
value whereas the marxists and the being

3046
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:01,200
value whereas the marxists and the being
 

3047
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,190
value whereas the marxists and the being
inheritors of the classical school

3048
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,200
inheritors of the classical school
 

3049
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,150
inheritors of the classical school
taught in terms of objective value

3050
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,160
taught in terms of objective value
 

3051
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,910
taught in terms of objective value
so the value is the number of hours it

3052
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:07,920
so the value is the number of hours it
 

3053
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,910
so the value is the number of hours it
takes to make something

3054
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:09,920
takes to make something
 

3055
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,069
takes to make something
or the effort the value is value is the

3056
00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:12,079
or the effort the value is value is the
 

3057
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,510
or the effort the value is value is the
effort that goes into making something

3058
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:13,520
effort that goes into making something
 

3059
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,829
effort that goes into making something
in the classical school well that's just

00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
in the classical school well that's just
 

3061
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:16,630
in the classical school well that's just
one

think you have to you have to have the

3072
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:27,040
think you have to you have to have the
 

3073
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,030
think you have to you have to have the
capacity to to move between one and the

3077
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,150
other in a structured model of value
yeah well my base model is the objective

3078
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,160
yeah well my base model is the objective
 

3079
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,630
yeah well my base model is the objective
okay but above that as soon as you start

3080
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:36,640
okay but above that as soon as you start
 

3081
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,990
okay but above that as soon as you start
talking used it about the worker for

3082
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,000
talking used it about the worker for
 

3083
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,990
talking used it about the worker for
example um

3084
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,000
example um
 

3085
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,109
example um
then you get involved in the

3086
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:41,119
then you get involved in the
 

3087
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,710
then you get involved in the
subjectivity because a worker will be

3088
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
subjectivity because a worker will be
 

3089
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,390
subjectivity because a worker will be
angry

3090
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,400
angry
 

3091
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,950
angry
and justifiably so about being treated

3092
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:48,960
and justifiably so about being treated
 

3093
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,190
and justifiably so about being treated
as a commodity because i'm not i'm not a

3094
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:51,200
as a commodity because i'm not i'm not a
 

3095
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,109
as a commodity because i'm not i'm not a
commodity i'm a human being okay and

3096
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:53,119
commodity i'm a human being okay and
 

3097
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,270
commodity i'm a human being okay and
that's where marx saw political

3098
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:55,280
that's where marx saw political
 

3099
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,589
that's where marx saw political
organization coming from

organization coming from
 

3101
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,829
organization coming from
so and that's subjective now and then

3102
00:52:59,829 --> 00:52:59,839
so and that's subjective now and then
 

3103
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,990
so and that's subjective now and then
when you get to money itself marx

3104
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,000
when you get to money itself marx
 

3105
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,349
when you get to money itself marx
actually said well what's the problem

3106
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:03,359
actually said well what's the problem
 

3107
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,950
actually said well what's the problem
what's the value of money

3108
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:04,960
what's the value of money
 

3109
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,630
what's the value of money
now if you use an objective theory of

3110
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,640
now if you use an objective theory of
 

3111
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,390
now if you use an objective theory of
value you would say oh the cost of money

3112
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
value you would say oh the cost of money
 

3113
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,150
value you would say oh the cost of money
the value of money is its cost of

3114
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
the value of money is its cost of
 

3115
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,309
the value of money is its cost of

a dollar it's about two cents
 

3119
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,030
a dollar it's about two cents
so he said it can't be

3120
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
so he said it can't be
 

3121
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,710
so he said it can't be
the value of the money cannot be its

he was okay with that because he could

value and a gap between the two
 

3155
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,349

when you're talking about

when you're talking about
 

3157

machines when you're buying stuff for
 

3159
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,870

production and then

3160
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
production and then
 

3161
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,470
production and then
at the next level you could look at

3162
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
at the next level you could look at
 

3163
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,390
at the next level you could look at
workers worker organization and say

3164
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:00,400
workers worker organization and say
 

3165
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,710
workers worker organization and say
that's driven by being treated as a

commodity when you're a non-commodity so
 

3169
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,950
commodity when you're a non-commodity so
the basic uh

3170

the basic uh

3173
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,309

that is described to karl marx is that

that is described to karl marx is that

comes from
 

3179
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,430
comes from
the labor you put into something yeah

3180
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:19,440
the labor you put into something yeah
 

3181
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,390
the labor you put into something yeah
and

00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:20,400
and
 

3183
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,710
and
you say well there's some deep truth

3184
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:22,720
you say well there's some deep truth
 

3185

also bring value to the world he was

also bring value to the world he was

he he was uh the only thing that matters
 

3195
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,309
he he was uh the only thing that matters
is human labor

3196
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
is human labor
 

3197
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,109
is human labor
not

3198
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:37,119
not
 

3199
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,990
not
not labor how do you measure what's the

3200
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,000
not labor how do you measure what's the
 

3201

role
 

3203
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,670

an exclusivist explanation for why labor

3218
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:55,920
an exclusivist explanation for why labor
 

3219
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,349
an exclusivist explanation for why labor
created value

3220
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:57,359
created value
 

3221
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,670
created value
and that was to say that uh there's the

3222
00:54:59,670 --> 00:54:59,680
and that was to say that uh there's the
 

3223
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,589
and that was to say that uh there's the
labor is the only commodity

3224
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:01,599
labor is the only commodity
 

3225
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,589
labor is the only commodity
with both what he called commodity and

3226
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:03,599
with both what he called commodity and
 

3227
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,190
with both what he called commodity and
commodity power

3228
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
commodity power
 

3229
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,710
commodity power
so you have labor and labor power

3230
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
so you have labor and labor power
 

3231
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,470
so you have labor and labor power
labor is the

3232
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:10,480
labor is the

read it for something like 30 years but
 

3237
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,150

labor has both commodity and commodity

3238
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,160
labor has both commodity and commodity
 

3239
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,670
labor has both commodity and commodity
power the commodity is you can buy labor

3240
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
power the commodity is you can buy labor
 

3241
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,150
power the commodity is you can buy labor
which is the means of subsistence labor

3242
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,160
which is the means of subsistence labor
 

3243
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,910
which is the means of subsistence labor
power is the capacity to work inside a

there's a difference between the two

3248
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,040
there's a difference between the two
 

3249
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,549
there's a difference between the two
therefore that difference will give rise

3250
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
therefore that difference will give rise
 

3251
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,150
therefore that difference will give rise
to surplus and there's no other

01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:25,119
feistier than you he was fasty but uh
 

3533
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,750
feistier than you he was fasty but uh
fasty with he could be arrogant like i'm

3534
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:27,760
fasty with he could be arrogant like i'm
 

3535
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,750
fasty with he could be arrogant like i'm
uh i've got an intellectual arrogance

3536
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:29,760
uh i've got an intellectual arrogance
 

3537
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,510
uh i've got an intellectual arrogance
i've yeah come to accept that but

3538
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:31,520
i've yeah come to accept that but
 

3539
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,270
i've yeah come to accept that but
there's like a fundamental humility to

3540
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,280
there's like a fundamental humility to
 

3541
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,349
there's like a fundamental humility to
you yeah if you're saying marx is like

3542
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:35,359
you yeah if you're saying marx is like
 

3543
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,670
you yeah if you're saying marx is like
he's ego that's the case

3544
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
he's ego that's the case
 

3545
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,430
he's ego that's the case
yeah i'm guessing

3546
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,440
yeah i'm guessing
 

3547
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,710
yeah i'm guessing
i'm never going to meet him well the

3548
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:40,720
i'm never going to meet him well the
 

3549
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,030
i'm never going to meet him well the
beard says ego to me the beat is huge

3551
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,990
beard says ego to me the beat is huge
yeah that's that's that's huge okay so

3552
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:46,000
yeah that's that's that's huge okay so
 

3553
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,270
yeah that's that's that's huge okay so
this is interesting you went

3554
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,280
this is interesting you went
 

3555
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,349
this is interesting you went
chronologically right through his word

01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:52,480
through his works yeah and i was trying
 

3561
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,910
through his works yeah and i was trying
to find the point at which he discovered

3562
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:53,920
to find the point at which he discovered
 

3563
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,390
to find the point at which he discovered
this use value exchange value idea and

3564
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:56,400
this use value exchange value idea and
 

3565
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,589
this use value exchange value idea and

classical authors in chronological
 

3579
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,829
classical authors in chronological
sequence and then somebody throws hegel

3580
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:15,839
sequence and then somebody throws hegel
 

3581
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,990
sequence and then somebody throws hegel
at him and suddenly he's talking in

3582
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
at him and suddenly he's talking in
 

3583
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,030
at him and suddenly he's talking in
hegelian terms and he suddenly says is

3584
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:21,040
hegelian terms and he suddenly says is
 

3585
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,309
hegelian terms and he suddenly says is
not

3586
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:22,319
not
 

3587
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,150
not
because it's whole value issues what is

3588
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:24,160
because it's whole value issues what is
 

3589
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,069
because it's whole value issues what is
values is exchange value use value how

3590
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:26,079
values is exchange value use value how
 

3591
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,510
values is exchange value use value how
do they relate to each other that's what

3592
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
do they relate to each other that's what
 

3593
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,630
do they relate to each other that's what
he was thinking about he said is not ex

3594
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:30,640
he was thinking about he said is not ex
 

3595
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,390
he was thinking about he said is not ex
use value which was left out of the

3596
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:32,400
use value which was left out of the
 

3597
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,549
use value which was left out of the
classical school a fundamental aspect of

3598
01:01:34,549 --> 01:01:34,559
classical school a fundamental aspect of
 

3599
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,069
classical school a fundamental aspect of
the commodity

3600
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:36,079
the commodity
 

3601
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,829
the commodity
is there not a tension between the use

3602
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:37,839
is there not a tension between the use
 

3603
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,510
is there not a tension between the use
value and exchange value

3604
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:39,520
value and exchange value
 

3605
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,670
value and exchange value
just so we're clear in that context use

3606
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:41,680
just so we're clear in that context use
 

3607
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,829
just so we're clear in that context use
value is kind of the subjective thing

3608
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:43,839
value is kind of the subjective thing
 

3609
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,069
value is kind of the subjective thing
exchange value is the objective yeah and

3610
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:46,079
exchange value is the objective yeah and
 

3611
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,069
exchange value is the objective yeah and
marx was found a way to integrate the

3612
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:48,079
marx was found a way to integrate the
 

3613
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:48,870
marx was found a way to integrate the
two

3614
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:48,880
two
 

3615
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,710
two
but he was focused on

3616
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:52,720

 

3617
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,789

labor being the only thing that can

3618
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:54,799
labor being the only thing that can
 

3619
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,549
labor being the only thing that can
generate both the user's value and the

3620
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:56,559
generate both the user's value and the
 

3621
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,309
generate both the user's value and the
exchange value but no

3622
01:01:58,309 --> 01:01:58,319
exchange value but no
 

3623
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,150
exchange value but no
if you look at the classical school

3624
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:00,160
if you look at the classical school
 

3625
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,349
if you look at the classical school
they focus on exchange value objective

3626
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:03,359
they focus on exchange value objective
 

3627
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,349
they focus on exchange value objective
look at the neo-classical they focus

3628
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:05,359
look at the neo-classical they focus
 

3629
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,829
look at the neo-classical they focus
upon use values subjective or they call

3630
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
upon use values subjective or they call
 

3631
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,029
upon use values subjective or they call
it utility

3632
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:09,039
it utility
 

3633
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,950
it utility
so marx coming from the ricardian

3634
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:10,960
so marx coming from the ricardian
 

3635
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,069
so marx coming from the ricardian
tradition

3636
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:12,079
tradition
 

3637
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,630
tradition
basically dismiss the role of utility

3638
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:14,640
basically dismiss the role of utility
 

3639
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,190
basically dismiss the role of utility
and then when he reads hegel he's

3640
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,200
and then when he reads hegel he's
 

3641
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,870
and then when he reads hegel he's
suddenly starting to think in terms of

3642
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:18,880
suddenly starting to think in terms of
 

3643
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,150
suddenly starting to think in terms of
unities and exchange value and use value

3644
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:22,160
unities and exchange value and use value
 

3645
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,390
unities and exchange value and use value
is the unity of the commodity

3646
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:24,400
is the unity of the commodity
 

3647
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,470
is the unity of the commodity
and he thinks well i can't ignore use

3648
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:26,480
and he thinks well i can't ignore use
 

3649
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,589
and he thinks well i can't ignore use
value

3650
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:27,599
value
 

3651
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,510
value
so rather than leaving it out completely

3652
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,520
so rather than leaving it out completely
 

3653
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,510
so rather than leaving it out completely
which is what ricardo and smith does

3654
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:31,520
which is what ricardo and smith does
 

3655
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,270
which is what ricardo and smith does
i've got to somehow bring it in and this

3656
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:33,280
i've got to somehow bring it in and this
 

3657
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,910
i've got to somehow bring it in and this
hegelian insight occurs to him and you

3658
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:35,920
hegelian insight occurs to him and you
 

3659
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,670
hegelian insight occurs to him and you
it's remarkable to you i really

3660
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
it's remarkable to you i really
 

3661
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,109
it's remarkable to you i really
recommend taking a look at the book even

3662
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:39,119
recommend taking a look at the book even
 

3663
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,029
recommend taking a look at the book even
just to look at that particular page

3664
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:41,039
just to look at that particular page
 

3665
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,470
just to look at that particular page
because what it would have been is it's

3666
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:42,480
because what it would have been is it's
 

3667
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,069
because what it would have been is it's
shown as a footnote but it would have

3668
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
shown as a footnote but it would have
 

3669
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,630
shown as a footnote but it would have
been him saying oh wow when his asterisk

3670
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:46,640
been him saying oh wow when his asterisk
 

3671
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,190
been him saying oh wow when his asterisk
asterisk is not uh

3672
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,200
asterisk is not uh
 

3673
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,829
asterisk is not uh
use value a fundamental aspect of the

3674
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:51,839
use value a fundamental aspect of the
 

3675
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,230
use value a fundamental aspect of the
unity of a commodity so in the notes you

3676
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
unity of a commodity so in the notes you
 

3677
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,910
unity of a commodity so in the notes you
see the discovery of an idea in the

3678
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:55,920
see the discovery of an idea in the
 

3679
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,029
see the discovery of an idea in the
human being and it's beautiful the

3680
01:02:57,029 --> 01:02:57,039
human being and it's beautiful the
 

3681
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,710
human being and it's beautiful the
integration of an idea and he actually

3682
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:58,720
integration of an idea and he actually
 

3683
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,470
integration of an idea and he actually
writes does this have significance in

3684
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:00,480
writes does this have significance in
 

3685
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,309
writes does this have significance in
economics question mark and then he

3686
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:02,319
economics question mark and then he
 

3687
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,390
economics question mark and then he
probably went home that night

3688
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:04,400
probably went home that night
 

3689
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,390
probably went home that night
and like that that that idea changed

3690
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:06,400
and like that that that idea changed
 

3691
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,710
and like that that that idea changed
yeah it changed him completely okay and

3692
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:08,720
yeah it changed him completely okay and
 

3693
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,069
yeah it changed him completely okay and
from that point on his writing was

3694
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:10,079
from that point on his writing was
 

3695
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,829
from that point on his writing was
completely different but he still had

01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,750
unity in capitalism
capitalism focuses upon the exchange

3850
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
capitalism focuses upon the exchange
 

3851
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,630
capitalism focuses upon the exchange
value that pushes the use value into the

3852
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:56,640
value that pushes the use value into the
 

3853
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,549
value that pushes the use value into the
background and there's a tension between

3854
01:05:58,549 --> 01:05:58,559
background and there's a tension between
 

3855
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,589
background and there's a tension between
the two

3856
01:05:59,589 --> 01:05:59,599
the two
 

3857
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,670
the two
what that means is the exchange value of

3858
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:01,680
what that means is the exchange value of
 

3859
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,470
what that means is the exchange value of
the commodity sets its price the use

3860
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:04,480
the commodity sets its price the use
 

3861
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,870
the commodity sets its price the use
value is independent he called them

3862
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
value is independent he called them
 

3863
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,950
value is independent he called them
incommensurable he literally would use

3864
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:08,960
incommensurable he literally would use
 

3865
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,870
incommensurable he literally would use
the word

3866
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:09,880
the word
 

3867
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,750
the word
incommensurability between exchange

3868
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:11,760
incommensurability between exchange
 

3869
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,270
incommensurability between exchange
value and a use value whereas

3870
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:13,280
value and a use value whereas
 

3871
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,510
value and a use value whereas
neoclassicals make them commensurable so

3872
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
neoclassicals make them commensurable so
 

3873
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,910
neoclassicals make them commensurable so
saying exchange value and use value in

3874
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:17,920
saying exchange value and use value in
 

3875
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,069
saying exchange value and use value in
incommensurable

3876
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:20,079
incommensurable
 

3877
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,670
incommensurable
and that normally means that exchange

3878
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:21,680
and that normally means that exchange
 

3879
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,270
and that normally means that exchange
value is objective like the number of

3880
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:23,280
value is objective like the number of
 

3881
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,510
value is objective like the number of
hours it takes to make something useful

3882
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:25,520
hours it takes to make something useful
 

3883
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,510
hours it takes to make something useful
is subjective how comfortable the chair

3884
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:27,520
is subjective how comfortable the chair
 

3885
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,990
is subjective how comfortable the chair
is the fact you can sit in a chair

3886
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,000
is the fact you can sit in a chair
 

3887
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,589
is the fact you can sit in a chair
so that's incommensurability but when

3888
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:31,599
so that's incommensurability but when
 

3889
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,829
so that's incommensurability but when
you apply it in production

3890
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:33,839
you apply it in production
 

3891
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,829
you apply it in production
the exchange value of something is

3892
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839
the exchange value of something is
 

3893
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,910
the exchange value of something is
objective it's how many hours it takes

3894
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
objective it's how many hours it takes
 

3895
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,990
objective it's how many hours it takes
to make a machine or how many hours it

3896
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,000
to make a machine or how many hours it
 

3897
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,589
to make a machine or how many hours it
takes to make the means of subsistence

3898
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:41,599
takes to make the means of subsistence
 

3899
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,910
takes to make the means of subsistence
for a worker the use value is also

3900
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:43,920
for a worker the use value is also
 

3901
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,990
for a worker the use value is also
objective you're making commodities for

3902
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,000
objective you're making commodities for
 

3903
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,430
objective you're making commodities for
sale

3904
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:47,440
sale
 

3905
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,829
sale
and the worker does six hours six hours

3906
01:06:49,829 --> 01:06:49,839
and the worker does six hours six hours
 

3907
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,789
and the worker does six hours six hours
of work will make them the

3908
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
of work will make them the
 

3909
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,029
of work will make them the
means of subsistence for the worker but

3910
01:06:55,029 --> 01:06:55,039
means of subsistence for the worker but
 

3911
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,270
means of subsistence for the worker but
the worker will work a 12-hour day

3912
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:57,280
the worker will work a 12-hour day
 

3913
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,430
the worker will work a 12-hour day
and the six hours becomes a gap

3914
01:06:59,430 --> 01:06:59,440
and the six hours becomes a gap
 

3915
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,829
and the six hours becomes a gap
now that's incommensurability between

3916
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:01,839
now that's incommensurability between
 

3917
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,549
now that's incommensurability between
use value and exchange value of labor

3918
01:07:04,549 --> 01:07:04,559
use value and exchange value of labor
 

3919
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,150
use value and exchange value of labor
but when you look at what he said about

3920
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:06,160
but when you look at what he said about
 

3921
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,549
but when you look at what he said about
no matter how long how it takes to make

3922
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:08,559
no matter how long how it takes to make
 

3923
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,109
no matter how long how it takes to make
a machine or how many pounds it costs

3924
01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:11,119
a machine or how many pounds it costs
 

3925
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,029
a machine or how many pounds it costs
he's saying they're identical

3926
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,039
he's saying they're identical
 

3927
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,109
he's saying they're identical
and that's contradicting his own logic

3928
01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:15,119
and that's contradicting his own logic
 

3929
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,190
and that's contradicting his own logic
well what's what's the youth value of a

3930
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:17,200
well what's what's the youth value of a
 

3931
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,670
well what's what's the youth value of a
machine fact that it can produce

3932
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:19,680
machine fact that it can produce
 

3933
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,670
machine fact that it can produce
goods for sale exactly the same as the

3934
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:21,680
goods for sale exactly the same as the
 

3935
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,109
goods for sale exactly the same as the

now what i've in my modern

3938
01:07:25,029 --> 01:07:25,039
now what i've in my modern
 

3939
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,589
now what i've in my modern
reinterpretation of marx which brings in

3940
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
reinterpretation of marx which brings in
 

3941
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,270
reinterpretation of marx which brings in
my work on energy

3942
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,280
my work on energy
 

3943
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,549
my work on energy
i see both labor and machinery as a

3944
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:32,559
i see both labor and machinery as a
 

3945
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,309
i see both labor and machinery as a
means to harness energy

3946
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:34,319
means to harness energy
 

3947
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,309
means to harness energy
and produce useful work

3948
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:36,319
and produce useful work
 

3949
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,549
and produce useful work
and they can both do that in fact they

3950
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:38,559
and they can both do that in fact they
 

3951
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:39,829
and they can both do that in fact they
do it together it's a collective

3952
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:39,839
do it together it's a collective
 

3953
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:41,109
do it together it's a collective
enterprise

3954
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:41,119
enterprise
 

3955
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,109
enterprise
okay so

3956
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:43,119
okay so
 

3957
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,029
okay so
and we'll go to that so there's no

3958
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:45,039
and we'll go to that so there's no
 

3959
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,789
and we'll go to that so there's no
there's no fundamental difference from

3960
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:46,799
there's no fundamental difference from
 

3961
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,710
there's no fundamental difference from
exchange value and use value perspective

3962
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:48,720
exchange value and use value perspective
 

3963
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,150
exchange value and use value perspective
between a human and a machine and

3964
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,160
between a human and a machine and
 

3965
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,750
between a human and a machine and
therefore they're using the same logic

3966
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:51,760
therefore they're using the same logic
 

3967
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,589
therefore they're using the same logic
they can both be a source of surplus

3968
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:53,599
they can both be a source of surplus
 

3969
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,829
they can both be a source of surplus
yeah which is what marx contradicted

3970
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:55,839
yeah which is what marx contradicted
 

3971
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:56,789
yeah which is what marx contradicted
because

3972
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:56,799
because
 

3973
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,470
because
his explanation for where socialism

3974
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,480
his explanation for where socialism
 

3975
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,470
his explanation for where socialism
would come from is that only profit

3976
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:00,480
would come from is that only profit
 

3977
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,069
would come from is that only profit
comes from late profit comes only from

3978
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:02,079
comes from late profit comes only from
 

3979
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,430
comes from late profit comes only from
labor

3980
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:03,440
labor
 

3981
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,270
labor
over time will add more machinery than

3982
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:05,280
over time will add more machinery than
 

3983
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,349
over time will add more machinery than
labor that will mean a falling rate of

3984
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:07,359
labor that will mean a falling rate of
 

3985
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,910
labor that will mean a falling rate of
profit and therefore a tendency towards

3986
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,920
profit and therefore a tendency towards
 

3987
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,829
profit and therefore a tendency towards
socialism and what he did in that

3988
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:11,839
socialism and what he did in that
 

3989
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,549
socialism and what he did in that
insight in 1857 is contradict

3990
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:14,559
insight in 1857 is contradict
 

3991
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,630
insight in 1857 is contradict
his own idea about what would lead to

3992
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,640
his own idea about what would lead to
 

3993
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,990
his own idea about what would lead to
socialism

3994
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,000
socialism
 

3995
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,070
socialism
and he couldn't cope with it okay what's

3996
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:20,080
and he couldn't cope with it okay what's
 

3997
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,550
and he couldn't cope with it okay what's
the difference between

3998
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:22,560
the difference between
 

3999
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,110
the difference between
marxian economics

4001
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,669
marxian economics
and marxist

01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:27,679
and marxist
 

4003

political ideology
 

4005
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,470
political ideology
the gap between the two the overlap the

01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:32,480
the gap between the two the overlap the
 

4007
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,709
the gap between the two the overlap the

and that tendency
 

4019
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,590
and that tendency
for the rate of profit of fall would

4020
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:45,600
for the rate of profit of fall would
 

4021
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,630
for the rate of profit of fall would
lead to

4022
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:46,640
lead to
 

4023
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,030
lead to
capitalists battening down on workers

uh i'll revolt by workers against this
 

4031
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,430
uh i'll revolt by workers against this
and then you would get socialism on the

4032
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:57,440
and then you would get socialism on the
 

4033
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,510
and then you would get socialism on the
other side so his

4034
01:08:59,510 --> 01:08:59,520
other side so his
 

4035
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,110
other side so his
he that what he called the tendency for

01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:01,120
he that what he called the tendency for
 

4037
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,630
he that what he called the tendency for
the rate of profit to fall played a

the rate of profit to fall played a
 

4039
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,870
the rate of profit to fall played a
critical role in his explanation for why

critical role in his explanation for why
 

4041
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,430
critical role in his explanation for why
socialism would have to come about he

4042
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:07,440
socialism would have to come about he
 

4043
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,870
socialism would have to come about he
was saying it would have to come about

4044
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
was saying it would have to come about
 

4045
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,229
was saying it would have to come about
or is it a good thing for it to come

01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:10,239
or is it a good thing for it to come
 

4047
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:12,870
or is it a good thing for it to come
about um

4048

history of radical thought he was
preceded by what were called utopian

sansamon even the cadburys company came
 

4063
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,990
sansamon even the cadburys company came
out of utopian socialist and they had an

out of utopian socialist and they had an
 

4065
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,590

marx said i can prove that socialism
 

4083
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,430
marx said i can prove that socialism

so he preferred he had a utopian vision

4086
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
so he preferred he had a utopian vision
 

4087
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,110
so he preferred he had a utopian vision
of a future society but he thought he

4088
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:53,120
of a future society but he thought he
 

4089
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,790
of a future society but he thought he
could prove that it had to come about

4090
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:54,800
could prove that it had to come about
 

4091
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,550
could prove that it had to come about
and the the proof

4092
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:56,560
and the the proof
 

4093
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,870
and the the proof
relied critically upon

01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
relied critically upon

01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,870
relied critically upon

4097
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,550
tendency for the rate of profit to fall
and that relied upon labor being the

4098
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
and that relied upon labor being the
 

4099
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,030
and that relied upon labor being the
only source of profit

morning um a poet in the afternoon and a

4132

morning um a poet in the afternoon and a
 

4133
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,390
morning um a poet in the afternoon and a
chef at night okay that's paraphrasing

4134
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:42,400
chef at night okay that's paraphrasing
 

4135
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,229
chef at night okay that's paraphrasing
one of his phrases so he did have a

4136
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:44,239
one of his phrases so he did have a
 

4137
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,630
one of his phrases so he did have a
utopian vision of a future society and

4138
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:46,640
utopian vision of a future society and
 

4139
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,390
utopian vision of a future society and
he did think human creativity would be

4140
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,400
he did think human creativity would be
 

4141
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,709
he did think human creativity would be
much much greater under socialism than

4142
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:50,719
much much greater under socialism than
 

4143
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,830
much much greater under socialism than
it was under capitalism he was wrong

4144
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:53,840
it was under capitalism he was wrong
 

4145
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,070
it was under capitalism he was wrong
uh so let's explore in different ways

4146
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:56,080
uh so let's explore in different ways
 

4147
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,430
uh so let's explore in different ways
where he was wrong you're saying there's

4148
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:57,440
where he was wrong you're saying there's
 

4149
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,550
where he was wrong you're saying there's
a fundamental flaw in the logic

4150
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:00,560
a fundamental flaw in the logic
 

4151
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,550
a fundamental flaw in the logic
but also if we can link

4152
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:02,560
but also if we can link
 

4153
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,990
but also if we can link
if we can explore

4154
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:04,000
if we can explore
 

4155
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,910
if we can explore
the high-level philosophical concepts of

4156
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:05,920
the high-level philosophical concepts of
 

4157
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,229
the high-level philosophical concepts of
socialism too like the dreams of a

4158
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:08,239
socialism too like the dreams of a
 

4159
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:12,630
socialism too like the dreams of a
utopia yeah so what um first of all what

4160
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
utopia yeah so what um first of all what
 

4161
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,470
utopia yeah so what um first of all what
is socialism

4162
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:14,480

actually was done under god's plan under
 

4213
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,990
actually was done under god's plan under
the soviets uh and even with a

4214
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
the soviets uh and even with a
 

4215
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,750
the soviets uh and even with a
collective collective farms as well you

4216
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:09,760
collective collective farms as well you
 

4217
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,750
collective collective farms as well you
know no longer owns your land the state

4218
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
know no longer owns your land the state
 

4219
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,990
know no longer owns your land the state
owns your own the land you worked on the

4220
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:14,000
owns your own the land you worked on the
 

4221
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,070
owns your own the land you worked on the
land and this was supposed to be a

4222
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,080
land and this was supposed to be a
 

4223
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,270
land and this was supposed to be a
utopia

4224
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:17,280
utopia
 

4225
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,110
utopia
right now does that turn out to be one

4226
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:19,120
right now does that turn out to be one
 

4227
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,110
right now does that turn out to be one
and we'll talk about maybe your ideas of

4228
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,120
and we'll talk about maybe your ideas of
 

4229
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,990
and we'll talk about maybe your ideas of
why didn't turn out to be one uh so the

4230
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:24,000
why didn't turn out to be one uh so the
 

4231
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,070
why didn't turn out to be one uh so the
the fascists did the same so it's just

4232
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
the fascists did the same so it's just
 

4233
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,510
the fascists did the same so it's just
fascism also

4234
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:27,520
fascism also
 

4235
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,790
fascism also
fascism

4236
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:28,800
fascism
 

4237
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,830
fascism
so called national socialism it's also a

4238
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:31,840
so called national socialism it's also a
 

4239
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,910
so called national socialism it's also a
kind of social so yeah but there was no

4240
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:33,920
kind of social so yeah but there was no
 

4241
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,350
kind of social so yeah but there was no
it wasn't pub public owners there was

4242
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,360
it wasn't pub public owners there was
 

4243
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,149
it wasn't pub public owners there was
public direction so the state would tell

4244
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:38,159
public direction so the state would tell
 

4245
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:39,430
public direction so the state would tell
factories what to do with a still

4246
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
factories what to do with a still
 

4247
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,350
factories what to do with a still
private profit and a large part of why

4248
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,360
private profit and a large part of why
 

4249
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,030
private profit and a large part of why
the nazis succeeded was the extent to

4250
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:43,040
the nazis succeeded was the extent to
 

4251
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,110
the nazis succeeded was the extent to
which they managed to co-opt major

4252
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
which they managed to co-opt major
 

4253
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,110
which they managed to co-opt major
manufacturers in germany

4254
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:47,120
manufacturers in germany
 

4255
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,310
manufacturers in germany
uh so

4256
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:48,320
uh so
 

4257
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,550
uh so
it's you know it's direction versus

4258
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:50,560
it's you know it's direction versus
 

4259
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,750
it's you know it's direction versus
ownership it's a dictatorial i mean

4260
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
ownership it's a dictatorial i mean
 

4261
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,750
ownership it's a dictatorial i mean
that's a very particular implementation

4262
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:55,760
that's a very particular implementation
 

4263
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,430
that's a very particular implementation
yeah so you have to you have to consider

4264
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:57,440
yeah so you have to you have to consider
 

4265
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,189
yeah so you have to you have to consider
the full details of the implementation

4266
01:12:59,189 --> 01:12:59,199
the full details of the implementation
 

4267
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,470
the full details of the implementation
but it's basically

4268
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480
but it's basically
 

4269
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,110
but it's basically
dictator guided yeah

4270
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
dictator guided yeah
 

4271
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,110
dictator guided yeah
if you want to if you want to take this

4272
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:05,120
if you want to if you want to take this
 

4273
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,709
if you want to if you want to take this
if you want to take a a proper vision

4274
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
if you want to take a a proper vision
 

4275
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,630
if you want to take a a proper vision
then you have to say it's the ownership

4276
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,640
then you have to say it's the ownership
 

4277
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,030
then you have to say it's the ownership
of the means of production by the state

4278
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:11,040
of the means of production by the state
 

4279
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,950
of the means of production by the state
yeah okay versus the ownership by

4280
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:12,960
yeah okay versus the ownership by
 

4281
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,149
yeah okay versus the ownership by
private that rules out the nazi period

4282
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:16,159
private that rules out the nazi period
 

4283
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,590
private that rules out the nazi period
do you use the word that again they're

4284
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:17,600
do you use the word that again they're
 

4285
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,070
do you use the word that again they're
bastardizing as much as americans do in

4286
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,080
bastardizing as much as americans do in
 

4287
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,350
bastardizing as much as americans do in
the opposite direction

4288
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:23,360

 

4289
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,790

they all have legitimate demands on the

4404
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:21,679
they all have legitimate demands on the
 

4405
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,990
they all have legitimate demands on the
resources of the country and the state

4406
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,000
resources of the country and the state
 

4407
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,070
resources of the country and the state
that means that all your resources are

4408
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:26,080
that means that all your resources are
 

4409
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,750
that means that all your resources are
fully employed and are probably over

employed
 

4413
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,189
employed
so you have a resource constraint

4414
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
so you have a resource constraint
 

4415
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,790
so you have a resource constraint
in that society

4419
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,790
the easiest way to cope with a resource
constraint is to produce last year's

4493
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,990
a 1942 bmw yeah okay it was exactly the
same as steve mcqueen and the great

4494
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
same as steve mcqueen and the great
 

4495
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,950
same as steve mcqueen and the great
escape

4496
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:54,960
escape
 

4497
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,910
escape
so the russians for 30 years were making

4498
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:57,920
so the russians for 30 years were making
 

4499
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,830
so the russians for 30 years were making
the same bloody motorbike it had a

4500
01:16:59,830 --> 01:16:59,840
the same bloody motorbike it had a
 

4501
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,950
the same bloody motorbike it had a
bicycle seat yeah okay and this is what

4502
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
bicycle seat yeah okay and this is what
 

4503
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,390
bicycle seat yeah okay and this is what
that's how they cope they've just made

4504
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:04,400
that's how they cope they've just made
 

4505
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,550
that's how they cope they've just made
the same damn machine every year they

4506
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:06,560
the same damn machine every year they
 

4507
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,030
the same damn machine every year they
said so that's that's the outcome

4508
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,040
said so that's that's the outcome
 

4509
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,390
said so that's that's the outcome
you actually want the best possible

4510
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:10,400
you actually want the best possible
 

4511
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,390
you actually want the best possible
world you're trying to build as fast as

4512
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
world you're trying to build as fast as
 

4513
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,310
world you're trying to build as fast as
possible you're paying workers as high

4514
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,320
possible you're paying workers as high
 

4515
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,950
possible you're paying workers as high
wages as you possibly can and that leads

4516
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:16,960
wages as you possibly can and that leads
 

4517
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,070
wages as you possibly can and that leads
to a world where you don't innovate

4518
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
to a world where you don't innovate
 

4519
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,470
to a world where you don't innovate
you said capitalism on the other hand

4520
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:22,480
you said capitalism on the other hand
 

4521
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,470
you said capitalism on the other hand
pure capitalist economy you're trying to

4522
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:24,480
pure capitalist economy you're trying to
 

4523
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,709
pure capitalist economy you're trying to
pay workers as little as possible

4524
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:26,719
pay workers as little as possible
 

4525
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:28,550
pay workers as little as possible
you have competitive industries you're

4526
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:28,560
you have competitive industries you're
 

4527
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,709
you have competitive industries you're
trying to take demand away from your

4528
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
trying to take demand away from your
 

4529
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,790
trying to take demand away from your
rivals you have kawasaki versus honda

4530
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
rivals you have kawasaki versus honda
 

4531
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,830
rivals you have kawasaki versus honda
versus

4532
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
versus
 

4533
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,270
versus
you know

4534
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
you know
 

4535
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,870
you know
bmw etc etc the way you get demand away

4536
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:38,880
bmw etc etc the way you get demand away
 

4537
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,510
bmw etc etc the way you get demand away
from your competitors is by innovating

4538
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:41,520
from your competitors is by innovating
 

4539
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,350
from your competitors is by innovating
so what you will get is cycles and booms

4540
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,360
so what you will get is cycles and booms
 

4541
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,030
so what you will get is cycles and booms
and slumps but you'll innovate and

4542
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,040
and slumps but you'll innovate and
 

4543
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,470
and slumps but you'll innovate and
change over time

4544
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:46,480
change over time
 

4545
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,229
change over time
so what you found was this huge gap

4546
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:48,239
so what you found was this huge gap
 

4547
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:51,430
so what you found was this huge gap
between socialist volume production with

4548
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,440
between socialist volume production with
 

4549
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,669
between socialist volume production with
no innovation and capitalism with

4550
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:53,679
no innovation and capitalism with
 

4551
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,590
no innovation and capitalism with
innovation

4552
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:55,600
innovation
 

4553
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,149
innovation
so that was the fundamental failing that

4554
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
so that was the fundamental failing that
 

4555
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,790
so that was the fundamental failing that
janos corner saw saw why did why does

4556
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
janos corner saw saw why did why does
 

4557
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,550
janos corner saw saw why did why does
socialism not innovate

4558
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:02,560
socialism not innovate
 

4559
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,390
socialism not innovate
because if you go back to

4560
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:04,400
because if you go back to
 

4561
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,830
because if you go back to
his famous historical incident where

01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:05,840
his famous historical incident where
 

4563
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,390
his famous historical incident where
khrushchev in the united nations

death says we will bury you he literally

4568
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
death says we will bury you he literally
 

4569
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,709
death says we will bury you he literally
we're going to bury you in commodities

4570
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:14,719
we're going to bury you in commodities
 

4571
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,229
we're going to bury you in commodities
yeah we're going to produce more output

4572
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
yeah we're going to produce more output
 

4573
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,510
yeah we're going to produce more output
than you are and he was wrong

4574
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:19,520
than you are and he was wrong
 

4575
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,990
than you are and he was wrong
because fundamentally in the long term

4576
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:22,000
because fundamentally in the long term
 

4577
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,830
because fundamentally in the long term
to bury somebody

4578
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:23,840
to bury somebody
 

4579
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,590
to bury somebody
in commodity production you have to

4580
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:25,600
in commodity production you have to
 

4581
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,470
in commodity production you have to
innovate

4582
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:26,480
innovate
 

4583
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,550
innovate
yeah and like there's also there's

4584
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:28,560
yeah and like there's also there's
 

4585
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,830
yeah and like there's also there's
another

4586
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:29,840
another
 

4587
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,390
another
remarkable soviet engineer who was given

4588
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:32,400
remarkable soviet engineer who was given
 

4589
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,430
remarkable soviet engineer who was given
the job of interpreting marx's ideas of

4590
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:35,440
the job of interpreting marx's ideas of
 

4591
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,590
the job of interpreting marx's ideas of
industrial sectors so he had the

4592
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:37,600
industrial sectors so he had the
 

4593
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,070
industrial sectors so he had the
commodity sphere the industry sphere

4594
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,080
commodity sphere the industry sphere
 

4595
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,229
commodity sphere the industry sphere
sector one sector two sector three uh

4596
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:42,239
sector one sector two sector three uh
 

4597
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,830
sector one sector two sector three uh
sector one producing consumer goods

4598
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
sector one producing consumer goods
 

4599
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,510
sector one producing consumer goods
sector two producing capital goods

4600
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:45,520
sector two producing capital goods
 

4601
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,430
sector two producing capital goods
sector three producing luxury goods for

4602
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:47,440
sector three producing luxury goods for
 

4603
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,390
sector three producing luxury goods for
capitalists and so he had a three sector

4604
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,400
capitalists and so he had a three sector
 

4605
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,310
capitalists and so he had a three sector
model of the economy and he was talking

4606
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
model of the economy and he was talking
 

4607
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,950
model of the economy and he was talking
about the dynamics between them and

4608
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:54,960
about the dynamics between them and
 

4609
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,270
about the dynamics between them and
what feldman did was reinterpret this as

4610
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,280
what feldman did was reinterpret this as
 

4611
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,870
what feldman did was reinterpret this as
an engineer would reinterpret it which

4612
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:58,880
an engineer would reinterpret it which
 

4613
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,630
an engineer would reinterpret it which
was brilliant work

4614
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:00,640
was brilliant work
 

4615
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,229
was brilliant work
so what he said was

4616
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:02,239
so what he said was
 

4617
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,910
so what he said was
you you need to produce the means of

4618
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:03,920
you you need to produce the means of
 

4619
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,270
you you need to produce the means of
production

4620
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:05,280
production
 

4621
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,350
production
if you want to grow quickly you focus on

4622
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:07,360
if you want to grow quickly you focus on
 

4623
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,189
if you want to grow quickly you focus on
producing the means of production rather

4624
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:09,199
producing the means of production rather
 

4625
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,590
producing the means of production rather
than commodities so you don't make cars

4626
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:11,600
than commodities so you don't make cars
 

4627
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,270
than commodities so you don't make cars
you make car factories

4628
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:13,280
you make car factories
 

4629
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,590
you make car factories
okay you make a few cars but most of the

4630
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:15,600
okay you make a few cars but most of the
 

4631
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,790
okay you make a few cars but most of the
other goes into expanding how many

4632
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:16,800
other goes into expanding how many
 

4633
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,870
other goes into expanding how many
factories you have and what he did was

4634
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:18,880
factories you have and what he did was
 

4635
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,470
factories you have and what he did was
do a mathematical model where you'd

4636
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:20,480
do a mathematical model where you'd
 

4637
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,830
do a mathematical model where you'd
start off with very low levels of

4638
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:21,840
start off with very low levels of
 

4639
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,750
start off with very low levels of
consumer good output but then you would

4640
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:23,760
consumer good output but then you would
 

4641
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,430
consumer good output but then you would
just go exponential

4642
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:25,440
just go exponential
 

4643
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,189
just go exponential
okay now i took a look at that back when

4644
01:19:27,189 --> 01:19:27,199
okay now i took a look at that back when
 

4645
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,910
okay now i took a look at that back when
i was doing my master's degree and the

4646
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
i was doing my master's degree and the
 

4647
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,229
i was doing my master's degree and the
training in mathematics i took

4648
01:19:32,229 --> 01:19:32,239
training in mathematics i took
 

4649
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:35,189
training in mathematics i took
feldman's equations and then looked at

4650
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:35,199
feldman's equations and then looked at
 

4651
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,110
feldman's equations and then looked at
what was actually driving it was he was

you had all these unemployed workers you

4666
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:50,080
you had all these unemployed workers you
 

4667
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,430
you had all these unemployed workers you
had all these peasants you could take

4668
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:51,440
had all these peasants you could take
 

4669
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,430
had all these peasants you could take
off the land and put into factories so

4670
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:53,440
off the land and put into factories so
 

4671
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,950
off the land and put into factories so
you had a huge supply of workers

4672
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:56,960
you had a huge supply of workers
 

4673
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,229
you had a huge supply of workers
what you had to do was build the

4674
01:19:58,229 --> 01:19:58,239
what you had to do was build the
 

4675
01:19:58,239 --> 01:19:59,590
what you had to do was build the
factories so you're building the

4676
01:19:59,590 --> 01:19:59,600
factories so you're building the
 

4677
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,830
factories so you're building the
factories but at a certain point you

4678
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:01,840
factories but at a certain point you
 

4679
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,590
factories but at a certain point you
exhaust the supply

4680
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:03,600
exhaust the supply
 

4681
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,790
exhaust the supply
of

4682
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:04,800
of
 

4683
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,669

un lowly employed or unemployed labor

4684
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
un lowly employed or unemployed labor
 

4685
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,590
un lowly employed or unemployed labor
and so rather than having this this

4686
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:09,600
and so rather than having this this
 

4687
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,310
and so rather than having this this
exponential takeoff you hit a ceiling

4688
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:12,320
exponential takeoff you hit a ceiling
 

4689
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,830
exponential takeoff you hit a ceiling
and then you can only grow as fast as

4690
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:13,840
and then you can only grow as fast as
 

4691
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,030
and then you can only grow as fast as
the population because you're not

4692
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:15,040
the population because you're not
 

4693
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,149
the population because you're not
innovating

4694
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:16,159
innovating
 

4695
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,149
innovating
okay so that's what actually hit the

4696
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:18,159
okay so that's what actually hit the
 

4697
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,070
okay so that's what actually hit the
sofa soviet system

4698
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:20,080
sofa soviet system
 

4699
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,669
sofa soviet system
and it's why they never buried the

4700
01:20:21,669 --> 01:20:21,679
and it's why they never buried the
 

4701
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,110
and it's why they never buried the
western consumer goods and instead why

4702
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:25,120
western consumer goods and instead why
 

4703
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,510
western consumer goods and instead why
eastern consumers looked in envy of the

4704
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,520

4709
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,669

equality overall is that always that's

4814
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:23,199
equality overall is that always that's
 

4815
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:25,189
equality overall is that always that's
interesting i mean the scarcity or

4816
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:25,199
interesting i mean the scarcity or
 

4817
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,229
interesting i mean the scarcity or
resource

4818
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:26,239
resource
 

4819
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,350
resource
wait but i feel like that's the

4820
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
wait but i feel like that's the
 

4821
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,510
wait but i feel like that's the
contradiction i thought

4822
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:29,520
contradiction i thought
 

4823
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,709
contradiction i thought
when you're thinking you know classical

4824
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:30,719
when you're thinking you know classical
 

4825
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,950
when you're thinking you know classical
about scarcity yeah i'm i'm barely

4826
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:32,960
about scarcity yeah i'm i'm barely
 

4827
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,270
about scarcity yeah i'm i'm barely
thinking at all

4828
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:35,280
thinking at all
 

4829
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,950
thinking at all
uh

4830
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:36,960
uh
 

4831
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,430
uh
uh so wait i

4832
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:39,440
uh so wait i
 

4833
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,070
uh so wait i
i thought scarcity the best way to build

4834
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:42,080
i thought scarcity the best way to build
 

4835
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,229
i thought scarcity the best way to build
on top of scarcity is a capitalist type

4836
01:22:44,229 --> 01:22:44,239
on top of scarcity is a capitalist type
 

4837
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:45,990
on top of scarcity is a capitalist type
of machine no this is this is where

4838
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:46,000
of machine no this is this is where
 

4839
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,950
of machine no this is this is where
again our vision of what scarcity is is

4840
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:48,960
again our vision of what scarcity is is
 

4841
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,910
again our vision of what scarcity is is
wrong

4842
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:49,920
wrong
 

4843
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,590
wrong
because

4844
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:51,600
because
 

4845
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,030
because
and ricardo said this best actually

4846
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
and ricardo said this best actually
 

4847
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,510
and ricardo said this best actually
better than marx because ricardo said

4848
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:55,520
better than marx because ricardo said
 

4849
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,350
better than marx because ricardo said
there are some products

4850
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:57,360
there are some products
 

4851
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,990
there are some products
uh whose value is determined entirely by

uh whose value is determined entirely by
 

4853
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,229
uh whose value is determined entirely by
their scarcity yeah

4854
01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:02,239
their scarcity yeah
 

4855
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,590

and we've been ruthless about the
ecology of this planet and we're going

4978
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:01,679
ecology of this planet and we're going
 

4979
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,430
ecology of this planet and we're going
to pay the price for it

4980
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:03,440
to pay the price for it
 

4981
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,390
to pay the price for it
so

4982
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:04,400
so
 

4983
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,070
so
if you have a

4984
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,080
if you have a
 

4985
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,310
if you have a
planet where you can't be ruthless

4986
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:08,320
planet where you can't be ruthless
 

4987
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,950
planet where you can't be ruthless
okay well yeah okay you have to mine it

4988
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
okay well yeah okay you have to mine it
 

4989
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,709
okay well yeah okay you have to mine it
as carefully as possible

4990
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:12,719
as carefully as possible
 

4991
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:13,669
as carefully as possible
then

4992
01:25:13,669 --> 01:25:13,679
then
 

4993
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:16,709
then
those that that utopian might be imposed

4994
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
those that that utopian might be imposed
 

4995
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,390
those that that utopian might be imposed
upon you for the needs for survival on

4996
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:18,400
upon you for the needs for survival on
 

4997
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,550
upon you for the needs for survival on
that planet back here

4998
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:20,560
that planet back here
 

4999
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,430
that planet back here
uh

5000
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:21,440
uh
 

5001
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,430
uh
marx's util utopia was still the one

5002
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:23,440
marx's util utopia was still the one
 

5003
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,270
marx's util utopia was still the one
that ignored the ecology

5004
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:25,280
that ignored the ecology
 

5005
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,629
that ignored the ecology
and i think

5006
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:26,639
and i think
 

5007
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:29,350
and i think
uh if i have a vision of a utopia in

5008
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
uh if i have a vision of a utopia in
 

5009
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,669
uh if i have a vision of a utopia in
future it's got bugger all to do about

5010
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:31,679
future it's got bugger all to do about
 

5011
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,830
future it's got bugger all to do about
what humans get out of it

5012
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:33,840
what humans get out of it
 

5013
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,070
what humans get out of it
it's what humans respect

5014
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,080
it's what humans respect
 

5015
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,830
it's what humans respect
they have to respect life

5016
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840
they have to respect life
 

5017
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,310
they have to respect life
so i don't see that as i see that as a

5018
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:40,320
so i don't see that as i see that as a
 

5019
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,390
so i don't see that as i see that as a
as a one-eyed utopia a utopia for a

5020
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:42,400
as a one-eyed utopia a utopia for a
 

5021
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,030
as a one-eyed utopia a utopia for a
single species as if it can exist on its

5022
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,040
single species as if it can exist on its
 

5023
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,510
single species as if it can exist on its
own which we should know it can't uh

5024
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:47,520
own which we should know it can't uh
 

5025
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,350
own which we should know it can't uh
quick bathroom break yeah

5026
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:49,360
quick bathroom break yeah
 

5027
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,110
quick bathroom break yeah
that would be great

5028
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,120
that would be great
 

5029
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,110
that would be great
we took a little bit of a break and now

5030
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:53,120
we took a little bit of a break and now
 

5031
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,350
we took a little bit of a break and now
we're back we needed to take a break

5032
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:55,360
we're back we needed to take a break
 

5033
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,110
we're back we needed to take a break
because my brain broke and i'm

5034
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:57,120
because my brain broke and i'm
 

5035
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,790
because my brain broke and i'm
piecing it back together you mentioned

5036
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:58,800
piecing it back together you mentioned
 

5037
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,709
piecing it back together you mentioned
ecology and life and the value of all of

5038
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:00,719
ecology and life and the value of all of
 

5039
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:01,990
ecology and life and the value of all of
that

5040
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,000
that
 

5041
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,709
that
we'll return to it if we can

5042
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:04,719
we'll return to it if we can
 

5043
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:05,990
we'll return to it if we can
but

5044
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:06,000
but
 

5045
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,750
but
first

5046
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:07,760
first
 

5047
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,790
first
we said

5048
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:08,800
we said
 

5049
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,790
we said
why this kind of

5050
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:12,800

 

5051
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,910

this idea of why socialism failed can we

5052
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:15,920
this idea of why socialism failed can we
 

5053
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,709
this idea of why socialism failed can we
linger on this a little bit longer

5054
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:18,719
linger on this a little bit longer
 

5055
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,149
linger on this a little bit longer
and how did the ideas of karl marx lead

5056
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:22,159
and how did the ideas of karl marx lead
 

5057
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:25,030
and how did the ideas of karl marx lead
to stalinism so this particular

5058
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:25,040
to stalinism so this particular
 

5059
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,350
to stalinism so this particular
implementation yeah

5060
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:27,360
implementation yeah
 

5061
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,629
implementation yeah
um

5062
01:26:28,629 --> 01:26:28,639
um
 

5063
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,470
um
is there something fundamental to these

5064
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:30,480
is there something fundamental to these
 

5065
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,510
is there something fundamental to these
ideas

5066
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,520
ideas
 

5067
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,790
ideas
that leads to a dictator and that leads

5068
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:34,800
that leads to a dictator and that leads
 

5069
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,390
that leads to a dictator and that leads
to atrocities

5070
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:36,400
to atrocities
 

5071
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,149
to atrocities
there's something about the mechanism

5072
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:38,159
there's something about the mechanism
 

5073
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,550
there's something about the mechanism
the bureaucracy that's built that leads

5074
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:40,560
the bureaucracy that's built that leads
 

5075
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,110
the bureaucracy that's built that leads
to

5076
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:43,120

 

5077
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,149

a human being that's able to

5078
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:46,159
a human being that's able to
 

5079
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,830
a human being that's able to
attain

5080
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:47,840
attain
 

5081
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,270
attain
integrate

5082
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:49,280
integrate
 

5083
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,229
integrate
uh absolute power and then start abusing

5084
01:26:52,229 --> 01:26:52,239
uh absolute power and then start abusing
 

5085
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,470
uh absolute power and then start abusing
that power all that kind of stuff like

5086
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:54,480
that power all that kind of stuff like
 

5087
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,270
that power all that kind of stuff like
some of the history of the 20th century

5088
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
some of the history of the 20th century
 

5089
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,390
some of the history of the 20th century
is that

5090
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:58,400
is that
 

5091
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,550
is that
inextricably connected to the ideas of

5092
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:00,560
inextricably connected to the ideas of
 

5093
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,470
inextricably connected to the ideas of
karl marx i think to some extent it is

5094
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:02,480
karl marx i think to some extent it is
 

5095
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,470
karl marx i think to some extent it is
but i'm going to also say that if it

5096
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:04,480
but i'm going to also say that if it
 

5097
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,310
but i'm going to also say that if it
hadn't been for the bolsheviks

5098
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:06,320
hadn't been for the bolsheviks
 

5099
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,310
hadn't been for the bolsheviks
interpreting marx and saying we can

5100
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:08,320
interpreting marx and saying we can
 

5101
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,830
interpreting marx and saying we can
reach socialism without going through

5102
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:09,840
reach socialism without going through
 

5103
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,189
reach socialism without going through
capitalism

5104
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:11,199
capitalism
 

5105
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,030
capitalism
then

5106
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:13,040
then
 

5107
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,189
then
it might not have happened

5108
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:15,199
it might not have happened
 

5109
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:16,229
it might not have happened
so if you look at the like the

5110
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:16,239
so if you look at the like the
 

5111
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:19,270
so if you look at the like the
mensheviks were a rival

5112
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:19,280
mensheviks were a rival
 

5113
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,750
mensheviks were a rival

developed
a analysis of capitalism based on

5128
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:35,920
a analysis of capitalism based on
 

5129
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,149
a analysis of capitalism based on
financial instability

5130

01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,350
way i said something about karl marx and
wood karl marx anyway we got there yeah

5458
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:29,360
wood karl marx anyway we got there yeah
 

5459
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,669
wood karl marx anyway we got there yeah
we got there but now we return but back

5460
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:31,679
we got there but now we return but back
 

5461
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,830
we got there but now we return but back
to marx i think it's not the destination

5462
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:33,840
to marx i think it's not the destination
 

5463
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,189
to marx i think it's not the destination
i think mark's

5464
01:33:35,189 --> 01:33:35,199
i think mark's
 

5465
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:37,990
i think mark's
the failure of of socialism with diana's

5466
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,000
the failure of of socialism with diana's
 

5467
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,550
the failure of of socialism with diana's
corner captured beautifully this idea of

5468
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:40,560
corner captured beautifully this idea of
 

5469
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,229
corner captured beautifully this idea of
what he called demand constrained versus

5470
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,239
what he called demand constrained versus
 

5471
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,310
what he called demand constrained versus
resource-constrained economies

5472
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:44,320
resource-constrained economies
 

5473
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,510
resource-constrained economies
and

5474
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:45,520
and
 

5475
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,229
and
capitalism is demand constrained okay

5476
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:48,239
capitalism is demand constrained okay
 

5477
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:49,910
capitalism is demand constrained okay
and and this is again where neoclassical

5478
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:49,920
and and this is again where neoclassical
 

5479
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,910
and and this is again where neoclassical
theory is completely wrong empirically

5480
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:51,920
theory is completely wrong empirically
 

5481
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,149
theory is completely wrong empirically
completely wrong so the neoclassicals

5482
01:33:54,149 --> 01:33:54,159
completely wrong so the neoclassicals
 

5483
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:56,070
completely wrong so the neoclassicals
have a vision of capitalism being

5484
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:56,080
have a vision of capitalism being
 

5485
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,990
have a vision of capitalism being
resource constrained and it's about

5486
01:33:57,990 --> 01:33:58,000
resource constrained and it's about
 

5487
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,709
resource constrained and it's about
maximizing your usage of resources

5488
01:34:00,709 --> 01:34:00,719
maximizing your usage of resources
 

5489
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,110
maximizing your usage of resources
subject to constraints and as corn i

5490
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:03,120
subject to constraints and as corn i
 

5491
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,229
subject to constraints and as corn i
said that's really what happened unto

5492
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:04,239
said that's really what happened unto
 

5493
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:06,870
said that's really what happened unto
socialism what happens under capitalism

5494
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:06,880
socialism what happens under capitalism
 

5495
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,709
socialism what happens under capitalism
is that you have

5496
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:08,719
is that you have
 

5497
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,470
is that you have
15 20 companies producing automobiles

5498
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:12,480
15 20 companies producing automobiles
 

5499
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,990
15 20 companies producing automobiles
they are all trying to capture as much

5500
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:14,000
they are all trying to capture as much
 

5501
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,910
they are all trying to capture as much
of the market as they can if you add up

5502
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:15,920
of the market as they can if you add up
 

5503
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,110
of the market as they can if you add up
their marketing plans you're going to

5504
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:17,120
their marketing plans you're going to
 

5505
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,550
their marketing plans you're going to
get 120 130 percent of the actual market

5506
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:20,560
get 120 130 percent of the actual market
 

5507
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,750
get 120 130 percent of the actual market
so they're all going to have excess

5508
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:21,760
so they're all going to have excess
 

5509
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,149
so they're all going to have excess
capacity when you build a factory you're

5510
01:34:24,149 --> 01:34:24,159
capacity when you build a factory you're
 

5511
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:25,830
capacity when you build a factory you're
building it with a plan for it to exist

5512
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:25,840
building it with a plan for it to exist
 

5513
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,229
building it with a plan for it to exist
for 5 10 15 years you have to have

5514
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:28,239
for 5 10 15 years you have to have
 

5515
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:30,550
for 5 10 15 years you have to have
excess capacity in the factory so that

5516
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:30,560
excess capacity in the factory so that
 

5517
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,709
excess capacity in the factory so that
means that capitalism has a far greater

5518
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:32,719
means that capitalism has a far greater
 

5519
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:34,390
means that capitalism has a far greater
productive capacity than it actually

5520
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:34,400
productive capacity than it actually
 

5521
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,790
productive capacity than it actually
uses and then the way that you manage to

5522
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:36,800
uses and then the way that you manage to
 

5523
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,790
uses and then the way that you manage to
get demands into your factory is to

5524
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:38,800
get demands into your factory is to
 

5525
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,629
get demands into your factory is to
innovate and produce something nobody

5526
01:34:40,629 --> 01:34:40,639
innovate and produce something nobody
 

5527
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:43,109
innovate and produce something nobody
else does or you're producing in volume

5528
01:34:43,109 --> 01:34:43,119
else does or you're producing in volume
 

5529
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:44,870
else does or you're producing in volume
and when somebody produces like a bung

5530
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:44,880
and when somebody produces like a bung
 

5531
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,270
and when somebody produces like a bung
tire comes out of firestone then

5532
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
tire comes out of firestone then
 

5533
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,709
tire comes out of firestone then
goodyear is ready to expand its

5534
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:48,719
goodyear is ready to expand its
 

5535
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:50,870
goodyear is ready to expand its
production and take advantage of that so

5536
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:50,880
production and take advantage of that so
 

5537
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,229
production and take advantage of that so
that's that's the actual nature of

5538
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:52,239
that's that's the actual nature of
 

5539
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:54,709
that's that's the actual nature of
competition in capitalism and that means

5540
01:34:54,709 --> 01:34:54,719
competition in capitalism and that means
 

5541
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,189
competition in capitalism and that means
that we get a cornucopia as of goods

5542
01:34:57,189 --> 01:34:57,199
that we get a cornucopia as of goods
 

5543
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,669
that we get a cornucopia as of goods
even if we're lowly workers the variety

5544
01:34:59,669 --> 01:34:59,679
even if we're lowly workers the variety
 

5545
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,229
even if we're lowly workers the variety
of goods and capitalism is overwhelming

5546
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:02,239
of goods and capitalism is overwhelming
 

5547
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,229
of goods and capitalism is overwhelming
and and that's just doesn't happen in

5548
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
and and that's just doesn't happen in
 

5549
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:06,870
and and that's just doesn't happen in
socialism you get your 1942 cost stack

5550
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:06,880
socialism you get your 1942 cost stack
 

5551
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,189
socialism you get your 1942 cost stack
as your motorbike that's it when you put

5552
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:09,199
as your motorbike that's it when you put
 

5553
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,709
as your motorbike that's it when you put
your money down to buy a refrigerator

5554
01:35:10,709 --> 01:35:10,719
your money down to buy a refrigerator
 

5555
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:12,790
your money down to buy a refrigerator
it'll arrive in 10 years

5556
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:12,800
it'll arrive in 10 years
 

5557
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,149
it'll arrive in 10 years
because the factory's already fully

5558
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:14,159
because the factory's already fully
 

5559
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,350
because the factory's already fully
constrained

5560
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:15,360
constrained
 

5561
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,830
constrained
so all these resource constraints mean

5562
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:17,840
so all these resource constraints mean
 

5563
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,669
so all these resource constraints mean
that people aren't happy

5564
01:35:19,669 --> 01:35:19,679
that people aren't happy
 

5565
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:21,189
that people aren't happy
under socialism

5566
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:21,199
under socialism
 

5567
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,310
under socialism
and if you've got a whole bunch of

5568
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:22,320
and if you've got a whole bunch of
 

5569
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,669
and if you've got a whole bunch of
people

5570
01:35:23,669 --> 01:35:23,679
people
 

5571
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:25,350
people
that aren't happy

5572
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:25,360
that aren't happy
 

5573
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,950
that aren't happy
then the best way to control them is to

5574
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:26,960
then the best way to control them is to
 

5575
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,709
then the best way to control them is to
suppress them

5576
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:28,719
suppress them
 

5577
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:30,629
suppress them
so i think in that sense ultimately yes

5578
01:35:30,629 --> 01:35:30,639
so i think in that sense ultimately yes
 

5579
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,750
so i think in that sense ultimately yes
it does lead to something like stalinism

5580
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:33,760
it does lead to something like stalinism
 

5581
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,750
it does lead to something like stalinism
so it's easier to give happy people

5582
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:35,760
so it's easier to give happy people
 

5583
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,510
so it's easier to give happy people
freedom

5584
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:37,520
freedom
 

5585
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,790
freedom
yeah i mean happy people get pretty

5586
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:38,800
yeah i mean happy people get pretty
 

5587
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,189
yeah i mean happy people get pretty
silly outside i'm not particularly the

01:35:41,189 --> 01:35:41,199
silly outside i'm not particularly the
 

5589
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:42,709
silly outside i'm not particularly the
extent to which americans overused and

5590
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
extent to which americans overused and
 

5591
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:45,109
extent to which americans overused and
distort the word freedom drives me by me

5592
01:35:45,109 --> 01:35:45,119
distort the word freedom drives me by me
 

5593
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:47,430
distort the word freedom drives me by me
um well but you know

5594
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:47,440
um well but you know
 

5595
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,030
um well but you know
all of these words can be distorted but

5596
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:49,040
all of these words can be distorted but
 

5597
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,910
all of these words can be distorted but
they all at the core have some

5598
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:51,920
they all at the core have some
 

5599
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,830
they all at the core have some
fundamental power and beauty and then we

5600
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:53,840
fundamental power and beauty and then we
 

5601
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,229
fundamental power and beauty and then we
just distort on the surface for the fun

5602
01:35:56,229 --> 01:35:56,239
just distort on the surface for the fun
 

5603
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:58,070
just distort on the surface for the fun
of it yeah just start battles on twitter

5604
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,080
of it yeah just start battles on twitter
 

5605
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,149
of it yeah just start battles on twitter
and so on but what citizens of the

5606
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:00,159
and so on but what citizens of the
 

5607
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:02,310
and so on but what citizens of the
soviet world didn't feel was freedom

5608
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:02,320
soviet world didn't feel was freedom
 

5609
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,990
soviet world didn't feel was freedom
yeah not just in first of all it wasn't

5610
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:04,000
yeah not just in first of all it wasn't
 

5611
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,310
yeah not just in first of all it wasn't
freedom to buy commodities the

5612
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:06,320
freedom to buy commodities the
 

5613
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,590
freedom to buy commodities the
commodities are supposed to be on the

and that meant that you had this that's
 

5959
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:02,470
and that meant that you had this that's
where all the you know chinese

01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:07,669
so they were building a capitalist
system

5966
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:07,679
system
 

5967
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:09,990
system
within a socialist command political

5968
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:10,000
within a socialist command political
 

5969
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,030
within a socialist command political
system

5970
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:11,040
system
 

5971
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,790
system
and that worked

5972
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:12,800
and that worked
 

5973
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,870
and that worked
and it's still working so there was the

5974
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:14,880
and it's still working so there was the

01:52:58,870 --> 01:52:58,880
under the
 

6577
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:02,149
under the
early period of the late period of mao

6578
01:53:02,149 --> 01:53:02,159
early period of the late period of mao
 

6579
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:03,669
early period of the late period of mao
and god almighty that changed the

6580
01:53:03,669 --> 01:53:03,679
and god almighty that changed the
 

6581
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,350
and god almighty that changed the
improvement they've seen in their lives

6582
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:05,360
improvement they've seen in their lives
 

6583
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:07,030
improvement they've seen in their lives
that's what they think about

6584
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:07,040
that's what they think about
 

6585
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,189
that's what they think about
so but it's the

6586
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:09,199
so but it's the
 

6587
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:11,270
so but it's the
if you just look at the history of the

6588
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:11,280
if you just look at the history of the
 

6589
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:12,790
if you just look at the history of the
20th century

6590
01:53:12,790 --> 01:53:12,800
20th century
 

6591
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,790
20th century
your intuition would say that some of

6592
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:14,800
your intuition would say that some of
 

6593
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,189
your intuition would say that some of
the mechanisms we see in china now will

6594
01:53:17,189 --> 01:53:17,199
the mechanisms we see in china now will
 

6595
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,510
the mechanisms we see in china now will
get you into trouble in the long term

6596
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:19,520
get you into trouble in the long term
 

6597
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,310
get you into trouble in the long term
so

6598
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:20,320
so
 

6599
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,790
so
it seems to be working really well in

6600
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
it seems to be working really well in
 

6601
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,109
it seems to be working really well in
many ways in terms of improving the

6602
01:53:25,109 --> 01:53:25,119
many ways in terms of improving the
 

6603
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:27,030
many ways in terms of improving the
quality of life of the average citizen

6604
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:27,040
quality of life of the average citizen
 

6605
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,149
quality of life of the average citizen
in china

6606
01:53:28,149 --> 01:53:28,159
in china
 

6607
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:29,910
in china
but you start to get worried about how

6608
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:29,920
but you start to get worried about how
 

6609
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,149
but you start to get worried about how
does this go wrong well yeah but at the

6610
01:53:32,149 --> 01:53:32,159
does this go wrong well yeah but at the
 

6611
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:34,470
does this go wrong well yeah but at the
same time maybe i mean often people will

6612
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:34,480
same time maybe i mean often people will
 

6613
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:35,750
same time maybe i mean often people will
say you know what's your vision for the

6614
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:35,760
say you know what's your vision for the
 

6615
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,229
say you know what's your vision for the
future and what they mean is what vision

6616
01:53:38,229 --> 01:53:38,239
future and what they mean is what vision
 

6617
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:39,430
future and what they mean is what vision
for the future do you have that i'm

6618
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:39,440
for the future do you have that i'm
 

6619
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,950
for the future do you have that i'm
gonna like

6620
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:40,960
gonna like
 

6621
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,870
gonna like
right okay now

6622
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:42,880
right okay now
 

6623
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,229
right okay now
what if you have a vision of the future

6624
01:53:44,229 --> 01:53:44,239
what if you have a vision of the future
 

6625
01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:47,189
what if you have a vision of the future
you don't like it's dreadful

6626
01:53:47,189 --> 01:53:47,199
you don't like it's dreadful
 

6627
01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:49,910
you don't like it's dreadful
well that's the ecological crisis i

6628
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:49,920
well that's the ecological crisis i
 

6629
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,750
well that's the ecological crisis i
think we're walking blindfolded into

6630
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:51,760
think we're walking blindfolded into
 

6631
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,189
think we're walking blindfolded into
well that's

6632
01:53:53,189 --> 01:53:53,199
well that's
 

6633
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:55,109
well that's
uh right that that that part of the

6634
01:53:55,109 --> 01:53:55,119
uh right that that that part of the
 

6635
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:56,709
uh right that that that part of the
picture we'll have to we'll have to talk

6636
01:53:56,709 --> 01:53:56,719
picture we'll have to we'll have to talk
 

6637
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:59,109
picture we'll have to we'll have to talk
about yeah how fundamental of a problem

6638
01:53:59,109 --> 01:53:59,119
about yeah how fundamental of a problem
 

6639
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:01,430
about yeah how fundamental of a problem
that is okay but what does that have to

6640
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:01,440
that is okay but what does that have to
 

6641
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,030
that is okay but what does that have to
do with the future of china that has to

6642
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:03,040
do with the future of china that has to
 

6643
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,790
do with the future of china that has to
do is that if you wish to impose

6644
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:04,800
do is that if you wish to impose
 

6645
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,470
do is that if you wish to impose
dramatic controls on the consumption of

6646
01:54:06,470 --> 01:54:06,480
dramatic controls on the consumption of
 

6647
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:07,669
dramatic controls on the consumption of
the rich

6648
01:54:07,669 --> 01:54:07,679
the rich
 

6649
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:10,229
the rich
which would be necessary to reduce our

6650
01:54:10,229 --> 01:54:10,239
which would be necessary to reduce our
 

6651
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:13,109
which would be necessary to reduce our
consumption burden so that we can get

6652
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:13,119
consumption burden so that we can get
 

6653
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:15,750
consumption burden so that we can get
closer to the ecological envelope we've

6654
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:15,760
closer to the ecological envelope we've
 

6655
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,669
closer to the ecological envelope we've
destroyed already

6656
01:54:17,669 --> 01:54:17,679
destroyed already
 

6657
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:19,030
destroyed already
then you're going to be more likely

6658
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:19,040
then you're going to be more likely
 

6659
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:20,550
then you're going to be more likely
successful doing that with a centralized

6660
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:20,560
successful doing that with a centralized
 

6661
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:23,270
successful doing that with a centralized
system where people accept centralized

6662
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:23,280
system where people accept centralized
 

6663
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,870
system where people accept centralized
political control

6664
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:24,880
political control
 

6665
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,310
political control
then you are in a country where it's all

6666
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:26,320
then you are in a country where it's all
 

6667
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,709
then you are in a country where it's all
diversified and you scream freedom every

6668
01:54:28,709 --> 01:54:28,719
diversified and you scream freedom every
 

6669
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:30,310
diversified and you scream freedom every
between every point in a tennis match

6670
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:30,320
between every point in a tennis match
 

6671
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,149
between every point in a tennis match
and i'm i've literally seen that when i

6672
01:54:32,149 --> 01:54:32,159
and i'm i've literally seen that when i
 

6673
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:35,109
and i'm i've literally seen that when i
was in philadelphia some time back

6674
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,119
was in philadelphia some time back
 

6675
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:37,669
was in philadelphia some time back
so the ideology that accepts a

6676
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:37,679
so the ideology that accepts a
 

6677
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:39,669
so the ideology that accepts a
collectivist attitude

6678
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:39,679
collectivist attitude
 

6679
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:41,910
collectivist attitude
may be more successful in controlling

6680
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:41,920
may be more successful in controlling
 

6681
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,790
may be more successful in controlling
our reducing human consumption levels

6682
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:44,800
our reducing human consumption levels
 

6683
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,709
our reducing human consumption levels
because when we talk about democracy i

6684
01:54:46,709 --> 01:54:46,719
because when we talk about democracy i
 

6685
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:48,229
because when we talk about democracy i
mean

6686
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:48,239
mean
 

6687
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:51,589
mean
who's voting here how many horses and

6688
01:54:51,589 --> 01:54:51,599
who's voting here how many horses and
 

6689
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,750
who's voting here how many horses and
elephants and

6690
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:53,760
elephants and
 

6691
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:57,030
elephants and
birds get to vote okay it's very what's

6692
01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:57,040
birds get to vote okay it's very what's
 

6693
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,270
birds get to vote okay it's very what's
a bird yeah

6694
01:54:59,270 --> 01:54:59,280
a bird yeah
 

6695
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,189
a bird yeah
you don't see them around here uh it's a

6696
01:55:01,189 --> 01:55:01,199
you don't see them around here uh it's a
 

6697
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:02,950
you don't see them around here uh it's a
very human-centric vision we have of

6698
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:02,960
very human-centric vision we have of
 

6699
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,350
very human-centric vision we have of
this planet yeah and

6700
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:05,360
this planet yeah and
 

6701
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,589
this planet yeah and
we're going to pay a price for that

6702
01:55:07,589 --> 01:55:07,599
we're going to pay a price for that
 

6703
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:09,910
we're going to pay a price for that
okay so you're saying to deal with

6704
01:55:09,910 --> 01:55:09,920
okay so you're saying to deal with
 

6705
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:12,470
okay so you're saying to deal with
global catastrophic events

6706
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:12,480
global catastrophic events
 

6707
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:14,709
global catastrophic events
centralized planning might be maybe

6708
01:55:14,709 --> 01:55:14,719
centralized planning might be maybe
 

6709
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:17,189
centralized planning might be maybe
i think will work better period i mean i

6710
01:55:17,189 --> 01:55:17,199
i think will work better period i mean i
 

6711
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:19,270
i think will work better period i mean i
like but again but but there's some

6712
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:19,280
like but again but but there's some
 

6713
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,709
like but again but but there's some
centralized

6714
01:55:20,709 --> 01:55:20,719
centralized
 

6715
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:22,310
centralized
stuff in the united states for example

6716
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:22,320
stuff in the united states for example
 

6717
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,870
stuff in the united states for example
your military yeah i know no no okay all

6718
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:24,880
your military yeah i know no no okay all
 

6719
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,310
your military yeah i know no no okay all
right

6720
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:26,320
right
 

6721
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,550
right
now is that now there's that feisty

6722
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:28,560
now is that now there's that feisty
 

6723
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,390
now is that now there's that feisty
australian yeah

6724
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:30,400
australian yeah
 

6725
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,790
australian yeah
uh so besides the military there is

6726
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:32,800
uh so besides the military there is
 

6727
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,149
uh so besides the military there is
that's the idea of the federal

6728
01:55:34,149 --> 01:55:34,159
that's the idea of the federal
 

6729
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:36,070
that's the idea of the federal
government in the united states is that

6730
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:36,080
government in the united states is that
 

6731
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:39,189
government in the united states is that
there is some centralized uh

6732
01:55:39,189 --> 01:55:39,199
there is some centralized uh
 

6733
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:41,030
there is some centralized uh
infrastructure building there's some big

6734
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:41,040
infrastructure building there's some big
 

6735
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:42,950
infrastructure building there's some big
there's not enough projects yeah

6736
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:42,960
there's not enough projects yeah
 

6737
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,830
there's not enough projects yeah
but there's some so the question is when

6738
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:45,840
but there's some so the question is when
 

6739
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,830
but there's some so the question is when
you deal with greater and greater global

6740
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:47,840
you deal with greater and greater global
 

6741
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,910
you deal with greater and greater global
catastrophic events

6742
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:49,920
catastrophic events
 

6743
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,669
catastrophic events
like the pandemic that we're just living

6744
01:55:51,669 --> 01:55:51,679
like the pandemic that we're just living
 

6745
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:52,790
like the pandemic that we're just living
through that the government would be

6746
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:52,800
through that the government would be
 

6747
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,550
through that the government would be
able to step up

6748
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:54,560
able to step up
 

6749
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:57,589
able to step up
and impose enough centralized planning

6750
01:55:57,589 --> 01:55:57,599
and impose enough centralized planning
 

6751
01:55:57,599 --> 01:55:59,589
and impose enough centralized planning
to allow us to deal

6752
01:55:59,589 --> 01:55:59,599
to allow us to deal
 

6753
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:02,310
to allow us to deal
sort of enable empower the citizenry to

they failed but the ideal is that would

6784
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360
they failed but the ideal is that would
 

6785
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,950
they failed but the ideal is that would
be able to succeed you would have to

6786
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:34,960
be able to succeed you would have to
 

6787
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:36,149
be able to succeed you would have to
have a small

6788
01:56:36,149 --> 01:56:36,159
have a small
 

6789
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:38,390
have a small
efficient the ideal the american ideal

6790
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:38,400
efficient the ideal the american ideal
 

6791
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,070
efficient the ideal the american ideal
is you have a small efficient government

6792
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:40,080
is you have a small efficient government
 

6793
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,709
is you have a small efficient government
that's able to take on tasks precisely

6794
01:56:42,709 --> 01:56:42,719
that's able to take on tasks precisely
 

6795
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:44,550
that's able to take on tasks precisely
like the pandemic but the thing is maybe

6796
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:44,560
like the pandemic but the thing is maybe
 

6797
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:45,830
like the pandemic but the thing is maybe
it shouldn't have been as small as it

6798
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:45,840
it shouldn't have been as small as it
 

6799
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,070
it shouldn't have been as small as it
was i mean my favorite instance of that

6800
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:48,080
was i mean my favorite instance of that
 

6801
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,229
was i mean my favorite instance of that
actually involves the uk because the

6802
01:56:50,229 --> 01:56:50,239
actually involves the uk because the
 

6803
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,149
actually involves the uk because the
whole neoliberal approach is about a

6804
01:56:52,149 --> 01:56:52,159
whole neoliberal approach is about a
 

6805
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:54,229
whole neoliberal approach is about a
small efficient government okay well

6806
01:56:54,229 --> 01:56:54,239
small efficient government okay well
 

6807
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:56,070
small efficient government okay well
small efficient government works when

6808
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:56,080
small efficient government works when
 

6809
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,310
small efficient government works when
you face small efficient challenges

6810
01:56:58,310 --> 01:56:58,320
you face small efficient challenges
 

6811
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,709
you face small efficient challenges
when you face something systemic

6812
01:57:00,709 --> 01:57:00,719
when you face something systemic
 

6813
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:02,550
when you face something systemic
rather than episodic then it's going to

6814
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:02,560
rather than episodic then it's going to
 

6815
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,790
rather than episodic then it's going to
break down and like this is i mean one

6816
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:04,800
break down and like this is i mean one
 

6817
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,709
break down and like this is i mean one
of the things i greatly respect is

6818
01:57:06,709 --> 01:57:06,719
of the things i greatly respect is
 

6819
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,109
of the things i greatly respect is
taleb's idea of anti-fragile you want a

6820
01:57:09,109 --> 01:57:09,119
taleb's idea of anti-fragile you want a
 

6821
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:10,950
taleb's idea of anti-fragile you want a
society which is anti-fragile not easily

6822
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:10,960
society which is anti-fragile not easily
 

6823
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,189
society which is anti-fragile not easily
broken whereas neoliberalism has pushed

6824
01:57:13,189 --> 01:57:13,199
broken whereas neoliberalism has pushed
 

6825
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:14,790
broken whereas neoliberalism has pushed
us towards this vision of efficiency but

6826
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:14,800
us towards this vision of efficiency but
 

6827
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,990
us towards this vision of efficiency but
it's easily snapped like in the uk

6828
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:18,000
it's easily snapped like in the uk
 

6829
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,350
it's easily snapped like in the uk
i've forgotten the government minister

involved but she was
 

6833
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,470
involved but she was
she asked her expert committee how many

6834
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:24,480
she asked her expert committee how many
 

6835
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,470
she asked her expert committee how many
this is before well before the pandemic

6836
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:26,480
this is before well before the pandemic
 

6837
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:29,430
this is before well before the pandemic
how many masks should we have on hand in

6838

how many masks should we have on hand in
 

6839
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,589
how many masks should we have on hand in
case of a pandemic and the answer from

6840
01:57:31,589 --> 01:57:31,599
case of a pandemic and the answer from
 

6841
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:34,310
case of a pandemic and the answer from
the experts was about a billion

6842
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:34,320
the experts was about a billion
 

6843
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,109
the experts was about a billion
okay that's 50 masks that's 20 masks per

6844
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119
okay that's 50 masks that's 20 masks per
 

6845

okay that's 50 masks that's 20 masks per
person okay oh that's too many let's

6846

person okay oh that's too many let's
 

6847
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,070
person okay oh that's too many let's
just make 50 million masks

6848
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:42,080
just make 50 million masks
 

6849
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,990
just make 50 million masks
that's one mask per person it was gone

6850
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:44,000
that's one mask per person it was gone
 

6851
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,709
that's one mask per person it was gone
in a matter of a day okay and therefore

6852
01:57:46,709 --> 01:57:46,719
in a matter of a day okay and therefore
 

6853
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:48,310
in a matter of a day okay and therefore
that's why they told us well masks don't

6854
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:48,320
that's why they told us well masks don't
 

6855

work you know what they meant was we
 

6857
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,149
work you know what they meant was we
don't have enough masks for our health

6858
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:52,159
don't have enough masks for our health
 

6859
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:54,229
don't have enough masks for our health
people let alone for you and the public

6860

people let alone for you and the public
 

6861
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:55,750
people let alone for you and the public
so we're going to [\h__\h] you until

6862
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:55,760
so we're going to [\h__\h] you until
 

6863
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,830
so we're going to [\h__\h] you until
those masks don't really work

6864
01:57:57,830 --> 01:57:57,840
those masks don't really work
 

6865
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,589
those masks don't really work
and then people don't wear masks and

6866
01:57:59,589 --> 01:57:59,599
and then people don't wear masks and
 

6867
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:01,189
and then people don't wear masks and
then we've got enough masks we rush up

6868
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:01,199
then we've got enough masks we rush up
 

6869
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,109
then we've got enough masks we rush up
the production job and by the time it

6870
01:58:03,109 --> 01:58:03,119
the production job and by the time it
 

6871
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:04,229
the production job and by the time it
comes along people have got the

6872
01:58:04,229 --> 01:58:04,239
comes along people have got the
 

6873
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:06,550
comes along people have got the
skepticism about masks so who does the

6874
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:06,560
skepticism about masks so who does the
 

6875
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:09,030
skepticism about masks so who does the
uh can you elaborate who does the blame

6876
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:09,040
uh can you elaborate who does the blame
 

6877
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,790
uh can you elaborate who does the blame
in that case go on the blame comes down

6878
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:10,800
in that case go on the blame comes down
 

6879
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:12,149
in that case go on the blame comes down
to the philosophy that says government

6880
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:12,159
to the philosophy that says government
 

6881
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:14,149
to the philosophy that says government
should always be small

6882
01:58:14,149 --> 01:58:14,159
should always be small
 

6883
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:16,149
should always be small
no but do you do you really think that

6884
01:58:16,149 --> 01:58:16,159
no but do you do you really think that
 

6885
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,669
no but do you do you really think that
bigger government would be the solution

6886
01:58:17,669 --> 01:58:17,679
bigger government would be the solution
 

6887
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:19,830
bigger government would be the solution
to the mask issues so let me let me push

6888
01:58:19,830 --> 01:58:19,840
to the mask issues so let me let me push
 

6889
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:21,669
to the mask issues so let me let me push
back sort of it's possible that

6890
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:21,679
back sort of it's possible that
 

6891
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:23,669
back sort of it's possible that
that that's capitalism solves that

6892
01:58:23,669 --> 01:58:23,679
that that's capitalism solves that
 

6893
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:24,870
that that's capitalism solves that
problem

6894
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:24,880
problem
 

6895
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:27,750
problem
well that's not if there's no money in

6896
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:27,760
well that's not if there's no money in
 

6897
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:31,030
well that's not if there's no money in
really long-term planning and capitalism

6898
01:58:31,030 --> 01:58:31,040
really long-term planning and capitalism
 

6899
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:34,470
really long-term planning and capitalism
okay there's money there's money in

6900
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:34,480

 

6901
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,709

isn't it possible to construct isn't

6902
01:58:36,709 --> 01:58:36,719
isn't it possible to construct isn't
 

6903
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:38,870
isn't it possible to construct isn't
possible for capitalism to construct the

6904
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:38,880
possible for capitalism to construct the
 

6905
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,070
possible for capitalism to construct the
system

6906
01:58:40,070 --> 01:58:40,080
system
 

6907
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,550
system
that insures against catastrophic events

6908
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:42,560
that insures against catastrophic events
 

6909
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:44,709
that insures against catastrophic events
not when they're systemic okay the

6910
01:58:44,709 --> 01:58:44,719
not when they're systemic okay the
 

6911
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:46,470
not when they're systemic okay the
capital you can insure against episodic

6912
01:58:46,470 --> 01:58:46,480
capital you can insure against episodic
 

6913
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,709
capital you can insure against episodic
events if you occasionally have a really

6914
01:58:48,709 --> 01:58:48,719
events if you occasionally have a really
 

6915
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:51,510
events if you occasionally have a really
bad storm but in general the weather's

6916
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:51,520
bad storm but in general the weather's
 

6917
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,109
bad storm but in general the weather's
not so bad that all the infrastructure

6918
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:53,119
not so bad that all the infrastructure
 

6919
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:55,109
not so bad that all the infrastructure
is being destroyed then you can share

6920
01:58:55,109 --> 01:58:55,119
is being destroyed then you can share
 

6921
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:56,950
is being destroyed then you can share
that around on a percentage basis if you

6922
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:56,960
that around on a percentage basis if you
 

6923
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:59,270
that around on a percentage basis if you
have a gaussian distribution for your

6924
01:58:59,270 --> 01:58:59,280
have a gaussian distribution for your
 

6925
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,270
have a gaussian distribution for your
events and you can and you don't the

6926
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:01,280
events and you can and you don't the
 

6927
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,430
events and you can and you don't the
mean doesn't move around too much and

6928
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:03,440
mean doesn't move around too much and
 

6929
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,030
mean doesn't move around too much and
the standard deviation doesn't change

6930
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:05,040
the standard deviation doesn't change
 

6931
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:07,430
the standard deviation doesn't change
all that much then insurance works fine

6932
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:07,440
all that much then insurance works fine
 

6933
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:09,589
all that much then insurance works fine
but if you have an if that's episodic if

6934
01:59:09,589 --> 01:59:09,599
but if you have an if that's episodic if
 

6935
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:10,950
but if you have an if that's episodic if
you have systemic stuff where the

6936
01:59:10,950 --> 01:59:10,960
you have systemic stuff where the
 

6937
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,030
you have systemic stuff where the
climate is changing completely and

6938
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:13,040
climate is changing completely and
 

6939
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,229
climate is changing completely and
you're going to wipe out your

6940
01:59:14,229 --> 01:59:14,239
you're going to wipe out your
 

6941
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:17,589
you're going to wipe out your
agricultural cap capabilities uh

6942
01:59:17,589 --> 01:59:17,599
agricultural cap capabilities uh
 

6943
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:19,430
agricultural cap capabilities uh
you simply can't do insurance on that

6944
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:19,440
you simply can't do insurance on that
 

6945
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:21,189
you simply can't do insurance on that
front you you can't make a profit out of

6946
01:59:21,189 --> 01:59:21,199
front you you can't make a profit out of
 

6947
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:23,750
front you you can't make a profit out of
catastrophe and capitalism

6948
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:23,760
catastrophe and capitalism
 

6949
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:27,589
catastrophe and capitalism
okay that's so that example of um

6950
01:59:27,589 --> 01:59:27,599
okay that's so that example of um
 

6951
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:30,470
okay that's so that example of um
climate change let's talk about it okay

6952
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:30,480
climate change let's talk about it okay
 

6953
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:32,629
climate change let's talk about it okay
so you mentioned

6954
01:59:32,629 --> 01:59:32,639
so you mentioned
 

6955
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:35,270
so you mentioned
that the human brain the economy and the

6956
01:59:35,270 --> 01:59:35,280
that the human brain the economy and the
 

6957
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:36,629
that the human brain the economy and the
biosphere

6958
01:59:36,629 --> 01:59:36,639
biosphere
 

6959
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:38,709
biosphere
are three of the most complex systems we

6960
01:59:38,709 --> 01:59:38,719
are three of the most complex systems we
 

6961
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:40,229
are three of the most complex systems we
know

6962
01:59:40,229 --> 01:59:40,239
know
 

6963
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:41,589
know
okay

6964
01:59:41,589 --> 01:59:41,599
okay
 

6965
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:43,669
okay
and you also criticize

6966
01:59:43,669 --> 01:59:43,679
and you also criticize
 

6967
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,310
and you also criticize
the economics community for

6968
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:46,320
the economics community for
 

6969
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:49,830
the economics community for
looking at the effects of

6970
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:49,840
looking at the effects of
 

6971
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,270
looking at the effects of
climate change

6972
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:51,280
climate change
 

6973
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,350
climate change
when measured as you know the effect on

6974
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:53,360
when measured as you know the effect on
 

6975
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,750
when measured as you know the effect on
the gdp yep so

6976
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:55,760
the gdp yep so
 

6977
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:58,390
the gdp yep so
you're saying it's a catastrophic thing

6978
01:59:58,390 --> 01:59:58,400
you're saying it's a catastrophic thing
 

6979
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,189
you're saying it's a catastrophic thing
that the biggest challenge our society

6980
02:00:01,189 --> 02:00:01,199
that the biggest challenge our society
 

6981
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:03,030
that the biggest challenge our society
our world is facing

6982
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:03,040
our world is facing
 

6983
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:05,270
our world is facing
why if the the economists disagree with

6984
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:05,280
why if the the economists disagree with
 

6985
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,750
why if the the economists disagree with
you the the effects on the gdp will be

6986
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:07,760
you the the effects on the gdp will be
 

6987
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:09,750
you the the effects on the gdp will be
minor

6988
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:09,760
minor
 

6989
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:10,629
minor
so

6990
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:10,639
so
 

6991
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:13,430
so
we'll deal with it when it comes mm-hmm

6992
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:13,440
we'll deal with it when it comes mm-hmm
 

6993
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:14,870
we'll deal with it when it comes mm-hmm
that's that's the argument against

6994
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:14,880
that's that's the argument against
 

6995
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:16,070
that's that's the argument against
that's the devil's advocate you're

6996
02:00:16,070 --> 02:00:16,080
that's the devil's advocate you're
 

6997
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:17,350
that's the devil's advocate you're
saying no

6998
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:17,360
saying no
 

6999
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:18,310
saying no
it is

7000
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:18,320
it is
 

7001
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:21,189
it is
uh a thing that will change our world

7002
02:00:21,189 --> 02:00:21,199
uh a thing that will change our world
 

7003
02:00:21,199 --> 02:00:22,229
uh a thing that will change our world
forever

7004
02:00:22,229 --> 02:00:22,239
forever
 

7005
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:23,830
forever
in ways that we should really really

7006
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:23,840
in ways that we should really really
 

7007
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,510
in ways that we should really really
really be thinking about

7008
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:25,520
really be thinking about
 

7009
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,430
really be thinking about
okay okay make the case the way you

7010
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:27,440
okay okay make the case the way you
 

7011
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:29,350
okay okay make the case the way you
disagree with the case is simple

7012
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:29,360
disagree with the case is simple

mining uh
government activities and the finance

7056
02:01:12,709 --> 02:01:12,719
government activities and the finance
 

7057
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:14,470
government activities and the finance
sector all they have in common is they

7058
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:14,480
sector all they have in common is they
 

7059
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,709
sector all they have in common is they
happen beneath me for roof

7060
02:01:16,709 --> 02:01:16,719
happen beneath me for roof
 

7061
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:18,550
happen beneath me for roof
so he's basically saying climate affects

7062
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:18,560
so he's basically saying climate affects
 

7063
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:21,270
so he's basically saying climate affects
the weather climate is weather okay

7064
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:21,280
the weather climate is weather okay
 

7065
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:22,950
the weather climate is weather okay
okay now

7066
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:22,960
okay now
 

7067
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,030
okay now
that is not at all what is meant by

7068
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:25,040
that is not at all what is meant by
 

7069
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:26,629
that is not at all what is meant by
climate change it's mean

7070
02:01:26,629 --> 02:01:26,639
climate change it's mean
 

7071
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:29,910
climate change it's mean
changing the entire pattern of the

02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:29,920
changing the entire pattern of the
 

7073
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:31,669
changing the entire pattern of the

planet for example the most extreme form
 

7077
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,990
planet for example the most extreme form
of climate change would be a breakdown

7078
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:36,000
of climate change would be a breakdown
 

7079
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,990
of climate change would be a breakdown
in the three circulation cells that

7080
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:38,000
in the three circulation cells that
 

7081
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,550
in the three circulation cells that
exist in each hemisphere the hadley cell

7082
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:40,560
exist in each hemisphere the hadley cell
 

7083
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:41,430

those are the main

7090
02:01:48,149 --> 02:01:48,159
those are the main
 

7091
02:01:48,159 --> 02:01:50,310
those are the main
bubbles if you like in the atmosphere

7092
02:01:50,310 --> 02:01:50,320
bubbles if you like in the atmosphere
 

7093
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:52,950
bubbles if you like in the atmosphere
now if we get enough increase in the

you turn the temperature up on a stove

7100
02:01:57,830 --> 02:01:57,840
you turn the temperature up on a stove
 

7101
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,910
you turn the temperature up on a stove
and you have nice bubbles occurring in a

7102
02:01:59,910 --> 02:01:59,920
and you have nice bubbles occurring in a
 

7103
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:01,350
and you have nice bubbles occurring in a
pot of soup and then turn the

7104
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:01,360
pot of soup and then turn the
 

7105
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,709
pot of soup and then turn the
temperature up and they all break down

7106
02:02:02,709 --> 02:02:02,719
temperature up and they all break down
 

7107
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:04,709
temperature up and they all break down
you've got bubbles everywhere

7108
02:02:04,709 --> 02:02:04,719
you've got bubbles everywhere
 

7109
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:06,550
you've got bubbles everywhere
that's called the equitable climate if

7110
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:06,560
that's called the equitable climate if
 

7111
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,310
that's called the equitable climate if
that happens

7112
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:08,320
that happens
 

7113
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:09,990
that happens
then most of the rainfall is going to

7114
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:10,000
then most of the rainfall is going to
 

7115
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:13,189
then most of the rainfall is going to
occur between 0 and 20 and 70 and 90 and

02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:13,199
occur between 0 and 20 and 70 and 90 and
 

7117
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:15,030
occur between 0 and 20 and 70 and 90 and
the middle is going to be dry except for

the middle is going to be dry except for
 

7119
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:17,030
the middle is going to be dry except for
extreme storms

extreme storms
we would we we built our societies in a

7122
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:20,639
we would we we built our societies in a
 

7123
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:23,109
we would we we built our societies in a
period of extreme stability of the

7124
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:23,119
period of extreme stability of the
 

7125
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:25,030
period of extreme stability of the
climate and when you look at the

7126
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:25,040
climate and when you look at the
 

7127
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:27,030
climate and when you look at the
long-term temperature records it's up

7128
02:02:27,030 --> 02:02:27,040
long-term temperature records it's up
 

7129
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:30,070
long-term temperature records it's up
and down like a you know like a seesaw i

7130
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:30,080
and down like a you know like a seesaw i
 

7131
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,709
and down like a you know like a seesaw i
saw a like a sawtooth blade between say

7132
02:02:32,709 --> 02:02:32,719
saw a like a sawtooth blade between say
 

7133
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:34,229
saw a like a sawtooth blade between say
one degree warmer than now and four

7134
02:02:34,229 --> 02:02:34,239
one degree warmer than now and four
 

7135
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:36,709
one degree warmer than now and four
degrees or six degrees cooler over the

7136
02:02:36,709 --> 02:02:36,719
degrees or six degrees cooler over the
 

7137
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:39,270
degrees or six degrees cooler over the
last million years and when you look at

7138
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:39,280
last million years and when you look at
 

7139
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,589
last million years and when you look at
where we evolved it's just at a turning

7140
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
where we evolved it's just at a turning
 

7141
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:43,910
where we evolved it's just at a turning
point on the peak of one of those ups

7142
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:43,920
point on the peak of one of those ups
 

7143
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,669
point on the peak of one of those ups
and downs so those i've forgotten the

7144
02:02:45,669 --> 02:02:45,679
and downs so those i've forgotten the
 

7145
02:02:45,679 --> 02:02:47,430
and downs so those i've forgotten the
name of the cycles but the cycles caused

7146
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:47,440
name of the cycles but the cycles caused
 

7147
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,430
name of the cycles but the cycles caused
by changes in the earth's rotation

7148
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,440
by changes in the earth's rotation
 

7149
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:52,229
by changes in the earth's rotation
around the sun uh and so

7150
02:02:52,229 --> 02:02:52,239
around the sun uh and so
 

7151
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:55,430
around the sun uh and so
we we evolved our civilization just at

7152
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:55,440
we we evolved our civilization just at
 

7153
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:56,390
we we evolved our civilization just at
the top

7154
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:56,400
the top
 

7155
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,830
the top
so coming up from a cold period and then

7156
02:02:59,830 --> 02:02:59,840
so coming up from a cold period and then
 

7157
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,270
so coming up from a cold period and then
we're going to head down to an another

7158
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:01,280
we're going to head down to an another
 

7159
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,189
we're going to head down to an another
cold period and that's when human

7160
02:03:03,189 --> 02:03:03,199
cold period and that's when human
 

7161
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:04,790
cold period and that's when human
civilization came along it's about a

7162
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:04,800
civilization came along it's about a
 

7163
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:07,270
civilization came along it's about a
period of about 12 000 years so across

7164
02:03:07,270 --> 02:03:07,280
period of about 12 000 years so across
 

7165
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:10,070
period of about 12 000 years so across
that period the temperature has changed

7166
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:10,080
that period the temperature has changed
 

7167
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:12,070
that period the temperature has changed
by not much more than half a degree up

7168
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:12,080
by not much more than half a degree up
 

7169
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:14,470
by not much more than half a degree up
and down now we're blasting it well and

7170
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:14,480
and down now we're blasting it well and
 

7171
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:16,629
and down now we're blasting it well and
truly out of those confines

7172
02:03:16,629 --> 02:03:16,639
truly out of those confines
 

7173
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:18,070
truly out of those confines
and

7174
02:03:18,070 --> 02:03:18,080
and
 

7175
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:20,310
and
my way of interpreting what

7176
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:20,320
my way of interpreting what
 

7177
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:22,149
my way of interpreting what
what climate change means is the

7178
02:03:22,149 --> 02:03:22,159
what climate change means is the
 

7179
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:24,070
what climate change means is the
stability of that climate that enables

7180
02:03:24,070 --> 02:03:24,080
stability of that climate that enables
 

7181
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:26,229
stability of that climate that enables
to build sedentary civilizations and not

7182
02:03:26,229 --> 02:03:26,239
to build sedentary civilizations and not
 

7183
02:03:26,239 --> 02:03:28,470
to build sedentary civilizations and not
be a nomadic species

7184
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:28,480
be a nomadic species
 

7185
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,990
be a nomadic species
is being destroyed

7186
02:03:29,990 --> 02:03:30,000
is being destroyed
 

7187
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:30,950
is being destroyed
so the

7188
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:30,960
so the
 

7189
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:33,669
so the
the challenge and by the way i'm

7190
02:03:33,669 --> 02:03:33,679
the challenge and by the way i'm
 

7191
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:36,390
the challenge and by the way i'm
playing devil's advocate

7192
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:36,400
playing devil's advocate
 

7193
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:37,270
playing devil's advocate
uh

7194
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:37,280
uh
 

7195
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:39,430
uh
the the question is is there something

7196
02:03:39,430 --> 02:03:39,440
the the question is is there something
 

7197
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,350
the the question is is there something
fundamentally different now about human

7198
02:03:41,350 --> 02:03:41,360
fundamentally different now about human
 

7199
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:45,030
fundamentally different now about human
civilization that we're able to

7200
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:45,040

 

7201
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:47,669

build technology

7202
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
build technology
 

7203
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:50,229
build technology
that alleviates some of the destructive

7204
02:03:50,229 --> 02:03:50,239
that alleviates some of the destructive
 

7205
02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:52,709
that alleviates some of the destructive
effects that we have on the climate we

7206
02:03:52,709 --> 02:03:52,719
effects that we have on the climate we
 

7207
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:54,310
effects that we have on the climate we
don't know

7208
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:54,320
don't know
 

7209
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:56,069
don't know
and we're going to find out the hard way

7210
02:03:56,069 --> 02:03:56,079
and we're going to find out the hard way
 

7211
02:03:56,079 --> 02:03:57,910
and we're going to find out the hard way
and the uncertainty you think would be

7212
02:03:57,910 --> 02:03:57,920
and the uncertainty you think would be
 

7213
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,229
and the uncertainty you think would be
very costly extremely like many of the

7214
02:04:00,229 --> 02:04:00,239
very costly extremely like many of the
 

7215
02:04:00,239 --> 02:04:02,149
very costly extremely like many of the
trajectories we might take

7216
02:04:02,149 --> 02:04:02,159
trajectories we might take
 

7217
02:04:02,159 --> 02:04:03,189
trajectories we might take
will be

7218
02:04:03,189 --> 02:04:03,199
will be
 

7219
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:05,189
will be
much more costly than they're profitable

7220
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:05,199
much more costly than they're profitable
 

7221
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:06,229
much more costly than they're profitable
yeah

7222
02:04:06,229 --> 02:04:06,239
yeah
 

7223
02:04:06,239 --> 02:04:07,430
yeah
and and like

and and like
 

7225
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:08,870
and and like
we've seen some of the storms that are

7226
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:08,880
we've seen some of the storms that are
 

7227
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,470
we've seen some of the storms that are
happening now in europe the ones that

7228
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:10,480
happening now in europe the ones that
 

7229
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,229
happening now in europe the ones that
you know washed away a village in

7230
02:04:12,229 --> 02:04:12,239
you know washed away a village in
 

7231
02:04:12,239 --> 02:04:14,950
you know washed away a village in
germany some time ago the the fire storm

7232
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:14,960
germany some time ago the the fire storm
 

7233
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:16,790
germany some time ago the the fire storm
that hit canada of all places i forgot

7234
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:16,800
that hit canada of all places i forgot
 

7235
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,550
that hit canada of all places i forgot
the name of the town that was burnt down

7236
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:18,560
the name of the town that was burnt down
 

7237
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,950
the name of the town that was burnt down
but an enormous temperature is in canada

7238
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:20,960
but an enormous temperature is in canada
 

7239
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:22,950
but an enormous temperature is in canada
uh again the storms have been happening

7240
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:22,960
uh again the storms have been happening
 

7241
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,629
uh again the storms have been happening
back in australia

7242
02:04:24,629 --> 02:04:24,639
back in australia
 

7243
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:26,149
back in australia
these are all manifestations of a

7244
02:04:26,149 --> 02:04:26,159
these are all manifestations of a
 

7245
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:27,910
these are all manifestations of a
complete shift in the weather patterns

7246
02:04:27,910 --> 02:04:27,920
complete shift in the weather patterns
 

7247
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:31,189
complete shift in the weather patterns
of the planet and they can wipe out like

7248
02:04:31,189 --> 02:04:31,199
of the planet and they can wipe out like
 

7249
02:04:31,199 --> 02:04:32,709
of the planet and they can wipe out like
you know a village just disappears

7250
02:04:32,709 --> 02:04:32,719
you know a village just disappears
 

7251
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:35,030
you know a village just disappears
because it's wiped out by unprecedented

7252
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:35,040
because it's wiped out by unprecedented
 

7253
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,910
because it's wiped out by unprecedented
rains and this keeps on happening

7254
02:04:37,910 --> 02:04:37,920
rains and this keeps on happening
 

7255
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:39,030

we are still
 

7259
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:41,910
we are still
living in a sedentary lifestyle when

7260
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:41,920
living in a sedentary lifestyle when
 

7261
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:44,550
living in a sedentary lifestyle when
we're a nomadic species okay so to be

7262
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:44,560
we're a nomadic species okay so to be
 

7263
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,229
we're a nomadic species okay so to be
able to maintain that sedentary

able to maintain that sedentary
 

7265
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:48,950
able to maintain that sedentary
lifestyle we do need to engineer the

7266
02:04:48,950 --> 02:04:48,960
lifestyle we do need to engineer the
 

7267
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:50,629
lifestyle we do need to engineer the
planet we need to keep it within that

7268

degree which is really what it's been
 

7275
02:04:58,159 --> 02:05:00,229
degree which is really what it's been
like for the last 10 12 000 years

7276
02:05:00,229 --> 02:05:00,239
like for the last 10 12 000 years
 

7277
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:01,750
like for the last 10 12 000 years
instead we're blasting it right out of

that range
 

7281
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:03,830
that range
and

7282
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:03,840
and
 

7283
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:06,390
and
we know some of the past climates that

7284
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:06,400
we know some of the past climates that
 

7285
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:08,790
we know some of the past climates that
have existed then we can model what they

7286
02:05:08,790 --> 02:05:08,800
have existed then we can model what they
 

7287
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:11,270
have existed then we can model what they
imply for our our food production

02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:52,880
now that his model this is what really

now that his model this is what really

pisses me off about these people is the
 

7391
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:56,709
pisses me off about these people is the
worst work i've read in 50 years of

02:06:56,709 --> 02:06:56,719
worst work i've read in 50 years of

do not include precipitation

7408
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:14,880
do not include precipitation
 

7409
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,870
do not include precipitation
they simply have temperature

7410
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:16,880
they simply have temperature
 

7411
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:19,189
they simply have temperature
so they assume that if temperature

7412
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:19,199
so they assume that if temperature
 

7413
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:20,629
so they assume that if temperature

02:07:22,229 --> 02:07:22,239
temperature which is better for

okay then so will precipitation

7420
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,400
okay then so will precipitation
 

7421
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,229
okay then so will precipitation
now that's completely wrong they've left

7422
02:07:28,229 --> 02:07:28,239
now that's completely wrong they've left
 

7423
02:07:28,239 --> 02:07:30,629
now that's completely wrong they've left
out a crucial imagine trying to model

02:07:30,629 --> 02:07:30,639
out a crucial imagine trying to model
 

7425
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:31,990
out a crucial imagine trying to model
the climate while ignoring the fact that

02:07:31,990 --> 02:07:32,000
the climate while ignoring the fact that
 

7427
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,430
the climate while ignoring the fact that
there's rainfall

7428
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:33,440
there's rainfall
 

7429
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:35,030
there's rainfall
right that's what they've done so their

7430
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:35,040
right that's what they've done so their
 

7431
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:36,629
right that's what they've done so their
work is so bad

7432
02:07:36,629 --> 02:07:36,639
work is so bad
 

7433
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:38,470
work is so bad
so dreadfully battered should never have

7434
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:38,480
so dreadfully battered should never have
 

7435
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:40,950
so dreadfully battered should never have
been they over all right right okay

7436
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:40,960
been they over all right right okay
 

7437
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,470
been they over all right right okay
i'm going to go for them sorry this is

7438
02:07:42,470 --> 02:07:42,480
i'm going to go for them sorry this is
 

7439
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:45,430
i'm going to go for them sorry this is
well no no i want 100 as as they deserve

7440
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:45,440
well no no i want 100 as as they deserve
 

7441
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:47,669
well no no i want 100 as as they deserve
it so it's an oversimplification

7442
02:07:47,669 --> 02:07:47,679
it so it's an oversimplification
 

7443
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:50,390
it so it's an oversimplification
but i also want you to steal man people

7444
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:50,400
but i also want you to steal man people
 

7445
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,229
but i also want you to steal man people
you disagree with and criticize people

7446
02:07:52,229 --> 02:07:52,239
you disagree with and criticize people
 

7447
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:54,950
you disagree with and criticize people
you agree with if possible yeah

7448
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:54,960
you agree with if possible yeah
 

7449
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,189
you agree with if possible yeah
to be sort of intellectually honest here

7450
02:07:57,189 --> 02:07:57,199
to be sort of intellectually honest here
 

7451
02:07:57,199 --> 02:07:59,669
to be sort of intellectually honest here
you do say sort of to push back on the

7452
02:07:59,669 --> 02:07:59,679
you do say sort of to push back on the
 

7453
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:02,149
you do say sort of to push back on the
catastrophic thinking about

7454
02:08:02,149 --> 02:08:02,159
catastrophic thinking about
 

7455
02:08:02,159 --> 02:08:05,030
catastrophic thinking about

7456
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:05,040

 

7457
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:05,990

that

7458
02:08:05,990 --> 02:08:06,000
that
 

7459
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,189
that
the

7460
02:08:07,189 --> 02:08:07,199
the
 

7461
02:08:07,199 --> 02:08:09,270
the
ecology the biosphere

7462
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:09,280
ecology the biosphere
 

7463
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:11,589
ecology the biosphere
is a complex system yeah

7464
02:08:11,589 --> 02:08:11,599
is a complex system yeah
 

7465
02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:12,870
is a complex system yeah
economics

7466
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:12,880
economics
 

7467
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:18,069
economics
the economy is a complex system

7468
02:08:18,069 --> 02:08:18,079

 

7469
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:19,030

so

7470
02:08:19,030 --> 02:08:19,040
so
 

7471
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:20,950
so
how can we make predictions about

7472
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:20,960
how can we make predictions about
 

7473
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:23,669
how can we make predictions about
complex systems how can we make a hope

7474
02:08:23,669 --> 02:08:23,679
complex systems how can we make a hope
 

7475
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:25,270
complex systems how can we make a hope
of

7476
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:25,280
of
 

7477
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:27,350
of
having a semi-confident predictions

7478
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:27,360
having a semi-confident predictions
 

7479
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:28,950
having a semi-confident predictions
about the complex system so the

7480
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:28,960
about the complex system so the
 

7481
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:32,390
about the complex system so the
scientific community is very confident

7482
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:32,400
scientific community is very confident
 

7483
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:33,910
scientific community is very confident
about

7484
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:33,920
about
 

7485
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:36,390
about
the complex system that is the biosphere

7486
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:36,400
the complex system that is the biosphere
 

7487
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,149
the complex system that is the biosphere
and the uh

7488
02:08:38,149 --> 02:08:38,159
and the uh
 

7489
02:08:38,159 --> 02:08:39,990
and the uh
the crisis that's before us on the

7490
02:08:39,990 --> 02:08:40,000
the crisis that's before us on the
 

7491
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,390
the crisis that's before us on the
horizon yeah

7492
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:42,400
horizon yeah
 

7493
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,790
horizon yeah
uh and then the economists are

7494
02:08:44,790 --> 02:08:44,800
uh and then the economists are
 

7495
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,790
uh and then the economists are
as a community i don't know i don't know

7496
02:08:46,790 --> 02:08:46,800
as a community i don't know i don't know
 

7497
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:48,550
as a community i don't know i don't know
what percentage but

7498
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:48,560
what percentage but
 

7499
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,350
what percentage but
much

7500
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:49,360
much
 

7501
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:52,470
much
too much uh that part of the community

7502
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:52,480
too much uh that part of the community
 

7503
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,069
too much uh that part of the community
is very confident

7504
02:08:54,069 --> 02:08:54,079
is very confident
 

7505
02:08:54,079 --> 02:08:55,430
is very confident
looking at the

7506
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:55,440
looking at the
 

7507
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:59,430
looking at the
economics complex uh complex system

7508
02:08:59,430 --> 02:08:59,440
economics complex uh complex system
 

7509
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:01,669
economics complex uh complex system
in saying that no

7510
02:09:01,669 --> 02:09:01,679
in saying that no
 

7511
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:03,030
in saying that no
this

7512
02:09:03,030 --> 02:09:03,040
this
 

7513
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:04,950
this
system we have

7514
02:09:04,950 --> 02:09:04,960
system we have
 

7515
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:07,990
system we have
of labor and money and capital and so on

7516
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:08,000
of labor and money and capital and so on
 

7517
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,669
of labor and money and capital and so on
we'll be able to deal with that crisis

7518
02:09:09,669 --> 02:09:09,679
we'll be able to deal with that crisis
 

7519
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:11,669
we'll be able to deal with that crisis
and any other crisis

7520
02:09:11,669 --> 02:09:11,679
and any other crisis
 

7521
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:13,990
and any other crisis
and they kind of construct simplified

7522
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:14,000
and they kind of construct simplified
 

7523
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,669
and they kind of construct simplified
models that justify

7524
02:09:17,669 --> 02:09:17,679
models that justify
 

7525
02:09:17,679 --> 02:09:20,149
models that justify
their confidence so how do we know who

7526
02:09:20,149 --> 02:09:20,159
their confidence so how do we know who
 

7527
02:09:20,159 --> 02:09:22,229
their confidence so how do we know who
to believe well for start if you believe

7528
02:09:22,229 --> 02:09:22,239
to believe well for start if you believe
 

7529
02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:24,550
to believe well for start if you believe
the economists you you need you need

7530
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:24,560
the economists you you need you need
 

7531
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,149
the economists you you need you need
your bro your head read

7532
02:09:26,149 --> 02:09:26,159
your bro your head read
 

7533
02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:27,430
your bro your head read
because when you write an argument i

7534
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:27,440
because when you write an argument i
 

7535
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:28,709
because when you write an argument i
know it's not an argument it's a summary

7536
02:09:28,709 --> 02:09:28,719
know it's not an argument it's a summary
 

7537
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:31,109
know it's not an argument it's a summary
of an argument and that is that sounds a

7538
02:09:31,109 --> 02:09:31,119
of an argument and that is that sounds a
 

7539
02:09:31,119 --> 02:09:32,950
of an argument and that is that sounds a
lot like an opinion and an emotional i

7540
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:32,960
lot like an opinion and an emotional i
 

7541
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:35,109
lot like an opinion and an emotional i
know i know i'm so angry about it like

7542
02:09:35,109 --> 02:09:35,119
know i know i'm so angry about it like
 

7543
02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:37,109
know i know i'm so angry about it like
listen i'll tell you i'll tell you where

7544
02:09:37,109 --> 02:09:37,119
listen i'll tell you i'll tell you where
 

7545
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:38,790
listen i'll tell you i'll tell you where
i stand

7546
02:09:38,790 --> 02:09:38,800
i stand
 

7547
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:41,270
i stand
and i've begun looking studying the

7548
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:41,280
and i've begun looking studying the
 

7549
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:44,069
and i've begun looking studying the
climate change yeah much more

7550
02:09:44,069 --> 02:09:44,079
climate change yeah much more
 

7551
02:09:44,079 --> 02:09:46,629
climate change yeah much more
i used to be

7552
02:09:46,629 --> 02:09:46,639
i used to be
 

7553
02:09:46,639 --> 02:09:48,790
i used to be
on things i don't

7554
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:48,800
on things i don't
 

7555
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,990
on things i don't
understand

7556
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:50,000
understand
 

7557
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,990
understand
have not spent time on

7558
02:09:51,990 --> 02:09:52,000
have not spent time on
 

7559
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,310
have not spent time on
i have so many colleagues that are

7560
02:09:54,310 --> 02:09:54,320
i have so many colleagues that are
 

7561
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:57,270
i have so many colleagues that are
scientists that i deeply respect

7562
02:09:57,270 --> 02:09:57,280
scientists that i deeply respect
 

7563
02:09:57,280 --> 02:10:01,750
scientists that i deeply respect
and i trust their opinion um

7564
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:01,760
and i trust their opinion um
 

7565
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,550
and i trust their opinion um
i have seen

7566
02:10:04,550 --> 02:10:04,560
i have seen
 

7567
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,950
i have seen
the lesser angels

7568
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:06,960
the lesser angels
 

7569
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:09,430
the lesser angels
of my colleagues on the on the pandemic

7570
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:09,440
of my colleagues on the on the pandemic
 

7571
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:11,910
of my colleagues on the on the pandemic
side on the other side

7572
02:10:11,910 --> 02:10:11,920
side on the other side
 

7573
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:14,950
side on the other side
the confidence the arrogance that impart

7574
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:14,960
the confidence the arrogance that impart
 

7575
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:17,510
the confidence the arrogance that impart
blinded i believe

7576
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:17,520
blinded i believe
 

7577
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,470
blinded i believe
the

7578
02:10:18,470 --> 02:10:18,480
the
 

7579
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,550
the
the jump between basic scientific

7580
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:20,560
the jump between basic scientific
 

7581
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:22,629
the jump between basic scientific
research to the

7582
02:10:22,629 --> 02:10:22,639
research to the
 

7583
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:26,390
research to the
uh to public policy yep yep and then

7584
02:10:26,390 --> 02:10:26,400
uh to public policy yep yep and then
 

7585
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:29,270
uh to public policy yep yep and then
that so i've become a little bit more

7586
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:29,280
that so i've become a little bit more
 

7587
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:32,149
that so i've become a little bit more
cautious in my trust on climate change

7588
02:10:32,149 --> 02:10:32,159
cautious in my trust on climate change
 

7589
02:10:32,159 --> 02:10:33,770
cautious in my trust on climate change
i'm still in the same place

7590
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:33,780
i'm still in the same place
 

7591
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:34,870
i'm still in the same place

[Music]
 

7593
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,310

and not i don't mean climate change and

7594
02:10:36,310 --> 02:10:36,320
and not i don't mean climate change and
 

7595
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,310
and not i don't mean climate change and
anything scientists say i become a

7596
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:38,320
anything scientists say i become a
 

7597
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:39,350
anything scientists say i become a
little bit

7598
02:10:39,350 --> 02:10:39,360
little bit
 

7599
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,790
little bit
wait a minute

7600
02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:40,800
wait a minute
 

7601
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:43,990
wait a minute
um

7602
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,000

 

7603
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,470

how does the basic scientific facts of

7604
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:46,480
how does the basic scientific facts of
 

7605
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,629
how does the basic scientific facts of
our reality map to what we should do as

7606
02:10:48,629 --> 02:10:48,639
our reality map to what we should do as
 

7607
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:51,189
our reality map to what we should do as
a human as a human civilization yeah

7608
02:10:51,189 --> 02:10:51,199
a human as a human civilization yeah
 

7609
02:10:51,199 --> 02:10:52,709
a human as a human civilization yeah
there i want to be a little bit careful

7610
02:10:52,709 --> 02:10:52,719
there i want to be a little bit careful
 

7611
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:55,510
there i want to be a little bit careful
so whenever now i see arrogance and

7612
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:55,520
so whenever now i see arrogance and
 

7613
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,830
so whenever now i see arrogance and
confidence i become suspicious well i'm

7614
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:57,840
confidence i become suspicious well i'm
 

7615
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:59,830
confidence i become suspicious well i'm
the same and that's why i'm being angry

7616
02:10:59,830 --> 02:10:59,840
the same and that's why i'm being angry
 

7617
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:01,830
the same and that's why i'm being angry
about the economist because there's

7618
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:01,840
about the economist because there's
 

7619
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,310
about the economist because there's
incredible arrogance incredible

7620
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:04,320
incredible arrogance incredible
 

7621
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:06,950
incredible arrogance incredible
stupidity at the arrogance

7622
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:06,960
stupidity at the arrogance
 

7623
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:08,790
stupidity at the arrogance
assumptions which

7624
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:08,800
assumptions which
 

7625
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,629
assumptions which
you look at it and think how did anybody

7626
02:11:10,629 --> 02:11:10,639
you look at it and think how did anybody
 

7627
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:13,430
you look at it and think how did anybody
let that get published sure okay so

7628
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:13,440
let that get published sure okay so
 

7629
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:15,910
let that get published sure okay so
the the economic analysis of the effects

7630
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:15,920
the the economic analysis of the effects
 

7631
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,390
the the economic analysis of the effects
of climate change yeah are poor very

7632
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:18,400
of climate change yeah are poor very
 

7633
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,709
of climate change yeah are poor very
many cases incredibly poor yeah and this

7634
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:20,719
many cases incredibly poor yeah and this
 

7635
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:21,669
many cases incredibly poor yeah and this
is like

7636
02:11:21,669 --> 02:11:21,679
is like
 

7637
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:23,830
is like
bjorn lomborg styles himself as the

7638
02:11:23,830 --> 02:11:23,840
bjorn lomborg styles himself as the
 

7639
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:25,510
bjorn lomborg styles himself as the
skeptical environmentalist and

7640
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:25,520
skeptical environmentalist and
 

7641
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:27,350
skeptical environmentalist and
criticizes the

7642
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:27,360
criticizes the
 

7643
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,430
criticizes the
environmental models he doesn't take a

7644
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:29,440
environmental models he doesn't take a
 

7645
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:31,430
environmental models he doesn't take a
look he doesn't criticize the work come

7646
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:31,440
look he doesn't criticize the work come
 

7647
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,990
look he doesn't criticize the work come
out by economists you look at it it's so

7648
02:11:33,990 --> 02:11:34,000
out by economists you look at it it's so
 

7649
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,030
out by economists you look at it it's so
bad

7650
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:35,040
bad
 

7651
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:37,430
bad
is it possible to do good economics

7652
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
is it possible to do good economics
 

7653
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,350
is it possible to do good economics
modeling of the effects of climate

7654
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:39,360
modeling of the effects of climate
 

7655
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:42,149
modeling of the effects of climate
change yeah it is possible uh very

7656
02:11:42,149 --> 02:11:42,159
change yeah it is possible uh very
 

7657
02:11:42,159 --> 02:11:44,229
change yeah it is possible uh very
difficult or is it like

7658
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:44,239
difficult or is it like
 

7659
02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:46,310
difficult or is it like
one complex system stack until it's time

7660
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:46,320
one complex system stack until it's time
 

7661
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:48,629
one complex system stack until it's time
to in that case yeah i mean like to me

7662
02:11:48,629 --> 02:11:48,639
to in that case yeah i mean like to me
 

7663
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:50,629
to in that case yeah i mean like to me
the what what you should be looking at

7664
02:11:50,629 --> 02:11:50,639
the what what you should be looking at
 

7665
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:52,390
the what what you should be looking at
is saying what are the scientists saying

7666
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:52,400
is saying what are the scientists saying
 

7667
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:54,149
is saying what are the scientists saying
are the consequences probable

7668
02:11:54,149 --> 02:11:54,159
are the consequences probable
 

7669
02:11:54,159 --> 02:11:56,310
are the consequences probable
consequences not we're not guaranteed

7670
02:11:56,310 --> 02:11:56,320
consequences not we're not guaranteed
 

7671
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:59,589
consequences not we're not guaranteed
but probable consequences of increasing

7672
02:11:59,589 --> 02:11:59,599
but probable consequences of increasing
 

7673
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:02,149
but probable consequences of increasing
the energy level of the atmosphere by

7674
02:12:02,149 --> 02:12:02,159
the energy level of the atmosphere by
 

7675
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:03,669
the energy level of the atmosphere by
the amount we're doing what can the

7676
02:12:03,669 --> 02:12:03,679
the amount we're doing what can the
 

7677
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:05,750
the amount we're doing what can the
scientists say in terms of like

7678
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:05,760
scientists say in terms of like
 

7679
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,750
scientists say in terms of like
the effects because it's so complicated

7680
02:12:07,750 --> 02:12:07,760
the effects because it's so complicated
 

7681
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:09,189
the effects because it's so complicated
the effects of

7682
02:12:09,189 --> 02:12:09,199
the effects of
 

7683
02:12:09,199 --> 02:12:10,870
the effects of
sort of shifting

7684
02:12:10,870 --> 02:12:10,880
sort of shifting
 

7685
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:12,629
sort of shifting
resources

7686
02:12:12,629 --> 02:12:12,639
resources
 

7687
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:14,870
resources
so basically what are the effects of

7688
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:14,880
so basically what are the effects of
 

7689
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,550
so basically what are the effects of
climate change how can we really model

7690
02:12:16,550 --> 02:12:16,560
climate change how can we really model
 

7691
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:18,229
climate change how can we really model
that because it's it's basically you're

7692
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:18,239
that because it's it's basically you're
 

7693
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:20,709
that because it's it's basically you're
looking through the fog of uncertainty

7694
02:12:20,709 --> 02:12:20,719
looking through the fog of uncertainty
 

7695
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:23,990
looking through the fog of uncertainty
yeah because they're rising sea levels

7696
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:24,000
yeah because they're rising sea levels
 

7697
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,910
yeah because they're rising sea levels
how can we know what effect that has

7698
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:25,920
how can we know what effect that has
 

7699
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:27,830
how can we know what effect that has
well yeah we know there'll be a lot of

7700
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:27,840
well yeah we know there'll be a lot of
 

7701
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,830
well yeah we know there'll be a lot of
change yeah this is i don't actually i

7702
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:29,840
change yeah this is i don't actually i
 

7703
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,510
change yeah this is i don't actually i
think the actual sea level one is a poor

7704
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:31,520
think the actual sea level one is a poor
 

7705
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:34,390
think the actual sea level one is a poor
argument and i don't focus on it what i

7706
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:34,400
argument and i don't focus on it what i
 

7707
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:36,870
argument and i don't focus on it what i
mainly focus upon is the the weather

7708
02:12:36,870 --> 02:12:36,880
mainly focus upon is the the weather
 

7709
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,229
mainly focus upon is the the weather
patterns

7710
02:12:38,229 --> 02:12:38,239
patterns
 

7711
02:12:38,239 --> 02:12:39,910
patterns
okay and if you look at like we've got

7712
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:39,920
okay and if you look at like we've got
 

7713
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:40,629
okay and if you look at like we've got
the

7714
02:12:40,629 --> 02:12:40,639
the
 

7715
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:42,229
the
the the wheat belt in america goes

7716
02:12:42,229 --> 02:12:42,239
the the wheat belt in america goes
 

7717
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:44,709
the the wheat belt in america goes
throughout idaho and countries places

7718
02:12:44,709 --> 02:12:44,719
throughout idaho and countries places
 

7719
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:47,109
throughout idaho and countries places
like that and you've got incredibly deep

7720
02:12:47,109 --> 02:12:47,119
like that and you've got incredibly deep
 

7721
02:12:47,119 --> 02:12:49,270
like that and you've got incredibly deep
topsoil ukraine is another classic

7722
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:49,280
topsoil ukraine is another classic
 

7723
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,270
topsoil ukraine is another classic
example the depth of the topsoil in

7724
02:12:51,270 --> 02:12:51,280
example the depth of the topsoil in
 

7725
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:53,589
example the depth of the topsoil in
ukraine is remarkable and that's the

7726
02:12:53,589 --> 02:12:53,599
ukraine is remarkable and that's the
 

7727
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:56,870
ukraine is remarkable and that's the
wheat bowl of europe and that requires

7728
02:12:56,870 --> 02:12:56,880
wheat bowl of europe and that requires
 

7729
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,629
wheat bowl of europe and that requires
both the right temperature for growing

7730
02:12:58,629 --> 02:12:58,639
both the right temperature for growing
 

7731
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:00,310
both the right temperature for growing
wheat and the right rainfall for growing

7732
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:00,320
wheat and the right rainfall for growing
 

7733
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:02,390
wheat and the right rainfall for growing
wheat now when we look at the models

7734
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:02,400
wheat now when we look at the models
 

7735
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:03,510
wheat now when we look at the models
that

7736
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:03,520
that
 

7737
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:06,069
that
climate scientists are building of of

7738
02:13:06,069 --> 02:13:06,079
climate scientists are building of of
 

7739
02:13:06,079 --> 02:13:08,550
climate scientists are building of of
that you have pretty much your ultimate

7740
02:13:08,550 --> 02:13:08,560
that you have pretty much your ultimate
 

7741
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:11,030
that you have pretty much your ultimate
foundation is is the lorenz model

7742
02:13:11,030 --> 02:13:11,040
foundation is is the lorenz model
 

7743
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,430
foundation is is the lorenz model
of turbulent flow

7744
02:13:13,430 --> 02:13:13,440
of turbulent flow
 

7745
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:14,790
of turbulent flow
and of course that's that's the first

7746
02:13:14,790 --> 02:13:14,800
and of course that's that's the first
 

7747
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:17,270
and of course that's that's the first
model which we saw chaos theory

7748
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:17,280
model which we saw chaos theory
 

7749
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:19,830
model which we saw chaos theory
complexity that beautiful simple model

7750
02:13:19,830 --> 02:13:19,840
complexity that beautiful simple model
 

7751
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:22,310
complexity that beautiful simple model
three variables three parameters and

7752
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:22,320
three variables three parameters and
 

7753
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,629
three variables three parameters and
incredible complexity out of the system

7754
02:13:24,629 --> 02:13:24,639
incredible complexity out of the system
 

7755
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:26,310
incredible complexity out of the system
uh but

7756
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:26,320
uh but
 

7757
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:27,990
uh but
and what that meant was you also had an

7758
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:28,000
and what that meant was you also had an
 

7759
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,030
and what that meant was you also had an
exponential decay in the accuracy of

7760
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:31,040
exponential decay in the accuracy of
 

7761
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:33,510
exponential decay in the accuracy of
your model over time so if you have if

7762
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:33,520
your model over time so if you have if
 

7763
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:35,910
your model over time so if you have if
you accurate to a thousand decimal

7764
02:13:35,910 --> 02:13:35,920
you accurate to a thousand decimal
 

7765
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:37,750
you accurate to a thousand decimal
places

7766
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:37,760
places
 

7767
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:39,910
places
then in a thousand days you'll have no

7768
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:39,920
then in a thousand days you'll have no
 

7769
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:41,669
then in a thousand days you'll have no
data whatsoever because each time you're

7770
02:13:41,669 --> 02:13:41,679
data whatsoever because each time you're
 

7771
02:13:41,679 --> 02:13:43,990
data whatsoever because each time you're
losing an order of magnitude of accuracy

7772
02:13:43,990 --> 02:13:44,000
losing an order of magnitude of accuracy
 

7773
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,910
losing an order of magnitude of accuracy
okay so that's the point about the

7774
02:13:45,910 --> 02:13:45,920
okay so that's the point about the
 

7775
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:47,589
okay so that's the point about the
inability to predict for the very long

7776
02:13:47,589 --> 02:13:47,599
inability to predict for the very long
 

7777
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:48,550
inability to predict for the very long
future

7778
02:13:48,550 --> 02:13:48,560
future
 

7779
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:50,149
future
but what you can just say well there's a

7780
02:13:50,149 --> 02:13:50,159
but what you can just say well there's a
 

7781
02:13:50,159 --> 02:13:52,390
but what you can just say well there's a
prediction horizon if we're close enough

7782
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:52,400
prediction horizon if we're close enough
 

7783
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,870
prediction horizon if we're close enough
to the if our statistical measurement of

7784
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:54,880
to the if our statistical measurement of
 

7785
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:56,149
to the if our statistical measurement of
where we are

7786
02:13:56,149 --> 02:13:56,159
where we are
 

7787
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:58,629
where we are
is close enough to where we actually are

7788
02:13:58,629 --> 02:13:58,639
is close enough to where we actually are
 

7789
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:00,550
is close enough to where we actually are
and our forecast horizon is narrow

7790
02:14:00,550 --> 02:14:00,560
and our forecast horizon is narrow
 

7791
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:01,510
and our forecast horizon is narrow
enough

7792
02:14:01,510 --> 02:14:01,520
enough
 

7793
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:03,830
enough
to not extrapolate too far then for this

7794
02:14:03,830 --> 02:14:03,840
to not extrapolate too far then for this
 

7795
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:05,589
to not extrapolate too far then for this
distance forward we can make a

7796
02:14:05,589 --> 02:14:05,599
distance forward we can make a
 

7797
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:07,030
distance forward we can make a
reasonable fist of predicting what the

7798
02:14:07,030 --> 02:14:07,040
reasonable fist of predicting what the
 

7799
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:08,470
reasonable fist of predicting what the
weather's going to be

7800
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:08,480
weather's going to be
 

7801
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:09,430
weather's going to be
and that's the foundation of

7802
02:14:09,430 --> 02:14:09,440
and that's the foundation of
 

7803
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:11,990
and that's the foundation of
meteorological uh the stuff we watch on

7804
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:12,000
meteorological uh the stuff we watch on
 

7805
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,629
meteorological uh the stuff we watch on
tv you know that most of the time the

7806
02:14:14,629 --> 02:14:14,639
tv you know that most of the time the
 

7807
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:16,310
tv you know that most of the time the
forecasts are going to be correct these

7808
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:16,320
forecasts are going to be correct these
 

7809
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,950
forecasts are going to be correct these
days 40 50 years ago most of the time

7810
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:18,960
days 40 50 years ago most of the time
 

7811
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,629
days 40 50 years ago most of the time
the forecasts were wrong

7812
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:20,639
the forecasts were wrong
 

7813
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:22,870
the forecasts were wrong
so that's the background foundation to

7814
02:14:22,870 --> 02:14:22,880
so that's the background foundation to
 

7815
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:25,109
so that's the background foundation to
these gcms but even they've got to

7816
02:14:25,109 --> 02:14:25,119
these gcms but even they've got to
 

7817
02:14:25,119 --> 02:14:27,109
these gcms but even they've got to
massively simplify the world so you have

7818
02:14:27,109 --> 02:14:27,119
massively simplify the world so you have
 

7819
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:29,430
massively simplify the world so you have
this enormous sphere of where they might

7820
02:14:29,430 --> 02:14:29,440
this enormous sphere of where they might
 

7821
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:31,430
this enormous sphere of where they might
divide it down to 100 kilometer by 100

7822
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:31,440
divide it down to 100 kilometer by 100
 

7823
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:34,629
divide it down to 100 kilometer by 100
kilometer by 10 kilometer

7824
02:14:34,629 --> 02:14:34,639

cube

7826
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:36,400

02:14:39,990 --> 02:14:40,000
rectangles whatever um oblongs that
 

7829
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,350
rectangles whatever um oblongs that
that's how they're modeling the

7830
02:14:41,350 --> 02:14:41,360
that's how they're modeling the
 

7831
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:42,470
that's how they're modeling the
transition

7832
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:42,480
transition
 

7833
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:43,189
transition
of

7834
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:43,199

where whether from one location to
 

7837
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:47,669
where whether from one location to

7838
02:14:47,669 --> 02:14:47,679
another so they've got a chunky
 

7839
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:49,430
another so they've got a chunky
vision of the planet which they have to

7840
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:49,440
vision of the planet which they have to
 

7841
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:51,589
vision of the planet which they have to
they can't model down to the last

7842
02:14:51,589 --> 02:14:51,599
they can't model down to the last
 

7843
02:14:51,599 --> 02:14:53,430
they can't model down to the last
molecule so you're losing yeah right

7844
02:14:53,430 --> 02:14:53,440
molecule so you're losing yeah right
 

7845
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:54,470
molecule so you're losing yeah right
it's getting better and better and

7846
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:54,480
it's getting better and better and
 

7847
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,069
it's getting better and better and
better better oh yeah i think that's

7848
02:14:56,069 --> 02:14:56,079
better better oh yeah i think that's
 

7849
02:14:56,079 --> 02:14:58,149
better better oh yeah i think that's
that's just too much processing power

7850
02:14:58,149 --> 02:14:58,159
that's just too much processing power
 

7851
02:14:58,159 --> 02:14:59,669
that's just too much processing power
but you you're going to have some

7852
02:14:59,669 --> 02:14:59,679
but you you're going to have some
 

7853
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:01,830
but you you're going to have some
confined you can't go i mean if you look

7854
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:01,840
confined you can't go i mean if you look
 

7855
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:03,109
confined you can't go i mean if you look
at the models to do the weather they

7856
02:15:03,109 --> 02:15:03,119
at the models to do the weather they
 

7857
02:15:03,119 --> 02:15:05,430
at the models to do the weather they
used to be of that 100 kilometer i think

7858
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:05,440
used to be of that 100 kilometer i think
 

7859
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:07,030
used to be of that 100 kilometer i think
about 10 kilometer grids now i don't

7860
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:07,040
about 10 kilometer grids now i don't
 

7861
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:09,430
about 10 kilometer grids now i don't
know but so the processing powers let us

7862
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:09,440
know but so the processing powers let us
 

7863
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:11,750
know but so the processing powers let us
get more and more precise that way i do

7864
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:11,760
get more and more precise that way i do
 

7865
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,350
get more and more precise that way i do
know that the models

7866
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:13,360
know that the models
 

7867
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:15,350
know that the models
now include chemical mixing that occurs

7868
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:15,360
now include chemical mixing that occurs
 

7869
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:17,189
now include chemical mixing that occurs
above cities yeah they've added that

7870
02:15:17,189 --> 02:15:17,199
above cities yeah they've added that
 

7871
02:15:17,199 --> 02:15:19,189
above cities yeah they've added that
complexity to them over time so you're

7872
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:19,199
complexity to them over time so you're
 

7873
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:20,950
complexity to them over time so you're
looking at the increasingly accurate

7874
02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:20,960
looking at the increasingly accurate
 

7875
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:22,870
looking at the increasingly accurate
models the weather patterns the effect

7876
02:15:22,870 --> 02:15:22,880
models the weather patterns the effect
 

7877
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:25,030
models the weather patterns the effect
they have on agriculture yeah on food

7878
02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:25,040
they have on agriculture yeah on food
 

7879
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:27,589
they have on agriculture yeah on food
yeah and you're saying that there's a

7880
02:15:27,589 --> 02:15:27,599
yeah and you're saying that there's a
 

7881
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:30,310
yeah and you're saying that there's a
lot of possibilities in which

7882
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:30,320
lot of possibilities in which
 

7883
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:31,990
lot of possibilities in which
that's going to be really destructive to

7884
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,000
that's going to be really destructive to
 

7885
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,229
that's going to be really destructive to
society and the food production side and

7886
02:15:34,229 --> 02:15:34,239
society and the food production side and
 

7887
02:15:34,239 --> 02:15:35,669
society and the food production side and
if you have that increase in temperature

7888
02:15:35,669 --> 02:15:35,679
if you have that increase in temperature
 

7889
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:36,709
if you have that increase in temperature
they're going to get a change in

7890
02:15:36,709 --> 02:15:36,719
they're going to get a change in
 

7891
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:38,709
they're going to get a change in
precipitation and it could mean that

7892
02:15:38,709 --> 02:15:38,719
precipitation and it could mean that
 

7893
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:41,589
precipitation and it could mean that
where the rainfall and the sunshine are

7894
02:15:41,589 --> 02:15:41,599
where the rainfall and the sunshine are
 

7895

02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:49,189

7913
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:02,149

what about so that that's a

02:16:02,149 --> 02:16:02,159
what about so that that's a
 

7915
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:03,669
what about so that that's a

straightforward criticism of
 

7917
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:05,510
straightforward criticism of
oversimplified models yeah what about

7918
02:16:05,510 --> 02:16:05,520
oversimplified models yeah what about
 

7919
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:07,430
oversimplified models yeah what about
the idea

7920
02:16:07,430 --> 02:16:07,440
the idea
 

7921
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:10,149
the idea
that we innovate our way out of it so

that we innovate our way out of it so

what is the there's a
 

7927
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:16,870
what is the there's a

02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:46,389
develop the idea very rapidly to put

what we're currently doing six years

7960
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:49,920
what we're currently doing six years
 

7961
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,830
what we're currently doing six years
yeah and we haven't got years we've got

7962
02:16:51,830 --> 02:16:51,840
yeah and we haven't got years we've got
 

7963
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:53,589
yeah and we haven't got years we've got
we might have decades we certainly

7964
02:16:53,589 --> 02:16:53,599
we might have decades we certainly
 

7965
02:16:53,599 --> 02:16:55,190
we might have decades we certainly
haven't got centuries

7966
02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:55,200
haven't got centuries
 

7967
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:58,070
haven't got centuries
um so in the time frame we've got i

7968
02:16:58,070 --> 02:16:58,080
um so in the time frame we've got i
 

7969
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:00,709
um so in the time frame we've got i
can't see that engineering going from

02:17:00,709 --> 02:17:00,719
can't see that engineering going from

02:17:00,719 --> 02:17:02,790
can't see that engineering going from

what do you think about the sort of the

02:17:09,509 --> 02:17:09,519
what do you think about the sort of the
 

7983
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:11,509
what do you think about the sort of the
catastrophic predictions that people

7984
02:17:11,509 --> 02:17:11,519
catastrophic predictions that people
 

7985
02:17:11,519 --> 02:17:14,150
catastrophic predictions that people
that have thought and have written about

7986
02:17:14,150 --> 02:17:14,160
that have thought and have written about
 

7987
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,429
that have thought and have written about
climate have made in the past that

02:17:15,429 --> 02:17:15,439
climate have made in the past that
 

7989
02:17:15,439 --> 02:17:17,270
climate have made in the past that
haven't come to that's mainly

7990
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:17,280
haven't come to that's mainly
 

7991
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:19,669
haven't come to that's mainly
unfortunately involving paul ellick and

02:17:19,669 --> 02:17:19,679
unfortunately involving paul ellick and

02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:21,910
unfortunately involving paul ellick and

7994
02:17:21,910 --> 02:17:21,920
the population bomb and the predictions

02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,070
the population bomb and the predictions
paul was making a few individuals or the

7996
02:17:24,070 --> 02:17:24,080
paul was making a few individuals or the
 

7997
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:26,070
paul was making a few individuals or the
one individual in that case yeah so i'm

7998
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:26,080
one individual in that case yeah so i'm
 

7999
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:27,830
one individual in that case yeah so i'm
mostly playing devil's advocate yes

8000
02:17:27,830 --> 02:17:27,840
mostly playing devil's advocate yes
 

8001
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:30,469
mostly playing devil's advocate yes
conversation and enjoying doing so

8002
02:17:30,469 --> 02:17:30,479
conversation and enjoying doing so
 

8003
02:17:30,479 --> 02:17:31,429
conversation and enjoying doing so
um

8004
02:17:31,429 --> 02:17:31,439
um
 

8005
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:33,750
um
i do think

8006
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:33,760
i do think
 

8007
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:36,150
i do think
uh i'm in agreement with the majority of

8008
02:17:36,150 --> 02:17:36,160
uh i'm in agreement with the majority of
 

8009
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:38,070
uh i'm in agreement with the majority of
the scientific community

8010
02:17:38,070 --> 02:17:38,080
the scientific community
 

8011
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:40,549
the scientific community
but you still see that argument mode

8012
02:17:40,549 --> 02:17:40,559
but you still see that argument mode
 

8013
02:17:40,559 --> 02:17:42,469
but you still see that argument mode
i still see the argument made

8014
02:17:42,469 --> 02:17:42,479
i still see the argument made
 

8015
02:17:42,479 --> 02:17:44,389
i still see the argument made
and i also am a little bit worried about

8016
02:17:44,389 --> 02:17:44,399
and i also am a little bit worried about
 

8017
02:17:44,399 --> 02:17:46,389
and i also am a little bit worried about
the arrogance and the ineffectiveness of

8018
02:17:46,389 --> 02:17:46,399
the arrogance and the ineffectiveness of
 

8019
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:48,309
the arrogance and the ineffectiveness of
the arrogance this is the problem it's

8020
02:17:48,309 --> 02:17:48,319
the arrogance this is the problem it's
 

8021
02:17:48,319 --> 02:17:49,509
the arrogance this is the problem it's
ineffective

8022
02:17:49,509 --> 02:17:49,519
ineffective
 

8023
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:51,509
ineffective
and and that's that's what worries me

8024
02:17:51,509 --> 02:17:51,519
and and that's that's what worries me
 

8025
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:52,549
and and that's that's what worries me
because

8026
02:17:52,549 --> 02:17:52,559
because
 

8027
02:17:52,559 --> 02:17:54,629
because
it's all been um

8028
02:17:54,629 --> 02:17:54,639
it's all been um
 

8029
02:17:54,639 --> 02:17:56,629
it's all been um
put into the sort of you know sea level

8030
02:17:56,629 --> 02:17:56,639
put into the sort of you know sea level
 

8031
02:17:56,639 --> 02:17:57,750
put into the sort of you know sea level
rise

8032
02:17:57,750 --> 02:17:57,760
rise
 

8033
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:00,150
rise
um temperature changes

8034
02:18:00,150 --> 02:18:00,160
um temperature changes
 

8035
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:03,190
um temperature changes
uh it's it's not put into the

8036
02:18:03,190 --> 02:18:03,200
uh it's it's not put into the
 

8037
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,709
uh it's it's not put into the
fragility

8038
02:18:04,709 --> 02:18:04,719
fragility
 

8039
02:18:04,719 --> 02:18:06,549
fragility
of the system in which we

8040
02:18:06,549 --> 02:18:06,559
of the system in which we
 

8041
02:18:06,559 --> 02:18:08,070
of the system in which we
currently live

8042
02:18:08,070 --> 02:18:08,080
currently live
 

8043
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:10,150
currently live
and the earth will survive and there's a

8044
02:18:10,150 --> 02:18:10,160
and the earth will survive and there's a
 

8045
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:11,589
and the earth will survive and there's a
wonderful science fiction book called

8046
02:18:11,589 --> 02:18:11,599
wonderful science fiction book called
 

8047
02:18:11,599 --> 02:18:13,030
wonderful science fiction book called
the earth abides

8048
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:13,040
the earth abides
 

8049
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:15,349
the earth abides
about a world in which humans get wiped

8050
02:18:15,349 --> 02:18:15,359
about a world in which humans get wiped
 

8051
02:18:15,359 --> 02:18:16,950
about a world in which humans get wiped
out there's only a tiny little band left

8052
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:16,960
out there's only a tiny little band left
 

8053
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:19,110
out there's only a tiny little band left
and then the earth reasserts itself so

8054
02:18:19,110 --> 02:18:19,120
and then the earth reasserts itself so
 

8055
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,950
and then the earth reasserts itself so
the earth's going to survive us will we

8056
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:20,960
the earth's going to survive us will we
 

8057
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:22,469
the earth's going to survive us will we
survive what we do with the earth that's

8058
02:18:22,469 --> 02:18:22,479
survive what we do with the earth that's
 

8059
02:18:22,479 --> 02:18:23,669
survive what we do with the earth that's
the question

8060
02:18:23,669 --> 02:18:23,679
the question
 

8061
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:24,469
the question
and

8062
02:18:24,469 --> 02:18:24,479
and
 

8063
02:18:24,479 --> 02:18:25,589
and
my

8064
02:18:25,589 --> 02:18:25,599
my
 

8065
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:27,030
my
feeling

8066
02:18:27,030 --> 02:18:27,040
feeling
 

8067
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,469
feeling
is that

8068
02:18:28,469 --> 02:18:28,479
is that
 

8069
02:18:28,479 --> 02:18:29,270
is that
we

8070
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:29,280
we
 

8071
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:31,589
we
have underplayed the extent to which the

8072
02:18:31,589 --> 02:18:31,599
have underplayed the extent to which the
 

8073
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:33,750
have underplayed the extent to which the
civilizations were built have depended

8074
02:18:33,750 --> 02:18:33,760
civilizations were built have depended
 

8075
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:36,230
civilizations were built have depended
upon a relatively stable climate and

8076
02:18:36,230 --> 02:18:36,240
upon a relatively stable climate and
 

8077
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:37,349
upon a relatively stable climate and
it's then there's that there's that

8078
02:18:37,349 --> 02:18:37,359
it's then there's that there's that
 

8079
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:38,870
it's then there's that there's that
turning point and the maximum in the

8080
02:18:38,870 --> 02:18:38,880
turning point and the maximum in the
 

8081
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:40,790
turning point and the maximum in the
global average temperature that we

8082
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:40,800
global average temperature that we
 

8083
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:42,950
global average temperature that we
evolved right on the top of it and if we

8084
02:18:42,950 --> 02:18:42,960
evolved right on the top of it and if we
 

8085
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:44,309
evolved right on the top of it and if we
had done nothing

8086
02:18:44,309 --> 02:18:44,319
had done nothing
 

8087
02:18:44,319 --> 02:18:45,910
had done nothing
we could find that heading back down

8088
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:45,920
we could find that heading back down
 

8089
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:48,150
we could find that heading back down
towards another ice age could equally

8090
02:18:48,150 --> 02:18:48,160
towards another ice age could equally
 

8091
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:49,349
towards another ice age could equally
destroy

8092
02:18:49,349 --> 02:18:49,359
destroy
 

8093
02:18:49,359 --> 02:18:51,349
destroy
the possibility of sedentary life but we

8094
02:18:51,349 --> 02:18:51,359
the possibility of sedentary life but we
 

8095
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:52,629
the possibility of sedentary life but we
for example if we'd never developed

8096
02:18:52,629 --> 02:18:52,639
for example if we'd never developed
 

8097
02:18:52,639 --> 02:18:55,110
for example if we'd never developed
developed fossil fuel based industries

8098
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:55,120
developed fossil fuel based industries
 

8099
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:57,910
developed fossil fuel based industries
uh we'd never built a super phosphate so

8100
02:18:57,910 --> 02:18:57,920
uh we'd never built a super phosphate so
 

8101
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,910
uh we'd never built a super phosphate so
a population would never have reached

8102
02:18:59,910 --> 02:18:59,920
a population would never have reached
 

8103
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:01,509
a population would never have reached
one billion people

8104
02:19:01,509 --> 02:19:01,519
one billion people
 

8105
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:03,429
one billion people
uh and we were still living like fairly

8106
02:19:03,429 --> 02:19:03,439
uh and we were still living like fairly
 

8107
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:05,830
uh and we were still living like fairly
sophisticated animals but you know like

8108
02:19:05,830 --> 02:19:05,840
sophisticated animals but you know like
 

8109
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:08,870
sophisticated animals but you know like
17th century level of load on the planet

8110
02:19:08,870 --> 02:19:08,880
17th century level of load on the planet
 

8111
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:10,629
17th century level of load on the planet
then we would have gone down that

8112
02:19:10,629 --> 02:19:10,639
then we would have gone down that
 

8113
02:19:10,639 --> 02:19:13,669
then we would have gone down that
decline and the approaching ice age

8114
02:19:13,669 --> 02:19:13,679
decline and the approaching ice age
 

8115
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:16,070
decline and the approaching ice age
would have started to wipe out our our

8116
02:19:16,070 --> 02:19:16,080
would have started to wipe out our our
 

8117
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:17,669
would have started to wipe out our our
farming areas the glaciers would have

8118
02:19:17,669 --> 02:19:17,679
farming areas the glaciers would have
 

8119
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:19,589
farming areas the glaciers would have
encroached and we would have been driven

8120
02:19:19,589 --> 02:19:19,599
encroached and we would have been driven
 

8121
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:21,910
encroached and we would have been driven
out of like an agricultural sedentary

8122
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:21,920
out of like an agricultural sedentary
 

8123
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:24,629
out of like an agricultural sedentary
civilization by that change so it's just

8124
02:19:24,629 --> 02:19:24,639
civilization by that change so it's just
 

8125
02:19:24,639 --> 02:19:26,790
civilization by that change so it's just
the fact that we evolved

8126
02:19:26,790 --> 02:19:26,800
the fact that we evolved
 

8127
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:29,270
the fact that we evolved
on this stable period in in the overall

8128
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:29,280
on this stable period in in the overall
 

8129
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:31,349
on this stable period in in the overall
temperature cycle of the planet and that

8130
02:19:31,349 --> 02:19:31,359
temperature cycle of the planet and that
 

8131
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:33,429
temperature cycle of the planet and that
stability is something

8132
02:19:33,429 --> 02:19:33,439
stability is something
 

8133
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:35,349
stability is something
which just reflects the turning point in

8134
02:19:35,349 --> 02:19:35,359
which just reflects the turning point in
 

8135
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:37,750
which just reflects the turning point in
a in the regular cycle of malicious

8136
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:37,760
a in the regular cycle of malicious
 

8137
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,110
a in the regular cycle of malicious
cycle i think it's called i've forgotten

8138
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:39,120
cycle i think it's called i've forgotten
 

8139
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:41,429
cycle i think it's called i've forgotten
the actual name but it's a cycle caused

8140
02:19:41,429 --> 02:19:41,439
the actual name but it's a cycle caused
 

8141
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:42,389
the actual name but it's a cycle caused
by

8142
02:19:42,389 --> 02:19:42,399
by
 

8143
02:19:42,399 --> 02:19:43,910
by
you know changing the earth's or orbit

8144
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:43,920
you know changing the earth's or orbit
 

8145
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:45,429
you know changing the earth's or orbit
around the sun

8146
02:19:45,429 --> 02:19:45,439
around the sun
 

8147
02:19:45,439 --> 02:19:49,830
around the sun
reflectivity and so on that that cycle

8148
02:19:49,830 --> 02:19:49,840
reflectivity and so on that that cycle
 

8149
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:51,990
reflectivity and so on that that cycle
it's just that tiny top bit that we

8150
02:19:51,990 --> 02:19:52,000
it's just that tiny top bit that we
 

8151
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,110
it's just that tiny top bit that we
evolved in

8152
02:19:53,110 --> 02:19:53,120
evolved in
 

8153
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:54,550
evolved in
so what we should have done so that's

8154
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:54,560
so what we should have done so that's
 

8155
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:55,990
so what we should have done so that's
that's really useful for us we should

8156
02:19:55,990 --> 02:19:56,000
that's really useful for us we should
 

8157
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,590
that's really useful for us we should
stay at that level

8158
02:19:57,590 --> 02:19:57,600
stay at that level
 

8159
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:59,349
stay at that level
now if we hadn't done it we'd go back

8160
02:19:59,349 --> 02:19:59,359
now if we hadn't done it we'd go back
 

8161
02:19:59,359 --> 02:20:00,469
now if we hadn't done it we'd go back
down here and that would be the end of

8162
02:20:00,469 --> 02:20:00,479
down here and that would be the end of
 

8163
02:20:00,479 --> 02:20:02,710
down here and that would be the end of
our civilization by an ice age instead

8164
02:20:02,710 --> 02:20:02,720
our civilization by an ice age instead
 

8165
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:04,309
our civilization by an ice age instead
we're going up here

8166
02:20:04,309 --> 02:20:04,319
we're going up here
 

8167
02:20:04,319 --> 02:20:06,950
we're going up here
really rapidly and we're causing a

8168
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:06,960
really rapidly and we're causing a
 

8169
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:10,469
really rapidly and we're causing a
change in temperature compared to that

8170
02:20:10,469 --> 02:20:10,479
change in temperature compared to that
 

8171
02:20:10,479 --> 02:20:14,550
change in temperature compared to that
long-term cycle 100 000 times faster

8172
02:20:14,550 --> 02:20:14,560
long-term cycle 100 000 times faster
 

8173
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:18,710
long-term cycle 100 000 times faster
so yeah i mean my my biggest worry is uh

8174
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:18,720
so yeah i mean my my biggest worry is uh
 

8175
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:22,230
so yeah i mean my my biggest worry is uh
even subtle changes in climate

8176
02:20:22,230 --> 02:20:22,240
even subtle changes in climate
 

8177
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:25,030
even subtle changes in climate
might result pressure in geopolitical

8178
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:25,040
might result pressure in geopolitical
 

8179
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:26,150
might result pressure in geopolitical
pressures

8180
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:26,160
pressures
 

8181
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:28,790
pressures
that that then lead to nuclear war and

8182
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:28,800
that that then lead to nuclear war and
 

8183
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,950
that that then lead to nuclear war and
that's yeah i mean there's an argument

8184
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:30,960
that's yeah i mean there's an argument
 

8185
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:32,550
that's yeah i mean there's an argument
that's actually behind

8186
02:20:32,550 --> 02:20:32,560
that's actually behind
 

8187
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:34,710
that's actually behind
to some extent not the ukraine war so

8188
02:20:34,710 --> 02:20:34,720
to some extent not the ukraine war so
 

8189
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:37,270
to some extent not the ukraine war so
much but the arab spring the wars in

8190
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:37,280
much but the arab spring the wars in
 

8191
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,590
much but the arab spring the wars in
syria which partially has led to what's

8192
02:20:39,590 --> 02:20:39,600
syria which partially has led to what's
 

8193
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:42,630
syria which partially has led to what's
happening in ukraine so and our weapons

8194
02:20:42,630 --> 02:20:42,640
happening in ukraine so and our weapons
 

8195
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:44,150
happening in ukraine so and our weapons
are getting more and more powerful and

8196
02:20:44,150 --> 02:20:44,160
are getting more and more powerful and
 

8197
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,750
are getting more and more powerful and
more and more destructive more and more

8198
02:20:45,750 --> 02:20:45,760
more and more destructive more and more
 

8199
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:47,429
more and more destructive more and more
nations are having these destructive

8200
02:20:47,429 --> 02:20:47,439
nations are having these destructive
 

8201
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:48,790
nations are having these destructive
weapons

8202
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:48,800
weapons
 

8203
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:51,590
weapons
and now we're entering cyber

8204
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:51,600
and now we're entering cyber
 

8205
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:53,750
and now we're entering cyber
space where it's even easier to be

8206
02:20:53,750 --> 02:20:53,760
space where it's even easier to be
 

8207
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:55,030
space where it's even easier to be
destructive

8208
02:20:55,030 --> 02:20:55,040
destructive
 

8209
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:56,870
destructive
weapons which didn't exist in the second

8210
02:20:56,870 --> 02:20:56,880
weapons which didn't exist in the second
 

8211
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:58,870
weapons which didn't exist in the second
world war so you know

8212
02:20:58,870 --> 02:20:58,880
world war so you know
 

8213
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:00,630
world war so you know
you don't need nuclear weapons to have

8214
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:00,640
you don't need nuclear weapons to have
 

8215
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:02,630
you don't need nuclear weapons to have
you know catastrophic attacks on each

8216
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:02,640
you know catastrophic attacks on each
 

8217
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:05,110
you know catastrophic attacks on each
other so yeah it's incredibly scary that

8218
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:05,120
other so yeah it's incredibly scary that
 

8219
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:08,309
other so yeah it's incredibly scary that
that the war-like side of human nature

8220
02:21:08,309 --> 02:21:08,319
that the war-like side of human nature
 

8221
02:21:08,319 --> 02:21:09,270
that the war-like side of human nature
could be

8222
02:21:09,270 --> 02:21:09,280
could be
 

8223
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:10,150
could be
and

8224
02:21:10,150 --> 02:21:10,160
and
 

8225
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:11,429
and
extremely

8226
02:21:11,429 --> 02:21:11,439
extremely
 

8227
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:14,389
extremely
enhanced by climate breakdown

8228
02:21:14,389 --> 02:21:14,399
enhanced by climate breakdown
 

8229
02:21:14,399 --> 02:21:16,550
enhanced by climate breakdown
so in this world

8230
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:16,560
so in this world
 

8231
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:18,710
so in this world
on a happy note

8232
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:18,720
on a happy note
 

8233
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,630
on a happy note
i don't know how we went from marxism

8234
02:21:20,630 --> 02:21:20,640
i don't know how we went from marxism
 

8235
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:22,630
i don't know how we went from marxism
and stalinism to

8236
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:22,640
and stalinism to
 

8237
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:24,469
and stalinism to
ecology but all those are beautiful

8238
02:21:24,469 --> 02:21:24,479
ecology but all those are beautiful
 

8239
02:21:24,479 --> 02:21:27,750
ecology but all those are beautiful
complex systems uh

8240
02:21:27,750 --> 02:21:27,760
complex systems uh
 

8241
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:29,830
complex systems uh
what is the best form of government

8242
02:21:29,830 --> 02:21:29,840
what is the best form of government
 

8243
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:31,830
what is the best form of government
would you say on the public we talked

8244
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:31,840
would you say on the public we talked
 

8245
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:36,230
would you say on the public we talked
about the economics of things

8246
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:36,240

 

8247
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:38,550

you ran for office so you care about

8248
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:38,560
you ran for office so you care about
 

8249
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:41,349
you ran for office so you care about
politics too how can politics what

8250
02:21:41,349 --> 02:21:41,359
politics too how can politics what
 

8251
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:43,670
politics too how can politics what
political systems can help us here i

8252
02:21:43,670 --> 02:21:43,680
political systems can help us here i
 

8253
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:45,510
political systems can help us here i
think we first of all have to appreciate

8254
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:45,520
think we first of all have to appreciate
 

8255
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:47,510
think we first of all have to appreciate

and
 

8263
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:52,950
and
as the intelligence species we should be

life
for those other species as well can we

8270
02:21:58,469 --> 02:21:58,479
for those other species as well can we
 

8271
02:21:58,479 --> 02:22:01,270
for those other species as well can we
actually linger on that what is

8272
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:01,280
actually linger on that what is
 

8273
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:03,349
actually linger on that what is
you mentioned we need to acknowledge the

8274
02:22:03,349 --> 02:22:03,359
you mentioned we need to acknowledge the
 

8275
02:22:03,359 --> 02:22:07,670
you mentioned we need to acknowledge the
value of life on earth

8276
02:22:07,670 --> 02:22:07,680

 

8277
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:10,070

you know can we integrate

8278
02:22:10,070 --> 02:22:10,080
you know can we integrate
 

8279
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:11,510
you know can we integrate
uh

8280
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:11,520
uh
 

8281
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:14,230
uh
the labor theory of value

8282
02:22:14,230 --> 02:22:14,240
the labor theory of value
 

8283
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:16,630
the labor theory of value
can we integrate into that the value of

8284
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:16,640
can we integrate into that the value of
 

8285
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:17,590
can we integrate into that the value of
life

life
 

8287
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:21,349
life
um so there's human life i i think

8288
02:22:21,349 --> 02:22:21,359
um so there's human life i i think
 

8289
02:22:21,359 --> 02:22:23,349
um so there's human life i i think
if you if you take like that structure

02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:25,590
if you if you take like that structure
that i talked about of marx's use value

there is free lunch withdrawal and it's

8310
02:22:44,309 --> 02:22:44,319
there is free lunch withdrawal and it's
 

8311
02:22:44,319 --> 02:22:46,230
there is free lunch withdrawal and it's
grounded in the energy that's provided

8312

grounded in the energy that's provided
 

8313
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:47,510
grounded in the energy that's provided
to us but well yeah that's the free

okay b you can't break even

8328
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:03,760
okay b you can't break even
 

8329
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:07,270
okay b you can't break even
yep see you can't leave the game

8330
02:23:07,270 --> 02:23:07,280
yep see you can't leave the game
 

8331
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:09,349

summer okay uh but the fact that exists

8334
02:23:11,510 --> 02:23:11,520
summer okay uh but the fact that exists
 

8335
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:13,349
summer okay uh but the fact that exists
in the first place is the free lunch

8336
02:23:13,349 --> 02:23:13,359
in the first place is the free lunch
 

8337
02:23:13,359 --> 02:23:15,590
in the first place is the free lunch
okay so we're exporting the free lunch

8338
02:23:15,590 --> 02:23:15,600
okay so we're exporting the free lunch
 

8339
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:17,910
okay so we're exporting the free lunch
but to be able to do it we can't put

8340
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:17,920
but to be able to do it we can't put
 

8341
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:19,670
but to be able to do it we can't put
waste back into that system so much that

8342
02:23:19,670 --> 02:23:19,680
waste back into that system so much that
 

8343
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:21,750
waste back into that system so much that
it undermines the free lunch and that's

8344
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:21,760
it undermines the free lunch and that's
 

8345
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:23,349
it undermines the free lunch and that's
what we've been doing

8346
02:23:23,349 --> 02:23:23,359
what we've been doing
 

8347
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:26,469
what we've been doing
and once you respect the fact that we

8348
02:23:26,469 --> 02:23:26,479
and once you respect the fact that we
 

8349
02:23:26,479 --> 02:23:27,750
and once you respect the fact that we
have to

8350
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:27,760
have to
 

8351
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:29,910
have to
living on on the biosphere the planet

8352
02:23:29,910 --> 02:23:29,920
living on on the biosphere the planet
 

8353
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:31,910
living on on the biosphere the planet
we're actually on

8354
02:23:31,910 --> 02:23:31,920
we're actually on
 

8355
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:33,990
we're actually on
we have to enable that biosphere to

8356
02:23:33,990 --> 02:23:34,000
we have to enable that biosphere to
 

8357
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,590
we have to enable that biosphere to
survive us

8358
02:23:35,590 --> 02:23:35,600
survive us
 

8359
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:37,510
survive us
because if it doesn't survive us we

8360
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:37,520
because if it doesn't survive us we
 

8361
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:40,070
because if it doesn't survive us we
won't survive it disappearing and

8362
02:23:40,070 --> 02:23:40,080
won't survive it disappearing and
 

8363
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:42,389
won't survive it disappearing and
there's not that realization in humanity

8364
02:23:42,389 --> 02:23:42,399
there's not that realization in humanity
 

8365
02:23:42,399 --> 02:23:45,190
there's not that realization in humanity
in general and when you see the value of

biosphere yeah
 

8375
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:53,910

so in order to maintain
 

8377
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:55,830
so in order to maintain
the biosphere we have to

8378
02:23:55,830 --> 02:23:55,840
the biosphere we have to
 

8379
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:57,349
the biosphere we have to
respect like

8380
02:23:57,349 --> 02:23:57,359
respect like
 

8381
02:23:57,359 --> 02:23:59,190
respect like
pragmatically speaking what that means

8382
02:23:59,190 --> 02:23:59,200
pragmatically speaking what that means
 

8383
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,110
pragmatically speaking what that means
is actually respecting all of life on

8384
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:01,120
is actually respecting all of life on
 

8385
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:02,870
is actually respecting all of life on

we are living in a simulation okay and i

8408
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:28,000
we are living in a simulation okay and i
 

8409
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,070
we are living in a simulation okay and i
have a conversation offline to have with

okay now there's truth that we have

8426
02:24:46,309 --> 02:24:46,319
okay now there's truth that we have
 

8427
02:24:46,319 --> 02:24:48,870
okay now there's truth that we have
intruded into everything okay we've

8428
02:24:48,870 --> 02:24:48,880
intruded into everything okay we've
 

8429
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:51,030
intruded into everything okay we've
taken over every element of the of the

8430
02:24:51,030 --> 02:24:51,040
taken over every element of the of the
 

8431
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:52,230
taken over every element of the of the
biosphere

8432
02:24:52,230 --> 02:24:52,240
biosphere
 

8433
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:54,389
biosphere
and and we think we can continue doing

8434
02:24:54,389 --> 02:24:54,399
and and we think we can continue doing
 

8435
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:55,190
and and we think we can continue doing
that

8436
02:24:55,190 --> 02:24:55,200
that
 

8437
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:57,030
that
the thing is we're breaking that

8438
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:57,040
the thing is we're breaking that
 

8439
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:58,469
the thing is we're breaking that
we're exporting it so much we're

8440
02:24:58,469 --> 02:24:58,479
we're exporting it so much we're
 

8441
02:24:58,479 --> 02:25:00,630
we're exporting it so much we're
breaking it down and yeah i think a ceo

8442
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:00,640
breaking it down and yeah i think a ceo
 

8443
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:03,349
breaking it down and yeah i think a ceo
wilson who argued with the 50 rule he

8444
02:25:03,349 --> 02:25:03,359
wilson who argued with the 50 rule he
 

8445
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:06,230
wilson who argued with the 50 rule he
believed that we should reserve 50 of

8446
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:06,240
believed that we should reserve 50 of
 

8447
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:07,429
believed that we should reserve 50 of
the planet

8448
02:25:07,429 --> 02:25:07,439
the planet
 

8449
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:10,790
the planet
for non-human species in other words we

8450
02:25:10,790 --> 02:25:10,800
for non-human species in other words we
 

8451
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:13,670
for non-human species in other words we
make 50 of it off limits humans cannot

8452
02:25:13,670 --> 02:25:13,680
make 50 of it off limits humans cannot
 

8453
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:14,870
make 50 of it off limits humans cannot
go there

8454
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:14,880
go there
 

8455
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:17,349
go there
and we just let that evolve as it does

8456
02:25:17,349 --> 02:25:17,359
and we just let that evolve as it does
 

8457
02:25:17,359 --> 02:25:19,910
and we just let that evolve as it does
and then we control the other 50 i think

8458
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:19,920
and then we control the other 50 i think
 

8459
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:22,230
and then we control the other 50 i think
it's probably giving too much to us

8460
02:25:22,230 --> 02:25:22,240
it's probably giving too much to us
 

8461
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:24,230
it's probably giving too much to us
i think we should actually save like 20

8462
02:25:24,230 --> 02:25:24,240
i think we should actually save like 20
 

8463
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:27,670
i think we should actually save like 20
25 max and the rest of the planet

8464
02:25:27,670 --> 02:25:27,680
25 max and the rest of the planet
 

8465
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:31,670
25 max and the rest of the planet
we let life go on and evolve as it does

8466
02:25:31,670 --> 02:25:31,680
we let life go on and evolve as it does
 

8467
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:33,110
we let life go on and evolve as it does
without our interference without our

dominance
 

8471
02:25:34,319 --> 02:25:35,910
dominance
now

8472
02:25:35,910 --> 02:25:35,920
now
 

8473
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:37,910
now
that's neither a dometic democratic

8474
02:25:37,910 --> 02:25:37,920
that's neither a dometic democratic
 

8475
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:40,309
that's neither a dometic democratic
system nor an authoritarian one it's one

8476
02:25:40,309 --> 02:25:40,319
system nor an authoritarian one it's one
 

8477
02:25:40,319 --> 02:25:42,070
system nor an authoritarian one it's one
which starts off with saying we the

8478
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:42,080
which starts off with saying we the
 

8479
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:43,830
which starts off with saying we the
first thing humans have to do is respect

8480
02:25:43,830 --> 02:25:43,840
first thing humans have to do is respect
 

8481
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,670
first thing humans have to do is respect
life itself

8482
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:45,680
life itself
 

8483
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:47,110
life itself
okay so

8484
02:25:47,110 --> 02:25:47,120
okay so
 

8485
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:49,830
okay so
would we do that

8486
02:25:49,830 --> 02:25:49,840
would we do that
 

8487
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:52,230
would we do that
we haven't done it obviously i don't

8488
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:52,240
we haven't done it obviously i don't
 

8489
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:53,510
we haven't done it obviously i don't
think the soviets would have done it if

8490
02:25:53,510 --> 02:25:53,520
think the soviets would have done it if
 

8491
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:55,910
think the soviets would have done it if
we had a generally soviet system we

8492
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:55,920
we had a generally soviet system we
 

8493
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:58,230
we had a generally soviet system we
haven't done under capitalist uh we

8494
02:25:58,230 --> 02:25:58,240
haven't done under capitalist uh we
 

8495
02:25:58,240 --> 02:26:01,270
haven't done under capitalist uh we
continue intruding so we we i think we

8496
02:26:01,270 --> 02:26:01,280
continue intruding so we we i think we
 

8497
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:03,349
continue intruding so we we i think we
have to go through something like a star

8498
02:26:03,349 --> 02:26:03,359
have to go through something like a star
 

8499
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:05,270
have to go through something like a star
trek a star trek you know catastrophic

trek a star trek you know catastrophic
 

8501
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:06,790

200 years
 

8503
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:08,150
200 years
to realize that ultimately if we're

8504
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,160
to realize that ultimately if we're
 

8505
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:10,070
to realize that ultimately if we're
going to survive as a species we have to

8506
02:26:10,070 --> 02:26:10,080
going to survive as a species we have to
 

8507
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:12,389
going to survive as a species we have to
respect life in general and then that

8508
02:26:12,389 --> 02:26:12,399
respect life in general and then that
 

8509
02:26:12,399 --> 02:26:15,349
respect life in general and then that
means we parts of parts of the planet we

8510
02:26:15,349 --> 02:26:15,359
means we parts of parts of the planet we
 

8511
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:17,670
means we parts of parts of the planet we
can no longer touch

8512
02:26:17,670 --> 02:26:17,680
can no longer touch
 

8513
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:19,830
can no longer touch
while we also try to maintain the planet

8514
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:19,840
while we also try to maintain the planet
 

8515
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:21,510
while we also try to maintain the planet
at the temperature that we found it in

8516
02:26:21,510 --> 02:26:21,520
at the temperature that we found it in
 

8517
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:23,670
at the temperature that we found it in
what we now call the anthropocene

8518
02:26:23,670 --> 02:26:23,680
what we now call the anthropocene
 

8519
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:25,349
what we now call the anthropocene
okay

8520
02:26:25,349 --> 02:26:25,359
okay
 

8521
02:26:25,359 --> 02:26:26,150
okay
so

8522
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:26,160
so
 

8523
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:27,590
so
politically

8524
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:27,600
politically
 

8525
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:29,910
politically
we have to have

8526
02:26:29,910 --> 02:26:29,920
we have to have
 

8527
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:31,910
we have to have
like in in many ways what native

8528
02:26:31,910 --> 02:26:31,920
like in in many ways what native
 

8529
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:34,150
like in in many ways what native
societies often have a vision of the

8530
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:34,160
societies often have a vision of the
 

8531
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:36,389
societies often have a vision of the
cycle of life not this

8532
02:26:36,389 --> 02:26:36,399
cycle of life not this
 

8533
02:26:36,399 --> 02:26:38,550
cycle of life not this
exponential progression we've developed

8534
02:26:38,550 --> 02:26:38,560
exponential progression we've developed
 

8535
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:41,110
exponential progression we've developed
over the last 250 years

8536
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:41,120
over the last 250 years
 

8537
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:43,030
over the last 250 years
um and again i'll use another movie the

8538
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:43,040
um and again i'll use another movie the
 

8539
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:45,110
um and again i'll use another movie the
avatar type respect for the cycle of

8540
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:45,120
avatar type respect for the cycle of
 

8541
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:45,990
avatar type respect for the cycle of
life

8542
02:26:45,990 --> 02:26:46,000
life
 

8543
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,070
life
we need to have that as part of our

8544
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:48,080
we need to have that as part of our
 

8545
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:51,670
we need to have that as part of our
innate nature and then on top of that

8546
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:51,680
innate nature and then on top of that
 

8547
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:54,150
innate nature and then on top of that
the political system comes out now that

8548
02:26:54,150 --> 02:26:54,160
the political system comes out now that
 

8549
02:26:54,160 --> 02:26:56,790
the political system comes out now that
political system has to be one that lets

8550
02:26:56,790 --> 02:26:56,800
political system has to be one that lets
 

8551
02:26:56,800 --> 02:27:00,550
political system has to be one that lets
us feel like we have a say in

8552
02:27:00,550 --> 02:27:00,560
us feel like we have a say in
 

8553
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:02,870
us feel like we have a say in
the direction of society while that part

8554
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:02,880
the direction of society while that part
 

8555
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:05,750
the direction of society while that part
is sacrosanct okay we can't touch it

8556
02:27:05,750 --> 02:27:05,760
is sacrosanct okay we can't touch it
 

8557
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:07,910
is sacrosanct okay we can't touch it
but we also because we are now living

8558
02:27:07,910 --> 02:27:07,920
but we also because we are now living
 

8559
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:09,910
but we also because we are now living
with so many challenges created by our

8560
02:27:09,910 --> 02:27:09,920
with so many challenges created by our
 

8561
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:12,550
with so many challenges created by our
own civilization i mean the main threat

8562
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:12,560
own civilization i mean the main threat
 

8563
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:14,950
own civilization i mean the main threat
to the existence of human civilization

8564
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:14,960
to the existence of human civilization
 

8565
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:17,349
to the existence of human civilization
is the existence of human civilization

8566
02:27:17,349 --> 02:27:17,359
is the existence of human civilization
 

8567
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:19,990
is the existence of human civilization
it's both a feature and a bug yeah and

8568
02:27:19,990 --> 02:27:20,000
it's both a feature and a bug yeah and
 

8569
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,190
it's both a feature and a bug yeah and
therefore

8570
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:21,200
therefore
 

8571
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,550
therefore
we need to have people who can

8572
02:27:22,550 --> 02:27:22,560
we need to have people who can
 

8573
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:24,309
we need to have people who can
understand complex systems making those

8574
02:27:24,309 --> 02:27:24,319
understand complex systems making those
 

8575
02:27:24,319 --> 02:27:26,389
understand complex systems making those
decisions now that means it isn't a

8576
02:27:26,389 --> 02:27:26,399
decisions now that means it isn't a
 

8577
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:28,790
decisions now that means it isn't a
political system as much as it is

8578
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:28,800
political system as much as it is
 

8579
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:30,710
political system as much as it is
an appreciation that the world is a

8580
02:27:30,710 --> 02:27:30,720
an appreciation that the world is a
 

8581
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:33,590
an appreciation that the world is a
complex system and therefore

8582
02:27:33,590 --> 02:27:33,600
complex system and therefore
 

8583
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:35,750
complex system and therefore
effects which we think a direct effect

8584
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:35,760
effects which we think a direct effect
 

8585
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:37,110
effects which we think a direct effect
will actually come through an oblique

8586
02:27:37,110 --> 02:27:37,120
will actually come through an oblique
 

8587
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:38,150
will actually come through an oblique
fashion

8588
02:27:38,150 --> 02:27:38,160
fashion
 

8589
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:39,910
fashion
and we cannot

8590
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:39,920
and we cannot
 

8591
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:42,309
and we cannot
there's no simple linear progression

8592
02:27:42,309 --> 02:27:42,319
there's no simple linear progression
 

8593
02:27:42,319 --> 02:27:44,790
there's no simple linear progression
from where we are to where we want to be

8594
02:27:44,790 --> 02:27:44,800
from where we are to where we want to be
 

8595
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:46,309
from where we are to where we want to be
so you have to see how everything feeds

8596
02:27:46,309 --> 02:27:46,319
so you have to see how everything feeds
 

8597
02:27:46,319 --> 02:27:47,910
so you have to see how everything feeds
together in a systemic way and that's

8598
02:27:47,910 --> 02:27:47,920
together in a systemic way and that's
 

8599
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:49,270
together in a systemic way and that's
why well one reason i designed the

8600
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:49,280
why well one reason i designed the
 

8601
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:51,110
why well one reason i designed the
software i'm wearing the t-shirt for now

8602
02:27:51,110 --> 02:27:51,120
software i'm wearing the t-shirt for now
 

8603
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:54,309
software i'm wearing the t-shirt for now
minsky is to have it's nowhere near

8604
02:27:54,309 --> 02:27:54,319
minsky is to have it's nowhere near
 

8605
02:27:54,319 --> 02:27:56,950
minsky is to have it's nowhere near
to this scale i hope it one day will be

8606
02:27:56,950 --> 02:27:56,960
to this scale i hope it one day will be
 

8607
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:58,309
to this scale i hope it one day will be
but something which means we can bring

8608
02:27:58,309 --> 02:27:58,319
but something which means we can bring
 

8609
02:27:58,319 --> 02:27:59,910
but something which means we can bring
together all that complexity all those

8610
02:27:59,910 --> 02:27:59,920
together all that complexity all those
 

8611
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:02,389
together all that complexity all those
systems and perceive them on an enormous

8612
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:02,399
systems and perceive them on an enormous
 

8613
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:04,070
systems and perceive them on an enormous
screen where we have all the various

8614
02:28:04,070 --> 02:28:04,080
screen where we have all the various
 

8615
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,750
screen where we have all the various
interacts and we can see what are

8616
02:28:05,750 --> 02:28:05,760
interacts and we can see what are
 

8617
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:08,630
interacts and we can see what are
potential futures and

8618
02:28:08,630 --> 02:28:08,640
potential futures and
 

8619
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:09,830
potential futures and
and that then

8620
02:28:09,830 --> 02:28:09,840
and that then
 

8621
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:11,349
and that then
guides us so it isn't a case of

8622
02:28:11,349 --> 02:28:11,359
guides us so it isn't a case of
 

8623
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:13,429
guides us so it isn't a case of
democracy and you know

8624
02:28:13,429 --> 02:28:13,439
democracy and you know
 

8625
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:15,910
democracy and you know
our side wins the vote and therefore we

8626
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:15,920
our side wins the vote and therefore we
 

8627
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:17,830
our side wins the vote and therefore we
ban abortion or we don't you know

8628
02:28:17,830 --> 02:28:17,840
ban abortion or we don't you know
 

8629
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:20,230
ban abortion or we don't you know
whatever else happens it's

8630
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:20,240
whatever else happens it's
 

8631
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:21,910
whatever else happens it's
seeing what the

8632
02:28:21,910 --> 02:28:21,920
seeing what the
 

8633
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:23,270
seeing what the
respecting the fact that we're in a

8634
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:23,280
respecting the fact that we're in a
 

8635
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:26,389
respecting the fact that we're in a
complex system and being uncertain about

8636
02:28:26,389 --> 02:28:26,399
complex system and being uncertain about
 

8637
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:29,670
complex system and being uncertain about
the consequences and not making the

8638
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:29,680
the consequences and not making the
 

8639
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:33,349
the consequences and not making the
bold uh expansionary

8640
02:28:33,349 --> 02:28:33,359
bold uh expansionary
 

8641
02:28:33,359 --> 02:28:35,590
bold uh expansionary
ideas that we've been doing

8642
02:28:35,590 --> 02:28:35,600
ideas that we've been doing
 

8643
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:38,070
ideas that we've been doing
so like being a little bit more and so

8644
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:38,080
so like being a little bit more and so
 

8645
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:41,429
so like being a little bit more and so
uh

8646
02:28:41,429 --> 02:28:41,439

 

8647
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:42,550

humble

02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:45,349
humble
humble humble is a good word but

humble humble is a good word but
 

8651
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:46,710
humble humble is a good word but
wouldn't you

8652
02:28:46,710 --> 02:28:46,720
wouldn't you
 

8653
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:49,830
wouldn't you
like to apply that same humility both

8654
02:28:49,830 --> 02:28:49,840
like to apply that same humility both
 

8655
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:53,750
like to apply that same humility both
to the considerations of

8656
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:53,760
to the considerations of
 

8657
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:56,870
to the considerations of
the the uh the pros of capitalism and

8658
02:28:56,870 --> 02:28:56,880
the the uh the pros of capitalism and
 

8659
02:28:56,880 --> 02:28:59,590
the the uh the pros of capitalism and
and to the catastrophic view of the

8660
02:28:59,590 --> 02:28:59,600
and to the catastrophic view of the
 

8661
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:01,270
and to the catastrophic view of the
effects of climate change yeah and also

8662
02:29:01,270 --> 02:29:01,280
effects of climate change yeah and also
 

8663
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:02,870
effects of climate change yeah and also
like i think we can we can afford to be

a manifesto publisher chose the title

8698
02:29:39,990 --> 02:29:40,000
a manifesto publisher chose the title
 

8699
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:44,230
a manifesto publisher chose the title
yes no but i'm joking but um

8700
02:29:44,230 --> 02:29:44,240
yes no but i'm joking but um
 

8701
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:46,710
yes no but i'm joking but um
maybe i will ask you about why manifesto

8702
02:29:46,710 --> 02:29:46,720
maybe i will ask you about why manifesto
 

8703
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:48,230
maybe i will ask you about why manifesto
but we'll go through some of the ideas

8704
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:48,240
but we'll go through some of the ideas
 

8705
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:51,190
but we'll go through some of the ideas
in this book we have been already uh

8706
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:51,200
in this book we have been already uh
 

8707
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:53,830
in this book we have been already uh
so some of it is embracing the fact that

8708
02:29:53,830 --> 02:29:53,840
so some of it is embracing the fact that
 

8709
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:55,429
so some of it is embracing the fact that

02:30:01,030 --> 02:30:01,040
so this t-shirt that you're wearing yep
 

8715
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:06,309
so this t-shirt that you're wearing yep
second out yep is uh the software

there you go you're wearing them
 

8721
02:30:10,319 --> 02:30:13,030
there you go you're wearing them
okay that's just infomercial

8722
02:30:13,030 --> 02:30:13,040
okay that's just infomercial
 

8723
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:16,830
okay that's just infomercial
so there's a t-shirt that says minsky

8724
02:30:16,830 --> 02:30:16,840
so there's a t-shirt that says minsky
 

8725
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:18,870
so there's a t-shirt that says minsky
um after

8726
02:30:18,870 --> 02:30:18,880
um after
 

8727
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:22,550
um after
not not not my minsky it's german

8728
02:30:22,550 --> 02:30:22,560
not not not my minsky it's german
 

8729
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:24,469
not not not my minsky it's german
yeah so no they're heimann minsky not uh

8730
02:30:24,469 --> 02:30:24,479
yeah so no they're heimann minsky not uh
 

8731
02:30:24,479 --> 02:30:27,270
yeah so no they're heimann minsky not uh
marvin means not marvin right so

8732
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,280
marvin means not marvin right so
 

8733
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:31,110
marvin means not marvin right so
that's so a.i minsky ismar and then uh

8734
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:31,120
that's so a.i minsky ismar and then uh
 

8735
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:32,150
that's so a.i minsky ismar and then uh
harmon

it's destabilizing ability is
destabilizing so that's sort of

8756
02:30:54,389 --> 02:30:54,399
destabilizing so that's sort of
 

8757
02:30:54,399 --> 02:30:57,190
destabilizing so that's sort of
embracing the the complex

8758
02:30:57,190 --> 02:30:57,200
embracing the the complex
 

8759
02:30:57,200 --> 02:31:00,230
embracing the the complex
aspect of it yeah so how can you model

8760
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:00,240
aspect of it yeah so how can you model
 

8761
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:03,030
aspect of it yeah so how can you model
the economy what are some of the

8762

the economy what are some of the
 

8763
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:04,710
the economy what are some of the
interesting

8764
02:31:04,710 --> 02:31:04,720
interesting
 

8765
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:06,870

well they're detailed or high level big

8766
02:31:06,870 --> 02:31:06,880
well they're detailed or high level big
 

8767
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:08,790
well they're detailed or high level big
picture ideas behind

8768
02:31:08,790 --> 02:31:08,800
picture ideas behind
 

8769
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:12,630
picture ideas behind
your efforts with minsky okay minsky

8770
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:12,640
your efforts with minsky okay minsky
 

8771
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:14,150
your efforts with minsky okay minsky
meaning the software the modeling

8772
02:31:14,150 --> 02:31:14,160
meaning the software the modeling
 

8773
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:16,710
meaning the software the modeling
software the that models the dynamics

8774
02:31:16,710 --> 02:31:16,720
software the that models the dynamics
 

8775
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:18,469
software the that models the dynamics
basically what minsky is doing is system

8776
02:31:18,469 --> 02:31:18,479
basically what minsky is doing is system
 

8777
02:31:18,479 --> 02:31:21,110
basically what minsky is doing is system
dynamics modeling so it's if anybody's

8778
02:31:21,110 --> 02:31:21,120
dynamics modeling so it's if anybody's
 

8779
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:25,110
dynamics modeling so it's if anybody's
used stella or ven sim or simulink um

8780
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:25,120
used stella or ven sim or simulink um
 

8781
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:26,469
used stella or ven sim or simulink um
then they've used exactly the same

8782
02:31:26,469 --> 02:31:26,479
then they've used exactly the same
 

8783
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:28,150
then they've used exactly the same
family of software that minsky is part

8784
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:28,160
family of software that minsky is part
 

8785
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:29,510
family of software that minsky is part
of so i didn't invent that that was

8786
02:31:29,510 --> 02:31:29,520
of so i didn't invent that that was
 

8787
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:31,590
of so i didn't invent that that was
invented by jay forrester who's one of

8788
02:31:31,590 --> 02:31:31,600
invented by jay forrester who's one of
 

8789
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:33,429
invented by jay forrester who's one of
the great intellects one of the great

8790
02:31:33,429 --> 02:31:33,439
the great intellects one of the great
 

8791
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:34,710
the great intellects one of the great
engineers

8792
02:31:34,710 --> 02:31:34,720
engineers
 

8793
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:38,309
engineers
in american history and the idea of of

8794
02:31:38,309 --> 02:31:38,319
in american history and the idea of of
 

8795
02:31:38,319 --> 02:31:40,309
in american history and the idea of of
forrester's system was

8796
02:31:40,309 --> 02:31:40,319
forrester's system was
 

8797
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:42,870
forrester's system was
complex interactions so he was doing his

8798
02:31:42,870 --> 02:31:42,880
complex interactions so he was doing his
 

8799
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:46,950
complex interactions so he was doing his
work in the 50s um uh he if people don't

8800
02:31:46,950 --> 02:31:46,960
work in the 50s um uh he if people don't
 

8801
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:48,469
work in the 50s um uh he if people don't
don't know forrester's work he actually

8802
02:31:48,469 --> 02:31:48,479
don't know forrester's work he actually
 

8803
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:51,270
don't know forrester's work he actually
built the models of the um uh the

8804
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:51,280
built the models of the um uh the
 

8805
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:53,110
built the models of the um uh the
mathematics for the gun turrets on

8806
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:53,120
mathematics for the gun turrets on
 

8807
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:54,870
mathematics for the gun turrets on
american warships in the second world

8808
02:31:54,870 --> 02:31:54,880
american warships in the second world
 

8809
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:57,349
american warships in the second world
war mechanical systems obviously

8810
02:31:57,349 --> 02:31:57,359
war mechanical systems obviously
 

8811
02:31:57,359 --> 02:31:59,429
war mechanical systems obviously
so he had to work out a you know

8812
02:31:59,429 --> 02:31:59,439
so he had to work out a you know
 

8813
02:31:59,439 --> 02:32:01,190
so he had to work out a you know
how to give a feedback system that meant

8814
02:32:01,190 --> 02:32:01,200
how to give a feedback system that meant
 

8815
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,110
how to give a feedback system that meant
when the boat rolled in one direction

8816
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:03,120
when the boat rolled in one direction
 

8817
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:05,110
when the boat rolled in one direction
the turret did not roll the other way

8818
02:32:05,110 --> 02:32:05,120
the turret did not roll the other way
 

8819
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,670
the turret did not roll the other way
all that stuff was his work so marvelous

8820
02:32:07,670 --> 02:32:07,680
all that stuff was his work so marvelous
 

8821
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:09,429
all that stuff was his work so marvelous
engineering and then he realized if you

8822
02:32:09,429 --> 02:32:09,439
engineering and then he realized if you
 

8823
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:11,910
engineering and then he realized if you
want to look at a even like a factory a

8824
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:11,920
want to look at a even like a factory a
 

8825
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:13,910
want to look at a even like a factory a
factory is a complex system and so you

8826
02:32:13,910 --> 02:32:13,920
factory is a complex system and so you
 

8827
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:15,510
factory is a complex system and so you
get cycles generated out of the

8828
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:15,520
get cycles generated out of the
 

8829
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:16,870
get cycles generated out of the
interaction between

8830
02:32:16,870 --> 02:32:16,880
interaction between
 

8831
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:18,950
interaction between
different components of the factory that

8832
02:32:18,950 --> 02:32:18,960
different components of the factory that
 

8833
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:20,710
different components of the factory that
he was first involved in taming that he

8834
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:20,720
he was first involved in taming that he
 

8835
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,469
he was first involved in taming that he
built the software to model complex

8836
02:32:22,469 --> 02:32:22,479
built the software to model complex
 

8837
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:24,550
built the software to model complex
interactive systems so minsky is that

8838
02:32:24,550 --> 02:32:24,560
interactive systems so minsky is that
 

8839
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:26,309
interactive systems so minsky is that
the thing at minsky adds which is unique

8840
02:32:26,309 --> 02:32:26,319
the thing at minsky adds which is unique
 

8841
02:32:26,319 --> 02:32:28,469
the thing at minsky adds which is unique
is the godly table and that's the double

8842
02:32:28,469 --> 02:32:28,479
is the godly table and that's the double
 

8843
02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:29,990
is the godly table and that's the double
entry bookkeeping so you can model the

8844
02:32:29,990 --> 02:32:30,000
entry bookkeeping so you can model the
 

8845
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,150
entry bookkeeping so you can model the
financial system godly the economist

8846
02:32:32,150 --> 02:32:32,160
financial system godly the economist
 

8847
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:34,230
financial system godly the economist
godly the economy win godly another

8848
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:34,240
godly the economy win godly another
 

8849
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:36,389
godly the economy win godly another
great great man so there there's like

8850
02:32:36,389 --> 02:32:36,399
great great man so there there's like
 

8851
02:32:36,399 --> 02:32:39,110
great great man so there there's like
this so you you're modeling as it's like

8852
02:32:39,110 --> 02:32:39,120
this so you you're modeling as it's like
 

8853
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:41,510
this so you you're modeling as it's like
a state diagram yeah fundamentally so

8854
02:32:41,510 --> 02:32:41,520
a state diagram yeah fundamentally so
 

8855
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:43,349
a state diagram yeah fundamentally so
it's actually this is circuit diagrams

8856
02:32:43,349 --> 02:32:43,359
it's actually this is circuit diagrams
 

8857
02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:44,710
it's actually this is circuit diagrams
it's exactly what engineers have been

8858
02:32:44,710 --> 02:32:44,720
it's exactly what engineers have been
 

8859
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:45,830
it's exactly what engineers have been
using for

8860
02:32:45,830 --> 02:32:45,840
using for
 

8861
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:48,870
using for
decades almost a century uh so you're

8862
02:32:48,870 --> 02:32:48,880
decades almost a century uh so you're
 

8863
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:50,830
decades almost a century uh so you're
using a circuit diagram to model the

8864
02:32:50,830 --> 02:32:50,840
using a circuit diagram to model the
 

8865
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:54,309
using a circuit diagram to model the
economy and that's that's the

8866
02:32:54,309 --> 02:32:54,319
economy and that's that's the
 

8867
02:32:54,319 --> 02:32:55,830
economy and that's that's the
so other packages have done it what

8868
02:32:55,830 --> 02:32:55,840
so other packages have done it what
 

8869
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,349
so other packages have done it what
they've what they haven't had in the

8870
02:32:57,349 --> 02:32:57,359
they've what they haven't had in the
 

8871
02:32:57,359 --> 02:33:00,630
they've what they haven't had in the
circuit diagram is a way of handling the

8872
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:00,640
circuit diagram is a way of handling the
 

8873
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:02,870
circuit diagram is a way of handling the
dynamics of the financial system so what

8874
02:33:02,870 --> 02:33:02,880
dynamics of the financial system so what
 

8875
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:05,670
dynamics of the financial system so what
the godly table does is bring it um

8876
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:05,680
the godly table does is bring it um
 

8877
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:08,150
the godly table does is bring it um
financial flows as being uh

8878
02:33:08,150 --> 02:33:08,160
financial flows as being uh
 

8879
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:09,670
financial flows as being uh
everything goes from somewhere and ends

8880
02:33:09,670 --> 02:33:09,680
everything goes from somewhere and ends
 

8881
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:11,110
everything goes from somewhere and ends
up somewhere

8882
02:33:11,110 --> 02:33:11,120
up somewhere
 

8883
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:13,110
up somewhere
so you have a positive and a negative if

8884
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:13,120
so you have a positive and a negative if
 

8885
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:15,590
so you have a positive and a negative if
you're looking on the liability side

8886
02:33:15,590 --> 02:33:15,600
you're looking on the liability side
 

8887
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:18,150
you're looking on the liability side
uh a positive and a positive or negative

8888
02:33:18,150 --> 02:33:18,160
uh a positive and a positive or negative
 

8889
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:19,670
uh a positive and a positive or negative
and a negative you're looking at assets

8890
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:19,680
and a negative you're looking at assets
 

8891
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:21,590
and a negative you're looking at assets
and liabilities aside and minsky gets

8892
02:33:21,590 --> 02:33:21,600
and liabilities aside and minsky gets
 

8893
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:23,030
and liabilities aside and minsky gets
the accounting right for that so you can

8894
02:33:23,030 --> 02:33:23,040
the accounting right for that so you can
 

8895
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:25,270
the accounting right for that so you can
do an enormous complex model

8896
02:33:25,270 --> 02:33:25,280
do an enormous complex model
 

8897
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:27,270
do an enormous complex model
looking at the economy financially from

8898
02:33:27,270 --> 02:33:27,280
looking at the economy financially from
 

8899
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:28,630
looking at the economy financially from
the point of view of a dozen different

8900
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:28,640
the point of view of a dozen different
 

8901
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:31,030
the point of view of a dozen different
actors in the economy and know that the

8902
02:33:31,030 --> 02:33:31,040
actors in the economy and know that the
 

8903
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:32,790
actors in the economy and know that the
mathematics is right even though what

8904
02:33:32,790 --> 02:33:32,800
mathematics is right even though what
 

8905
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:34,389
mathematics is right even though what
you're building a set of differential

8906
02:33:34,389 --> 02:33:34,399
you're building a set of differential
 

8907
02:33:34,399 --> 02:33:36,790
you're building a set of differential
equations which might be 50 differential

8908
02:33:36,790 --> 02:33:36,800
equations which might be 50 differential
 

8909
02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:39,990
equations which might be 50 differential
equations with 350 terms in them if you

8910
02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:40,000
equations with 350 terms in them if you
 

8911
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,590
equations with 350 terms in them if you
get the godly tables right you know the

8912
02:33:41,590 --> 02:33:41,600
get the godly tables right you know the
 

8913
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,670
get the godly tables right you know the
mathematics is correct so that's the

8914
02:33:43,670 --> 02:33:43,680
mathematics is correct so that's the
 

8915
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:45,510
mathematics is correct so that's the
main innovation that minsky adds and

8916
02:33:45,510 --> 02:33:45,520
main innovation that minsky adds and
 

8917
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:47,270
main innovation that minsky adds and
you're operating there at the

8918
02:33:47,270 --> 02:33:47,280
you're operating there at the
 

8919
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:49,030
you're operating there at the
macroeconomics level yeah it's

8920
02:33:49,030 --> 02:33:49,040
macroeconomics level yeah it's
 

8921
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:51,030
macroeconomics level yeah it's
definitely macro it's top down it's not

8922
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:51,040
definitely macro it's top down it's not
 

8923
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:53,110
definitely macro it's top down it's not
it's not agent-based and then this i'm

02:33:53,110 --> 02:33:53,120
it's not agent-based and then this i'm
 

8925

8970
02:34:41,590 --> 02:34:41,600
of your book these are did these come
 

8971
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:43,750
of your book these are did these come
from the software yeah yeah i mean i

8972
02:34:43,750 --> 02:34:43,760
from the software yeah yeah i mean i
 

8973
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:46,190
from the software yeah yeah i mean i
first did that in mathematica uh back in

8974
02:34:46,190 --> 02:34:46,200
first did that in mathematica uh back in
 

8975
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:49,270
first did that in mathematica uh back in
1992 august 1992.

uh mathematics is another amazing piece

8978
02:34:51,349 --> 02:34:51,359
uh mathematics is another amazing piece
 

8979
02:34:51,359 --> 02:34:53,270
uh mathematics is another amazing piece
of software yeah and i find it it's very

8980
02:34:53,270 --> 02:34:53,280
of software yeah and i find it it's very
 

8981
02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:54,469
of software yeah and i find it it's very
much a programmer's approach to

8982
02:34:54,469 --> 02:34:54,479
much a programmer's approach to
 

8983
02:34:54,479 --> 02:34:56,230
much a programmer's approach to
mathematics i prefer like a program

8984
02:34:56,230 --> 02:34:56,240
mathematics i prefer like a program
 

8985
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:57,590
mathematics i prefer like a program
called mathcad

8986
02:34:57,590 --> 02:34:57,600
called mathcad
 

8987
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:59,750
called mathcad
which is what i'm using for all my uh

8988
02:34:59,750 --> 02:34:59,760
which is what i'm using for all my uh
 

8989
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:02,309
which is what i'm using for all my uh
when i do my mathematics on the

02:35:02,309 --> 02:35:02,319
when i do my mathematics on the
 

8991
02:35:02,319 --> 02:35:06,070
when i do my mathematics on the
computer i write math cad or cab cad

8992
02:35:06,070 --> 02:35:06,080

i'm definitely a fan of engineers what

9010
02:35:23,910 --> 02:35:23,920
i'm definitely a fan of engineers what
 

9011
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:25,750
i'm definitely a fan of engineers what
are the plots that we're looking at here

9012
02:35:25,750 --> 02:35:25,760
are the plots that we're looking at here

9019
02:35:32,399 --> 02:35:34,550

this is across years like different

02:35:34,550 --> 02:35:34,560
this is across years like different
 

9021
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:36,630
this is across years like different
trade-offs yeah is there something

9022
02:35:36,630 --> 02:35:36,640
trade-offs yeah is there something
 

9023
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:38,230
trade-offs yeah is there something
interesting to say about the plots and

9024
02:35:38,230 --> 02:35:38,240
interesting to say about the plots and
 

9025
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:40,150
interesting to say about the plots and
the insights from those plots that yeah

9026
02:35:40,150 --> 02:35:40,160
the insights from those plots that yeah
 

9027
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:43,030
the insights from those plots that yeah
yeah and software that's um that's

9028
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:43,040
yeah and software that's um that's
 

9029
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:45,030
yeah and software that's um that's
particular parameter values to give that

9030
02:35:45,030 --> 02:35:45,040
particular parameter values to give that
 

9031
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:46,630
particular parameter values to give that
outcome but

9032
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:46,640
outcome but
 

9033
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:48,710
outcome but
what happened when i first simulated the

02:35:58,319 --> 02:36:01,030
and what he did was build a model of
cycles and he he actually wrote a paper

02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:01,040
cycles and he he actually wrote a paper
 

9047
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:02,550

it's only about a five-page paper
 

9051
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,510
it's only about a five-page paper
published in a in a book and a very very

published in a in a book and a very very
 

9053
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:10,070
published in a in a book and a very very

02:36:10,070 --> 02:36:10,080
obscure conference paper and what he was
 

9055
02:36:10,080 --> 02:36:11,510
obscure conference paper and what he was
doing was trying to build a model of

9056
02:36:11,510 --> 02:36:11,520
doing was trying to build a model of

okay so if you he wrote it in 1967 and

9060
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:16,640
okay so if you he wrote it in 1967 and
 

9061
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:18,790
okay so if you he wrote it in 1967 and
it was putting in a mathematical form of

9062
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:18,800
it was putting in a mathematical form of
 

9063
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:21,590
it was putting in a mathematical form of
model that marx came up with an 1867. so

9064
02:36:21,590 --> 02:36:21,600
model that marx came up with an 1867. so
 

9065
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:23,270
model that marx came up with an 1867. so
it was a centenary birthday present to

02:36:23,270 --> 02:36:23,280
it was a centenary birthday present to
 

9067
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:27,110
it was a centenary birthday present to

9070
02:36:28,309 --> 02:36:28,319
chapter
 

9071
02:36:28,319 --> 02:36:30,230
chapter
25 i think

9072
02:36:30,230 --> 02:36:30,240
25 i think
 

9073
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:34,230
25 i think
of volume 1 a capital section 3.

9074
02:36:34,230 --> 02:36:34,240
of volume 1 a capital section 3.
 

9075
02:36:34,240 --> 02:36:35,590
of volume 1 a capital section 3.
he um

9076
02:36:35,590 --> 02:36:35,600
he um
 

9077
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:36,389
he um
he

9078
02:36:36,389 --> 02:36:36,399
he
 

9079
02:36:36,399 --> 02:36:38,230
he
built a verbal model of a cyclical

9080
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:38,240
built a verbal model of a cyclical
 

9081
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:40,230
built a verbal model of a cyclical
system and it's quite out of character

9082
02:36:40,230 --> 02:36:40,240
system and it's quite out of character
 

9083
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:41,670
system and it's quite out of character
with the rest of the book so when you

9084
02:36:41,670 --> 02:36:41,680
with the rest of the book so when you
 

9085
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:43,910
with the rest of the book so when you
read volume 1 of capital people think

9086
02:36:43,910 --> 02:36:43,920
read volume 1 of capital people think
 

9087
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:46,710
read volume 1 of capital people think
marx has got a commodity money

9088

marx has got a commodity money
 

9089
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:48,870
marx has got a commodity money
view of money he doesn't at all he

9090
02:36:48,870 --> 02:36:48,880
view of money he doesn't at all he
 

9091
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:51,190
view of money he doesn't at all he
simply did the idea was he had like an

9095
02:36:52,479 --> 02:36:54,309
onion do you start off on the middle
level and you ignore the outer layer

9096
02:36:54,309 --> 02:36:54,319
level and you ignore the outer layer
 

9097
02:36:54,319 --> 02:36:55,590
level and you ignore the outer layer
then you bring the outer layer and so on

9098
02:36:55,590 --> 02:36:55,600
then you bring the outer layer and so on
 

9099
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:58,150
then you bring the outer layer and so on
and so forth anyway in this model in in

02:36:58,150 --> 02:36:58,160
and so forth anyway in this model in in

assumed workers got a subsistence wage
 

9105
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:04,150

02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:04,160
that's it but in this little chapter he
 

9107
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:05,110
that's it but in this little chapter he
said

9108
02:37:05,110 --> 02:37:05,120
said
 

9109
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:07,270
said
that if um

9110
02:37:07,270 --> 02:37:07,280

then workers will demand wage rises

9118
02:37:13,429 --> 02:37:13,439
then workers will demand wage rises
 

9119
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:15,510
then workers will demand wage rises
okay and the wage rises will cut into

9120
02:37:15,510 --> 02:37:15,520
okay and the wage rises will cut into
 

9121
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:16,630
okay and the wage rises will cut into
the profit

9122
02:37:16,630 --> 02:37:16,640
the profit
 

9123
02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:18,230
the profit
so that capitalists will not get the

9124
02:37:18,230 --> 02:37:18,240
so that capitalists will not get the
 

9125
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:20,070
so that capitalists will not get the
level of profit they're expecting

9126
02:37:20,070 --> 02:37:20,080
level of profit they're expecting
 

9127
02:37:20,080 --> 02:37:22,150
level of profit they're expecting
therefore they will invest less and the

9128
02:37:22,150 --> 02:37:22,160
therefore they will invest less and the
 

9129
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:24,150
therefore they will invest less and the
economy will slump and the slump will

9130
02:37:24,150 --> 02:37:24,160
economy will slump and the slump will
 

9131
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:25,349
economy will slump and the slump will
mean workers

9132
02:37:25,349 --> 02:37:25,359
mean workers
 

9133
02:37:25,359 --> 02:37:27,429
mean workers
become unemployed and have to accept

9134
02:37:27,429 --> 02:37:27,439
become unemployed and have to accept
 

9135
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:29,510
become unemployed and have to accept
wage cuts and it was a model of a

9136
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:29,520
wage cuts and it was a model of a
 

9137
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:31,830
wage cuts and it was a model of a
cyclical economy and as it happens mark

spent his later years trying to learn

9140
02:37:33,990 --> 02:37:34,000
spent his later years trying to learn
 

9141
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,070
spent his later years trying to learn
enough calculus to be able to model it

9142
02:37:36,070 --> 02:37:36,080
enough calculus to be able to model it
 

9143
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:37,990
enough calculus to be able to model it
himself mathematically and he never

9144
02:37:37,990 --> 02:37:38,000
himself mathematically and he never
 

9145
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:39,830
himself mathematically and he never
managed there's marx's and mathematical

9146
02:37:39,830 --> 02:37:39,840
managed there's marx's and mathematical
 

9147
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:41,670
managed there's marx's and mathematical
notes on calculus which are quite fun to

9148
02:37:41,670 --> 02:37:41,680
notes on calculus which are quite fun to
 

9149
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:43,349
notes on calculus which are quite fun to
read and if you have a mathematical

9150
02:37:43,349 --> 02:37:43,359
read and if you have a mathematical
 

9151
02:37:43,359 --> 02:37:45,510
read and if you have a mathematical
background did he get far

9152
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:45,520
background did he get far
 

9153
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:47,349
background did he get far
no he got too caught up in the whole

9154
02:37:47,349 --> 02:37:47,359
no he got too caught up in the whole
 

9155
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:49,349
no he got too caught up in the whole
philosophy and he never really got to

9156
02:37:49,349 --> 02:37:49,359
philosophy and he never really got to
 

9157
02:37:49,359 --> 02:37:52,309
philosophy and he never really got to
build the model but what what um goodwin

9158
02:37:52,309 --> 02:37:52,319
build the model but what what um goodwin
 

9159
02:37:52,319 --> 02:37:54,469
build the model but what what um goodwin
realized was a predator prey model

9160
02:37:54,469 --> 02:37:54,479
realized was a predator prey model
 

9161
02:37:54,479 --> 02:37:56,469
realized was a predator prey model
okay the lock the volterra model was the

9162
02:37:56,469 --> 02:37:56,479
okay the lock the volterra model was the
 

9163
02:37:56,479 --> 02:37:58,550
okay the lock the volterra model was the
basis of the idea say what the idea is

9164
02:37:58,550 --> 02:37:58,560
basis of the idea say what the idea is
 

9165
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:01,670
basis of the idea say what the idea is
you have a have a prey like a and the

9166
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:01,680
you have a have a prey like a and the
 

9167
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:04,070
you have a have a prey like a and the
example that that lochter actually used

9168
02:38:04,070 --> 02:38:04,080
example that that lochter actually used
 

9169
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:07,030
example that that lochter actually used
initially was grass

9170
02:38:07,030 --> 02:38:07,040
initially was grass
 

9171
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:09,030
initially was grass
grasses the prey and then you have a

9172
02:38:09,030 --> 02:38:09,040
grasses the prey and then you have a
 

9173
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:11,910
grasses the prey and then you have a
predator and the predator cows

9174
02:38:11,910 --> 02:38:11,920
predator and the predator cows
 

9175
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:13,910
predator and the predator cows
so you start off with a very few cows

9176
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:13,920
so you start off with a very few cows
 

9177
02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:16,710
so you start off with a very few cows
lots of grass and then because of lots

9178
02:38:16,710 --> 02:38:16,720
lots of grass and then because of lots
 

9179
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:18,950
lots of grass and then because of lots
of grass the numbers of cows grow

9180
02:38:18,950 --> 02:38:18,960
of grass the numbers of cows grow
 

9181
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:20,550
of grass the numbers of cows grow
and then because the cows grow they

9182
02:38:20,550 --> 02:38:20,560
and then because the cows grow they
 

9183
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:22,389
and then because the cows grow they
start to eat the grass so the grass runs

9184
02:38:22,389 --> 02:38:22,399
start to eat the grass so the grass runs
 

9185
02:38:22,399 --> 02:38:24,469
start to eat the grass so the grass runs
out so the cows starve and you get a

9186
02:38:24,469 --> 02:38:24,479
out so the cows starve and you get a
 

9187
02:38:24,479 --> 02:38:26,710
out so the cows starve and you get a
cycle and what lochter was amazed by was

9188
02:38:26,710 --> 02:38:26,720
cycle and what lochter was amazed by was
 

9189
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:28,630
cycle and what lochter was amazed by was
that the cycles were persistent they

9190
02:38:28,630 --> 02:38:28,640
that the cycles were persistent they
 

9191
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:30,870
that the cycles were persistent they
they didn't die out so goodwin got that

9192
02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:30,880
they didn't die out so goodwin got that
 

9193
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:32,870
they didn't die out so goodwin got that
vision and he then built a predator-prey

9194
02:38:32,870 --> 02:38:32,880
vision and he then built a predator-prey
 

9195
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:35,429
vision and he then built a predator-prey
model and i first of all read goodwin

9196
02:38:35,429 --> 02:38:35,439
model and i first of all read goodwin
 

9197
02:38:35,439 --> 02:38:36,630
model and i first of all read goodwin
and really found it really hard to

9198
02:38:36,630 --> 02:38:36,640
and really found it really hard to
 

9199
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:38,230
and really found it really hard to
follow his writing it was

9200
02:38:38,230 --> 02:38:38,240
follow his writing it was
 

9201
02:38:38,240 --> 02:38:40,309
follow his writing it was
he's not a very good writer but a guy

9202
02:38:40,309 --> 02:38:40,319
he's not a very good writer but a guy
 

9203
02:38:40,319 --> 02:38:42,150
he's not a very good writer but a guy
called john blatt who was a professor of

02:38:42,150 --> 02:38:42,160
called john blatt who was a professor of
 

9205
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:43,830

mathematics at new south wales

9206
02:38:43,830 --> 02:38:43,840
mathematics at new south wales
 

9207
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:46,389
mathematics at new south wales
university wrote a brilliant explanation

9208
02:38:46,389 --> 02:38:46,399
university wrote a brilliant explanation
 

9209
02:38:46,399 --> 02:38:48,389
university wrote a brilliant explanation
of the goodwin's model in a book called

9210
02:38:48,389 --> 02:38:48,399
of the goodwin's model in a book called
 

9211
02:38:48,399 --> 02:38:50,309
of the goodwin's model in a book called
dynamic economic systems and i read that

9212
02:38:50,309 --> 02:38:50,319
dynamic economic systems and i read that
 

9213
02:38:50,319 --> 02:38:52,469
dynamic economic systems and i read that
it was superb and he said a way you

9214
02:38:52,469 --> 02:38:52,479
it was superb and he said a way you
 

9215
02:38:52,479 --> 02:38:55,590
it was superb and he said a way you
could extend this was to include finance

9216
02:38:55,590 --> 02:38:55,600
could extend this was to include finance
 

9217
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:57,190
could extend this was to include finance
so i thought okay what i'm going to have

9218
02:38:57,190 --> 02:38:57,200
so i thought okay what i'm going to have
 

9219
02:38:57,200 --> 02:38:58,870
so i thought okay what i'm going to have
is that what

9220
02:38:58,870 --> 02:38:58,880
is that what
 

9221
02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:00,710
is that what
goodwin presumed is capitalists invest

9222
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:00,720
goodwin presumed is capitalists invest
 

9223
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:01,990
goodwin presumed is capitalists invest
all their profits

9224
02:39:01,990 --> 02:39:02,000
all their profits
 

9225
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:05,030
all their profits
okay so you get a boom when they're when

9226
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:05,040
okay so you get a boom when they're when
 

9227
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:07,190
okay so you get a boom when they're when
there's a high rate of profit because

9228
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:07,200
there's a high rate of profit because
 

9229
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:08,710
there's a high rate of profit because
they invest all that money and then a

9230
02:39:08,710 --> 02:39:08,720
they invest all that money and then a
 

9231
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:11,110
they invest all that money and then a
slump when there's low profit because

9232
02:39:11,110 --> 02:39:11,120
slump when there's low profit because
 

9233
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:13,030
slump when there's low profit because
depreciation will wipe away capital and

9234
02:39:13,030 --> 02:39:13,040
depreciation will wipe away capital and
 

9235
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:15,190
depreciation will wipe away capital and
you'll go boom and slump so i simply

9236
02:39:15,190 --> 02:39:15,200
you'll go boom and slump so i simply
 

9237
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:16,950
you'll go boom and slump so i simply
added in well capitalists will invest

9238
02:39:16,950 --> 02:39:16,960
added in well capitalists will invest
 

9239
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:18,950
added in well capitalists will invest
more than their

9240
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:18,960
more than their
 

9241
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,790
more than their
profits during a boom

9242
02:39:20,790 --> 02:39:20,800
profits during a boom
 

9243
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:22,230
profits during a boom
but less than their profits during a

9244
02:39:22,230 --> 02:39:22,240
but less than their profits during a
 

9245
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:23,429
but less than their profits during a
slump

9246
02:39:23,429 --> 02:39:23,439
slump
 

9247
02:39:23,439 --> 02:39:24,550
slump
and that therefore means they had to

9248
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:24,560
and that therefore means they had to
 

9249
02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:26,790
and that therefore means they had to
borrow money to finance the gap and pay

9250
02:39:26,790 --> 02:39:26,800
borrow money to finance the gap and pay
 

9251
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:28,710
borrow money to finance the gap and pay
interest on the debt so i ended up with

9252
02:39:28,710 --> 02:39:28,720
interest on the debt so i ended up with
 

9253
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:30,389
interest on the debt so i ended up with
a model with just three system states

9254
02:39:30,389 --> 02:39:30,399
a model with just three system states
 

9255
02:39:30,399 --> 02:39:31,110
a model with just three system states
the

9256
02:39:31,110 --> 02:39:31,120
the
 

9257
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:33,190
the

02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:34,630
income share the wages distribution of
income from workers capitalists and

9260
02:39:34,630 --> 02:39:34,640
income from workers capitalists and
 

9261
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:36,070
income from workers capitalists and
bankers

9262
02:39:36,070 --> 02:39:36,080

the level of employment and the level of

9264
02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:38,560
the level of employment and the level of
 

9265
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:40,230
the level of employment and the level of
private debt

9266
02:39:40,230 --> 02:39:40,240
private debt
 

9267
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:42,389
private debt
and those three equations

9268
02:39:42,389 --> 02:39:42,399
and those three equations
 

9269
02:39:42,399 --> 02:39:44,469
and those three equations
are fundamentally like going from the

9270
02:39:44,469 --> 02:39:44,479
are fundamentally like going from the
 

9271
02:39:44,479 --> 02:39:46,150
are fundamentally like going from the
luck to volterra model with just two

9272
02:39:46,150 --> 02:39:46,160
luck to volterra model with just two
 

9273
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:48,070
luck to volterra model with just two
equations and therefore you get a fixed

9274
02:39:48,070 --> 02:39:48,080
equations and therefore you get a fixed
 

9275
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:49,110
equations and therefore you get a fixed
cycle

9276
02:39:49,110 --> 02:39:49,120
cycle
 

9277
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:51,590
cycle
to the lorenz model where you have three

9278
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:51,600
to the lorenz model where you have three
 

9279
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:52,950
to the lorenz model where you have three
and therefore what i got out of it was a

9280
02:39:52,950 --> 02:39:52,960
and therefore what i got out of it was a
 

9281
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:54,870
and therefore what i got out of it was a
chaotic outcome so what you're seeing is

9282
02:39:54,870 --> 02:39:54,880
chaotic outcome so what you're seeing is
 

9283
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:55,750
chaotic outcome so what you're seeing is

being the only ones who borrowed
 

9299
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:13,190
being the only ones who borrowed
but the people who paid for the higher

9300
02:40:13,190 --> 02:40:13,200
but the people who paid for the higher
 

9301
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:17,190
but the people who paid for the higher
level of private debt were the workers

9302
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:17,200

 

9303
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:19,590

the rising bankers share

9304
02:40:19,590 --> 02:40:19,600
the rising bankers share
 

9305
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,429
the rising bankers share
corresponded exactly to a falling

9306
02:40:21,429 --> 02:40:21,439
corresponded exactly to a falling
 

9307
02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:23,030
corresponded exactly to a falling
workers share

9308
02:40:23,030 --> 02:40:23,040
workers share
 

9309
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:24,950
workers share
so you're you can infer from that that

9310
02:40:24,950 --> 02:40:24,960
so you're you can infer from that that
 

9311
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:26,230
so you're you can infer from that that
the workers are the ones paying

9312
02:40:26,230 --> 02:40:26,240
the workers are the ones paying
 

9313
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:27,670
the workers are the ones paying
effectively the workers end up paying

9314
02:40:27,670 --> 02:40:27,680
effectively the workers end up paying
 

9315
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:29,910
effectively the workers end up paying
for it they get a lower level of wages

9316
02:40:29,910 --> 02:40:29,920
for it they get a lower level of wages
 

9317
02:40:29,920 --> 02:40:32,230
for it they get a lower level of wages
and it's the basic dynamic is that

9318
02:40:32,230 --> 02:40:32,240
and it's the basic dynamic is that
 

9319
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:33,590
and it's the basic dynamic is that
capitalists

9320
02:40:33,590 --> 02:40:33,600
capitalists
 

9321
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:34,950
capitalists
when you have a three social class

9322
02:40:34,950 --> 02:40:34,960
when you have a three social class
 

9323
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:37,110
when you have a three social class
system your income goes between workers

9324
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:37,120
system your income goes between workers
 

9325
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:38,870
system your income goes between workers
capitalists and bankers now in the

9326
02:40:38,870 --> 02:40:38,880
capitalists and bankers now in the
 

9327
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:40,150
capitalists and bankers now in the
system that goodwin did they're just

9328
02:40:40,150 --> 02:40:40,160
system that goodwin did they're just
 

9329
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:42,309
system that goodwin did they're just
workers and capitalists so if workers

9330
02:40:42,309 --> 02:40:42,319
workers and capitalists so if workers
 

9331
02:40:42,319 --> 02:40:44,070
workers and capitalists so if workers
share rose profit capital share had to

9332
02:40:44,070 --> 02:40:44,080
share rose profit capital share had to
 

9333
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:46,309
share rose profit capital share had to
fall okay but when you have three social

9334
02:40:46,309 --> 02:40:46,319
fall okay but when you have three social
 

9335
02:40:46,319 --> 02:40:48,550
fall okay but when you have three social
classes then capital share can remain

9336
02:40:48,550 --> 02:40:48,560
classes then capital share can remain
 

9337
02:40:48,560 --> 02:40:51,429
classes then capital share can remain
constant while workers fall in bankers

9338
02:40:51,429 --> 02:40:51,439
constant while workers fall in bankers
 

9339
02:40:51,439 --> 02:40:53,590
constant while workers fall in bankers
workers falls and bankers rise so that's

9340
02:40:53,590 --> 02:40:53,600
workers falls and bankers rise so that's
 

9341
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:55,510
workers falls and bankers rise so that's
what actually happened uh because

9342
02:40:55,510 --> 02:40:55,520
what actually happened uh because
 

9343
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:57,510
what actually happened uh because
capitalists the simple way i modeled it

9344
02:40:57,510 --> 02:40:57,520
capitalists the simple way i modeled it
 

9345
02:40:57,520 --> 02:40:59,429
capitalists the simple way i modeled it
was there's a certain rate of profit at

9346
02:40:59,429 --> 02:40:59,439
was there's a certain rate of profit at
 

9347
02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:01,030
was there's a certain rate of profit at
which capitalists invest all their

9348
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:01,040
which capitalists invest all their
 

9349
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:03,269
which capitalists invest all their
profits above that they borrow more

9350
02:41:03,269 --> 02:41:03,279
profits above that they borrow more
 

9351
02:41:03,279 --> 02:41:05,429
profits above that they borrow more
below that they pay off debt

9352
02:41:05,429 --> 02:41:05,439
below that they pay off debt
 

9353
02:41:05,439 --> 02:41:06,950
below that they pay off debt
so what would happen is when you got

9354
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:06,960
so what would happen is when you got
 

9355
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,469
so what would happen is when you got
back to that point

9356
02:41:08,469 --> 02:41:08,479
back to that point
 

9357
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:10,150
back to that point
then the level of investment would be a

9358
02:41:10,150 --> 02:41:10,160
then the level of investment would be a
 

9359
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:12,950
then the level of investment would be a
precise share of gdp

9360
02:41:12,950 --> 02:41:12,960
precise share of gdp
 

9361
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,790
precise share of gdp
and therefore you get a precise rate of

9362
02:41:14,790 --> 02:41:14,800
and therefore you get a precise rate of
 

9363
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:16,309
and therefore you get a precise rate of
economic growth but if there was a

9364
02:41:16,309 --> 02:41:16,319
economic growth but if there was a
 

9365
02:41:16,319 --> 02:41:19,190
economic growth but if there was a
higher percentage going to bankers

9366
02:41:19,190 --> 02:41:19,200
higher percentage going to bankers
 

9367
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:20,710
higher percentage going to bankers
and offset by a lower share going to

9368
02:41:20,710 --> 02:41:20,720
and offset by a lower share going to
 

9369
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:22,870
and offset by a lower share going to
workers it didn't affect the capitalists

9370
02:41:22,870 --> 02:41:22,880
workers it didn't affect the capitalists
 

9371
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:24,710
workers it didn't affect the capitalists
so what you get is the cycles sort of

9372
02:41:24,710 --> 02:41:24,720
so what you get is the cycles sort of
 

9373
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:26,710
so what you get is the cycles sort of
diminish for a while because

9374
02:41:26,710 --> 02:41:26,720
diminish for a while because
 

9375
02:41:26,720 --> 02:41:28,469
diminish for a while because
uh there's

9376
02:41:28,469 --> 02:41:28,479
uh there's
 

9377
02:41:28,479 --> 02:41:30,630
uh there's
as

9378
02:41:30,630 --> 02:41:30,640
as
 

9379
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:32,070
as
so the income distribution effect is

9380
02:41:32,070 --> 02:41:32,080
so the income distribution effect is
 

9381
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:33,590
so the income distribution effect is
important so the

9382
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:33,600
important so the
 

9383
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:35,830
important so the
the workers pay for the increasing level

9384
02:41:35,830 --> 02:41:35,840
the workers pay for the increasing level
 

9385
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:36,870
the workers pay for the increasing level
of debt

9386
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:36,880
of debt
 

9387
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:38,309
of debt
but the other side of it was that the

9388
02:41:38,309 --> 02:41:38,319
but the other side of it was that the
 

9389
02:41:38,319 --> 02:41:40,710
but the other side of it was that the
cycles were diminished for a while now

9390
02:41:40,710 --> 02:41:40,720
cycles were diminished for a while now
 

9391
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:42,389
cycles were diminished for a while now
what you get is a period of diminishing

9392
02:41:42,389 --> 02:41:42,399
what you get is a period of diminishing
 

9393
02:41:42,399 --> 02:41:45,590
what you get is a period of diminishing
cycles then leading to rising cycles and

9394
02:41:45,590 --> 02:41:45,600
cycles then leading to rising cycles and

element of lorenzo's equations of fluid

9402
02:41:56,309 --> 02:41:56,319

dynamics so what they found was in

9404
02:41:59,269 --> 02:41:59,279
dynamics so what they found was in
 

9405
02:41:59,279 --> 02:42:00,469
dynamics so what they found was in
examining

9406
02:42:00,469 --> 02:42:00,479
examining
 

9407
02:42:00,479 --> 02:42:02,630
examining
laminar flow and a fluid you have a

9408
02:42:02,630 --> 02:42:02,640
laminar flow and a fluid you have a
 

9409
02:42:02,640 --> 02:42:04,309
laminar flow and a fluid you have a
period where the laminar flow got more

9410
02:42:04,309 --> 02:42:04,319
period where the laminar flow got more
 

9411
02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:06,469
period where the laminar flow got more
laminar and then suddenly it would start

9412
02:42:06,469 --> 02:42:06,479
laminar and then suddenly it would start
 

9413
02:42:06,479 --> 02:42:09,429
laminar and then suddenly it would start
to get less laminar and go turbulent

9414
02:42:09,429 --> 02:42:09,439
to get less laminar and go turbulent
 

9415
02:42:09,439 --> 02:42:11,190
to get less laminar and go turbulent
and this is this is what actually goes

9416
02:42:11,190 --> 02:42:11,200
and this is this is what actually goes
 

9417
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:14,309
and this is this is what actually goes
on in the model so in my model of minsky

9418
02:42:14,309 --> 02:42:14,319
on in the model so in my model of minsky
 

9419
02:42:14,319 --> 02:42:15,190
on in the model so in my model of minsky
so

9420
02:42:15,190 --> 02:42:15,200
so
 

9421
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:17,510
so
what you have is a period where there's

9422
02:42:17,510 --> 02:42:17,520
what you have is a period where there's
 

9423
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:19,510
what you have is a period where there's
big berms and cycles and then as the

9424
02:42:19,510 --> 02:42:19,520
big berms and cycles and then as the
 

9425
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:22,389
big berms and cycles and then as the
debt level rises the booms and slums get

9426
02:42:22,389 --> 02:42:22,399
debt level rises the booms and slums get
 

9427
02:42:22,399 --> 02:42:24,630
debt level rises the booms and slums get
smaller and that looks like what

9428
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:24,640
smaller and that looks like what
 

9429
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:26,230
smaller and that looks like what
neoclassical economists call the great

9430
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:26,240
neoclassical economists call the great
 

9431
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:27,750
neoclassical economists call the great

so i when i first modeled this 1982 i

9434
02:42:30,870 --> 02:42:30,880
so i when i first modeled this 1982 i
 

9435
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:32,550
so i when i first modeled this 1982 i
finished up my paper which is published

9436
02:42:32,550 --> 02:42:32,560
finished up my paper which is published
 

9437
02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:34,309
finished up my paper which is published
in 95 with what i thought was a nice

warn us against regarding a period of
 

9445
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:42,469
warn us against regarding a period of
relative stability in a capitalist

9446
02:42:42,469 --> 02:42:42,479
relative stability in a capitalist
 

9447
02:42:42,479 --> 02:42:44,550
relative stability in a capitalist
economy as anything more than a lull

9448
02:42:44,550 --> 02:42:44,560
economy as anything more than a lull
 

9449
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:45,990

02:42:45,990 --> 02:42:46,000
before the storm
 

9451
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:47,190
before the storm
now i thought it was a great speed of

9455
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:50,950
rhetoric i didn't think it was going to
[\h__\h] happen but it did because you

9456
02:42:50,950 --> 02:42:50,960
[\h__\h] happen but it did because you
 

9457
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:52,950
[\h__\h] happen but it did because you
had this period from 1990 through to

9458
02:42:52,950 --> 02:42:52,960
had this period from 1990 through to
 

9459
02:42:52,960 --> 02:42:54,790
had this period from 1990 through to
2007

9460
02:42:54,790 --> 02:42:54,800
2007
 

9461
02:42:54,800 --> 02:42:56,469
2007
where there were diminishing cycles and

9462
02:42:56,469 --> 02:42:56,479
where there were diminishing cycles and
 

9463
02:42:56,479 --> 02:42:58,150
where there were diminishing cycles and
the neoclassicals labelled that the

9464
02:42:58,150 --> 02:42:58,160
the neoclassicals labelled that the
 

9465
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:00,070
the neoclassicals labelled that the
great moderation and they took the

9466
02:43:00,070 --> 02:43:00,080
great moderation and they took the
 

9467
02:43:00,080 --> 02:43:01,349
great moderation and they took the
credit for it they thought that the

9468
02:43:01,349 --> 02:43:01,359
credit for it they thought that the
 

9469
02:43:01,359 --> 02:43:03,030
credit for it they thought that the
economy was being managed by them to a

9470
02:43:03,030 --> 02:43:03,040
economy was being managed by them to a
 

9471
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:06,389
economy was being managed by them to a
lower rate of infla inflation a lower

9472

lower rate of infla inflation a lower
 

9473
02:43:06,399 --> 02:43:08,950
lower rate of infla inflation a lower
level of unemployment less instability

9474
02:43:08,950 --> 02:43:08,960
level of unemployment less instability
 

9475
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,790
level of unemployment less instability
over time and they literally took credit

9476
02:43:10,790 --> 02:43:10,800
over time and they literally took credit
 

9477
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:12,469
over time and they literally took credit
for it and i was watching that and

9478
02:43:12,469 --> 02:43:12,479
for it and i was watching that and
 

9479
02:43:12,479 --> 02:43:13,750
for it and i was watching that and
thinking that's like my model running

9480
02:43:13,750 --> 02:43:13,760
thinking that's like my model running
 

9481
02:43:13,760 --> 02:43:15,910
thinking that's like my model running
and i'm sure i'm scared of [\h__\h]

9482
02:43:15,910 --> 02:43:15,920
and i'm sure i'm scared of [\h__\h]
 

9483
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:18,710
and i'm sure i'm scared of [\h__\h]
that there'll be a breakdown i ended up

9484
02:43:18,710 --> 02:43:18,720
that there'll be a breakdown i ended up
 

9485
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:20,710
that there'll be a breakdown i ended up
not um working in the area for a while

9486
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:20,720
not um working in the area for a while
 

9487
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:22,950
not um working in the area for a while
because i wrote debunking economics

9488
02:43:22,950 --> 02:43:22,960
because i wrote debunking economics
 

9489
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:25,349
because i wrote debunking economics
and i got involved in a fight over the

9490
02:43:25,349 --> 02:43:25,359
and i got involved in a fight over the
 

9491
02:43:25,359 --> 02:43:26,469
and i got involved in a fight over the
modeling of

9492
02:43:26,469 --> 02:43:26,479
modeling of
 

9493
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:28,710
modeling of
competition in neoclassical theory that

9494
02:43:28,710 --> 02:43:28,720
competition in neoclassical theory that
 

9495
02:43:28,720 --> 02:43:29,990
competition in neoclassical theory that
took me away for about four or five

9496
02:43:29,990 --> 02:43:30,000
took me away for about four or five
 

9497
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,030
took me away for about four or five
years

9498
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:31,040
years
 

9499
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:33,670
years
and then i got asked to do a court case

9500
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:33,680
and then i got asked to do a court case
 

9501
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:37,670
and then i got asked to do a court case
in 2005 end of 2005

9502
02:43:37,670 --> 02:43:37,680
in 2005 end of 2005
 

9503
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:38,790
in 2005 end of 2005
and

9504
02:43:38,790 --> 02:43:38,800
and
 

9505
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:40,870
and
i used minsky as my framework for

9506
02:43:40,870 --> 02:43:40,880
i used minsky as my framework for
 

9507
02:43:40,880 --> 02:43:43,030
i used minsky as my framework for
arguing that somebody who was involved

9508
02:43:43,030 --> 02:43:43,040
arguing that somebody who was involved
 

9509
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:44,870
arguing that somebody who was involved
in predatory lending should be able to

9510
02:43:44,870 --> 02:43:44,880
in predatory lending should be able to
 

9511
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:47,190
in predatory lending should be able to
get out of the debt they were in

9512
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:47,200
get out of the debt they were in
 

9513
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:49,590
get out of the debt they were in
and i explained minsky's theory and i've

9514
02:43:49,590 --> 02:43:49,600
and i explained minsky's theory and i've
 

9515
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:50,630
and i explained minsky's theory and i've
used this

9516
02:43:50,630 --> 02:43:50,640
used this
 

9517
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:52,630
used this
throwaway line of saying debt levels

9518
02:43:52,630 --> 02:43:52,640
throwaway line of saying debt levels
 

9519
02:43:52,640 --> 02:43:54,309
throwaway line of saying debt levels
have been private debt have been rising

9520
02:43:54,309 --> 02:43:54,319
have been private debt have been rising
 

9521
02:43:54,319 --> 02:43:55,590
have been private debt have been rising
exponentially

9522
02:43:55,590 --> 02:43:55,600
exponentially
 

9523
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:57,590
exponentially
and then i thought well i can't as an

9524
02:43:57,590 --> 02:43:57,600
and then i thought well i can't as an
 

9525
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:59,349
and then i thought well i can't as an
expert just make a claim like that i've

9526
02:43:59,349 --> 02:43:59,359
expert just make a claim like that i've
 

9527
02:43:59,359 --> 02:44:01,110
expert just make a claim like that i've
got to check the data

9528
02:44:01,110 --> 02:44:01,120
got to check the data
 

9529
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:02,710
got to check the data
and the debt ratio was rising

9530
02:44:02,710 --> 02:44:02,720
and the debt ratio was rising
 

9531
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:04,469
and the debt ratio was rising
exponentially and i thought holy [\h__\h]

9532
02:44:04,469 --> 02:44:04,479
exponentially and i thought holy [\h__\h]
 

9533
02:44:04,479 --> 02:44:06,790
exponentially and i thought holy [\h__\h]
we're in for a financial crisis

9534
02:44:06,790 --> 02:44:06,800
we're in for a financial crisis
 

9535
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:08,309
we're in for a financial crisis
and somebody has to warn about it at

9536
02:44:08,309 --> 02:44:08,319
and somebody has to warn about it at
 

9537
02:44:08,319 --> 02:44:10,630
and somebody has to warn about it at
least in australia i was that somebody

9538
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:10,640
least in australia i was that somebody
 

9539
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:13,990
least in australia i was that somebody
so can you given this chaotic dynamics i

9540
02:44:13,990 --> 02:44:14,000
so can you given this chaotic dynamics i
 

9541
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,389
so can you given this chaotic dynamics i
idea can you talk about the crisis ahead

9542
02:44:16,389 --> 02:44:16,399
idea can you talk about the crisis ahead
 

9543
02:44:16,399 --> 02:44:18,950
idea can you talk about the crisis ahead
of us in the future so one of the things

9544
02:44:18,950 --> 02:44:18,960
of us in the future so one of the things
 

9545
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:20,309
of us in the future so one of the things
i mean it's fun about the question of

9546
02:44:20,309 --> 02:44:20,319
i mean it's fun about the question of
 

9547
02:44:20,319 --> 02:44:21,590
i mean it's fun about the question of
economics

9548
02:44:21,590 --> 02:44:21,600
economics
 

9549
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:23,590
economics
is economics about understanding the

9550
02:44:23,590 --> 02:44:23,600
is economics about understanding the
 

9551
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,910
is economics about understanding the
past or predicting the future

9552
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:25,920
past or predicting the future
 

9553
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:29,190
past or predicting the future
because uh

9554
02:44:29,190 --> 02:44:29,200

 

9555
02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:31,429

you can construct models that

9556
02:44:31,429 --> 02:44:31,439
you can construct models that
 

9557
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:34,070
you can construct models that
do poetic like in 95

9558
02:44:34,070 --> 02:44:34,080
do poetic like in 95
 

9559
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:36,550
do poetic like in 95
poetic um

9560
02:44:36,550 --> 02:44:36,560
poetic um
 

9561
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:38,710
poetic um
yeah and then you can you know watch

9562
02:44:38,710 --> 02:44:38,720
yeah and then you can you know watch
 

9563
02:44:38,720 --> 02:44:41,510
yeah and then you can you know watch
years come fly by and some of the

9564
02:44:41,510 --> 02:44:41,520
years come fly by and some of the
 

9565
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:44,389
years come fly by and some of the
predictions in retrospect that you make

9566
02:44:44,389 --> 02:44:44,399
predictions in retrospect that you make
 

9567
02:44:44,399 --> 02:44:48,070
predictions in retrospect that you make
turn out to be true but you you know you

9568
02:44:48,070 --> 02:44:48,080
turn out to be true but you you know you
 

9569
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:49,750
turn out to be true but you you know you
all kinds of gurus throughout history

9570
02:44:49,750 --> 02:44:49,760
all kinds of gurus throughout history
 

9571
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:51,349
all kinds of gurus throughout history
have done that kind of thing

9572
02:44:51,349 --> 02:44:51,359
have done that kind of thing
 

9573
02:44:51,359 --> 02:44:53,269
have done that kind of thing
um and you can call yourself right and

9574
02:44:53,269 --> 02:44:53,279
um and you can call yourself right and
 

9575
02:44:53,279 --> 02:44:55,110
um and you can call yourself right and
forget all the many times you've been

9576
02:44:55,110 --> 02:44:55,120
forget all the many times you've been
 

9577
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:56,150
forget all the many times you've been
wrong

9578
02:44:56,150 --> 02:44:56,160
wrong
 

9579
02:44:56,160 --> 02:44:57,990
wrong
let's talk about the future what kind of

9580
02:44:57,990 --> 02:44:58,000
let's talk about the future what kind of
 

9581
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:59,429
let's talk about the future what kind of
stuff

9582
02:44:59,429 --> 02:44:59,439
stuff
 

9583
02:44:59,439 --> 02:45:00,630
stuff
you mentioned about the importance of

9584
02:45:00,630 --> 02:45:00,640
you mentioned about the importance of
 

9585
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:01,910
you mentioned about the importance of
the biosphere

9586
02:45:01,910 --> 02:45:01,920
the biosphere
 

9587
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:04,469
the biosphere
but what other crises are ahead of us

9588
02:45:04,469 --> 02:45:04,479
but what other crises are ahead of us
 

9589
02:45:04,479 --> 02:45:07,429
but what other crises are ahead of us
that this that that a chaotic dynamics

9590
02:45:07,429 --> 02:45:07,439
that this that that a chaotic dynamics
 

9591
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:09,190
that this that that a chaotic dynamics
view

9592
02:45:09,190 --> 02:45:09,200
view
 

9593
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:11,510
view
allows us to predict really i saw coming

9594
02:45:11,510 --> 02:45:11,520
allows us to predict really i saw coming
 

9595
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:12,710
allows us to predict really i saw coming
out of it

9596
02:45:12,710 --> 02:45:12,720
out of it
 

9597
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:14,630
out of it
leaving aside the ecological

9598
02:45:14,630 --> 02:45:14,640
leaving aside the ecological
 

9599
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:17,429
leaving aside the ecological
wasn't a crisis it was stagnation

9600
02:45:17,429 --> 02:45:17,439
wasn't a crisis it was stagnation
 

9601
02:45:17,439 --> 02:45:19,910
wasn't a crisis it was stagnation
because what we got out of the crisis

9602
02:45:19,910 --> 02:45:19,920
because what we got out of the crisis
 

9603
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:21,670
because what we got out of the crisis
was caused by a rising level of private

9604
02:45:21,670 --> 02:45:21,680
was caused by a rising level of private
 

9605
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:22,550
was caused by a rising level of private
debt

9606
02:45:22,550 --> 02:45:22,560
debt
 

9607
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:26,150
debt
okay now you reach a peak level where

9608
02:45:26,150 --> 02:45:26,160
okay now you reach a peak level where
 

9609
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:27,590
okay now you reach a peak level where
the willingness to take on debt

9610
02:45:27,590 --> 02:45:27,600
the willingness to take on debt
 

9611
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:29,429
the willingness to take on debt
collapses

9612
02:45:29,429 --> 02:45:29,439
collapses
 

9613
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:31,510
collapses
and so you go to a period where debt is

9614
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:31,520
and so you go to a period where debt is
 

9615
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:33,910
and so you go to a period where debt is
rising all the time so credit which is

9616
02:45:33,910 --> 02:45:33,920
rising all the time so credit which is
 

9617
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:35,910
rising all the time so credit which is
the annual change in debt

9618
02:45:35,910 --> 02:45:35,920
the annual change in debt
 

9619
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:37,830
the annual change in debt
and that's credit is part of aggregate

9620
02:45:37,830 --> 02:45:37,840
and that's credit is part of aggregate
 

9621
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:40,309
and that's credit is part of aggregate
demand and aggregate income so credit

9622
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:40,319
demand and aggregate income so credit
 

9623
02:45:40,319 --> 02:45:42,389
demand and aggregate income so credit
goes from positive to negative and that

9624
02:45:42,389 --> 02:45:42,399
goes from positive to negative and that
 

9625
02:45:42,399 --> 02:45:44,950
goes from positive to negative and that
causes a slump so that would uh so can

9626
02:45:44,950 --> 02:45:44,960
causes a slump so that would uh so can
 

9627
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:47,910
causes a slump so that would uh so can
you describe why that causes this lump

9628
02:45:47,910 --> 02:45:47,920
you describe why that causes this lump
 

9629
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:49,990
you describe why that causes this lump
credit goes to negative if you ask paul

9630
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,000
credit goes to negative if you ask paul
 

9631
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,590
credit goes to negative if you ask paul
krugman he'll tell you credit plays no

9632
02:45:51,590 --> 02:45:51,600
krugman he'll tell you credit plays no
 

9633
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:53,590
krugman he'll tell you credit plays no
role in aggregate demand

9634
02:45:53,590 --> 02:45:53,600
role in aggregate demand
 

9635
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:56,630
role in aggregate demand
okay give me a second uh credit plays no

9636
02:45:56,630 --> 02:45:56,640
okay give me a second uh credit plays no
 

9637
02:45:56,640 --> 02:45:58,550
okay give me a second uh credit plays no
role in an aggregate demand

9638
02:45:58,550 --> 02:45:58,560
role in an aggregate demand
 

9639
02:45:58,560 --> 02:45:59,830
role in an aggregate demand
so the vision the vision that the

9640
02:45:59,830 --> 02:45:59,840
so the vision the vision that the
 

9641
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:01,269
so the vision the vision that the
neoclassicals have for the banking

9642
02:46:01,269 --> 02:46:01,279
neoclassicals have for the banking
 

9643
02:46:01,279 --> 02:46:03,750
neoclassicals have for the banking
system is what they call learnable funds

9644
02:46:03,750 --> 02:46:03,760
system is what they call learnable funds
 

9645
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:06,790
system is what they call learnable funds
is paul krugman by the way the uh

9646
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:06,800
is paul krugman by the way the uh
 

9647
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:08,150
is paul krugman by the way the uh
the knight

9648
02:46:08,150 --> 02:46:08,160
the knight
 

9649
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:09,670
the knight
at the front of the army that is the

9650
02:46:09,670 --> 02:46:09,680
at the front of the army that is the
 

9651
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:11,510
at the front of the army that is the
neoclassical economist

9652
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:11,520
neoclassical economist
 

9653
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:14,950
neoclassical economist
yeah fundamentally sure okay um

9654
02:46:14,950 --> 02:46:14,960
yeah fundamentally sure okay um
 

9655
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:16,950
yeah fundamentally sure okay um
he he's he's politically reasonable

9656
02:46:16,950 --> 02:46:16,960
he he's he's politically reasonable
 

9657
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:18,389
he he's he's politically reasonable
which makes him

9658
02:46:18,389 --> 02:46:18,399
which makes him
 

9659
02:46:18,399 --> 02:46:21,030
which makes him
more dangerous than those that aren't

9660
02:46:21,030 --> 02:46:21,040
more dangerous than those that aren't
 

9661
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:23,110
more dangerous than those that aren't
he's politically there's quite a lot of

9662
02:46:23,110 --> 02:46:23,120
he's politically there's quite a lot of
 

9663
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:24,389
he's politically there's quite a lot of
people that would disagree with that

9664
02:46:24,389 --> 02:46:24,399
people that would disagree with that
 

9665
02:46:24,399 --> 02:46:26,550
people that would disagree with that
characterization of paul krugman as he's

9666
02:46:26,550 --> 02:46:26,560
characterization of paul krugman as he's
 

9667
02:46:26,560 --> 02:46:28,550
characterization of paul krugman as he's
politically reasonable you should see

9668
02:46:28,550 --> 02:46:28,560
politically reasonable you should see
 

9669
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:30,150
politically reasonable you should see
the people

9670
02:46:30,150 --> 02:46:30,160
the people
 

9671
02:46:30,160 --> 02:46:31,349
the people
okay okay

9672
02:46:31,349 --> 02:46:31,359
okay okay
 

9673
02:46:31,359 --> 02:46:32,710
okay okay
fair enough okay

9674
02:46:32,710 --> 02:46:32,720
fair enough okay
 

9675
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:34,150
fair enough okay
that's not a negative or positive

9676
02:46:34,150 --> 02:46:34,160
that's not a negative or positive
 

9677
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:35,830
that's not a negative or positive
statement that's just he can be feisty

9678
02:46:35,830 --> 02:46:35,840
statement that's just he can be feisty
 

9679
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:38,230
statement that's just he can be feisty
as well he can he can but he's like the

9680
02:46:38,230 --> 02:46:38,240
as well he can he can but he's like the
 

9681
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:40,630
as well he can he can but he's like the
human face of neoclassical economics

9682
02:46:40,630 --> 02:46:40,640
human face of neoclassical economics
 

9683
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:42,790
human face of neoclassical economics
he doesn't deserve having a human face

9684
02:46:42,790 --> 02:46:42,800
he doesn't deserve having a human face
 

9685
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:46,070
he doesn't deserve having a human face
it's a anti-human theory but you really

9686
02:46:46,070 --> 02:46:46,080
it's a anti-human theory but you really
 

9687
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:48,389
it's a anti-human theory but you really
think i got you all right well so

9688
02:46:48,389 --> 02:46:48,399
think i got you all right well so
 

9689
02:46:48,399 --> 02:46:51,510
think i got you all right well so
yeah uh so but the credit does not have

9690
02:46:51,510 --> 02:46:51,520
yeah uh so but the credit does not have
 

9691
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:54,389
yeah uh so but the credit does not have
any effect on aggregate demand in their

9692
02:46:54,389 --> 02:46:54,399
any effect on aggregate demand in their
 

9693
02:46:54,399 --> 02:46:56,309
any effect on aggregate demand in their
model and you're saying that's not the

9694
02:46:56,309 --> 02:46:56,319
model and you're saying that's not the
 

9695
02:46:56,319 --> 02:46:57,990
model and you're saying that's not the
case it's absolutely crucial to

9696
02:46:57,990 --> 02:46:58,000
case it's absolutely crucial to
 

9697
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,070
case it's absolutely crucial to
aggregate demand so what they model is

9698
02:47:00,070 --> 02:47:00,080
aggregate demand so what they model is
 

9699
02:47:00,080 --> 02:47:01,750
aggregate demand so what they model is
again the example of you lending to me

9700
02:47:01,750 --> 02:47:01,760
again the example of you lending to me
 

9701
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:05,349
again the example of you lending to me
or vice versa if i lend money to you i

9702
02:47:05,349 --> 02:47:05,359
or vice versa if i lend money to you i
 

9703
02:47:05,359 --> 02:47:07,429
or vice versa if i lend money to you i
can spend less you can spend more okay

9704
02:47:07,429 --> 02:47:07,439
can spend less you can spend more okay
 

9705
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:08,389
can spend less you can spend more okay
so

9706
02:47:08,389 --> 02:47:08,399
so
 

9707
02:47:08,399 --> 02:47:11,110
so
credit credit is the change in debt so

9708
02:47:11,110 --> 02:47:11,120
credit credit is the change in debt so
 

9709
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:13,590
credit credit is the change in debt so
if there's if i lend money to you then

9710
02:47:13,590 --> 02:47:13,600
if there's if i lend money to you then
 

9711
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:16,389
if there's if i lend money to you then
there's a level of private debt rises

9712
02:47:16,389 --> 02:47:16,399
there's a level of private debt rises
 

9713
02:47:16,399 --> 02:47:18,710
there's a level of private debt rises
okay so there's an increase in credit

9714
02:47:18,710 --> 02:47:18,720
okay so there's an increase in credit
 

9715
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:20,710
okay so there's an increase in credit
but that increase in credit comes at an

9716
02:47:20,710 --> 02:47:20,720
but that increase in credit comes at an
 

9717
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:23,110
but that increase in credit comes at an
expense of my spending power so you can

9718
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:23,120
expense of my spending power so you can
 

9719
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:25,190
expense of my spending power so you can
spend what i've lent you but i can't

9720
02:47:25,190 --> 02:47:25,200
spend what i've lent you but i can't
 

9721
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:27,190
spend what i've lent you but i can't
spend what i've lent you so credit

9722
02:47:27,190 --> 02:47:27,200
spend what i've lent you so credit
 

9723
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:29,269
spend what i've lent you so credit
cancels out but when you look at that's

9724
02:47:29,269 --> 02:47:29,279
cancels out but when you look at that's
 

9725
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,429
cancels out but when you look at that's
learnable funds but in the real world

9726
02:47:31,429 --> 02:47:31,439
learnable funds but in the real world
 

9727
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:32,870
learnable funds but in the real world
and the bank of england has said this is

9728
02:47:32,870 --> 02:47:32,880
and the bank of england has said this is
 

9729
02:47:32,880 --> 02:47:34,230
and the bank of england has said this is
the real world and the textbooks are

9730
02:47:34,230 --> 02:47:34,240
the real world and the textbooks are
 

9731
02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:36,150
the real world and the textbooks are
wrong categorically in

9732
02:47:36,150 --> 02:47:36,160
wrong categorically in
 

9733
02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:38,630
wrong categorically in
2014.

9734
02:47:38,630 --> 02:47:38,640
2014.
 

9735
02:47:38,640 --> 02:47:41,590
2014.
when the bank lends it adds to its asset

9736
02:47:41,590 --> 02:47:41,600
when the bank lends it adds to its asset
 

9737
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:43,830
when the bank lends it adds to its asset
side and says you owe us more money and

9738
02:47:43,830 --> 02:47:43,840
side and says you owe us more money and
 

9739
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:45,830
side and says you owe us more money and
it adds to its liability site and says

9740
02:47:45,830 --> 02:47:45,840
it adds to its liability site and says
 

9741
02:47:45,840 --> 02:47:47,429
it adds to its liability site and says
here's the money in your bank account

9742
02:47:47,429 --> 02:47:47,439
here's the money in your bank account
 

9743
02:47:47,439 --> 02:47:49,830
here's the money in your bank account
now you spend that money so what happens

9744
02:47:49,830 --> 02:47:49,840
now you spend that money so what happens
 

9745
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:52,469
now you spend that money so what happens
when you do your sums credit is part of

9746
02:47:52,469 --> 02:47:52,479
when you do your sums credit is part of
 

9747
02:47:52,479 --> 02:47:55,030
when you do your sums credit is part of
aggregate demand and aggregate income

9748
02:47:55,030 --> 02:47:55,040
aggregate demand and aggregate income
 

9749
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:56,590
aggregate demand and aggregate income
and that's something i first solved in

9750
02:47:56,590 --> 02:47:56,600
and that's something i first solved in
 

9751
02:47:56,600 --> 02:47:58,630
and that's something i first solved in
2019 i think

9752
02:47:58,630 --> 02:47:58,640
2019 i think
 

9753
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:00,830
2019 i think
2000 so i only recently proved it

9754
02:48:00,830 --> 02:48:00,840
2000 so i only recently proved it
 

9755
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:03,269
2000 so i only recently proved it
mathematically so what that means is

9756
02:48:03,269 --> 02:48:03,279
mathematically so what that means is
 

9757
02:48:03,279 --> 02:48:04,150
mathematically so what that means is
credit

9758
02:48:04,150 --> 02:48:04,160
credit
 

9759
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:07,110
credit
can is a component of aggregate demand

9760
02:48:07,110 --> 02:48:07,120
can is a component of aggregate demand
 

9761
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:09,349
can is a component of aggregate demand
and credit is also very volatile it's

9762
02:48:09,349 --> 02:48:09,359
and credit is also very volatile it's
 

9763
02:48:09,359 --> 02:48:10,790
and credit is also very volatile it's
like consumption demand never goes

9764
02:48:10,790 --> 02:48:10,800
like consumption demand never goes
 

9765
02:48:10,800 --> 02:48:11,750
like consumption demand never goes
negative

9766
02:48:11,750 --> 02:48:11,760
negative
 

9767
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:13,510
negative
investment demand never goes negative

9768
02:48:13,510 --> 02:48:13,520
investment demand never goes negative
 

9769
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:15,110
investment demand never goes negative
but credit can go from positive to

9770
02:48:15,110 --> 02:48:15,120
but credit can go from positive to
 

9771
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:17,110
but credit can go from positive to
negative and when you take a look at the

9772
02:48:17,110 --> 02:48:17,120
negative and when you take a look at the
 

9773
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:19,830
negative and when you take a look at the
long run of american history after the

9774
02:48:19,830 --> 02:48:19,840

9775
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:21,349
long run of american history after the
second world war

9776
02:48:21,349 --> 02:48:21,359
second world war
 

9777
02:48:21,359 --> 02:48:25,590
second world war
there was no period uh until 2007

9778
02:48:25,590 --> 02:48:25,600
there was no period uh until 2007
 

9779
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:27,190
there was no period uh until 2007
where credit was negative it was a

9780
02:48:27,190 --> 02:48:27,200
where credit was negative it was a
 

9781
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:29,269
where credit was negative it was a
positive component of g d

9782
02:48:29,269 --> 02:48:29,279
positive component of g d
 

9783
02:48:29,279 --> 02:48:30,710
positive component of g d
a positive number

9784
02:48:30,710 --> 02:48:30,720
a positive number
 

9785
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:32,870
a positive number
therefore when you do it as a percentage

9786
02:48:32,870 --> 02:48:32,880
therefore when you do it as a percentage
 

9787
02:48:32,880 --> 02:48:34,950
therefore when you do it as a percentage
of gdp it was a positive percentage of

9788
02:48:34,950 --> 02:48:34,960
of gdp it was a positive percentage of
 

9789
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:36,150
of gdp it was a positive percentage of
gdp

9790
02:48:36,150 --> 02:48:36,160
gdp
 

9791
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:38,230
gdp
it peaked at 16

9792
02:48:38,230 --> 02:48:38,240
it peaked at 16
 

9793
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:43,590
it peaked at 16
of gdp in 2006 2007 it fell to minus

9794
02:48:43,590 --> 02:48:43,600
of gdp in 2006 2007 it fell to minus
 

9795
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:47,830
of gdp in 2006 2007 it fell to minus
five percent in 2008 2009 so you had a

9796
02:48:47,830 --> 02:48:47,840
five percent in 2008 2009 so you had a
 

9797
02:48:47,840 --> 02:48:49,670
five percent in 2008 2009 so you had a
20 of gdp

9798
02:48:49,670 --> 02:48:49,680
20 of gdp
 

9799
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:51,670
20 of gdp

02:48:51,670 --> 02:48:51,680
turn around in aggregate demand
 

9801
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:53,590
turn around in aggregate demand
now when you plot that against

9802
02:48:53,590 --> 02:48:53,600
now when you plot that against
 

9803
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:56,950
now when you plot that against
unemployment the correlation of

9804
02:48:56,950 --> 02:48:56,960
unemployment the correlation of
 

9805
02:48:56,960 --> 02:49:00,309

02:49:07,830 --> 02:49:07,840
is about minus 0.9
 

9813
02:49:07,840 --> 02:49:08,630
is about minus 0.9
okay

9814
02:49:08,630 --> 02:49:08,640
okay
 

9815
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:10,469
okay
enormous negative correlation now

9816
02:49:10,469 --> 02:49:10,479
enormous negative correlation now
 

9817
02:49:10,479 --> 02:49:12,070
enormous negative correlation now
according to the neoclassicals it should

9818
02:49:12,070 --> 02:49:12,080
according to the neoclassicals it should
 

9819
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:13,670
according to the neoclassicals it should
be close to zero

9820
02:49:13,670 --> 02:49:13,680
be close to zero
 

9821
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:15,670
be close to zero
empirically it's bleedingly obvious it's

9822
02:49:15,670 --> 02:49:15,680
empirically it's bleedingly obvious it's
 

9823
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:18,070
empirically it's bleedingly obvious it's
not and it applies to every country in

9824
02:49:18,070 --> 02:49:18,080
not and it applies to every country in
 

9825
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:20,150
not and it applies to every country in
the world that had a financial crisis at

9826
02:49:20,150 --> 02:49:20,160
the world that had a financial crisis at
 

9827
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:22,070
the world that had a financial crisis at
that period so

9828
02:49:22,070 --> 02:49:22,080
that period so
 

9829
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:24,550
that period so
it's it's bleedingly obvious in the data

9830
02:49:24,550 --> 02:49:24,560
it's it's bleedingly obvious in the data
 

9831
02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:26,389
it's it's bleedingly obvious in the data
and they ignore it because credit's not

9832
02:49:26,389 --> 02:49:26,399
and they ignore it because credit's not
 

9833
02:49:26,399 --> 02:49:27,830
and they ignore it because credit's not

part of their model
 

9835
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:29,670
part of their model
and you're saying it's causation that's

9836
02:49:29,670 --> 02:49:29,680
and you're saying it's causation that's
 

9837

what it's called
today we said there is extremely high

02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:33,520
today we said there is extremely high
 

9841
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:35,670
today we said there is extremely high
inflation

9842
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:35,680
inflation
 

9843
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:37,510
inflation
what

9844
02:49:37,510 --> 02:49:37,520
what
 

9845
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:38,950
what
does inflation

9846
02:49:38,950 --> 02:49:38,960
does inflation
 

9847
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:40,550
does inflation
what role does inflation play in this

9848
02:49:40,550 --> 02:49:40,560
what role does inflation play in this
 

9849
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:42,550
what role does inflation play in this
picture is a little bit of inflation

9850
02:49:42,550 --> 02:49:42,560
picture is a little bit of inflation
 

9851
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:45,670
picture is a little bit of inflation
good we talked about money creation

9852
02:49:45,670 --> 02:49:45,680
good we talked about money creation
 

9853
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:47,990
good we talked about money creation
um and at the beginning

9854
02:49:47,990 --> 02:49:48,000
um and at the beginning
 

9855
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,990
um and at the beginning
what's a little bit of inflation good or

9856
02:49:49,990 --> 02:49:50,000
what's a little bit of inflation good or
 

9857
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,150
what's a little bit of inflation good or
bad a lot of inflation good or bad how

9858
02:49:52,150 --> 02:49:52,160
bad a lot of inflation good or bad how
 

9859
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:56,070
bad a lot of inflation good or bad how
concerned

9860
02:49:56,070 --> 02:49:56,080

 

9861
02:49:56,080 --> 02:49:57,349

again it's taken me a while to get my

9862
02:49:57,349 --> 02:49:57,359
again it's taken me a while to get my
 

9863
02:49:57,359 --> 02:49:58,950
again it's taken me a while to get my
head around around this but if you think

9864
02:49:58,950 --> 02:49:58,960
head around around this but if you think
 

9865
02:49:58,960 --> 02:50:00,630
head around around this but if you think
about how people say what are the

9866
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:00,640
about how people say what are the
 

9867
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:01,990
about how people say what are the
functions of money they say money it's a

9868
02:50:01,990 --> 02:50:02,000
functions of money they say money it's a
 

9869
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:03,750
functions of money they say money it's a
unit of count account yeah you're

9870
02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:03,760
unit of count account yeah you're
 

9871
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:06,710
unit of count account yeah you're
measuring it's a means of exchange okay

9872
02:50:06,710 --> 02:50:06,720
measuring it's a means of exchange okay
 

9873
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:08,469
measuring it's a means of exchange okay
and it's a store of value

9874
02:50:08,469 --> 02:50:08,479
and it's a store of value
 

9875
02:50:08,479 --> 02:50:09,830
and it's a store of value
okay now

9876
02:50:09,830 --> 02:50:09,840
okay now
 

9877
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:12,790
okay now
yes okay it has those three roles but

9878
02:50:12,790 --> 02:50:12,800
yes okay it has those three roles but
 

9879
02:50:12,800 --> 02:50:14,389
yes okay it has those three roles but
the last one is contradictory of the

9880
02:50:14,389 --> 02:50:14,399
the last one is contradictory of the
 

9881
02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:15,830
the last one is contradictory of the
previous two

9882
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:15,840
previous two
 

9883
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:17,429
previous two
because and this is where we see this

9884
02:50:17,429 --> 02:50:17,439
because and this is where we see this
 

9885
02:50:17,439 --> 02:50:19,349
because and this is where we see this
with the bitcoin phenomenon

9886
02:50:19,349 --> 02:50:19,359
with the bitcoin phenomenon
 

9887
02:50:19,359 --> 02:50:21,030
with the bitcoin phenomenon
if you want to hang onto money as a

9888
02:50:21,030 --> 02:50:21,040
if you want to hang onto money as a
 

9889
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:23,670
if you want to hang onto money as a
store of value

9890
02:50:23,670 --> 02:50:23,680
store of value
 

9891
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:24,630
store of value
then

9892
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:24,640
then
 

9893
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:27,030
then
if prices are falling

9894
02:50:27,030 --> 02:50:27,040
if prices are falling
 

9895
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:29,429
if prices are falling
the value of money is rising

9896
02:50:29,429 --> 02:50:29,439
the value of money is rising
 

9897
02:50:29,439 --> 02:50:31,349
the value of money is rising
and it's actually in your interests as a

9898
02:50:31,349 --> 02:50:31,359
and it's actually in your interests as a
 

9899
02:50:31,359 --> 02:50:33,349
and it's actually in your interests as a
store of value to hang on to it and not

9900
02:50:33,349 --> 02:50:33,359
store of value to hang on to it and not
 

9901
02:50:33,359 --> 02:50:35,110
store of value to hang on to it and not
spend it okay

9902
02:50:35,110 --> 02:50:35,120
spend it okay
 

9903
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:37,670
spend it okay
so that contradicts its role as a means

9904
02:50:37,670 --> 02:50:37,680
so that contradicts its role as a means
 

9905
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:39,030
so that contradicts its role as a means
of exchange

9906
02:50:39,030 --> 02:50:39,040
of exchange
 

9907
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:41,429
of exchange
now if you have money which depreciates

9908
02:50:41,429 --> 02:50:41,439
now if you have money which depreciates
 

9909
02:50:41,439 --> 02:50:43,429
now if you have money which depreciates
and this was actually tried in this in

9910
02:50:43,429 --> 02:50:43,439
and this was actually tried in this in
 

9911
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:45,269
and this was actually tried in this in
the austrian town of wargle during the

9912
02:50:45,269 --> 02:50:45,279
the austrian town of wargle during the
 

9913
02:50:45,279 --> 02:50:46,790
the austrian town of wargle during the
second before during the great

9914
02:50:46,790 --> 02:50:46,800
second before during the great
 

9915
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:48,150
second before during the great
depression

9916
02:50:48,150 --> 02:50:48,160
depression
 

9917
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:50,389
depression
if you have money that depreciates then

9918
02:50:50,389 --> 02:50:50,399
if you have money that depreciates then
 

9919
02:50:50,399 --> 02:50:52,070
if you have money that depreciates then
if you don't use it you lose it

9920
02:50:52,070 --> 02:50:52,080
if you don't use it you lose it
 

9921
02:50:52,080 --> 02:50:54,150
if you don't use it you lose it
fundamentally so it has a high rate of

9922
02:50:54,150 --> 02:50:54,160
fundamentally so it has a high rate of
 

9923
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:56,550
fundamentally so it has a high rate of
circulation so there's a

9924
02:50:56,550 --> 02:50:56,560
circulation so there's a
 

9925
02:50:56,560 --> 02:50:58,469
circulation so there's a
a monetary theorist called silvio

9926
02:50:58,469 --> 02:50:58,479
a monetary theorist called silvio
 

9927
02:50:58,479 --> 02:50:59,590
a monetary theorist called silvio

gazelle
and he wrote this proposal that money

9930
02:51:01,670 --> 02:51:01,680
and he wrote this proposal that money
 

9931
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:03,349
and he wrote this proposal that money
should depreciate

9932
02:51:03,349 --> 02:51:03,359
should depreciate
 

9933
02:51:03,359 --> 02:51:05,190

and so he thought how can i stimulate

9954
02:51:27,269 --> 02:51:27,279
and so he thought how can i stimulate
 

9955
02:51:27,279 --> 02:51:29,510
and so he thought how can i stimulate
demand here so he produced a script

9956
02:51:29,510 --> 02:51:29,520
demand here so he produced a script
 

9957
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:30,950
demand here so he produced a script
which could only be used for buying

9958
02:51:30,950 --> 02:51:30,960
which could only be used for buying
 

9959

goods and services in wargle
 

9961
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:34,630
goods and services in wargle
and

9962
02:51:34,630 --> 02:51:34,640
and
 

9963
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:36,309
and

02:51:38,870 --> 02:51:38,880
rates but it was depreciated by putting
 

9967
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:40,630
rates but it was depreciated by putting
a stamp on the money if you didn't use

9968
02:51:40,630 --> 02:51:40,640
a stamp on the money if you didn't use
 

9969
02:51:40,640 --> 02:51:43,429
a stamp on the money if you didn't use
it so what happened was people would pay

9970
02:51:43,429 --> 02:51:43,439
it so what happened was people would pay
 

9971
02:51:43,439 --> 02:51:45,349
it so what happened was people would pay
their rates they needed to pay the rates

9972
02:51:45,349 --> 02:51:45,359
their rates they needed to pay the rates
 

9973
02:51:45,359 --> 02:51:47,269
their rates they needed to pay the rates
using this money so the the script so

9974
02:51:47,269 --> 02:51:47,279
using this money so the the script so
 

9975
02:51:47,279 --> 02:51:50,230
using this money so the the script so
they use the script and it because it

9976
02:51:50,230 --> 02:51:50,240
they use the script and it because it
 

9977
02:51:50,240 --> 02:51:52,710
they use the script and it because it
depreciated you'd use it rapidly so

9978
02:51:52,710 --> 02:51:52,720
depreciated you'd use it rapidly so
 

9979
02:51:52,720 --> 02:51:55,110
depreciated you'd use it rapidly so
people were using that money this

9980
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:55,120
people were using that money this
 

9981
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:57,590
people were using that money this
alternative to the austrian shilling and

9982
02:51:57,590 --> 02:51:57,600
alternative to the austrian shilling and
 

9983
02:51:57,600 --> 02:51:59,830
alternative to the austrian shilling and
the economic activity in town took off

9984
02:51:59,830 --> 02:51:59,840
the economic activity in town took off
 

9985
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:02,070
the economic activity in town took off
and unemployment fell to zero and it was

and unemployment fell to zero and it was
 

9987
02:52:02,080 --> 02:52:03,990
and unemployment fell to zero and it was
an absolute miracle and if you loved a

02:52:03,990 --> 02:52:04,000
an absolute miracle and if you loved a
 

9989
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,070
an absolute miracle and if you loved a
wargle experiment and the austrian

9990
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:06,080
wargle experiment and the austrian
 

9991
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:07,990
wargle experiment and the austrian
central bank sued them

9992
02:52:07,990 --> 02:52:08,000
central bank sued them
 

9993
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:09,750
central bank sued them
for establishing an alternative form of

02:52:09,750 --> 02:52:09,760
for establishing an alternative form of
 

9995
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:11,510
for establishing an alternative form of

unemployment went back up to 25 again
 

9999
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,309
unemployment went back up to 25 again
and austria voted you know what 99 point

10000
02:52:16,309 --> 02:52:16,319
and austria voted you know what 99 point
 

10001

was it 99.6

10002
02:52:18,469 --> 02:52:18,479
was it 99.6
 

10003
02:52:18,479 --> 02:52:20,870
was it 99.6
for the nazis something crazy number

10004
02:52:20,870 --> 02:52:20,880
for the nazis something crazy number
 

10005
02:52:20,880 --> 02:52:23,510
for the nazis something crazy number
like that one when hitler marched in so

10006
02:52:23,510 --> 02:52:23,520
like that one when hitler marched in so
 

10007
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:25,750
like that one when hitler marched in so
the wargle experiment showed that a

10008
02:52:25,750 --> 02:52:25,760
the wargle experiment showed that a
 

10009
02:52:25,760 --> 02:52:27,990
the wargle experiment showed that a
depreciating currency led to a high rate

10010
02:52:27,990 --> 02:52:28,000
depreciating currency led to a high rate
 

10011
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,230
depreciating currency led to a high rate
of circulation but of course we're not

10012
02:52:30,230 --> 02:52:30,240
of circulation but of course we're not
 

10013

talking by my republic levels of

02:52:32,550 --> 02:52:32,560
talking by my republic levels of
 

10015
02:52:32,560 --> 02:52:35,190
talking by my republic levels of
inflation so when you get that much

10016
02:52:35,190 --> 02:52:35,200
inflation so when you get that much
 

10017
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:37,670
inflation so when you get that much
inflation and that's normally caused by

10018
02:52:37,670 --> 02:52:37,680
inflation and that's normally caused by
 

10019
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:40,230
inflation and that's normally caused by
as the as the as the weimar inflation

10020
02:52:40,230 --> 02:52:40,240
as the as the as the weimar inflation
 

10021
02:52:40,240 --> 02:52:42,469
as the as the as the weimar inflation
was caused by the reparation terms

10022
02:52:42,469 --> 02:52:42,479
was caused by the reparation terms
 

10023
02:52:42,479 --> 02:52:44,309
was caused by the reparation terms
imposed on germany

10024
02:52:44,309 --> 02:52:44,319
imposed on germany
 

10025
02:52:44,319 --> 02:52:46,469
imposed on germany
fundamentally by france at the 3d

10026
02:52:46,469 --> 02:52:46,479
fundamentally by france at the 3d

versailles

10028
02:52:47,750 --> 02:52:47,760
versailles
 

10029
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:48,630
versailles
they

10030
02:52:48,630 --> 02:52:48,640
they
 

10031
02:52:48,640 --> 02:52:50,389
they
paid a large part of that with just

10032
02:52:50,389 --> 02:52:50,399
paid a large part of that with just
 

10033
02:52:50,399 --> 02:52:52,150
paid a large part of that with just
basically printing the notes and he went

10034
02:52:52,150 --> 02:52:52,160
basically printing the notes and he went
 

10035
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:54,630
basically printing the notes and he went
into this crazy period of hyperinflation

10036
02:52:54,630 --> 02:52:54,640
into this crazy period of hyperinflation
 

10037
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:56,550
into this crazy period of hyperinflation
so hyperinflation almost always occurs

10038
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:56,560
so hyperinflation almost always occurs
 

10039
02:52:56,560 --> 02:52:57,990
so hyperinflation almost always occurs
when there's a massive destruction of

10040
02:52:57,990 --> 02:52:58,000
when there's a massive destruction of
 

10041
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,070
when there's a massive destruction of
physical resources and the monetary

10042
02:53:00,070 --> 02:53:00,080
physical resources and the monetary
 

10043
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:01,910
physical resources and the monetary
authority tries to pay back literally

10044
02:53:01,910 --> 02:53:01,920
authority tries to pay back literally
 

10045
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:03,750
authority tries to pay back literally
over it and then you get hyperinflation

10046
02:53:03,750 --> 02:53:03,760
over it and then you get hyperinflation
 

10047
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:06,070
over it and then you get hyperinflation
that's total social breakdown so a

10048
02:53:06,070 --> 02:53:06,080
that's total social breakdown so a
 

10049
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:08,630
that's total social breakdown so a
moderate level of inflation

10050
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:08,640
moderate level of inflation
 

10051
02:53:08,640 --> 02:53:11,590
moderate level of inflation
inspires the means of exchange usage of

10052
02:53:11,590 --> 02:53:11,600
inspires the means of exchange usage of
 

10053
02:53:11,600 --> 02:53:14,469
inspires the means of exchange usage of
money that undermines the store of value

10054
02:53:14,469 --> 02:53:14,479
money that undermines the store of value

and
 

10059
02:53:17,279 --> 02:53:20,469
and
and that dilemma is why we have this

10060
02:53:20,469 --> 02:53:20,479
and that dilemma is why we have this
 

10061
02:53:20,479 --> 02:53:23,269
and that dilemma is why we have this
antagonistic attitude towards inflation

antagonistic attitude towards inflation
 

10063

yeah i mean you're describing his

10064
02:53:24,870 --> 02:53:24,880
yeah i mean you're describing his

02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:26,710
yeah i mean you're describing his
attention

attention
 

10067
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:28,389
attention
but

10068
02:53:28,389 --> 02:53:28,399
but
 

10069
02:53:28,399 --> 02:53:30,790
but
it's nevertheless is like money is a

02:53:30,790 --> 02:53:30,800
it's nevertheless is like money is a
 

10071
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:32,550
it's nevertheless is like money is a
store of value and a means of exchange

10072
02:53:32,550 --> 02:53:32,560
store of value and a means of exchange
 

10073
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:33,910
store of value and a means of exchange

10074
02:53:33,910 --> 02:53:33,920
and i don't
 

10075
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:34,790

you know
 

10077
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:36,790
you know
to push back it's not necessarily that

10078
02:53:36,790 --> 02:53:36,800
to push back it's not necessarily that
 

10079
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:38,469
to push back it's not necessarily that
there's attention it's just that

02:53:52,479 --> 02:53:54,389
means of exchange
it's deflation using more for store

10096
02:53:54,389 --> 02:53:54,399
it's deflation using more for store
 

10097
02:53:54,399 --> 02:53:56,389
it's deflation using more for store
value but that doesn't i don't see it as

10098
02:53:56,389 --> 02:53:56,399
value but that doesn't i don't see it as
 

10099
02:53:56,399 --> 02:53:58,550
value but that doesn't i don't see it as
a tension that's just the uh

10100
02:53:58,550 --> 02:53:58,560
a tension that's just the uh
 

10101
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:00,469
a tension that's just the uh
how much you use it for those different

10102
02:54:00,469 --> 02:54:00,479
how much you use it for those different
 

10103
02:54:00,479 --> 02:54:02,710
how much you use it for those different
like but a bit ends up saying that

10104
02:54:02,710 --> 02:54:02,720
like but a bit ends up saying that
 

10105
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:06,150
like but a bit ends up saying that
overall the level of effective commerce

10106
02:54:06,150 --> 02:54:06,160
overall the level of effective commerce
 

10107
02:54:06,160 --> 02:54:08,150
overall the level of effective commerce
a bit of inflation is a good thing

10108
02:54:08,150 --> 02:54:08,160
a bit of inflation is a good thing
 

10109
02:54:08,160 --> 02:54:09,750
a bit of inflation is a good thing
because that's depreciating the money

10110
02:54:09,750 --> 02:54:09,760
because that's depreciating the money
 

10111
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:11,670
because that's depreciating the money
slightly and encourage its use yeah but

10112
02:54:11,670 --> 02:54:11,680
slightly and encourage its use yeah but
 

10113
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:14,070
slightly and encourage its use yeah but
so the argument that

10114
02:54:14,070 --> 02:54:14,080
so the argument that
 

10115
02:54:14,080 --> 02:54:16,469
so the argument that
uh some bitcoin folks use or gold

10116
02:54:16,469 --> 02:54:16,479
uh some bitcoin folks use or gold
 

10117
02:54:16,479 --> 02:54:19,670
uh some bitcoin folks use or gold
standards

10118
02:54:19,670 --> 02:54:19,680

 

10119
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:21,750

again huddle's not an argument

10120
02:54:21,750 --> 02:54:21,760
again huddle's not an argument
 

10121
02:54:21,760 --> 02:54:22,550
again huddle's not an argument
uh

10122
02:54:22,550 --> 02:54:22,560
uh
 

10123
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:24,550
uh
is that

10124
02:54:24,550 --> 02:54:24,560
is that
 

10125
02:54:24,560 --> 02:54:27,110
is that
having an inflation of zero

10126
02:54:27,110 --> 02:54:27,120
having an inflation of zero
 

10127
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:29,830
having an inflation of zero
is actually achieving that balance

10128
02:54:29,830 --> 02:54:29,840
is actually achieving that balance
 

10129
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:32,389
is actually achieving that balance
yeah right so like that yeah but they're

10130
02:54:32,389 --> 02:54:32,399
yeah right so like that yeah but they're
 

10131
02:54:32,399 --> 02:54:33,990
yeah right so like that yeah but they're
actually in favor of negative they

10132
02:54:33,990 --> 02:54:34,000
actually in favor of negative they
 

10133
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,150
actually in favor of negative they
wanted to appreciate rapidly and there's

10134
02:54:36,150 --> 02:54:36,160
wanted to appreciate rapidly and there's
 

10135
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:38,950
wanted to appreciate rapidly and there's
addictively negative inflation that the

10136
02:54:38,950 --> 02:54:38,960
addictively negative inflation that the
 

10137
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:41,349
addictively negative inflation that the
value of the value of the money rising

10138
02:54:41,349 --> 02:54:41,359
value of the value of the money rising
 

10139
02:54:41,359 --> 02:54:43,269
value of the value of the money rising
relative to commodities that's what they

10140
02:54:43,269 --> 02:54:43,279
relative to commodities that's what they
 

10141
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:46,150
relative to commodities that's what they
want that's the hotel philosophy

10142
02:54:46,150 --> 02:54:46,160
want that's the hotel philosophy
 

10143
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:47,910
want that's the hotel philosophy
well that's more of like an investment i

10144
02:54:47,910 --> 02:54:47,920
well that's more of like an investment i
 

10145
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:49,750
well that's more of like an investment i
don't know if that yeah that's more of

10146
02:54:49,750 --> 02:54:49,760
don't know if that yeah that's more of
 

10147
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:50,950
don't know if that yeah that's more of
an investment philosophy than the

10148
02:54:50,950 --> 02:54:50,960
an investment philosophy than the
 

10149
02:54:50,960 --> 02:54:52,630
an investment philosophy than the
fundamental principles of why they

10150
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:52,640
fundamental principles of why they
 

10151
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:53,670
fundamental principles of why they
believe in

10152
02:54:53,670 --> 02:54:53,680
believe in
 

10153
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:55,429
believe in
cryptocurrency and

10154
02:54:55,429 --> 02:54:55,439
cryptocurrency and
 

10155
02:54:55,439 --> 02:54:58,070
cryptocurrency and
enforce scarcity it's a model the

10156
02:54:58,070 --> 02:54:58,080
enforce scarcity it's a model the
 

10157
02:54:58,080 --> 02:54:59,990
enforce scarcity it's a model the
concern there is that when you print

10158
02:54:59,990 --> 02:55:00,000
concern there is that when you print
 

10159
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:01,030
concern there is that when you print
money

10160
02:55:01,030 --> 02:55:01,040

02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:06,070
policies detached from the actual
um

10166
02:55:06,070 --> 02:55:06,080
um
 

10167
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:07,269
um
from value

10168
02:55:07,269 --> 02:55:07,279
from value
 

10169
02:55:07,279 --> 02:55:08,870
from value
yeah well you get i mean this is this is

10170
02:55:08,870 --> 02:55:08,880
yeah well you get i mean this is this is
 

10171
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:10,230
yeah well you get i mean this is this is
where again it matters to get money

10172
02:55:10,230 --> 02:55:10,240
where again it matters to get money
 

10173
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:13,030
where again it matters to get money
creation right because the government's

10174
02:55:13,030 --> 02:55:13,040
creation right because the government's
 

10175
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:14,870
creation right because the government's
not the only money creator banks are as

10176
02:55:14,870 --> 02:55:14,880
not the only money creator banks are as
 

10177
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:16,950
not the only money creator banks are as
well private banks

10178
02:55:16,950 --> 02:55:16,960
well private banks
 

10179
02:55:16,960 --> 02:55:18,630
well private banks
and

10180
02:55:18,630 --> 02:55:18,640
and
 

10181
02:55:18,640 --> 02:55:21,110
and
and we if we obsess too much about

10182
02:55:21,110 --> 02:55:21,120
and we if we obsess too much about
 

10183
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:23,429
and we if we obsess too much about
limiting government money creation

10184
02:55:23,429 --> 02:55:23,439
limiting government money creation
 

10185
02:55:23,439 --> 02:55:25,510
limiting government money creation
what we end up getting if there is money

10186
02:55:25,510 --> 02:55:25,520
what we end up getting if there is money
 

10187
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:27,030
what we end up getting if there is money
creation going on the private banks

10188
02:55:27,030 --> 02:55:27,040
creation going on the private banks
 

10189
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:28,870
creation going on the private banks
doing it and you get an increase in

10190
02:55:28,870 --> 02:55:28,880
doing it and you get an increase in
 

10191
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:31,670
doing it and you get an increase in
private debt and fundamentally private

10192
02:55:31,670 --> 02:55:31,680
private debt and fundamentally private
 

10193
02:55:31,680 --> 02:55:33,750
private debt and fundamentally private
debt and its collapse

10194
02:55:33,750 --> 02:55:33,760
debt and its collapse
 

10195
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:35,429
debt and its collapse
uh

10196
02:55:35,429 --> 02:55:35,439
uh
 

10197
02:55:35,439 --> 02:55:37,750
uh
types of credit when it stops growing

10198
02:55:37,750 --> 02:55:37,760
types of credit when it stops growing
 

10199
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:38,950
types of credit when it stops growing
that's the fundamental cause of

10200
02:55:38,950 --> 02:55:38,960
that's the fundamental cause of
 

10201
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:40,950
that's the fundamental cause of
financial crises

10202
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:40,960
financial crises
 

10203
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:43,110
financial crises
so yeah but the question is what's the

10204
02:55:43,110 --> 02:55:43,120
so yeah but the question is what's the
 

10205
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:46,230
so yeah but the question is what's the
the cause for the the collapse of the

10206
02:55:46,230 --> 02:55:46,240
the cause for the the collapse of the
 

10207
02:55:46,240 --> 02:55:48,150
the cause for the the collapse of the
uh well i think this is like the

10208
02:55:48,150 --> 02:55:48,160
uh well i think this is like the
 

10209
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:50,630
uh well i think this is like the
austrian thinking leaves out the debt

10210
02:55:50,630 --> 02:55:50,640
austrian thinking leaves out the debt
 

10211
02:55:50,640 --> 02:55:53,030
austrian thinking leaves out the debt
deflation and that's like i think one of

10212
02:55:53,030 --> 02:55:53,040
deflation and that's like i think one of
 

10213
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:55,030
deflation and that's like i think one of
the most important papers ever written

10214
02:55:55,030 --> 02:55:55,040
the most important papers ever written
 

10215
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:56,790
the most important papers ever written
was by irving fischer called the debt

10216
02:55:56,790 --> 02:55:56,800
was by irving fischer called the debt
 

10217
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:59,269
was by irving fischer called the debt
deflation theory of great depressions

10218
02:55:59,269 --> 02:55:59,279
deflation theory of great depressions
 

10219
02:55:59,279 --> 02:56:00,950
deflation theory of great depressions
fischer was somebody who

10220
02:56:00,950 --> 02:56:00,960
fischer was somebody who
 

10221
02:56:00,960 --> 02:56:02,630
fischer was somebody who
accepted the neoclassical vision he

10222
02:56:02,630 --> 02:56:02,640
accepted the neoclassical vision he
 

10223
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:04,830
accepted the neoclassical vision he
wrote the

10224
02:56:04,830 --> 02:56:04,840
wrote the
 

10225
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:07,349
wrote the
pre-efficiency market hypothesis

10226
02:56:07,349 --> 02:56:07,359
pre-efficiency market hypothesis
 

10227
02:56:07,359 --> 02:56:09,670
pre-efficiency market hypothesis
efficiency market hypothesis he had a

10228
02:56:09,670 --> 02:56:09,680
efficiency market hypothesis he had a
 

10229
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:12,790
efficiency market hypothesis he had a
his his own phd called the theory of

10230
02:56:12,790 --> 02:56:12,800
his his own phd called the theory of
 

10231
02:56:12,800 --> 02:56:14,389
his his own phd called the theory of
interest

10232
02:56:14,389 --> 02:56:14,399
interest
 

10233
02:56:14,399 --> 02:56:16,150
interest
and in that he argued effectively for a

10234
02:56:16,150 --> 02:56:16,160
and in that he argued effectively for a
 

10235
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:18,870
and in that he argued effectively for a
supply and demand analysis of the of the

10236
02:56:18,870 --> 02:56:18,880
supply and demand analysis of the of the
 

10237
02:56:18,880 --> 02:56:21,510
supply and demand analysis of the of the
um financial system

10238
02:56:21,510 --> 02:56:21,520
um financial system
 

10239
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:23,830
um financial system
and he argued for equilibrium

10240
02:56:23,830 --> 02:56:23,840
and he argued for equilibrium
 

10241
02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:25,990
and he argued for equilibrium
he said when you're working with a like

10242
02:56:25,990 --> 02:56:26,000
he said when you're working with a like
 

10243
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:29,030
he said when you're working with a like

uh
the transaction and the exchange occur

10248
02:56:32,389 --> 02:56:32,399
the transaction and the exchange occur
 

10249
02:56:32,399 --> 02:56:34,710
the transaction and the exchange occur

when you're working with the financial
 

10253

so he's he said he assumed that debts

10258
02:56:42,230 --> 02:56:42,240
so he's he said he assumed that debts
 

10259
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:44,070
so he's he said he assumed that debts
are repaid

10260
02:56:44,070 --> 02:56:44,080
are repaid
 

10261
02:56:44,080 --> 02:56:46,550
are repaid
all debts are repaid and he assumed that

10262
02:56:46,550 --> 02:56:46,560
all debts are repaid and he assumed that
 

10263
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:48,630
all debts are repaid and he assumed that
equilibrium through time was an

10264
02:56:48,630 --> 02:56:48,640
equilibrium through time was an
 

10265
02:56:48,640 --> 02:56:50,710
equilibrium through time was an
essential part of his assumption this is

10266
02:56:50,710 --> 02:56:50,720
essential part of his assumption this is
 

10267
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:51,910
essential part of his assumption this is
and then the great depression comes

10268
02:56:51,910 --> 02:56:51,920
and then the great depression comes
 

10269
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:54,389
and then the great depression comes
along

10270
02:56:54,389 --> 02:56:54,399
along
 

10271
02:56:54,399 --> 02:56:55,990
along
and he

10272
02:56:55,990 --> 02:56:56,000
and he
 

10273
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,230
and he
has become a major shareholder in rank

10274
02:56:58,230 --> 02:56:58,240
has become a major shareholder in rank

because he invented the rolodex

10278
02:57:01,910 --> 02:57:01,920
because he invented the rolodex
 

10279
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:05,030
because he invented the rolodex
he's a tinkerer and so he had taken out

10280
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:05,040
he's a tinkerer and so he had taken out
 

10281
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:05,990
he's a tinkerer and so he had taken out
shares

10282
02:57:05,990 --> 02:57:06,000
shares
 

10283
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,150
shares
on margin and he was worth about 100

10284
02:57:08,150 --> 02:57:08,160
on margin and he was worth about 100
 

10285
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:10,710
on margin and he was worth about 100
million in modern terms

10286
02:57:10,710 --> 02:57:10,720
million in modern terms
 

10287
02:57:10,720 --> 02:57:13,110
million in modern terms
when the great depression hit and 90 of

10288
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:13,120
when the great depression hit and 90 of
 

10289
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:14,870
when the great depression hit and 90 of
that was share market valuation he'd

10290
02:57:14,870 --> 02:57:14,880
that was share market valuation he'd
 

10291
02:57:14,880 --> 02:57:16,389
that was share market valuation he'd
taken out margin debt just like

10292
02:57:16,389 --> 02:57:16,399
taken out margin debt just like
 

10293
02:57:16,399 --> 02:57:17,830
taken out margin debt just like
everybody else

10294
02:57:17,830 --> 02:57:17,840
everybody else
 

10295
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:19,429
everybody else
and with margin debt you could put down

10296
02:57:19,429 --> 02:57:19,439
and with margin debt you could put down
 

10297
02:57:19,439 --> 02:57:21,110
and with margin debt you could put down
a hundred thousand dollars and buy a

10298
02:57:21,110 --> 02:57:21,120
a hundred thousand dollars and buy a
 

10299
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:23,830
a hundred thousand dollars and buy a
million dollars worth of shares

10300
02:57:23,830 --> 02:57:23,840
million dollars worth of shares
 

10301
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:26,870
million dollars worth of shares
so you got this huge leverage into debt

10302
02:57:26,870 --> 02:57:26,880
so you got this huge leverage into debt
 

10303
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:28,710
so you got this huge leverage into debt
now that when the financial crisis hit

10304
02:57:28,710 --> 02:57:28,720
now that when the financial crisis hit
 

10305
02:57:28,720 --> 02:57:30,389
now that when the financial crisis hit
the level of margin debt in america had

10306
02:57:30,389 --> 02:57:30,399
the level of margin debt in america had
 

10307
02:57:30,399 --> 02:57:34,309
the level of margin debt in america had
risen from half a percent of gdp in 1920

10308
02:57:34,309 --> 02:57:34,319
risen from half a percent of gdp in 1920
 

10309
02:57:34,319 --> 02:57:36,950
risen from half a percent of gdp in 1920
to 13 of gdp

10310
02:57:36,950 --> 02:57:36,960
to 13 of gdp
 

10311
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:40,070
to 13 of gdp
in 1929 it then fell to zero again

10312
02:57:40,070 --> 02:57:40,080
in 1929 it then fell to zero again
 

10313
02:57:40,080 --> 02:57:41,910
in 1929 it then fell to zero again
that's why the stock market crash in 29

10314
02:57:41,910 --> 02:57:41,920
that's why the stock market crash in 29
 

10315
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:44,630
that's why the stock market crash in 29
was so devastating that scale of of

10316
02:57:44,630 --> 02:57:44,640
was so devastating that scale of of
 

10317
02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:46,150
was so devastating that scale of of
margin lending

10318
02:57:46,150 --> 02:57:46,160
margin lending
 

10319
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:47,510
margin lending
and everyone was being wiped out they

10320
02:57:47,510 --> 02:57:47,520
and everyone was being wiped out they
 

10321
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:49,349
and everyone was being wiped out they
were selling rolls-royces for 20 quid

10322
02:57:49,349 --> 02:57:49,359
were selling rolls-royces for 20 quid
 

10323
02:57:49,359 --> 02:57:50,389
were selling rolls-royces for 20 quid
you know that you literally have

10324
02:57:50,389 --> 02:57:50,399
you know that you literally have
 

10325
02:57:50,399 --> 02:57:51,990
you know that you literally have
photographs showing people doing that

10326
02:57:51,990 --> 02:57:52,000
photographs showing people doing that
 

10327
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:53,910
photographs showing people doing that
because a margin call comes in you've

10328
02:57:53,910 --> 02:57:53,920
because a margin call comes in you've
 

10329
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:55,830
because a margin call comes in you've
got to liquidate everything

10330
02:57:55,830 --> 02:57:55,840
got to liquidate everything
 

10331
02:57:55,840 --> 02:57:58,950
got to liquidate everything
okay so he said the danger is is is of a

10332
02:57:58,950 --> 02:57:58,960
okay so he said the danger is is is of a
 

10333
02:57:58,960 --> 02:58:01,349
okay so he said the danger is is is of a
debt deflation is what we have to avoid

10334
02:58:01,349 --> 02:58:01,359
debt deflation is what we have to avoid
 

10335
02:58:01,359 --> 02:58:03,670
debt deflation is what we have to avoid
okay and that means

10336
02:58:03,670 --> 02:58:03,680
okay and that means
 

10337
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:05,110
okay and that means
you don't want too much private debt to

10338
02:58:05,110 --> 02:58:05,120
you don't want too much private debt to
 

10339
02:58:05,120 --> 02:58:06,389
you don't want too much private debt to
accumulate

10340
02:58:06,389 --> 02:58:06,399
accumulate
 

10341
02:58:06,399 --> 02:58:07,910
accumulate
and you don't want

10342
02:58:07,910 --> 02:58:07,920
and you don't want
 

10343
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:09,670
and you don't want
falling prices because the falling

10344
02:58:09,670 --> 02:58:09,680
falling prices because the falling
 

10345
02:58:09,680 --> 02:58:11,510
falling prices because the falling
prices will amplify

10346
02:58:11,510 --> 02:58:11,520
prices will amplify
 

10347
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:13,590
prices will amplify
the impact of being insolvent to begin

10348
02:58:13,590 --> 02:58:13,600
the impact of being insolvent to begin
 

10349
02:58:13,600 --> 02:58:14,389
the impact of being insolvent to begin
with

with
 

10351
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:15,590
with
and that's what we saw in the great

10352
02:58:15,590 --> 02:58:15,600
and that's what we saw in the great
 

10353
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:18,030
and that's what we saw in the great
depression it's partially what we saw in

10354
02:58:18,030 --> 02:58:18,040
depression it's partially what we saw in
 

10355
02:58:18,040 --> 02:58:20,870
depression it's partially what we saw in
2007 but we didn't have anything like

10356
02:58:20,870 --> 02:58:20,880
2007 but we didn't have anything like
 

10357
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:23,429
2007 but we didn't have anything like
the level of of margin debt margin debt

10358
02:58:23,429 --> 02:58:23,439
the level of of margin debt margin debt
 

10359
02:58:23,439 --> 02:58:26,389
the level of of margin debt margin debt
was reduced from 90 to 50 ratio after

02:58:26,389 --> 02:58:26,399
was reduced from 90 to 50 ratio after

the great depression
 

10363
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:30,710
the great depression
um so there were limits on how bad it

10364
02:58:30,710 --> 02:58:30,720
um so there were limits on how bad it
 

10365
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:32,870
um so there were limits on how bad it
was in 2007

10366
02:58:32,870 --> 02:58:32,880
was in 2007
 

10367
02:58:32,880 --> 02:58:33,830
was in 2007
but

10368
02:58:33,830 --> 02:58:33,840
but
 

10369
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:35,429
but
the danger is still the period of

02:58:35,429 --> 02:58:35,439
the danger is still the period of

the danger is still the period of
deflation amplifies your debts

10372

deflation amplifies your debts

deflation amplifies your debts
okay and he's he i call it fisher's

10374
02:58:39,910 --> 02:58:39,920
okay and he's he i call it fisher's
 

10375
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:41,590
okay and he's he i call it fisher's
paradox he didn't write those terms

10376
02:58:41,590 --> 02:58:41,600
paradox he didn't write those terms
 

10377
02:58:41,600 --> 02:58:43,349
paradox he didn't write those terms
himself but he wrote a line saying the

10378
02:58:43,349 --> 02:58:43,359
himself but he wrote a line saying the
 

10379
02:58:43,359 --> 02:58:46,790
himself but he wrote a line saying the
more debtors pay the more they owe okay

10380
02:58:46,790 --> 02:58:46,800
more debtors pay the more they owe okay
 

10381
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:49,269
more debtors pay the more they owe okay
and this is because you're liquidating

10382
02:58:49,269 --> 02:58:49,279
and this is because you're liquidating
 

10383
02:58:49,279 --> 02:58:50,550
and this is because you're liquidating
to try to

10384
02:58:50,550 --> 02:58:50,560
to try to
 

10385
02:58:50,560 --> 02:58:52,070
to try to
meet your own debts

10386
02:58:52,070 --> 02:58:52,080
meet your own debts
 

10387
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:54,870
meet your own debts
when you liquidate the price level falls

10388
02:58:54,870 --> 02:58:54,880
when you liquidate the price level falls
 

10389
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:56,950
when you liquidate the price level falls
you will end up having a lower level of

10390
02:58:56,950 --> 02:58:56,960
you will end up having a lower level of
 

10391
02:58:56,960 --> 02:58:59,670
you will end up having a lower level of
monetary debt but a higher level of debt

10392
02:58:59,670 --> 02:58:59,680
monetary debt but a higher level of debt
 

10393
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:01,429
monetary debt but a higher level of debt
when you deflate it using the price

10394
02:59:01,429 --> 02:59:01,439
when you deflate it using the price
 

10395
02:59:01,439 --> 02:59:03,190
when you deflate it using the price
level so the biggest danger in

10396
02:59:03,190 --> 02:59:03,200
level so the biggest danger in
 

10397
02:59:03,200 --> 02:59:05,670
level so the biggest danger in
capitalism is the debt deflation

10398
02:59:05,670 --> 02:59:05,680
capitalism is the debt deflation
 

10399
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:07,910
capitalism is the debt deflation
far more dangerous than inflation and

10400
02:59:07,910 --> 02:59:07,920
far more dangerous than inflation and
 

10401
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:10,790
far more dangerous than inflation and
the cause of debt deflation is

10402
02:59:10,790 --> 02:59:10,800
the cause of debt deflation is
 

10403
02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:12,870
the cause of debt deflation is
too much lending too much bank lending

10404
02:59:12,870 --> 02:59:12,880
too much lending too much bank lending
 

10405
02:59:12,880 --> 02:59:14,870
too much lending too much bank lending
too much private money creation

10406
02:59:14,870 --> 02:59:14,880
too much private money creation
 

10407
02:59:14,880 --> 02:59:17,349
too much private money creation
and if you take a look at the 1920s

10408
02:59:17,349 --> 02:59:17,359
and if you take a look at the 1920s

explained the boom of the 1920s on his
surplus he said my government running a

surplus he said my government running a
 

10415
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:25,990
surplus he said my government running a
surplus of 1 of gdp pretty much from

10416
02:59:25,990 --> 02:59:26,000
surplus of 1 of gdp pretty much from
 

10417
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,389
surplus of 1 of gdp pretty much from
1922 through to 1930

10418
02:59:28,389 --> 02:59:28,399
1922 through to 1930
 

10419
02:59:28,399 --> 02:59:30,550
1922 through to 1930
is the foundation of our stability it

10420
02:59:30,550 --> 02:59:30,560
is the foundation of our stability it
 

10421

should be continued what he didn't look

10422
02:59:32,630 --> 02:59:32,640
should be continued what he didn't look
 

10423
02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:35,590
should be continued what he didn't look
at was that over that same time period

10424
02:59:35,590 --> 02:59:35,600
at was that over that same time period
 

10425
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:38,230
at was that over that same time period
on average americans were borrowing five

10426
02:59:38,230 --> 02:59:38,240
on average americans were borrowing five
 

10427
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:40,309
on average americans were borrowing five
percent of gdp per year from the private

10428
02:59:40,309 --> 02:59:40,319
percent of gdp per year from the private

banks
 

10431
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:43,590
banks
so you had a housing bubble at the

10432
02:59:43,590 --> 02:59:43,600
so you had a housing bubble at the
 

10433
02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:45,269
so you had a housing bubble at the
beginning of the 1920s which richard

10434
02:59:45,269 --> 02:59:45,279
beginning of the 1920s which richard
 

10435

beginning of the 1920s which richard
vague covers beautifully in the

10436
02:59:47,670 --> 02:59:47,680
vague covers beautifully in the
 

10437
02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:49,349
vague covers beautifully in the
brief history of doom

10438
02:59:49,349 --> 02:59:49,359
brief history of doom
 

10439
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:51,510
brief history of doom
and then you had this huge rise in

10440
02:59:51,510 --> 02:59:51,520
and then you had this huge rise in
 

10441
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:54,070
and then you had this huge rise in
margin debt as well gigantic increase in

10442
02:59:54,070 --> 02:59:54,080
margin debt as well gigantic increase in
 

10443
02:59:54,080 --> 02:59:55,429
margin debt as well gigantic increase in
margin debt

10444
02:59:55,429 --> 02:59:55,439
margin debt
 

10445
02:59:55,439 --> 02:59:57,349
margin debt
so all this borrowed money was being

10446
02:59:57,349 --> 02:59:57,359
so all this borrowed money was being
 

10447
02:59:57,359 --> 02:59:58,870
so all this borrowed money was being
spent into the economy and this is where

10448
02:59:58,870 --> 02:59:58,880
spent into the economy and this is where
 

10449
02:59:58,880 --> 03:00:00,710
spent into the economy and this is where
credit becomes part of aggregate demand

10450
03:00:00,710 --> 03:00:00,720
credit becomes part of aggregate demand
 

10451
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:02,150
credit becomes part of aggregate demand
and it's both not just for goods and

10452
03:00:02,150 --> 03:00:02,160
and it's both not just for goods and
 

10453
03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:04,710
and it's both not just for goods and
services it's also for shares and houses

10454
03:00:04,710 --> 03:00:04,720
services it's also for shares and houses
 

10455
03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:07,750
services it's also for shares and houses
and so on so a huge valuation effect

10456
03:00:07,750 --> 03:00:07,760
and so on so a huge valuation effect
 

10457
03:00:07,760 --> 03:00:10,389
and so on so a huge valuation effect
but then when the margin debt turned

10458
03:00:10,389 --> 03:00:10,399
but then when the margin debt turned
 

10459
03:00:10,399 --> 03:00:12,630
but then when the margin debt turned
around when people would not take out

10460
03:00:12,630 --> 03:00:12,640
around when people would not take out
 

10461
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:14,710
around when people would not take out
margin debt anymore the demand for

10462
03:00:14,710 --> 03:00:14,720
margin debt anymore the demand for
 

10463
03:00:14,720 --> 03:00:16,389
margin debt anymore the demand for
margin debt disappeared and then it was

10464
03:00:16,389 --> 03:00:16,399
margin debt disappeared and then it was
 

10465
03:00:16,399 --> 03:00:20,230
margin debt disappeared and then it was
a you know what we call badly a positive

10466
03:00:20,230 --> 03:00:20,240
a you know what we call badly a positive
 

10467
03:00:20,240 --> 03:00:21,910
a you know what we call badly a positive
feedback loop is actually an amplifying

10468
03:00:21,910 --> 03:00:21,920
feedback loop is actually an amplifying
 

10469
03:00:21,920 --> 03:00:24,950
feedback loop is actually an amplifying
feedback loop and that calls to collapse

10470
03:00:24,950 --> 03:00:24,960
feedback loop and that calls to collapse
 

10471
03:00:24,960 --> 03:00:25,750
feedback loop and that calls to collapse
so

10472
03:00:25,750 --> 03:00:25,760
so
 

10473
03:00:25,760 --> 03:00:28,070
so
what elements of that do you see today

10474
03:00:28,070 --> 03:00:28,080
what elements of that do you see today
 

10475
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:30,070
what elements of that do you see today
that we need to fix and how do we fix it

10476
03:00:30,070 --> 03:00:30,080
that we need to fix and how do we fix it
 

10477
03:00:30,080 --> 03:00:31,910
that we need to fix and how do we fix it
we have to regard the level of private

10478
03:00:31,910 --> 03:00:31,920
we have to regard the level of private
 

10479
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:33,110
we have to regard the level of private
debt as a

10480
03:00:33,110 --> 03:00:33,120
debt as a
 

10481
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:35,429
debt as a
target of economic policy just as much

10482
03:00:35,429 --> 03:00:35,439
target of economic policy just as much
 

10483
03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:36,950
target of economic policy just as much
as the rate of inflation or the rate of

10484
03:00:36,950 --> 03:00:36,960
as the rate of inflation or the rate of
 

10485
03:00:36,960 --> 03:00:39,429
as the rate of inflation or the rate of
unemployment how do wha what is the

10486
03:00:39,429 --> 03:00:39,439
unemployment how do wha what is the
 

10487
03:00:39,439 --> 03:00:41,030
unemployment how do wha what is the
moderate amount of private debt that's

10488
03:00:41,030 --> 03:00:41,040
moderate amount of private debt that's
 

10489
03:00:41,040 --> 03:00:42,710
moderate amount of private debt that's
good i would say something of you

10490
03:00:42,710 --> 03:00:42,720
good i would say something of you
 

10491
03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:44,469
good i would say something of you
anywhere between 30 and 70 percent of

10492
03:00:44,469 --> 03:00:44,479
anywhere between 30 and 70 percent of
 

10493

gdp
 

10495
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,150
gdp
what is it currently uh in america it's

10496
03:00:48,150 --> 03:00:48,160
what is it currently uh in america it's
 

10497

what is it currently uh in america it's
170 percent

170 percent
 

10499
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:51,429
170 percent
nice

10500
03:00:51,429 --> 03:00:51,439
nice
 

10501
03:00:51,439 --> 03:00:53,990
nice
of gdp of gdp oh that's for nice i've

10502
03:00:53,990 --> 03:00:54,000
of gdp of gdp oh that's for nice i've
 

10503
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,269
of gdp of gdp oh that's for nice i've
got that

10504
03:00:55,269 --> 03:00:55,279
got that
 

10505
03:00:55,279 --> 03:00:56,790
got that
after we talk but i can show you the the

10506
03:00:56,790 --> 03:00:56,800
after we talk but i can show you the the
 

10507
03:00:56,800 --> 03:00:58,469
after we talk but i can show you the the
data in this and it's

10508
03:00:58,469 --> 03:00:58,479
data in this and it's
 

10509
03:00:58,479 --> 03:01:00,870
data in this and it's
it it is just this huge increase in

10510
03:01:00,870 --> 03:01:00,880
it it is just this huge increase in
 

10511
03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:02,950
it it is just this huge increase in
private debt yeah the cause first of all

10512
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:02,960
private debt yeah the cause first of all
 

10513
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:04,230
private debt yeah the cause first of all
caused the boom

10514
03:01:04,230 --> 03:01:04,240
caused the boom
 

10515
03:01:04,240 --> 03:01:08,150
caused the boom
but then financing the credit causes

10516
03:01:08,150 --> 03:01:08,160
but then financing the credit causes
 

10517
03:01:08,160 --> 03:01:10,550
but then financing the credit causes
ultimately causes the slump and so if we

10518
03:01:10,550 --> 03:01:10,560
ultimately causes the slump and so if we
 

10519
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:12,230
ultimately causes the slump and so if we
remove the

10520
03:01:12,230 --> 03:01:12,240
remove the
 

10521
03:01:12,240 --> 03:01:14,309
remove the
rate level at which debt can reach and

10522
03:01:14,309 --> 03:01:14,319
rate level at which debt can reach and
 

10523
03:01:14,319 --> 03:01:16,790
rate level at which debt can reach and
we stop speculative lending and base

10524
03:01:16,790 --> 03:01:16,800
we stop speculative lending and base
 

10525
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:19,510
we stop speculative lending and base
heavily lending for both uh innovation

10526
03:01:19,510 --> 03:01:19,520
heavily lending for both uh innovation
 

10527
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:21,510
heavily lending for both uh innovation
invest investment and

10528
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:21,520
invest investment and
 

10529
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:23,510
invest investment and
essential consumption items we won't

10530
03:01:23,510 --> 03:01:23,520
essential consumption items we won't
 

10531
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:25,510
essential consumption items we won't
have the slump on the other side we can

10532
03:01:25,510 --> 03:01:25,520
have the slump on the other side we can
 

10533
03:01:25,520 --> 03:01:27,349
have the slump on the other side we can
we can get rid of financial instability

10534
03:01:27,349 --> 03:01:27,359
we can get rid of financial instability
 

10535
03:01:27,359 --> 03:01:29,830
we can get rid of financial instability
we can't stop financial cycles but we

10536
03:01:29,830 --> 03:01:29,840
we can't stop financial cycles but we
 

10537
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:31,670
we can't stop financial cycles but we
can stop financial breakdown and so we

10538
03:01:31,670 --> 03:01:31,680
can stop financial breakdown and so we
 

10539
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:32,790
can stop financial breakdown and so we
should really be focusing on the

10540
03:01:32,790 --> 03:01:32,800
should really be focusing on the
 

10541
03:01:32,800 --> 03:01:35,110
should really be focusing on the
instability and getting that yeah

10542
03:01:35,110 --> 03:01:35,120
instability and getting that yeah
 

10543
03:01:35,120 --> 03:01:37,510
instability and getting that yeah

intelligence yeah it is a catalyst but
 

10881
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:19,110
intelligence yeah it is a catalyst but
what it means is

10882
03:07:19,110 --> 03:07:19,120
what it means is
 

10883
03:07:19,120 --> 03:07:20,950
what it means is
uh we can delude ourselves as much as we

10884
03:07:20,950 --> 03:07:20,960
uh we can delude ourselves as much as we
 

10885
03:07:20,960 --> 03:07:22,790
uh we can delude ourselves as much as we
can inform ourselves

10886
03:07:22,790 --> 03:07:22,800
can inform ourselves
 

10887
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:23,510
can inform ourselves
so

10888
03:07:23,510 --> 03:07:23,520
so
 

10889
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:25,110
so
because we share beliefs we can do

10890
03:07:25,110 --> 03:07:25,120
because we share beliefs we can do
 

10891
03:07:25,120 --> 03:07:26,870
because we share beliefs we can do
things in a collective way

10892
03:07:26,870 --> 03:07:26,880
things in a collective way
 

10893
03:07:26,880 --> 03:07:28,950
things in a collective way
and if we believe that you know we can

10894
03:07:28,950 --> 03:07:28,960
and if we believe that you know we can
 

10895
03:07:28,960 --> 03:07:30,790
and if we believe that you know we can
if we take the incantations of the witch

10896
03:07:30,790 --> 03:07:30,800
if we take the incantations of the witch
 

10897
03:07:30,800 --> 03:07:32,230
if we take the incantations of the witch
doctors and we

10898
03:07:32,230 --> 03:07:32,240
doctors and we
 

10899
03:07:32,240 --> 03:07:33,830
doctors and we
and we happen to have a couple of spears

10900
03:07:33,830 --> 03:07:33,840
and we happen to have a couple of spears
 

10901
03:07:33,840 --> 03:07:35,590
and we happen to have a couple of spears
and and things we can go and attack the

10902
03:07:35,590 --> 03:07:35,600
and and things we can go and attack the
 

10903
03:07:35,600 --> 03:07:36,790
and and things we can go and attack the
local

10904
03:07:36,790 --> 03:07:36,800
local
 

10905
03:07:36,800 --> 03:07:39,830
local
uh hurt a tribe of

10906
03:07:39,830 --> 03:07:39,840
uh hurt a tribe of
 

10907
03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:41,830
uh hurt a tribe of
lions and drive them out and we become

10908
03:07:41,830 --> 03:07:41,840
lions and drive them out and we become
 

10909
03:07:41,840 --> 03:07:44,469
lions and drive them out and we become
the dominant species so it worked at the

10910
03:07:44,469 --> 03:07:44,479
the dominant species so it worked at the
 

10911
03:07:44,479 --> 03:07:46,230
the dominant species so it worked at the
stage where we were

10912
03:07:46,230 --> 03:07:46,240
stage where we were
 

10913
03:07:46,240 --> 03:07:48,070
stage where we were
in competition with other species on the

10914
03:07:48,070 --> 03:07:48,080
in competition with other species on the
 

10915
03:07:48,080 --> 03:07:49,590
in competition with other species on the
planet now that we're the dominant

10916
03:07:49,590 --> 03:07:49,600
planet now that we're the dominant
 

10917
03:07:49,600 --> 03:07:51,190
planet now that we're the dominant
species

10918
03:07:51,190 --> 03:07:51,200
species
 

10919
03:07:51,200 --> 03:07:53,590
species
then our beliefs get in the way

10920
03:07:53,590 --> 03:07:53,600
then our beliefs get in the way
 

10921
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:55,750
then our beliefs get in the way
so you agree with uh with einstein who

10922
03:07:55,750 --> 03:07:55,760
so you agree with uh with einstein who
 

10923
03:07:55,760 --> 03:07:57,990
so you agree with uh with einstein who
said uh the only

10924
03:07:57,990 --> 03:07:58,000
said uh the only
 

10925
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:59,349
said uh the only
there are only two things that are

10926
03:07:59,349 --> 03:07:59,359
there are only two things that are
 

10927
03:07:59,359 --> 03:08:01,030
there are only two things that are
infinite the universe and human

10928
03:08:01,030 --> 03:08:01,040
infinite the universe and human
 

10929
03:08:01,040 --> 03:08:02,790
infinite the universe and human
stupidity and he wasn't sure about the

10930
03:08:02,790 --> 03:08:02,800
stupidity and he wasn't sure about the
 

10931
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:04,309
stupidity and he wasn't sure about the
universe and he wasn't sure about the

10932
03:08:04,309 --> 03:08:04,319
universe and he wasn't sure about the
 

10933
03:08:04,319 --> 03:08:05,349
universe and he wasn't sure about the
right

10934
03:08:05,349 --> 03:08:05,359
right
 

10935
03:08:05,359 --> 03:08:06,790
right
that's right and he wasn't sure about

10936
03:08:06,790 --> 03:08:06,800
that's right and he wasn't sure about
 

10937
03:08:06,800 --> 03:08:08,070
that's right and he wasn't sure about
the universe

10938
03:08:08,070 --> 03:08:08,080
the universe
 

10939
03:08:08,080 --> 03:08:09,429
the universe
uh

10940
03:08:09,429 --> 03:08:09,439
uh
 

10941
03:08:09,439 --> 03:08:11,590
uh
yeah so you think that the collective i

10942
03:08:11,590 --> 03:08:11,600
yeah so you think that the collective i
 

10943
03:08:11,600 --> 03:08:12,630
yeah so you think that the collective i
mean

10944
03:08:12,630 --> 03:08:12,640
mean
 

10945
03:08:12,640 --> 03:08:14,710
mean
there's an affinity to the destructive

10946
03:08:14,710 --> 03:08:14,720
there's an affinity to the destructive
 

10947
03:08:14,720 --> 03:08:15,670
there's an affinity to the destructive
and the

10948
03:08:15,670 --> 03:08:15,680
and the
 

10949
03:08:15,680 --> 03:08:17,990
and the
the stupid the inhumane that's possible

10950
03:08:17,990 --> 03:08:18,000
the stupid the inhumane that's possible
 

10951
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:19,910
the stupid the inhumane that's possible
when we humans get together but it feels

10952
03:08:19,910 --> 03:08:19,920
when we humans get together but it feels
 

10953
03:08:19,920 --> 03:08:21,110
when we humans get together but it feels
like

10954
03:08:21,110 --> 03:08:21,120
like
 

10955
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:23,030
like
there's more trajectories there's more

10956
03:08:23,030 --> 03:08:23,040
there's more trajectories there's more
 

10957
03:08:23,040 --> 03:08:25,349
there's more trajectories there's more
possibility for creation there are and i

10958
03:08:25,349 --> 03:08:25,359
possibility for creation there are and i
 

10959
03:08:25,359 --> 03:08:26,870
possibility for creation there are and i
think that's why we have to

10960
03:08:26,870 --> 03:08:26,880
think that's why we have to
 

10961
03:08:26,880 --> 03:08:29,429
think that's why we have to
i say if we if we built around the idea

10962
03:08:29,429 --> 03:08:29,439
i say if we if we built around the idea
 

10963
03:08:29,439 --> 03:08:30,309
i say if we if we built around the idea
that our

10964
03:08:30,309 --> 03:08:30,319
that our
 

10965
03:08:30,319 --> 03:08:33,110
that our
role as a species is to maintain and

10966
03:08:33,110 --> 03:08:33,120
role as a species is to maintain and
 

10967
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:34,469
role as a species is to maintain and
extend life

10968
03:08:34,469 --> 03:08:34,479
extend life
 

10969
03:08:34,479 --> 03:08:36,710
extend life
on the planet and and if not find it

10970
03:08:36,710 --> 03:08:36,720
on the planet and and if not find it
 

10971
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:38,150
on the planet and and if not find it
elsewhere then

10972
03:08:38,150 --> 03:08:38,160
elsewhere then
 

10973
03:08:38,160 --> 03:08:40,550
elsewhere then
seated elsewhere yeah then that is a

10974
03:08:40,550 --> 03:08:40,560
seated elsewhere yeah then that is a
 

10975
03:08:40,560 --> 03:08:42,469
seated elsewhere yeah then that is a
vision which makes us creative and

10976
03:08:42,469 --> 03:08:42,479
vision which makes us creative and
 

10977
03:08:42,479 --> 03:08:43,990
vision which makes us creative and
confines the worst elements of our

10978
03:08:43,990 --> 03:08:44,000
confines the worst elements of our
 

10979
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,469
confines the worst elements of our
capacities to share beliefs

10980
03:08:46,469 --> 03:08:46,479
capacities to share beliefs
 

10981
03:08:46,479 --> 03:08:49,110
capacities to share beliefs
so i that's what i my hope is

10982
03:08:49,110 --> 03:08:49,120
so i that's what i my hope is
 

10983
03:08:49,120 --> 03:08:50,950
so i that's what i my hope is
that we'll reach that stage but i think

10984
03:08:50,950 --> 03:08:50,960
that we'll reach that stage but i think
 

10985
03:08:50,960 --> 03:08:53,110
that we'll reach that stage but i think
we've overshot it so badly

10986
03:08:53,110 --> 03:08:53,120
we've overshot it so badly
 

10987
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:55,110
we've overshot it so badly
that my real fear is we'll end up

10988
03:08:55,110 --> 03:08:55,120
that my real fear is we'll end up
 

10989
03:08:55,120 --> 03:08:56,790
that my real fear is we'll end up
blaming technology

10990
03:08:56,790 --> 03:08:56,800
blaming technology
 

10991
03:08:56,800 --> 03:08:57,750
blaming technology
for the

10992
03:08:57,750 --> 03:08:57,760
for the
 

10993
03:08:57,760 --> 03:08:59,269
for the
type of world we find ourselves living

10994
03:08:59,269 --> 03:08:59,279
type of world we find ourselves living
 

10995
03:08:59,279 --> 03:09:01,510
type of world we find ourselves living
in in the next 20 to 50 years so you

10996
03:09:01,510 --> 03:09:01,520
in in the next 20 to 50 years so you
 

10997
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:03,349
in in the next 20 to 50 years so you
think technology is going to be one of

10998
03:09:03,349 --> 03:09:03,359
think technology is going to be one of
 

10999
03:09:03,359 --> 03:09:04,070
think technology is going to be one of
the

11000
03:09:04,070 --> 03:09:04,080
the
 

11001
03:09:04,080 --> 03:09:05,750
the
part of the solution part of the

11002
03:09:05,750 --> 03:09:05,760
part of the solution part of the
 

11003
03:09:05,760 --> 03:09:08,150
part of the solution part of the
solution yeah but it's but

11004
03:09:08,150 --> 03:09:08,160
solution yeah but it's but
 

11005
03:09:08,160 --> 03:09:09,830
solution yeah but it's but
if we go through and blame it which is

11006
03:09:09,830 --> 03:09:09,840
if we go through and blame it which is
 

11007
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:11,750
if we go through and blame it which is
quite possible yeah we'll blame the

11008
03:09:11,750 --> 03:09:11,760
quite possible yeah we'll blame the
 

11009
03:09:11,760 --> 03:09:13,590
quite possible yeah we'll blame the
technology rather than blaming too much

11010
03:09:13,590 --> 03:09:13,600
technology rather than blaming too much
 

11011
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:15,269
technology rather than blaming too much
of the technology and the too much comes

11012
03:09:15,269 --> 03:09:15,279
of the technology and the too much comes
 

11013
03:09:15,279 --> 03:09:17,030
of the technology and the too much comes
down to what economists have told us

11014
03:09:17,030 --> 03:09:17,040
down to what economists have told us
 

11015
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:19,110
down to what economists have told us
that we can just continue consuming

11016
03:09:19,110 --> 03:09:19,120
that we can just continue consuming
 

11017
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:21,030
that we can just continue consuming
infinitely on a finite planet and

11018
03:09:21,030 --> 03:09:21,040
infinitely on a finite planet and
 

11019
03:09:21,040 --> 03:09:22,550
infinitely on a finite planet and
kenneth bolding said that beautifully

11020
03:09:22,550 --> 03:09:22,560
kenneth bolding said that beautifully
 

11021
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:23,429
kenneth bolding said that beautifully
said the

11022
03:09:23,429 --> 03:09:23,439
said the
 

11023
03:09:23,439 --> 03:09:25,269
said the
if somebody believes that he can have

11024
03:09:25,269 --> 03:09:25,279
if somebody believes that he can have
 

11025
03:09:25,279 --> 03:09:27,269
if somebody believes that he can have
exponential growth on a finite planet

11026
03:09:27,269 --> 03:09:27,279
exponential growth on a finite planet
 

11027
03:09:27,279 --> 03:09:28,469
exponential growth on a finite planet

go to uh
this american factory

11068
03:10:12,710 --> 03:10:12,720
this american factory
 

11069
03:10:12,720 --> 03:10:14,469
this american factory
uh that makes cars

11070
03:10:14,469 --> 03:10:14,479
uh that makes cars
 

11071
03:10:14,479 --> 03:10:17,910
uh that makes cars
here in austin and also visits starbase

11072
03:10:17,910 --> 03:10:17,920
here in austin and also visits starbase
 

11073
03:10:17,920 --> 03:10:20,630
here in austin and also visits starbase
so let me ask you about

11074
03:10:20,630 --> 03:10:20,640
so let me ask you about
 

11075
03:10:20,640 --> 03:10:22,469
so let me ask you about
expanding out into the universe is that

11076
03:10:22,469 --> 03:10:22,479
expanding out into the universe is that
 

11077
03:10:22,479 --> 03:10:24,070
expanding out into the universe is that
something that

11078
03:10:24,070 --> 03:10:24,080
something that
 

11079
03:10:24,080 --> 03:10:25,750
something that
that excites you yeah i mentioned about

11080
03:10:25,750 --> 03:10:25,760
that excites you yeah i mentioned about
 

11081
03:10:25,760 --> 03:10:28,309
that excites you yeah i mentioned about
the economics of it do you think um

11082
03:10:28,309 --> 03:10:28,319
the economics of it do you think um
 

11083
03:10:28,319 --> 03:10:29,269
the economics of it do you think um
does it

11084
03:10:29,269 --> 03:10:29,279
does it
 

11085
03:10:29,279 --> 03:10:31,110
does it
what do you think marx would think about

11086
03:10:31,110 --> 03:10:31,120
what do you think marx would think about
 

11087
03:10:31,120 --> 03:10:33,429
what do you think marx would think about
this like what economically

11088
03:10:33,429 --> 03:10:33,439
this like what economically
 

11089
03:10:33,439 --> 03:10:35,750
this like what economically
speaking what what is this is it a good

11090
03:10:35,750 --> 03:10:35,760
speaking what what is this is it a good
 

11091
03:10:35,760 --> 03:10:36,630
speaking what what is this is it a good
thing

11092
03:10:36,630 --> 03:10:36,640
thing
 

11093
03:10:36,640 --> 03:10:38,630
thing
i i think it's vital we can have

11094
03:10:38,630 --> 03:10:38,640
i i think it's vital we can have
 

11095
03:10:38,640 --> 03:10:40,710
i i think it's vital we can have
capitalism and outer space

11096
03:10:40,710 --> 03:10:40,720
capitalism and outer space
 

11097
03:10:40,720 --> 03:10:42,229
capitalism and outer space
far more successfully than we can have

11098
03:10:42,229 --> 03:10:42,239
far more successfully than we can have
 

11099
03:10:42,239 --> 03:10:44,150
far more successfully than we can have
it on the planet because we don't face

11100
03:10:44,150 --> 03:10:44,160
it on the planet because we don't face
 

11101
03:10:44,160 --> 03:10:45,830
it on the planet because we don't face
when we dump the waste ends up in the

11102
03:10:45,830 --> 03:10:45,840
when we dump the waste ends up in the
 

11103
03:10:45,840 --> 03:10:48,790
when we dump the waste ends up in the
sun not a problem okay um

11104
03:10:48,790 --> 03:10:48,800
sun not a problem okay um
 

11105
03:10:48,800 --> 03:10:51,750
sun not a problem okay um
so it means the potential we don't

11106
03:10:51,750 --> 03:10:51,760
so it means the potential we don't
 

11107
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:54,150
so it means the potential we don't
undermine our own productive capacity if

11108
03:10:54,150 --> 03:10:54,160
undermine our own productive capacity if
 

11109
03:10:54,160 --> 03:10:55,750
undermine our own productive capacity if
we're doing it in outer space so the

11110
03:10:55,750 --> 03:10:55,760
we're doing it in outer space so the
 

11111
03:10:55,760 --> 03:10:58,309
we're doing it in outer space so the
destructive element of waste is uh has a

11112
03:10:58,309 --> 03:10:58,319
destructive element of waste is uh has a
 

11113
03:10:58,319 --> 03:11:00,469
destructive element of waste is uh has a
lesser impact in this car yeah i mean

11114
03:11:00,469 --> 03:11:00,479
lesser impact in this car yeah i mean
 

11115
03:11:00,479 --> 03:11:02,229
lesser impact in this car yeah i mean
who cares if we throw a bit of our iron

11116
03:11:02,229 --> 03:11:02,239
who cares if we throw a bit of our iron
 

11117
03:11:02,239 --> 03:11:04,229
who cares if we throw a bit of our iron
back into the sun again and take a fair

11118
03:11:04,229 --> 03:11:04,239
back into the sun again and take a fair
 

11119
03:11:04,239 --> 03:11:05,750
back into the sun again and take a fair
bit of it to turn it into a what would

11120
03:11:05,750 --> 03:11:05,760
bit of it to turn it into a what would
 

11121
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:08,550
bit of it to turn it into a what would
be the next stage to be a red giant um

11122
03:11:08,550 --> 03:11:08,560
be the next stage to be a red giant um
 

11123
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:09,830
be the next stage to be a red giant um
and we have to get away because if

11124
03:11:09,830 --> 03:11:09,840
and we have to get away because if
 

11125
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:11,750
and we have to get away because if
there's a red giant at some stage it'll

11126
03:11:11,750 --> 03:11:11,760
there's a red giant at some stage it'll
 

11127
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:13,429
there's a red giant at some stage it'll
the sun will head out past the orbit of

11128
03:11:13,429 --> 03:11:13,439
the sun will head out past the orbit of
 

11129
03:11:13,439 --> 03:11:15,750
the sun will head out past the orbit of
mars i think certainly past the orbit of

11130
03:11:15,750 --> 03:11:15,760
mars i think certainly past the orbit of
 

11131
03:11:15,760 --> 03:11:16,630
mars i think certainly past the orbit of
earth

11132
03:11:16,630 --> 03:11:16,640
earth
 

11133
03:11:16,640 --> 03:11:17,510
earth
so

11134
03:11:17,510 --> 03:11:17,520
so
 

11135
03:11:17,520 --> 03:11:20,150
so
to have the longevity of

11136
03:11:20,150 --> 03:11:20,160
to have the longevity of
 

11137
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:22,550
to have the longevity of
just human life

11138
03:11:22,550 --> 03:11:22,560
just human life
 

11139
03:11:22,560 --> 03:11:25,190
just human life
the life that evolved on this planet we

11140
03:11:25,190 --> 03:11:25,200
the life that evolved on this planet we
 

11141
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:26,950
the life that evolved on this planet we
have to be able to take it off planet

11142
03:11:26,950 --> 03:11:26,960
have to be able to take it off planet
 

11143
03:11:26,960 --> 03:11:29,190
have to be able to take it off planet
ultimately so if you think in the really

11144
03:11:29,190 --> 03:11:29,200
ultimately so if you think in the really
 

11145
03:11:29,200 --> 03:11:30,550
ultimately so if you think in the really
long term

11146
03:11:30,550 --> 03:11:30,560
long term
 

11147
03:11:30,560 --> 03:11:32,790
long term
then it's our responsibility we're going

11148
03:11:32,790 --> 03:11:32,800
then it's our responsibility we're going
 

11149
03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:35,510
then it's our responsibility we're going
to maintain life is to get is to

11150
03:11:35,510 --> 03:11:35,520
to maintain life is to get is to
 

11151
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:38,790
to maintain life is to get is to
establish life off the planet

11152
03:11:38,790 --> 03:11:38,800
establish life off the planet
 

11153
03:11:38,800 --> 03:11:41,990
establish life off the planet
what do you think about robots and ai

11154
03:11:41,990 --> 03:11:42,000
what do you think about robots and ai
 

11155
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:43,750
what do you think about robots and ai
part of the expanding our interviews oh

11156
03:11:43,750 --> 03:11:43,760
part of the expanding our interviews oh
 

11157
03:11:43,760 --> 03:11:45,590
part of the expanding our interviews oh
yeah we have to i mean you that's that

11158
03:11:45,590 --> 03:11:45,600
yeah we have to i mean you that's that
 

11159
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:47,990
yeah we have to i mean you that's that
that ends labor you can't be you can't

11160
03:11:47,990 --> 03:11:48,000
that ends labor you can't be you can't
 

11161
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:49,590
that ends labor you can't be you can't
go for it you know you're deadly jean

11162
03:11:49,590 --> 03:11:49,600
go for it you know you're deadly jean
 

11163
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:51,269
go for it you know you're deadly jean
can't be from here to the asteroid belt

11164
03:11:51,269 --> 03:11:51,279
can't be from here to the asteroid belt
 

11165
03:11:51,279 --> 03:11:52,870
can't be from here to the asteroid belt
and back again for dinner with your

11166
03:11:52,870 --> 03:11:52,880
and back again for dinner with your
 

11167
03:11:52,880 --> 03:11:55,269
and back again for dinner with your
family uh so with production would be

11168
03:11:55,269 --> 03:11:55,279
family uh so with production would be
 

11169
03:11:55,279 --> 03:11:57,349
family uh so with production would be
entirely mechanized there'd be have to

11170
03:11:57,349 --> 03:11:57,359
entirely mechanized there'd be have to
 

11171
03:11:57,359 --> 03:11:59,030
entirely mechanized there'd be have to
be a handful of people who service the

11172
03:11:59,030 --> 03:11:59,040
be a handful of people who service the
 

11173
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:00,950
be a handful of people who service the
machines but so it's about production

11174
03:12:00,950 --> 03:12:00,960
machines but so it's about production
 

11175
03:12:00,960 --> 03:12:03,830
machines but so it's about production
and automation what about

11176
03:12:03,830 --> 03:12:03,840
and automation what about
 

11177
03:12:03,840 --> 03:12:05,590
and automation what about
elements of consciousness that make

11178
03:12:05,590 --> 03:12:05,600
elements of consciousness that make
 

11179
03:12:05,600 --> 03:12:07,510
elements of consciousness that make
humans so special

11180
03:12:07,510 --> 03:12:07,520
humans so special
 

11181
03:12:07,520 --> 03:12:09,349
humans so special
what about that persisting within them

11182
03:12:09,349 --> 03:12:09,359
what about that persisting within them
 

11183
03:12:09,359 --> 03:12:11,269
what about that persisting within them
that i mean i'm still a skeptic about as

11184
03:12:11,269 --> 03:12:11,279
that i mean i'm still a skeptic about as
 

11185
03:12:11,279 --> 03:12:13,030
that i mean i'm still a skeptic about as
ever being able to create a machine

11186
03:12:13,030 --> 03:12:13,040
ever being able to create a machine
 

11187
03:12:13,040 --> 03:12:15,590
ever being able to create a machine
which is truly conscious if i can throw

11188
03:12:15,590 --> 03:12:15,600
which is truly conscious if i can throw
 

11189
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:17,030
which is truly conscious if i can throw
my it's almost two cents that would

11190
03:12:17,030 --> 03:12:17,040
my it's almost two cents that would
 

11191
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:19,269
my it's almost two cents that would
really piss off karl marx by the way if

11192
03:12:19,269 --> 03:12:19,279
really piss off karl marx by the way if
 

11193
03:12:19,279 --> 03:12:20,790
really piss off karl marx by the way if
we create machines that are conscious

11194
03:12:20,790 --> 03:12:20,800
we create machines that are conscious
 

11195
03:12:20,800 --> 03:12:22,790
we create machines that are conscious
exactly this is actually part of the

exactly this is actually part of the

exactly this is actually part of the
there's two good logical arguments

11198
03:12:24,150 --> 03:12:24,160
there's two good logical arguments
 

11199
03:12:24,160 --> 03:12:25,830
there's two good logical arguments
against the labor theory of value one of

against the labor theory of value one of

against the labor theory of value one of
what it becomes machines become

11202
03:12:27,110 --> 03:12:27,120
what it becomes machines become
 

11203
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:29,510
what it becomes machines become

declining rate of profit applies in
 

11207
03:12:31,200 --> 03:12:32,630
declining rate of profit applies in

socialism
 

11209
03:12:32,640 --> 03:12:34,309
socialism
it'll apply as a rate of accumulation

11210
03:12:34,309 --> 03:12:34,319
it'll apply as a rate of accumulation
 

11211
03:12:34,319 --> 03:12:36,309
it'll apply as a rate of accumulation
and sorry in capitalism it'll apply as a

11212
03:12:36,309 --> 03:12:36,319
and sorry in capitalism it'll apply as a
 

11213
03:12:36,319 --> 03:12:38,389
and sorry in capitalism it'll apply as a
rate of socialism as well a guy called

rate of socialism as well a guy called
khalid made that argument so his

11216
03:12:40,389 --> 03:12:40,399
khalid made that argument so his
 

11217
03:12:40,399 --> 03:12:42,710
khalid made that argument so his
argument was just unsound but yeah

11218
03:12:42,710 --> 03:12:42,720
argument was just unsound but yeah
 

11219
03:12:42,720 --> 03:12:44,229
argument was just unsound but yeah
intelligent machines would completely

03:12:44,229 --> 03:12:44,239
intelligent machines would completely
 

11221
03:12:44,239 --> 03:12:46,790
intelligent machines would completely
screw marks up you know yeah but do you

11222
03:12:46,790 --> 03:12:46,800
screw marks up you know yeah but do you
 

11223
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:50,229
screw marks up you know yeah but do you
not like that world where machines have

11224
03:12:50,229 --> 03:12:50,239
not like that world where machines have
 

11225
03:12:50,239 --> 03:12:51,750
not like that world where machines have
not only intelligence but their

not only intelligence but their
 

11227

just get increasing processing power
 

11245
03:13:06,319 --> 03:13:07,510
just get increasing processing power
it's not processing power it's

imagination
 

11249
03:13:09,200 --> 03:13:11,349
imagination
and i think whatever the heck that means

11250
03:13:11,349 --> 03:13:11,359
and i think whatever the heck that means
 

11251
03:13:11,359 --> 03:13:13,510
and i think whatever the heck that means
huh whatever the heck that means yeah i

mean you you would have had imaginative

11254
03:13:15,349 --> 03:13:15,359
mean you you would have had imaginative
 

11255
03:13:15,359 --> 03:13:17,429
mean you you would have had imaginative
insights some of your papers on uh like

03:13:26,309 --> 03:13:26,319
human interface where the standards can
 

11265

human interface where the standards can
be lower for the machine and higher for

11266
03:13:28,229 --> 03:13:28,239
be lower for the machine and higher for
 

11267
03:13:28,239 --> 03:13:29,590
be lower for the machine and higher for
the human okay that's an insight you

11268
03:13:29,590 --> 03:13:29,600
the human okay that's an insight you
 

11269
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:31,590
the human okay that's an insight you
would have had at some point and then

11270
03:13:31,590 --> 03:13:31,600
would have had at some point and then
 

11271
03:13:31,600 --> 03:13:33,429
would have had at some point and then
you've worked it further so i've had

11272
03:13:33,429 --> 03:13:33,439
you've worked it further so i've had
 

11273
03:13:33,439 --> 03:13:35,190
you've worked it further so i've had
insights like that as well and i have no

11274
03:13:35,190 --> 03:13:35,200
insights like that as well and i have no
 

11275
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:37,030
insights like that as well and i have no
idea where they come from they just hit

11276
03:13:37,030 --> 03:13:37,040
idea where they come from they just hit
 

11277
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:39,349
idea where they come from they just hit
me in the head and i write them down and

11278
03:13:39,349 --> 03:13:39,359
me in the head and i write them down and
 

11279
03:13:39,359 --> 03:13:41,110
me in the head and i write them down and
and they solve a problem that i didn't

11280
03:13:41,110 --> 03:13:41,120
and they solve a problem that i didn't
 

11281
03:13:41,120 --> 03:13:43,429
and they solve a problem that i didn't
even know my mind was working on okay

11282
03:13:43,429 --> 03:13:43,439
even know my mind was working on okay
 

11283
03:13:43,439 --> 03:13:44,309
even know my mind was working on okay
so

11284
03:13:44,309 --> 03:13:44,319
so
 

11285
03:13:44,319 --> 03:13:46,550
so
how can we get a machine to do that

11286
03:13:46,550 --> 03:13:46,560
how can we get a machine to do that
 

11287
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:47,670
how can we get a machine to do that
and

11288
03:13:47,670 --> 03:13:47,680
and
 

11289
03:13:47,680 --> 03:13:48,790
and
i

11290
03:13:48,790 --> 03:13:48,800
i
 

11291
03:13:48,800 --> 03:13:50,550
i
do not know the answer but one thing i

11292
03:13:50,550 --> 03:13:50,560
do not know the answer but one thing i
 

11293
03:13:50,560 --> 03:13:52,790
do not know the answer but one thing i
think is the potential is i think

11294
03:13:52,790 --> 03:13:52,800
think is the potential is i think
 

11295
03:13:52,800 --> 03:13:55,110
think is the potential is i think
we think we have to create ai that has

11296
03:13:55,110 --> 03:13:55,120
we think we have to create ai that has
 

11297
03:13:55,120 --> 03:13:56,630
we think we have to create ai that has
feelings

11298
03:13:56,630 --> 03:13:56,640
feelings
 

11299
03:13:56,640 --> 03:13:58,630
feelings
ai that wants to survive because if you

11300
03:13:58,630 --> 03:13:58,640
ai that wants to survive because if you
 

11301
03:13:58,640 --> 03:14:01,030
ai that wants to survive because if you
think how our intelligence

11302
03:14:01,030 --> 03:14:01,040
think how our intelligence
 

11303
03:14:01,040 --> 03:14:03,510
think how our intelligence
evolved it's on this planet in a

11304
03:14:03,510 --> 03:14:03,520
evolved it's on this planet in a
 

11305
03:14:03,520 --> 03:14:05,750
evolved it's on this planet in a
struggle between predator and prey and

11306
03:14:05,750 --> 03:14:05,760
struggle between predator and prey and
 

11307
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:07,910
struggle between predator and prey and
intelligence became a survival technique

11308
03:14:07,910 --> 03:14:07,920
intelligence became a survival technique
 

11309
03:14:07,920 --> 03:14:09,830
intelligence became a survival technique
i find the ideas of ernest becker with

11310
03:14:09,830 --> 03:14:09,840
i find the ideas of ernest becker with
 

11311
03:14:09,840 --> 03:14:12,229
i find the ideas of ernest becker with
denial of death really powerful which is

11312
03:14:12,229 --> 03:14:12,239
denial of death really powerful which is
 

11313
03:14:12,239 --> 03:14:15,349
denial of death really powerful which is
that humans

11314
03:14:15,349 --> 03:14:15,359

 

11315
03:14:15,359 --> 03:14:18,550

will not only have emotions and are

11316
03:14:18,550 --> 03:14:18,560
will not only have emotions and are
 

11317
03:14:18,560 --> 03:14:20,229
will not only have emotions and are
trying to survive

11318
03:14:20,229 --> 03:14:20,239
trying to survive
 

11319
03:14:20,239 --> 03:14:22,870
trying to survive
they're able to

11320
03:14:22,870 --> 03:14:22,880
they're able to
 

11321
03:14:22,880 --> 03:14:24,389
they're able to
ponder

11322
03:14:24,389 --> 03:14:24,399
ponder
 

11323
03:14:24,399 --> 03:14:26,870
ponder
out in the distant future their

11324
03:14:26,870 --> 03:14:26,880
out in the distant future their
 

11325
03:14:26,880 --> 03:14:30,550
out in the distant future their
mortality yes and that is a driving

11326
03:14:30,550 --> 03:14:30,560
mortality yes and that is a driving
 

11327
03:14:30,560 --> 03:14:32,550
mortality yes and that is a driving
force for even greater creation that

11328
03:14:32,550 --> 03:14:32,560
force for even greater creation that
 

11329
03:14:32,560 --> 03:14:34,229
force for even greater creation that
animals are able to do

11330
03:14:34,229 --> 03:14:34,239
animals are able to do
 

11331
03:14:34,239 --> 03:14:36,070
animals are able to do
more more uh

11332
03:14:36,070 --> 03:14:36,080
more more uh
 

11333
03:14:36,080 --> 03:14:38,550
more more uh
more primitive animals

11334
03:14:38,550 --> 03:14:38,560
more primitive animals
 

11335
03:14:38,560 --> 03:14:41,110
more primitive animals
and so there is some element where i

11336
03:14:41,110 --> 03:14:41,120
and so there is some element where i
 

11337
03:14:41,120 --> 03:14:44,150
and so there is some element where i
agree with you i think for ai systems to

11338
03:14:44,150 --> 03:14:44,160
agree with you i think for ai systems to
 

11339
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:46,469
agree with you i think for ai systems to
have something like consciousness

11340
03:14:46,469 --> 03:14:46,479
have something like consciousness
 

11341
03:14:46,479 --> 03:14:47,750
have something like consciousness
they have to

11342
03:14:47,750 --> 03:14:47,760
they have to
 

11343
03:14:47,760 --> 03:14:50,389
they have to
fear their mortality exactly and i think

11344
03:14:50,389 --> 03:14:50,399
fear their mortality exactly and i think
 

11345
03:14:50,399 --> 03:14:53,429
fear their mortality exactly and i think
that's if you do it then you don't you

11346
03:14:53,429 --> 03:14:53,439
that's if you do it then you don't you
 

11347
03:14:53,439 --> 03:14:55,510
that's if you do it then you don't you
you can't produce an ai

11348
03:14:55,510 --> 03:14:55,520
you can't produce an ai
 

11349
03:14:55,520 --> 03:14:58,309
you can't produce an ai
whose behavior you can control

11350
03:14:58,309 --> 03:14:58,319
whose behavior you can control
 

11351
03:14:58,319 --> 03:15:00,229
whose behavior you can control
i mean when you have kids

11352
03:15:00,229 --> 03:15:00,239
i mean when you have kids
 

11353
03:15:00,239 --> 03:15:03,510
i mean when you have kids
yeah you can't control their behavior

11354
03:15:03,510 --> 03:15:03,520
yeah you can't control their behavior
 

11355
03:15:03,520 --> 03:15:06,070
yeah you can't control their behavior
you you know that's that's the trade-off

11356
03:15:06,070 --> 03:15:06,080
you you know that's that's the trade-off
 

11357
03:15:06,080 --> 03:15:08,469
you you know that's that's the trade-off
you give left to an anarchist yeah like

11358
03:15:08,469 --> 03:15:08,479
you give left to an anarchist yeah like
 

11359
03:15:08,479 --> 03:15:10,070
you give left to an anarchist yeah like
one of my favorite instances in my

11360
03:15:10,070 --> 03:15:10,080
one of my favorite instances in my

one's got a real quirk to her and
i was standing over her cot when she was

11370
03:15:20,229 --> 03:15:20,239
i was standing over her cot when she was
 

11371
03:15:20,239 --> 03:15:22,389
i was standing over her cot when she was
literally like about six months old and

11372
03:15:22,389 --> 03:15:22,399
literally like about six months old and
 

11373
03:15:22,399 --> 03:15:24,710
literally like about six months old and
she was gurgling away to herself and her

11374
03:15:24,710 --> 03:15:24,720
she was gurgling away to herself and her
 

11375
03:15:24,720 --> 03:15:25,670
she was gurgling away to herself and her
father

11376
03:15:25,670 --> 03:15:25,680
father
 

11377
03:15:25,680 --> 03:15:27,670
father
uh wakes his fingers said stop making

11378
03:15:27,670 --> 03:15:27,680
uh wakes his fingers said stop making
 

11379
03:15:27,680 --> 03:15:29,830
uh wakes his fingers said stop making
that noise and this little six-month-old

11380
03:15:29,830 --> 03:15:29,840
that noise and this little six-month-old
 

11381
03:15:29,840 --> 03:15:31,910
that noise and this little six-month-old
kid goes

11382
03:15:31,910 --> 03:15:31,920
kid goes
 

11383
03:15:31,920 --> 03:15:33,750
kid goes
and i said boy you're gonna have issues

11384
03:15:33,750 --> 03:15:33,760
and i said boy you're gonna have issues
 

11385
03:15:33,760 --> 03:15:35,670
and i said boy you're gonna have issues
with that one right yeah and and she

11386
03:15:35,670 --> 03:15:35,680
with that one right yeah and and she
 

11387
03:15:35,680 --> 03:15:38,389
with that one right yeah and and she
anarchist was born yeah and so you can't

11388
03:15:38,389 --> 03:15:38,399
anarchist was born yeah and so you can't
 

11389
03:15:38,399 --> 03:15:40,309
anarchist was born yeah and so you can't
control this life you give birth to and

11390
03:15:40,309 --> 03:15:40,319
control this life you give birth to and
 

11391
03:15:40,319 --> 03:15:41,910
control this life you give birth to and
that's i think the threat of ai

11392
03:15:41,910 --> 03:15:41,920
that's i think the threat of ai
 

11393
03:15:41,920 --> 03:15:44,630
that's i think the threat of ai
terrifying and exciting it is and i

11394
03:15:44,630 --> 03:15:44,640
terrifying and exciting it is and i
 

11395
03:15:44,640 --> 03:15:46,229
terrifying and exciting it is and i
think we should take that risk at some

11396
03:15:46,229 --> 03:15:46,239
think we should take that risk at some
 

11397
03:15:46,239 --> 03:15:47,269
think we should take that risk at some
stage

11398
03:15:47,269 --> 03:15:47,279
stage
 

11399
03:15:47,279 --> 03:15:49,110
stage
but i think to do it with what actually

11400
03:15:49,110 --> 03:15:49,120
but i think to do it with what actually
 

11401
03:15:49,120 --> 03:15:49,990
but i think to do it with what actually
let

11402
03:15:49,990 --> 03:15:50,000
let
 

11403
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:52,950
let
artificial intelligence involve in this

11404
03:15:52,950 --> 03:15:52,960
artificial intelligence involve in this
 

11405
03:15:52,960 --> 03:15:54,630
artificial intelligence involve in this
environment in which it fears its own

11406
03:15:54,630 --> 03:15:54,640
environment in which it fears its own
 

11407
03:15:54,640 --> 03:15:55,670
environment in which it fears its own
death

11408
03:15:55,670 --> 03:15:55,680
death
 

11409
03:15:55,680 --> 03:15:57,190
death
yeah

11410
03:15:57,190 --> 03:15:57,200
yeah
 

11411
03:15:57,200 --> 03:15:59,269
yeah
yeah i think there's a lot of beauty

11412
03:15:59,269 --> 03:15:59,279
yeah i think there's a lot of beauty
 

11413
03:15:59,279 --> 03:16:02,309
yeah i think there's a lot of beauty
there but it's there's also a lot of a

11414
03:16:02,309 --> 03:16:02,319
there but it's there's also a lot of a
 

11415
03:16:02,319 --> 03:16:04,229
there but it's there's also a lot of a
lot of destruction that's possible so

11416
03:16:04,229 --> 03:16:04,239
lot of destruction that's possible so
 

11417
03:16:04,239 --> 03:16:06,550
lot of destruction that's possible so
you have to be extremely careful but

11418
03:16:06,550 --> 03:16:06,560
you have to be extremely careful but
 

11419
03:16:06,560 --> 03:16:08,070
you have to be extremely careful but
that's kind of the cutting edge of which

11420
03:16:08,070 --> 03:16:08,080
that's kind of the cutting edge of which
 

11421
03:16:08,080 --> 03:16:11,830
that's kind of the cutting edge of which
we all often operate as a humanity

11422
03:16:11,830 --> 03:16:11,840
we all often operate as a humanity
 

11423
03:16:11,840 --> 03:16:13,990
we all often operate as a humanity
let me ask you for advice

11424
03:16:13,990 --> 03:16:14,000
let me ask you for advice
 

11425
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,469
let me ask you for advice
can you give advice to young people

11426
03:16:16,469 --> 03:16:16,479
can you give advice to young people
 

11427
03:16:16,479 --> 03:16:18,790
can you give advice to young people
in high school and college

11428
03:16:18,790 --> 03:16:18,800
in high school and college
 

11429
03:16:18,800 --> 03:16:21,990
in high school and college
uh maybe they're interested in economics

11430
03:16:21,990 --> 03:16:22,000
uh maybe they're interested in economics
 

11431
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:24,710
uh maybe they're interested in economics
maybe they uh have other career ideas

11432
03:16:24,710 --> 03:16:24,720
maybe they uh have other career ideas
 

11433
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:26,790
maybe they uh have other career ideas
what advice would you give them about a

11434
03:16:26,790 --> 03:16:26,800
what advice would you give them about a
 

11435
03:16:26,800 --> 03:16:28,550
what advice would you give them about a
career they can have that they could be

11436
03:16:28,550 --> 03:16:28,560
career they can have that they could be
 

11437
03:16:28,560 --> 03:16:31,349
career they can have that they could be
proud of or a life they can be proud of

11438
03:16:31,349 --> 03:16:31,359
proud of or a life they can be proud of
 

11439
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:32,870
proud of or a life they can be proud of
mainly in a career i say don't do an

11440
03:16:32,870 --> 03:16:32,880
mainly in a career i say don't do an
 

11441
03:16:32,880 --> 03:16:34,950
mainly in a career i say don't do an
economics degree

11442
03:16:34,950 --> 03:16:34,960
economics degree
 

11443
03:16:34,960 --> 03:16:36,630
economics degree
okay i say

11444
03:16:36,630 --> 03:16:36,640
okay i say
 

11445
03:16:36,640 --> 03:16:39,110
okay i say
there's a there's a little book

11446
03:16:39,110 --> 03:16:39,120
there's a there's a little book
 

11447
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:41,429
there's a there's a little book
on comics

11448
03:16:41,429 --> 03:16:41,439
on comics
 

11449
03:16:41,439 --> 03:16:43,429
on comics
econ comics taking the

11450
03:16:43,429 --> 03:16:43,439
econ comics taking the
 

11451
03:16:43,439 --> 03:16:45,110
econ comics taking the
out of economics

11452
03:16:45,110 --> 03:16:45,120
out of economics
 

11453
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:47,429
out of economics
um so they should start with that

11454
03:16:47,429 --> 03:16:47,439
um so they should start with that
 

11455
03:16:47,439 --> 03:16:49,990
um so they should start with that
and then say screw it to an economics

11456
03:16:49,990 --> 03:16:50,000
and then say screw it to an economics
 

11457
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:52,550
and then say screw it to an economics
degree yeah because what what you learn

11458
03:16:52,550 --> 03:16:52,560
degree yeah because what what you learn
 

11459
03:16:52,560 --> 03:16:54,550
degree yeah because what what you learn
is an obsolete technology learning

11460
03:16:54,550 --> 03:16:54,560
is an obsolete technology learning
 

11461
03:16:54,560 --> 03:16:56,309
is an obsolete technology learning
economics at a university is like

11462
03:16:56,309 --> 03:16:56,319
economics at a university is like
 

11463
03:16:56,319 --> 03:16:59,750
economics at a university is like
learning it's all make astronomy

11464
03:16:59,750 --> 03:16:59,760
learning it's all make astronomy
 

11465
03:16:59,760 --> 03:17:02,550
learning it's all make astronomy
okay earth-centric equilibrium

11466
03:17:02,550 --> 03:17:02,560
okay earth-centric equilibrium
 

11467
03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:03,429
okay earth-centric equilibrium
um

11468
03:17:03,429 --> 03:17:03,439
um
 

11469
03:17:03,439 --> 03:17:05,429
um
you know epicycles being added to make

11470
03:17:05,429 --> 03:17:05,439
you know epicycles being added to make
 

11471
03:17:05,439 --> 03:17:07,030
you know epicycles being added to make
your models fit the data so it's not

11472
03:17:07,030 --> 03:17:07,040
your models fit the data so it's not
 

11473
03:17:07,040 --> 03:17:09,750
your models fit the data so it's not
that economics is not a discipline worth

11474
03:17:09,750 --> 03:17:09,760
that economics is not a discipline worth
 

11475
03:17:09,760 --> 03:17:11,910
that economics is not a discipline worth
deeply studying it's that the university

11476
03:17:11,910 --> 03:17:11,920
deeply studying it's that the university
 

11477
03:17:11,920 --> 03:17:14,469
deeply studying it's that the university
education around that is so bad it's bad

11478
03:17:14,469 --> 03:17:14,479
education around that is so bad it's bad
 

11479
03:17:14,479 --> 03:17:16,870
education around that is so bad it's bad
yeah so i'd say learn system dynamics

11480
03:17:16,870 --> 03:17:16,880
yeah so i'd say learn system dynamics
 

11481
03:17:16,880 --> 03:17:18,710
yeah so i'd say learn system dynamics
do a course in system dynamics which you

11482
03:17:18,710 --> 03:17:18,720
do a course in system dynamics which you
 

11483
03:17:18,720 --> 03:17:20,389
do a course in system dynamics which you
can apply in any field

11484
03:17:20,389 --> 03:17:20,399
can apply in any field
 

11485
03:17:20,399 --> 03:17:22,229
can apply in any field
and then apply what you learn out of

11486
03:17:22,229 --> 03:17:22,239
and then apply what you learn out of
 

11487
03:17:22,239 --> 03:17:24,309
and then apply what you learn out of
system dynamics to the issues of

11488
03:17:24,309 --> 03:17:24,319
system dynamics to the issues of
 

11489
03:17:24,319 --> 03:17:26,229
system dynamics to the issues of
economics if that's what interests you

11490
03:17:26,229 --> 03:17:26,239
economics if that's what interests you
 

11491
03:17:26,239 --> 03:17:29,190
economics if that's what interests you
so get a sort of base engineering

11492
03:17:29,190 --> 03:17:29,200
so get a sort of base engineering
 

11493
03:17:29,200 --> 03:17:31,830
so get a sort of base engineering
education a base engineering education

11494
03:17:31,830 --> 03:17:31,840
education a base engineering education
 

11495
03:17:31,840 --> 03:17:33,590
education a base engineering education
uh that is far better than doing an

11496
03:17:33,590 --> 03:17:33,600
uh that is far better than doing an
 

11497
03:17:33,600 --> 03:17:36,469
uh that is far better than doing an
economics degree in terms of life

11498
03:17:36,469 --> 03:17:36,479
economics degree in terms of life
 

11499
03:17:36,479 --> 03:17:38,950
economics degree in terms of life
i know my life is pretty chaotic in many

11500
03:17:38,950 --> 03:17:38,960
i know my life is pretty chaotic in many
 

11501
03:17:38,960 --> 03:17:41,110
i know my life is pretty chaotic in many
many ways my friends friends and family

11502
03:17:41,110 --> 03:17:41,120
many ways my friends friends and family
 

11503
03:17:41,120 --> 03:17:44,070
many ways my friends friends and family
will tell me that every opportunity uh

11504
03:17:44,070 --> 03:17:44,080
will tell me that every opportunity uh
 

11505
03:17:44,080 --> 03:17:45,830
will tell me that every opportunity uh
but the thing is i once had this i'll

11506
03:17:45,830 --> 03:17:45,840
but the thing is i once had this i'll
 

11507
03:17:45,840 --> 03:17:48,229

a paper from 2009 called the economics
 

11673
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:34,469
a paper from 2009 called the economics
of climate change

11674
03:20:34,469 --> 03:20:34,479
of climate change
 

11675
03:20:34,479 --> 03:20:36,950
of climate change
journal of economic perspectives i think

11676
03:20:36,950 --> 03:20:36,960
journal of economic perspectives i think
 

11677
03:20:36,960 --> 03:20:38,790
journal of economic perspectives i think
and i read this section where he says

11678
03:20:38,790 --> 03:20:38,800
and i read this section where he says
 

11679
03:20:38,800 --> 03:20:42,469
and i read this section where he says
that one of the ways they tried to

11680
03:20:42,469 --> 03:20:42,479
that one of the ways they tried to
 

11681
03:20:42,479 --> 03:20:44,790
that one of the ways they tried to
calibrate what climate change was due is

11682
03:20:44,790 --> 03:20:44,800
calibrate what climate change was due is
 

11683
03:20:44,800 --> 03:20:46,790
calibrate what climate change was due is
they assumed that the relationship

11684
03:20:46,790 --> 03:20:46,800
they assumed that the relationship
 

11685
03:20:46,800 --> 03:20:49,990
they assumed that the relationship
between gdp and temperature over space

11686
03:20:49,990 --> 03:20:50,000
between gdp and temperature over space
 

11687
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:53,190
between gdp and temperature over space
would apply over time as well

11688
03:20:53,190 --> 03:20:53,200
would apply over time as well
 

11689
03:20:53,200 --> 03:20:55,190
would apply over time as well
yes and i read that and thought that is

11690
03:20:55,190 --> 03:20:55,200
yes and i read that and thought that is
 

11691
03:20:55,200 --> 03:20:57,990
yes and i read that and thought that is
so [\h__\h] stupid

11692
03:20:57,990 --> 03:20:58,000
so [\h__\h] stupid
 

11693
03:20:58,000 --> 03:20:59,190
so [\h__\h] stupid
because all it's saying is that if

11694
03:20:59,190 --> 03:20:59,200
because all it's saying is that if
 

11695
03:20:59,200 --> 03:21:00,469
because all it's saying is that if
there's a 10 degree temperature

11696
03:21:00,469 --> 03:21:00,479
there's a 10 degree temperature
 

11697
03:21:00,479 --> 03:21:02,550
there's a 10 degree temperature
difference between new york and florida

11698
03:21:02,550 --> 03:21:02,560
difference between new york and florida
 

11699
03:21:02,560 --> 03:21:04,950
difference between new york and florida
and a 20 difference in income then a 10

11700
03:21:04,950 --> 03:21:04,960
and a 20 difference in income then a 10
 

11701
03:21:04,960 --> 03:21:06,229
and a 20 difference in income then a 10
degree increase in temperature will

11702
03:21:06,229 --> 03:21:06,239
degree increase in temperature will
 

11703
03:21:06,239 --> 03:21:08,150
degree increase in temperature will
cause gdp by 4 by 20

11704
03:21:08,150 --> 03:21:08,160
cause gdp by 4 by 20
 

11705
03:21:08,160 --> 03:21:10,870
cause gdp by 4 by 20
it is so insanely stupid so

billions of people and christ knows how
many other life forms

11764
03:22:07,750 --> 03:22:07,760
many other life forms
 

11765
03:22:07,760 --> 03:22:09,910
many other life forms
and the having that knowledge

11766
03:22:09,910 --> 03:22:09,920
and the having that knowledge
 

11767
03:22:09,920 --> 03:22:11,990
and the having that knowledge
is the most depressing experience of my

life
that ideas

11772
03:22:15,670 --> 03:22:15,680
that ideas
 

11773
03:22:15,680 --> 03:22:17,429

03:22:58,309 --> 03:22:58,319
the anthropocene epoch it'll be the
 

11817
03:22:58,319 --> 03:23:00,389
the anthropocene epoch it'll be the
anthropocene event

11818
03:23:00,389 --> 03:23:00,399
anthropocene event
 

11819
03:23:00,399 --> 03:23:02,309
anthropocene event
because an epoch is millions of years

11820
03:23:02,309 --> 03:23:02,319
because an epoch is millions of years
 

11821
03:23:02,319 --> 03:23:05,670
because an epoch is millions of years
and you know a huge period of life on

11822
03:23:05,670 --> 03:23:05,680
and you know a huge period of life on
 

11823
03:23:05,680 --> 03:23:08,710
and you know a huge period of life on
the planet and we might be snuffed out

11824
03:23:08,710 --> 03:23:08,720
the planet and we might be snuffed out
 

11825
03:23:08,720 --> 03:23:12,070
the planet and we might be snuffed out
in 10 000 years of human civilization

11826
03:23:12,070 --> 03:23:12,080
in 10 000 years of human civilization
 

11827
03:23:12,080 --> 03:23:14,389
in 10 000 years of human civilization
and that's not much

11828
03:23:14,389 --> 03:23:14,399
and that's not much
 

11829
03:23:14,399 --> 03:23:16,070
and that's not much
slower than the meteors wiping out the

11830
03:23:16,070 --> 03:23:16,080
slower than the meteors wiping out the
 

11831
03:23:16,080 --> 03:23:17,670
slower than the meteors wiping out the
dinosaurs the dinosaurs lasted for a

11832
03:23:17,670 --> 03:23:17,680
dinosaurs the dinosaurs lasted for a
 

11833
03:23:17,680 --> 03:23:20,150
dinosaurs the dinosaurs lasted for a
long time after that event so

11834
03:23:20,150 --> 03:23:20,160
long time after that event so
 

11835
03:23:20,160 --> 03:23:22,150
long time after that event so
we're we're like we'd just be a layer in

like i've had that four or five times in

my life with different women at
 

12039
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:49,190
my life with different women at
different times and i've stuffed up the

12040
03:26:49,190 --> 03:26:49,200
different times and i've stuffed up the
 

12041
03:26:49,200 --> 03:26:52,389
different times and i've stuffed up the
most important one very early on um

12042

most important one very early on um
 

12043
03:26:52,399 --> 03:26:55,510
most important one very early on um
and but that feeling is incredible

12044
03:26:55,510 --> 03:26:55,520
and but that feeling is incredible
 

12045
03:26:55,520 --> 03:26:57,429
and but that feeling is incredible
and uh

12046
03:26:57,429 --> 03:26:57,439
and uh
 

12047
03:26:57,439 --> 03:26:59,750
and uh
you you couldn't have life worth living

12048
03:26:59,750 --> 03:26:59,760
you you couldn't have life worth living
 

12049
03:26:59,760 --> 03:27:01,269
you you couldn't have life worth living
without that

12050
03:27:01,269 --> 03:27:01,279
without that
 

12051
03:27:01,279 --> 03:27:03,750
without that
so it's an essential part of who we are

12052
03:27:03,750 --> 03:27:03,760
so it's an essential part of who we are
 

12053
03:27:03,760 --> 03:27:05,910
so it's an essential part of who we are
but what we have to do is to transfer it

12054
03:27:05,910 --> 03:27:05,920
but what we have to do is to transfer it
 

12055
03:27:05,920 --> 03:27:08,150
but what we have to do is to transfer it
not just to the rest of our species but

12056
03:27:08,150 --> 03:27:08,160
not just to the rest of our species but
 

12057
03:27:08,160 --> 03:27:09,830
not just to the rest of our species but
to all species

12058
03:27:09,830 --> 03:27:09,840
to all species
 

12059
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:10,870
to all species
and

12060
03:27:10,870 --> 03:27:10,880
and
 

12061
03:27:10,880 --> 03:27:12,870
and
that's i think what's what's vital and

12062
03:27:12,870 --> 03:27:12,880
that's i think what's what's vital and
 

12063
03:27:12,880 --> 03:27:15,110
that's i think what's what's vital and
how do we maintain that over

12064
03:27:15,110 --> 03:27:15,120
how do we maintain that over
 

12065
03:27:15,120 --> 03:27:16,630
how do we maintain that over
generations

12066
03:27:16,630 --> 03:27:16,640
generations
 

12067
03:27:16,640 --> 03:27:18,469
generations
and i think that

12068
03:27:18,469 --> 03:27:18,479
and i think that
 

12069
03:27:18,479 --> 03:27:20,550
and i think that
that that idea that we can actually hang

12070
03:27:20,550 --> 03:27:20,560
that that idea that we can actually hang
 

12071
03:27:20,560 --> 03:27:22,150
that that idea that we can actually hang
on to that general sense of respect and

12072
03:27:22,150 --> 03:27:22,160
on to that general sense of respect and
 

12073
03:27:22,160 --> 03:27:23,910
on to that general sense of respect and
not lose it again because the amount of

12074
03:27:23,910 --> 03:27:23,920
not lose it again because the amount of
 

12075
03:27:23,920 --> 03:27:26,389
not lose it again because the amount of
life we've terminated on this planet

12076
03:27:26,389 --> 03:27:26,399
life we've terminated on this planet
 

12077
03:27:26,399 --> 03:27:29,510
life we've terminated on this planet
uh the the war-like side of humanity

12078
03:27:29,510 --> 03:27:29,520
uh the the war-like side of humanity
 

12079
03:27:29,520 --> 03:27:30,550
uh the the war-like side of humanity
that is

12080
03:27:30,550 --> 03:27:30,560
that is
 

12081
03:27:30,560 --> 03:27:32,150
that is
too much of a defining feature of our

12082
03:27:32,150 --> 03:27:32,160
too much of a defining feature of our
 

12083
03:27:32,160 --> 03:27:33,990
too much of a defining feature of our
species that's the opposite of love it's

12084
03:27:33,990 --> 03:27:34,000
species that's the opposite of love it's
 

12085
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:34,870
species that's the opposite of love it's
hate

12086
03:27:34,870 --> 03:27:34,880
hate
 

12087
03:27:34,880 --> 03:27:36,630
hate
but it's pleasure in inflicting pain on

12088
03:27:36,630 --> 03:27:36,640
but it's pleasure in inflicting pain on
 

12089
03:27:36,640 --> 03:27:38,309
but it's pleasure in inflicting pain on
others when you see people killing

12090
03:27:38,309 --> 03:27:38,319
others when you see people killing
 

12091
03:27:38,319 --> 03:27:39,910
others when you see people killing
others in a war-like environment they're

12092
03:27:39,910 --> 03:27:39,920
others in a war-like environment they're
 

12093
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:43,030

12095
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:45,510
enjoying themselves okay uh it's rarely
sometimes it's self-defense but there's

12096
03:27:45,510 --> 03:27:45,520
sometimes it's self-defense but there's
 

12097
03:27:45,520 --> 03:27:46,950
sometimes it's self-defense but there's
when you when you've talked spoken to

12098
03:27:46,950 --> 03:27:46,960
when you when you've talked spoken to

there's a dark aspect to human nature

12110
03:27:58,309 --> 03:27:58,319
there's a dark aspect to human nature
 

12111
03:27:58,319 --> 03:27:59,990
there's a dark aspect to human nature
very different but

12112
03:27:59,990 --> 03:28:00,000
very different but
 

12113
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:02,550
very different but
there's also the capacity

12114
03:28:02,550 --> 03:28:02,560
there's also the capacity
 

12115
03:28:02,560 --> 03:28:04,870
there's also the capacity
to uh to rise above that and i think

12116
03:28:04,870 --> 03:28:04,880
to uh to rise above that and i think
 

12117
03:28:04,880 --> 03:28:06,550
to uh to rise above that and i think
like it put us on a spectrum between

12118
03:28:06,550 --> 03:28:06,560
like it put us on a spectrum between
 

12119
03:28:06,560 --> 03:28:08,550
like it put us on a spectrum between
chimpanzees at one extreme and bonobos

12120
03:28:08,550 --> 03:28:08,560
chimpanzees at one extreme and bonobos
 

12121
03:28:08,560 --> 03:28:10,389
chimpanzees at one extreme and bonobos
at the other yeah we're too close to the

12122
03:28:10,389 --> 03:28:10,399
at the other yeah we're too close to the
 

12123
03:28:10,399 --> 03:28:13,190
at the other yeah we're too close to the
chimpanzees you know and bananas are
