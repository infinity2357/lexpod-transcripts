it not
 

55
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,869
it not
i'm afraid it repeats itself a lot um so

i'm afraid it repeats itself a lot um so
 

57

it is and so
 

61
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,070
it is and so

so so people are living longer they're

102
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
so so people are living longer they're
 

103
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,389
so so people are living longer they're
generally healthier and so on but again

104
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
generally healthier and so on but again
 

105
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,789
generally healthier and so on but again
we still see a lot of the same behavior

106
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
we still see a lot of the same behavior
 

107
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,949
we still see a lot of the same behavior
patterns some of which are

108
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
patterns some of which are
 

109
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,029
patterns some of which are
not very attractive

110
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
not very attractive
 

111
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,390
not very attractive
so some of it has to do with the

112
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
so some of it has to do with the
 

113
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,550
so some of it has to do with the
constraints on resources presumably with

114
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
constraints on resources presumably with
 

115
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,229
constraints on resources presumably with
technology you have less and less

116
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
technology you have less and less
 

117
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,550
technology you have less and less
constraints on resources so

118
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
constraints on resources so
 

119
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,790
constraints on resources so
we get to maybe emphasize the better

120
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
we get to maybe emphasize the better
 

121
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,390
we get to maybe emphasize the better
angels of our nature

122

123
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,110

and in in so doing does that not

124
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
and in in so doing does that not
 

125
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,470
and in in so doing does that not
potentially

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
hyperinflation
 

173
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,509
hyperinflation
and unemployment and um the

174
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
and unemployment and um the
 

175
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,509
and unemployment and um the
the decline in standard of living and

176
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
the decline in standard of living and
 

177
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,670
the decline in standard of living and
that sounds like a plausible

178
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
that sounds like a plausible
 

179
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,550
that sounds like a plausible
uh explanation but there are economic

180
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
uh explanation but there are economic
 

181
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,110
uh explanation but there are economic
troubles now for sure we had the bank

182
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
troubles now for sure we had the bank
 

183
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,070
troubles now for sure we had the bank
collapse in 2008

184
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
collapse in 2008
 

185
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,910
collapse in 2008
and there's stagnation

186
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
and there's stagnation
 

187
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,830
and there's stagnation
in some people's standards of living but

188
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
in some people's standards of living but
 

189
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,990
in some people's standards of living but
it's hard to explain what we've seen in

190
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
it's hard to explain what we've seen in
 

191
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,750
it's hard to explain what we've seen in
this country in the last few years just

192
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
this country in the last few years just
 

193
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,949
this country in the last few years just
strictly on the basis of people are poor

194
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
strictly on the basis of people are poor
 

195
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,270
strictly on the basis of people are poor
and angry and sad

196
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
and angry and sad
 

197
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,990
and angry and sad
i think they want to be angry

198
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
i think they want to be angry
 

199
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,110
i think they want to be angry
so

200
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
so
 

201
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,830
so
without being political in a divisive

202
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
without being political in a divisive
 

203
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,110
without being political in a divisive
kind of way

204
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
kind of way
 

205
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,030
kind of way
can we talk about the lessons you can

206
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
can we talk about the lessons you can
 

207
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,589
can we talk about the lessons you can
draw from world war ii

208
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
draw from world war ii
 

209
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,670
draw from world war ii

which is the kind of technology but then
 

245
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,150
which is the kind of technology but then
there's just like the human nature the

never allowed to have illusions anymore
about human nature

258
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
about human nature
 

259
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,629
about human nature
so you you have to to learn that lesson

260
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
so you you have to to learn that lesson
 

261

so you you have to to learn that lesson
to be

262
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,470
called the diamond age which you know
talks about a book that essentially does

506
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
talks about a book that essentially does
 

507
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,430
talks about a book that essentially does
that

508
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
that
 

509
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,630
that
and i've been sort of watching people

510
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
and i've been sort of watching people
 

511
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,550
and i've been sort of watching people
try to come at the the problem of

512
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
try to come at the the problem of
 

513
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,790
try to come at the the problem of
building that thing uh from different

514
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
building that thing uh from different
 

515
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,630
building that thing uh from different
directions for

516
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
directions for
 

517
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,190
directions for
ever since the book came out basically

518
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
ever since the book came out basically
 

519
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,110
ever since the book came out basically
um and so

520
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
um and so
 

521
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,790
um and so
uh the uh

522
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
uh the uh
 

523
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,470
uh the uh
and so i i kind of have a although i

524
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
and so i i kind of have a although i
 

525
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,470
and so i i kind of have a although i
haven't worked on it myself i do get a

526
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
haven't worked on it myself i do get a
 

527
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,190
haven't worked on it myself i do get a
sense of the the level of difficulty

528
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
sense of the the level of difficulty
 

529
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,110
sense of the the level of difficulty
in in realizing that

530
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
in in realizing that
 

531
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,949
in in realizing that
that that goal

532
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
that that goal
 

533
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,949
that that goal
um so that book is in the 90s so as

534
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
um so that book is in the 90s so as
 

535
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,990
um so that book is in the 90s so as
google

536
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
google
 

537
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,829
google
is coming to be

538
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
is coming to be
 

539
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,030
is coming to be
essentially

540
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
essentially
 

541
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,110
essentially
uh not google but the search engine the

542
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
uh not google but the search engine the
 

543
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,269
uh not google but the search engine the
initial search engines event which gave

544
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
initial search engines event which gave
 

545
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,030
initial search engines event which gave
birth to google essentially in in

546
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
birth to google essentially in in
 

547
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,550
birth to google essentially in in
contrast

548
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
contrast
 

549
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,550
contrast
right yeah yeah that was still in the

550
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
right yeah yeah that was still in the
 

551
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,190
right yeah yeah that was still in the
era of alta vista and ask jeeves and

552
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
era of alta vista and ask jeeves and
 

553
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,910
era of alta vista and ask jeeves and
multiple different uh search

554
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
multiple different uh search
 

555
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,829
multiple different uh search
engines and yeah i'm pretty sure i had

556
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
engines and yeah i'm pretty sure i had
 

557
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,069
engines and yeah i'm pretty sure i had
not heard of google at that point that

558
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
not heard of google at that point that
 

559
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,790
not heard of google at that point that
would have been 95 96 i think the book

560
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
would have been 95 96 i think the book
 

561
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,110
would have been 95 96 i think the book
came out in 94.

562
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
came out in 94.
 

563
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,790
came out in 94.
and then of course the social networks

564
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
and then of course the social networks
 

565
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,269
and then of course the social networks
followed which is another form

566
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
followed which is another form
 

567
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,550
followed which is another form
of um

568
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
of um
 

569
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,990
of um
guidance through the space of

570
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
guidance through the space of
 

571
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,829
guidance through the space of
information yeah

572
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
information yeah
 

573
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,069
information yeah
well what happens is that these things

574
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
well what happens is that these things
 

575
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,990
well what happens is that these things
come along and then people find ways to

576
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
come along and then people find ways to
 

577
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,910
come along and then people find ways to
game them

578
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
game them
 

579
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,470
game them
and so i saw an interesting thread the

580
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
and so i saw an interesting thread the
 

581
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,110
and so i saw an interesting thread the
other day pointing out that

582
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
other day pointing out that
 

583
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,150
other day pointing out that
you know

584
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
you know
 

585
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,710
you know
20 years ago if you had googled

586
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720

 

587
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,790

uh
 

591
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,590
uh
chances are you would have been taken

592
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600

597
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,470

the top hits are going to be from
 

601
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,150
the top hits are going to be from
somebody who's who's got an angle who's

somebody who's who's got an angle who's
 

603
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,829
somebody who's who's got an angle who's
got a scheme right they're like trying

604
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
got a scheme right they're like trying
 

605
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,069
got a scheme right they're like trying
to sell you math tutoring

606
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
to sell you math tutoring
 

607
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,710
to sell you math tutoring
or you know they're

608
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
or you know they're
 

609
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,949
or you know they're
they're working some kind of marketing

610
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
they're working some kind of marketing
 

611
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,790
they're working some kind of marketing
plan on you

612
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
plan on you
 

613
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,910
plan on you
so

614
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
so
 

615
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,790
so
the the traditional engines become

616
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
the the traditional engines become
 

617
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,269
the the traditional engines become
actually less useful over time for their

618
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
actually less useful over time for their
 

619
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,750
actually less useful over time for their

that doesn't mean that they can't

624
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
that doesn't mean that they can't
 

625
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,790
that doesn't mean that they can't
it shouldn't be replaced by newer and

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
it shouldn't be replaced by newer and
 

627
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,870
it shouldn't be replaced by newer and
better ones

628
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
better ones
 

629
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,790
better ones
first of all to defend the people with

630
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
first of all to defend the people with
 

631
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,630
first of all to defend the people with

right

634
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
right
 

635
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,190
right
they're trying to find business models

636
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
they're trying to find business models
 

637
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,389
they're trying to find business models
yeah fund

638
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
yeah fund
 

639
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,629
yeah fund
oftentimes which is funny you went with

640
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
oftentimes which is funny you went with
 

641
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,509
oftentimes which is funny you went with
i think

642
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
i think
 

643
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,230
i think
like you went at math

644
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
like you went at math
 

645
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,030
like you went at math
those greedy bastards

646
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
those greedy bastards
 

647
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,710
those greedy bastards
but it's great it's great how can we

648
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
but it's great it's great how can we
 

649
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,990
but it's great it's great how can we
monetize the pythagorean theorem yeah

650
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
monetize the pythagorean theorem yeah
 

651
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,790
monetize the pythagorean theorem yeah
well

652
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
well
 

653
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,350
well
i mean education right yes to figure out

654
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
i mean education right yes to figure out
 

655
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,629
i mean education right yes to figure out
like

656
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
like
 

657
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,230
like
people who love math education for

658
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
people who love math education for
 

659
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,590
people who love math education for
example

660
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
example
 

661
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,949
example
love it purely not purely but very often

662
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
love it purely not purely but very often
 

663
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,550
love it purely not purely but very often
love it

664
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
love it
 

665
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,590
love it
for itself for just teaching math yeah

666
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
for itself for just teaching math yeah
 

667
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,829
for itself for just teaching math yeah
but then they start

668
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
but then they start
 

669
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,590
but then they start
you know when coming face to face with

670
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
you know when coming face to face with
 

671
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,350
you know when coming face to face with
for example like the youtube algorithm

672
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
for example like the youtube algorithm
 

673
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,190
for example like the youtube algorithm
they start to try to figure out okay how

674
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
they start to try to figure out okay how
 

675
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,910
they start to try to figure out okay how
can i make money off of this the the

676
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
can i make money off of this the the
 

677
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,990
can i make money off of this the the
primary goal is still

678
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
primary goal is still
 

679
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,949
primary goal is still
that love of education but they also

680
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
that love of education but they also
 

681
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,910
that love of education but they also
want to to make that love of education

682
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
want to to make that love of education
 

683
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,710
want to to make that love of education
of their full-time job but

684
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
of their full-time job but
 

685
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,030
of their full-time job but
i see that sort of that dance of

686
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
i see that sort of that dance of
 

687
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,470
i see that sort of that dance of
humanity with the algorithms as uh it

688
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
humanity with the algorithms as uh it
 

689
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,790
humanity with the algorithms as uh it
finds this kind of local pocket of

690
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
finds this kind of local pocket of
 

691
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,430
finds this kind of local pocket of
optimality that's or sub-optimality

692
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
optimality that's or sub-optimality
 

693
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,990
optimality that's or sub-optimality
whatever yeah it gets stuck in it anyway

694
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
whatever yeah it gets stuck in it anyway
 

695
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,629
whatever yeah it gets stuck in it anyway
it's a pocket of some sort and but i see

696
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
it's a pocket of some sort and but i see
 

697
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,990
it's a pocket of some sort and but i see
that pocket is way better than what we

698
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
that pocket is way better than what we
 

699
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,269
that pocket is way better than what we
had before

700
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
had before
 

701
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,069
had before
in the 80s right 90s before the internet

702
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
in the 80s right 90s before the internet
 

703
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,629
in the 80s right 90s before the internet
but like and now we're now this is this

704
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
but like and now we're now this is this
 

705
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,110
but like and now we're now this is this
is also human nature we start uh writing

706
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
is also human nature we start uh writing
 

707
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,990
is also human nature we start uh writing
very eloquent articles about how

708
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
very eloquent articles about how
 

709
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,069
very eloquent articles about how
this pocket is clearly pocket it's not

710
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
this pocket is clearly pocket it's not
 

711
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,389
this pocket is clearly pocket it's not
very good and we can imagine much better

712
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
very good and we can imagine much better
 

713
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,350
very good and we can imagine much better
lands far beyond and but the reality is

714
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
lands far beyond and but the reality is
 

715
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,030
lands far beyond and but the reality is
it's better than before yeah and now

716
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
it's better than before yeah and now
 

717
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,550
it's better than before yeah and now
we're waiting for

718
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
we're waiting for
 

719
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,190
we're waiting for
we have to escape yeah minimum and you

720
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
we have to escape yeah minimum and you
 

721
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,829
we have to escape yeah minimum and you
have to wait either for lone geniuses or

722
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
have to wait either for lone geniuses or
 

723
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,670
have to wait either for lone geniuses or
for some kind of momentum of a group of

724
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
for some kind of momentum of a group of
 

725
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,310
for some kind of momentum of a group of
geniuses that just say enough is enough

726
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
geniuses that just say enough is enough
 

727
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,710
geniuses that just say enough is enough
i have an idea yeah this is how we get

728
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
i have an idea yeah this is how we get
 

729
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,310
i have an idea yeah this is how we get
out and it's too easy to be sort of i

730
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
out and it's too easy to be sort of i
 

731
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,710
out and it's too easy to be sort of i
think uh partially because you can get a

732
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
think uh partially because you can get a
 

733
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,629
think uh partially because you can get a
lot of clicks in your articles being

734
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
lot of clicks in your articles being
 

735
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,389
lot of clicks in your articles being
cynical about being in this pocket and

736
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:40,399
cynical about being in this pocket and
 

737
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,030
cynical about being in this pocket and
we were forever stuck in this pocket and

738
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
we were forever stuck in this pocket and
 

739
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,670
we were forever stuck in this pocket and
then like coming up with this grandiose

740
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
then like coming up with this grandiose
 

741
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,550
then like coming up with this grandiose
theory that humanity has finally

742
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
theory that humanity has finally
 

743
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,230
theory that humanity has finally
like is collapsing

744
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
like is collapsing
 

745
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,150
like is collapsing
stuck forever like a prison in this

746
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
stuck forever like a prison in this
 

747
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,230
stuck forever like a prison in this
pocket but reality they're just it's

748
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
pocket but reality they're just it's
 

749
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,629
pocket but reality they're just it's
like it's just clickbait articles and

750
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
like it's just clickbait articles and
 

751
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,949
like it's just clickbait articles and
and books until we

752
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
and books until we
 

753
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,269
and books until we
one curious aunt comes up with the next

754
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
one curious aunt comes up with the next
 

755
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,350
one curious aunt comes up with the next
pocket yeah tunnels through the barrier

756
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
pocket yeah tunnels through the barrier
 

757
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,990
pocket yeah tunnels through the barrier
or gets enough energy to jump over the

758
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
or gets enough energy to jump over the
 

759
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,230
or gets enough energy to jump over the
barrier and eventually we'll be

760
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
barrier and eventually we'll be
 

761
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,230
barrier and eventually we'll be
as you've talked about i mean we'll be

762
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
as you've talked about i mean we'll be
 

763
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,350
as you've talked about i mean we'll be
we'll colonize the solar system and then

764
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
we'll colonize the solar system and then
 

765
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,910
we'll colonize the solar system and then
uh we'll be stuck in the solar system

766
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
uh we'll be stuck in the solar system
 

767
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,829
uh we'll be stuck in the solar system
and then people will say well we're

768
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
and then people will say well we're
 

769
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,150
and then people will say well we're
screwed when because when the sun energy

770
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
screwed when because when the sun energy
 

771
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,230
screwed when because when the sun energy
runs out there's no way to get to the

772
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
runs out there's no way to get to the
 

773
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,949
runs out there's no way to get to the
the next solar system and then and so on

774
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
the next solar system and then and so on
 

775
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,629
the next solar system and then and so on
it goes on until we colonize the

776
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
it goes on until we colonize the
 

777
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,509
it goes on until we colonize the
entirety of the observable universe yeah

778
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
entirety of the observable universe yeah
 

779
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,269
entirety of the observable universe yeah
i think i think getting out of the solar

780
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
i think i think getting out of the solar
 

781
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,430
i think i think getting out of the solar
system is going to be a hard one but so

782
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
system is going to be a hard one but so
 

783
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,949
system is going to be a hard one but so
can you you mention this can you

784
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
can you you mention this can you
 

785
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,550
can you you mention this can you
elaborate

786
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
elaborate
 

787
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,949
elaborate
why you think

788
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
why you think
 

789
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,629
why you think
back to sort of a serious question why

790
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
back to sort of a serious question why
 

791
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,629
back to sort of a serious question why
do you think it's hard to get outside of

792
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
do you think it's hard to get outside of
 

793
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,069
do you think it's hard to get outside of
our solar system it's just an energy

794
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
our solar system it's just an energy
 

795
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,350
our solar system it's just an energy
calcul i mean

796
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
calcul i mean
 

797
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,269
calcul i mean
you can do it slowly

798
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
you can do it slowly
 

799
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,069
you can do it slowly
uh whenever you want um

800
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
uh whenever you want um
 

801
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,430
uh whenever you want um
but uh the idea of getting there in you

802
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
but uh the idea of getting there in you
 

803
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,949
but uh the idea of getting there in you
know one lifetime or multiple

804
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
know one lifetime or multiple
 

805
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,069
know one lifetime or multiple
a few lifetimes is requires huge amounts

806
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
a few lifetimes is requires huge amounts
 

807
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,590
a few lifetimes is requires huge amounts
of energy to

808
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
of energy to
 

809
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,629
of energy to
to accelerate um and then you've as soon

810
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
to accelerate um and then you've as soon
 

811
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,550
to accelerate um and then you've as soon
as you get halfway there you need to

812
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
as you get halfway there you need to
 

813
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,470
as you get halfway there you need to
expend an equal amount of energy to

814
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
expend an equal amount of energy to
 

815
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,710
expend an equal amount of energy to
decelerate or you'll just go shooting by

816
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
decelerate or you'll just go shooting by
 

817
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,550
decelerate or you'll just go shooting by
and so um

818
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
and so um
 

819
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,230
and so um
that means carrying a lot of energy and

820
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
that means carrying a lot of energy and
 

821
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,670
that means carrying a lot of energy and
there's there's

822
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
there's there's
 

823
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,069
there's there's
ideas like yuri milner

824
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
ideas like yuri milner
 

825
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,790
ideas like yuri milner
i think is still funding the the idea to

826
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
i think is still funding the the idea to
 

827
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,150
i think is still funding the the idea to
use laser propulsion to send something

828
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
use laser propulsion to send something
 

829
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,110
use laser propulsion to send something
uh to another star system a small object

830
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
uh to another star system a small object
 

831
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,069
uh to another star system a small object
um

832
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
um
 

833
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,470
um
but it'll have no way to slow down

834
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
but it'll have no way to slow down
 

835
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,230
but it'll have no way to slow down
as far as i know they never talk about

836
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
as far as i know they never talk about
 

837
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,910
as far as i know they never talk about
that part yeah like how do i slow down

838
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
that part yeah like how do i slow down
 

839
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,829
that part yeah like how do i slow down
yeah

840
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839
yeah
 

841
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,150
yeah
um so it's a quick flyby you take a good

842
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
um so it's a quick flyby you take a good
 

843
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,670
um so it's a quick flyby you take a good
picture i guess yeah you better take

844
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
picture i guess yeah you better take
 

845
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,230
picture i guess yeah you better take
some good pictures on your way by so and

846
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
some good pictures on your way by so and
 

847
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,749
some good pictures on your way by so and
that's great if it happens i'm not

848
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
that's great if it happens i'm not
 

849
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,110
that's great if it happens i'm not
knocking it

850
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
knocking it
 

851
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,990
knocking it
but

852
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
but
 

853
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,710
but
the amount of energy is is that's needed

854
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
the amount of energy is is that's needed
 

855
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,550
the amount of energy is is that's needed
is just staggering and there's there's

856
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:54,560
is just staggering and there's there's
 

857
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,790
is just staggering and there's there's
other issues like just how do you

858
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
other issues like just how do you
 

859
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,910
other issues like just how do you
maintain

860
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
maintain
 

861
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,269
maintain
uh

862
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
uh
 

863
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,230
uh
an ecosystem for that long in isolation

864
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
an ecosystem for that long in isolation
 

865
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,990
an ecosystem for that long in isolation
uh how do you prevent people from going

866
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
uh how do you prevent people from going
 

867
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,870
uh how do you prevent people from going
crazy what happens if you hit something

868
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
crazy what happens if you hit something
 

869
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,550
crazy what happens if you hit something
while traveling at a significant

870
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
while traveling at a significant
 

871
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,550
while traveling at a significant
fraction of the speed of light what

872
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
fraction of the speed of light what
 

873
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,910
fraction of the speed of light what
about it sort of

874
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
about it sort of
 

875
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,590
about it sort of
some combination of expanding human

876
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
some combination of expanding human
 

877
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,069
some combination of expanding human
lifespan but also just

878
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
lifespan but also just
 

879
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,310
lifespan but also just
good old-fashioned

880
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
good old-fashioned
 

881
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,910
good old-fashioned
stable society on a spaceship yeah yeah

882
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
stable society on a spaceship yeah yeah
 

883
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,030
stable society on a spaceship yeah yeah
the generation ship yeah yeah yeah no i

884
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
the generation ship yeah yeah yeah no i
 

885
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,629
the generation ship yeah yeah yeah no i
think that's the only way it would it

886
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
think that's the only way it would it
 

887
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,470
think that's the only way it would it
would have to keep going for a long time

888
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
would have to keep going for a long time
 

889
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,509
would have to keep going for a long time
um

890
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
um
 

891
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,790
um
and they might get to where they're

892
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
and they might get to where they're
 

893
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,110
and they might get to where they're
going and find

894
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
going and find
 

895
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,629
going and find
a shitty um solar system like we can try

896
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
a shitty um solar system like we can try
 

897
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,150
a shitty um solar system like we can try
to

898
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
to
 

899
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,389
to
we can try to do some advanced survey

900
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
we can try to do some advanced survey
 

901
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,110
we can try to do some advanced survey
but

902
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
but
 

903
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,110
but
i mean if you get there

904
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
i mean if you get there
 

905
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,350
i mean if you get there
and all the planets in that solar system

906
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
and all the planets in that solar system
 

907
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,910
and all the planets in that solar system
are just garbage planets then it's kind

908
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
are just garbage planets then it's kind
 

909
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,509
are just garbage planets then it's kind
of a big letdown

910
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
of a big letdown
 

911
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,069
of a big letdown
for for this like thousand-year voyage

912
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
for for this like thousand-year voyage
 

913
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,030
for for this like thousand-year voyage
that you've just uh you've just been on

914
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
that you've just uh you've just been on
 

915
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,110
that you've just uh you've just been on
right so i mean we have a pretty narrow

916
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
right so i mean we have a pretty narrow
 

917
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,870
right so i mean we have a pretty narrow
range of

918
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
range of
 

919
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,309
range of
of parameters that we need to stay

920
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
of parameters that we need to stay
 

921
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,350
of parameters that we need to stay
between in order to survive um in terms

922
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
between in order to survive um in terms
 

923
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,990
between in order to survive um in terms
of the the gravitational uh field that

924
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
of the the gravitational uh field that
 

925
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,390
of the the gravitational uh field that
we can deal with um

926
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
we can deal with um
 

927
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,710
we can deal with um
so that such a sets of bound on the size

928
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
so that such a sets of bound on the size
 

929
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,549
so that such a sets of bound on the size
of the the planet

930
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
of the the planet
 

931
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,870
of the the planet
and um what we need in the way of

932
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:18,880
and um what we need in the way of
 

933
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,510
and um what we need in the way of
temperature and atmosphere and so on

934
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
temperature and atmosphere and so on
 

935
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,390
temperature and atmosphere and so on
so

936
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
so
 

937
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,870
so
when you look at all those complications

938
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
when you look at all those complications
 

939
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,949
when you look at all those complications
then basically

940
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
then basically
 

941
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,029
then basically
building uh

942
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
building uh
 

943
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,470
building uh
uh sort of

944
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
uh sort of
 

945
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,549
uh sort of
exactly the environment we want out of

946
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
exactly the environment we want out of
 

947
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,870
exactly the environment we want out of
available materials in this solar system

948
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
available materials in this solar system
 

949
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,950
available materials in this solar system
starts to look a hell of a lot better

950
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960

 

951
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,669

it's hard to make

952
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
it's hard to make
 

953
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,789
it's hard to make
an economic argument let's say for for

954
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
an economic argument let's say for for
 

955
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,789
an economic argument let's say for for
for making that journey

956
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
for making that journey
 

957
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,789
for making that journey
uh one of the things i like about the

958
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
uh one of the things i like about the
 

959
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,870
uh one of the things i like about the
expanse is the fact that the people who

960
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
expanse is the fact that the people who
 

961
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,669
expanse is the fact that the people who
are trying to build the starship to go

962
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
are trying to build the starship to go
 

963
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,350
are trying to build the starship to go
to the other solar system are doing it

964
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
to the other solar system are doing it
 

965
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,270
to the other solar system are doing it
for religious reasons

966
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
for religious reasons
 

967
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,590
for religious reasons
i think that's the only reason that you

968
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
i think that's the only reason that you
 

969
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,230
i think that's the only reason that you
would do it

970
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
would do it
 

971
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,230
would do it
because economically it just makes more

972
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
because economically it just makes more
 

973
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,669
because economically it just makes more
sense to build

974
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
sense to build
 

975
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,630
sense to build
rotating cylindrical space habitats and

976
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
rotating cylindrical space habitats and
 

977
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,390
rotating cylindrical space habitats and
make them perfect

978
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
make them perfect
 

979
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,150
make them perfect
well is isn't everything done for

980
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
well is isn't everything done for
 

981
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,230
well is isn't everything done for
religious reasons like why do we

982
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
religious reasons like why do we
 

983
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,789
religious reasons like why do we
exploration yeah like what why why do we

984
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
exploration yeah like what why why do we
 

985
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,470
exploration yeah like what why why do we
go to the moon again

986
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
go to the moon again
 

987
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,710
go to the moon again
and do the other things uh what does jfk

988
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
and do the other things uh what does jfk
 

989
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,710
and do the other things uh what does jfk
said is because not because they're easy

990
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
said is because not because they're easy
 

991
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,390
said is because not because they're easy
but because they're hard it's not kind

992
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
but because they're hard it's not kind
 

993
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,909
but because they're hard it's not kind
of a religious reason

994
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
of a religious reason
 

995
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,710
of a religious reason
i knew a veteran of the apollo program

996
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
i knew a veteran of the apollo program
 

997
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,470
i knew a veteran of the apollo program

yeah so the conflict between nations is
 

1005
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,830
yeah so the conflict between nations is
a kind of

1006

um not exactly a religion but it's what
 

1009

that meaning isn't found in some kind of
 

1015
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,789
that meaning isn't found in some kind of
it's it's hard to find meaning in

1016
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
it's it's hard to find meaning in
 

1017
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,789
it's it's hard to find meaning in
mathematics yeah it's it's found in some

1018
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
mathematics yeah it's it's found in some
 

1019
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,669
mathematics yeah it's it's found in some
kind of

1020
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
kind of
 

1021
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,150
kind of
in music and religion whatever art i

1022
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
in music and religion whatever art i
 

1023
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,510
in music and religion whatever art i
mean some people do

1024
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
mean some people do
 

1025
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,789
mean some people do
but those are

1026
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
but those are
 

1027
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,669
but those are
probably not enough of them to

1028
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
probably not enough of them to
 

1029
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,909
probably not enough of them to
well they uh people that find beauty uh

1030
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
well they uh people that find beauty uh
 

1031
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,310
well they uh people that find beauty uh
meaning in mathematics they usually find

1032
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
meaning in mathematics they usually find
 

1033
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,310
meaning in mathematics they usually find
meaning between the lines nevertheless

1034
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
meaning between the lines nevertheless
 

1035
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,870
meaning between the lines nevertheless
not in the actual uh

1036
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
not in the actual uh
 

1037
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,669
not in the actual uh
for like the proving

1038
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
for like the proving
 

1039
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,110
for like the proving
proving some kind of thing fair enough

1040
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120
proving some kind of thing fair enough
 

1041
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,110

yeah so

1042
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
yeah so
 

1043
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,669
yeah so
from a cost perspective do you actually

1044
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
from a cost perspective do you actually
 

1045
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,990
from a cost perspective do you actually
see a possible future where we're b

1046
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
see a possible future where we're b
 

1047
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,909
see a possible future where we're b
building these kind of generation ships

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,470
and just
why not launch them one a year

1052
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:28,480
why not launch them one a year
 

1053

guy who required a lot of convincing
 

1109
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,230
guy who required a lot of convincing
um he'd been thinking about it since he

1110
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
um he'd been thinking about it since he
 

1111
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,870
um he'd been thinking about it since he
was five years old and it was an

1112
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
was five years old and it was an
 

1113
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,789
was five years old and it was an
inevitability but

1114
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:36,799
inevitability but
 

1115
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,149
inevitability but
um the

1116
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
um the
 

1117
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,230
um the
the idea um

1118
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
the idea um
 

1119
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,750
the idea um
that that kind of got hatched in 1999

1120
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
that that kind of got hatched in 1999
 

1121
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,510
that that kind of got hatched in 1999
was to um

1122
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
was to um
 

1123
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,630
was to um
just do some uh advanced scouting work

1124
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
just do some uh advanced scouting work
 

1125
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,590
just do some uh advanced scouting work
you know

1126
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
you know
 

1127
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,789
you know
explore the corners of the the space of

1128
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
explore the corners of the the space of
 

1129
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,029
explore the corners of the the space of
possibilities

1130
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
possibilities
 

1131
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,190
possibilities
and so that's what uh

1132
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
and so that's what uh
 

1133
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,750
and so that's what uh
that was blue operations llc which was

1134
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
that was blue operations llc which was
 

1135
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,029
that was blue operations llc which was
the precursor to blue origin

1136
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
the precursor to blue origin
 

1137
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,390
the precursor to blue origin
and um

1138
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
and um
 

1139
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,710
and um
so it was a small staff of people that

1140
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
so it was a small staff of people that
 

1141
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,029
so it was a small staff of people that
that did that for a few years and i

1142
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
that did that for a few years and i
 

1143
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,549
that did that for a few years and i
think it was about 2003 2004 that

1144
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
think it was about 2003 2004 that
 

1145
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,990
think it was about 2003 2004 that
uh it swung decisively towards the

1146
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
uh it swung decisively towards the
 

1147
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,070
uh it swung decisively towards the
direction it's it's been following ever

1148
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
direction it's it's been following ever
 

1149
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,630
direction it's it's been following ever

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,190
uh i believe and i continue to believe
that the the fact that we use chemical

1162
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
that the the fact that we use chemical
 

1163
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,390
that the the fact that we use chemical
rockets is just an accident of history

1164
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
rockets is just an accident of history
 

1165
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,630
rockets is just an accident of history
that comes out of world war ii

1166
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
that comes out of world war ii
 

1167
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,310
that comes out of world war ii
so until world war ii rockets are being

1168
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
so until world war ii rockets are being
 

1169
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,070
so until world war ii rockets are being
built on a small scale by people like

1170
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,080
built on a small scale by people like
 

1171
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,470
built on a small scale by people like
robert goddard

1172
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
robert goddard
 

1173
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,070
robert goddard
but then

1174
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,080
but then
 

1175
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,110
but then
hitler

1176
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
hitler
 

1177
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,990
hitler
desperately wants to bomb london

1178
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
desperately wants to bomb london
 

1179
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,510
desperately wants to bomb london
but he can't quite reach it and the

1180
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
but he can't quite reach it and the
 

1181
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,390
but he can't quite reach it and the
liftwaffe has been kind of neutralized

1182
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
liftwaffe has been kind of neutralized
 

1183
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,190
liftwaffe has been kind of neutralized
so

1184
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
so
 

1185
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,830
so
he he decides he's going to lob warheads

1186
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
he he decides he's going to lob warheads
 

1187
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,710
he he decides he's going to lob warheads
into it with with rockets

1188
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
into it with with rockets
 

1189
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,630
into it with with rockets
which is a terrible

1190
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
which is a terrible
 

1191
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,549
which is a terrible
misallocation of resources it's a

1192
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
misallocation of resources it's a
 

1193
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,630
misallocation of resources it's a
terrible idea but

1194
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640
terrible idea but
 

1195
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,549
terrible idea but
so it only could have happened in a

1196
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:12,559
so it only could have happened in a
 

1197
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,950
so it only could have happened in a
dictatorship controlled by

1198
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
dictatorship controlled by
 

1199
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,510
dictatorship controlled by
a lunatic um

1200
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
a lunatic um
 

1201
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,510
a lunatic um
but that's that's the situation that

1202
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
but that's that's the situation that
 

1203
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,909
but that's that's the situation that
existed so they built these rockets they

1204
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
existed so they built these rockets they
 

1205
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,630
existed so they built these rockets they
you know that's the v2

1206
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
you know that's the v2
 

1207
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,029
you know that's the v2
um and then it's just a complete

1208
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
um and then it's just a complete
 

1209
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,870
um and then it's just a complete
coincidence that that war ends with um

1210
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
coincidence that that war ends with um
 

1211
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,029
coincidence that that war ends with um
atomic bombs being developed in a

1212
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:33,039
atomic bombs being developed in a
 

1213
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,870
atomic bombs being developed in a
completely separate

1214
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
completely separate
 

1215
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,870
completely separate
super weapon program

1216
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:36,880
super weapon program
 

1217
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,430
super weapon program
and so suddenly the the existence of the

1218
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
and so suddenly the the existence of the
 

1219
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,549
and so suddenly the the existence of the
bombs

1220
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
bombs
 

1221
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,590
bombs
creates a demand for rockets that didn't

1222
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
creates a demand for rockets that didn't
 

1223
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,190
creates a demand for rockets that didn't
exist before

1224
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
exist before
 

1225
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,789
exist before
because if you've got

1226
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:46,799
because if you've got
 

1227
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,430
because if you've got
atomic bombs you need a way to deliver

1228
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
atomic bombs you need a way to deliver
 

1229
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,110
atomic bombs you need a way to deliver
them you can do with bombers but

1230
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
them you can do with bombers but
 

1231
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,909
them you can do with bombers but
it's a lot better to just hurl them

1232
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
it's a lot better to just hurl them
 

1233
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,430
it's a lot better to just hurl them
to the other side of the world on the

1234
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
to the other side of the world on the
 

1235
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,270
to the other side of the world on the
top of a rocket

1236
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280
top of a rocket
 

1237
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,270
top of a rocket
so um so suddenly

1238
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
so um so suddenly
 

1239
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,669
so um so suddenly
rockets which had gotten a boost

1240
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
rockets which had gotten a boost
 

1241
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,909
rockets which had gotten a boost
because of hitler's v2 program got a

1242
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
because of hitler's v2 program got a
 

1243
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,510
because of hitler's v2 program got a
much bigger boost

1244
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
much bigger boost
 

1245
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,710
much bigger boost
during the

1246
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
during the
 

1247
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,470
during the
50s and 60s

1248
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
50s and 60s
 

1249
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,789
50s and 60s
and it is a complete you're right for

1250
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
and it is a complete you're right for
 

1251
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,870
and it is a complete you're right for
some reason never thought of this it is

1252
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
some reason never thought of this it is
 

1253
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,110
some reason never thought of this it is
an accident of history that nuclear

1254
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
an accident of history that nuclear
 

1255
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,310
an accident of history that nuclear
weapons are developed at a similar time

1256
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320
weapons are developed at a similar time
 

1257
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,110
weapons are developed at a similar time
first of all nuclear weapons didn't have

1258
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
first of all nuclear weapons didn't have
 

1259
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,789
first of all nuclear weapons didn't have
to be developed at the same time as

1260
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
to be developed at the same time as
 

1261
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,950
to be developed at the same time as
world war ii right that's an accident in

1262
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
world war ii right that's an accident in
 

1263
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,190
world war ii right that's an accident in
history yeah and the fact

1264
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,200
history yeah and the fact
 

1265
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,110
history yeah and the fact
that okay so then hitler started using

1266
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
that okay so then hitler started using
 

1267
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,750
that okay so then hitler started using
rockets that's an accident okay

1268
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760
rockets that's an accident okay
 

1269
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,110
rockets that's an accident okay
that's fascinating it's a fascinating uh

1270
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
that's fascinating it's a fascinating uh
 

1271
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,590
that's fascinating it's a fascinating uh
set of coincidences yeah and which is

1272
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
set of coincidences yeah and which is
 

1273
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,149
set of coincidences yeah and which is
true of a lot of technologies by the way

1274
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
true of a lot of technologies by the way
 

1275
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,470
true of a lot of technologies by the way
but by the time these rockets are kind

1276
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
but by the time these rockets are kind
 

1277
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,149
but by the time these rockets are kind
of working um we've got hydrogen bombs

1278
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
of working um we've got hydrogen bombs
 

1279
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:48,950
of working um we've got hydrogen bombs
that

1280
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
that
 

1281
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,149
that
are so big and so devastating that

1282
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
are so big and so devastating that
 

1283
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,630
are so big and so devastating that
nobody really wants to use them but it

1284
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
nobody really wants to use them but it
 

1285
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,870
nobody really wants to use them but it
turns out you can fit a capsule with a

1286
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
turns out you can fit a capsule with a
 

1287
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,549
turns out you can fit a capsule with a
couple of people in it

1288
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
couple of people in it
 

1289
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,149
couple of people in it
into the the socket on the end of a of a

1290
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:02,159
into the the socket on the end of a of a
 

1291
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,029
into the the socket on the end of a of a
missile that was made to hold a hydrogen

1292
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:05,039
missile that was made to hold a hydrogen
 

1293
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,310
missile that was made to hold a hydrogen
bomb

1294
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
bomb
 

1295
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,909
bomb
so um

1296
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
so um
 

1297
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,630
so um
so we start doing that instead

1298
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:10,640
so we start doing that instead
 

1299
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,070
so we start doing that instead
as a proxy

1300
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
as a proxy
 

1301
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,070
as a proxy
for for having a war

1302
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,080
for for having a war
 

1303
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,029
for for having a war
um

1304
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
um
 

1305
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,269
um
and um i'd love to be in the meeting

1306
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:17,279
and um i'd love to be in the meeting
 

1307
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,870
and um i'd love to be in the meeting
where the first guy brought that up as

1308
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
where the first guy brought that up as
 

1309
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,230
where the first guy brought that up as
an idea

1310
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240

 

1311
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,750

it's probably a russian why don't we

1312
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
it's probably a russian why don't we
 

1313
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,630
it's probably a russian why don't we
strap a person to the rocket yeah

1314
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
strap a person to the rocket yeah
 

1315
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,470
strap a person to the rocket yeah
yeah well it probably was because they

1316
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
yeah well it probably was because they
 

1317
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,549
yeah well it probably was because they
did it first right uh the russians did

1318
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
did it first right uh the russians did
 

1319
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,390
did it first right uh the russians did
it and they had perhaps less respect for

1320
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400
it and they had perhaps less respect for
 

1321
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,950
it and they had perhaps less respect for
sort of safety protocols could be

1322
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
sort of safety protocols could be
 

1323
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,430
sort of safety protocols could be
they're a little bit more uh willing to

1324
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
they're a little bit more uh willing to
 

1325
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,510
they're a little bit more uh willing to
sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to

1326
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to
 

1327
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,830
sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to
risk the life of an astronaut

1328
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
risk the life of an astronaut
 

1329
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,149
risk the life of an astronaut
yeah yeah this is basically the story of

1330
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
yeah yeah this is basically the story of
 

1331
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,430
yeah yeah this is basically the story of
how

1332
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,440
how
 

1333
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,950
how
through all of this competition and

1334
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
through all of this competition and
 

1335
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,870
through all of this competition and
because of these historical accidents

1336
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
because of these historical accidents
 

1337
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,149
because of these historical accidents
you know trillions of r d dollars and

1338
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159
you know trillions of r d dollars and
 

1339
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,190
you know trillions of r d dollars and
rubles were put into

1340
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
rubles were put into
 

1341
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,870
rubles were put into
development of chemical rocket

1342
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
development of chemical rocket
 

1343
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,190
development of chemical rocket
technology which is you know now

1344
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
technology which is you know now
 

1345
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,830
technology which is you know now
advanced to an incredibly high degree

1346
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
advanced to an incredibly high degree
 

1347
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,750
advanced to an incredibly high degree
but there's other ways to make things go

1348
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
but there's other ways to make things go
 

1349
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,510
but there's other ways to make things go
really fast

1350
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520
really fast
 

1351
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,909
really fast
which is like all that rockets do

1352
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
which is like all that rockets do
 

1353
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,070
which is like all that rockets do
that's all orbit is it's just going

1354
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
that's all orbit is it's just going
 

1355
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,230
that's all orbit is it's just going
really fast

1356
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
really fast
 

1357
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,750
really fast
and

1358
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
and
 

1359
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,750
and
because so many nerds are obsessed with

1360
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:15,760
because so many nerds are obsessed with
 

1361
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,510
because so many nerds are obsessed with
space people have been

1362
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
space people have been
 

1363
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,710
space people have been
uh thinking about alternate schemes for

1364
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:20,720
uh thinking about alternate schemes for
 

1365
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,310
uh thinking about alternate schemes for
as long as they've been thinking about

1366
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
as long as they've been thinking about
 

1367
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,590
as long as they've been thinking about
rockets

1368
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
rockets
 

1369
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,510
rockets
um and so one of the first things that

1370
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
um and so one of the first things that
 

1371
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,590
um and so one of the first things that
you that i learned

1372
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
you that i learned
 

1373
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,070
you that i learned
kind of trying to explore new

1374
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
kind of trying to explore new
 

1375
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,750
kind of trying to explore new
possibilities

1376
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
possibilities
 

1377
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,630
possibilities
uh

1378
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
uh
 

1379
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,149
uh
was that

1380
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
was that
 

1381
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,750
was that
i could

1382
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
i could
 

1383
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,830
i could
put all of my brain power to work and

1384
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
put all of my brain power to work and
 

1385
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,950
put all of my brain power to work and
and be creative as i could and and

1386
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
and be creative as i could and and
 

1387
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,710
and be creative as i could and and
invent some idea that i thought was new

1388
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
invent some idea that i thought was new
 

1389
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,789
invent some idea that i thought was new
for making things go fast and i would

1390
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
for making things go fast and i would
 

1391
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,269
for making things go fast and i would
always find out that some guy in russia

1392
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
always find out that some guy in russia
 

1393
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,750
always find out that some guy in russia
or somewhere had had thought the same

1394
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,760
or somewhere had had thought the same
 

1395
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,230
or somewhere had had thought the same
idea up 50 years ago

1396
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
idea up 50 years ago
 

1397
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,630
idea up 50 years ago
and figured out all the math yeah you

1398
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
and figured out all the math yeah you
 

1399
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,630
and figured out all the math yeah you
know and so

1400
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
know and so
 

1401
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,510
know and so
so at a certain point you give up on

1402
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
so at a certain point you give up on
 

1403
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,750
so at a certain point you give up on
trying to invent completely new ideas

1404
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
trying to invent completely new ideas
 

1405
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,029
trying to invent completely new ideas
and just go

1406
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
and just go
 

1407
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,830
and just go
poking around trying to find those guys

1408
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:08,840
poking around trying to find those guys
 

1409
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,310
poking around trying to find those guys
um so there's a number of uh

1410
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
um so there's a number of uh
 

1411
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,710
um so there's a number of uh
of ideas that we looked at

1412
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
of ideas that we looked at
 

1413
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,190
of ideas that we looked at
you know some are crazier some are less

1414
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,200
you know some are crazier some are less
 

1415
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,310
you know some are crazier some are less
crazy but um the direction that that

1416
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,320
crazy but um the direction that that
 

1417
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,029
crazy but um the direction that that
company eventually took was was chemical

1418
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
company eventually took was was chemical
 

1419
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,390
company eventually took was was chemical
rockets is there something you can

1420
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
rockets is there something you can
 

1421
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,789
rockets is there something you can
comment on possible ideas like so first

1422
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:26,799
comment on possible ideas like so first
 

1423
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,269
comment on possible ideas like so first
of all like

1424
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
of all like
 

1425
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,630
of all like
i mean uh

1426
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:30,640
i mean uh
 

1427
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,110
i mean uh
uh like you could use nuclear so nuclear

1428
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
uh like you could use nuclear so nuclear
 

1429
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,789
uh like you could use nuclear so nuclear
pulse propulsion

1430
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
pulse propulsion
 

1431
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,029
pulse propulsion
yeah so that's i mean you've probably

1432
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
yeah so that's i mean you've probably
 

1433
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,669
yeah so that's i mean you've probably
heard of project orion which um

1434
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:39,679
heard of project orion which um
 

1435
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,630
heard of project orion which um
was the

1436
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
was the
 

1437
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,870
was the
freeman dyson and

1438
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:42,880
freeman dyson and
 

1439
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,909
freeman dyson and
some of his collaborators

1440
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
some of his collaborators
 

1441
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,149
some of his collaborators
had a scheme to um

1442
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:48,159
had a scheme to um
 

1443
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,310
had a scheme to um
to power a large space vehicle by

1444
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
to power a large space vehicle by
 

1445
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,350
to power a large space vehicle by
detonating atomic bombs behind it

1446
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
detonating atomic bombs behind it
 

1447
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,430
detonating atomic bombs behind it
and so one of the other people who was

1448
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
and so one of the other people who was
 

1449
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,669
and so one of the other people who was
working at blue operations during this

1450
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,679
working at blue operations during this
 

1451
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,029
working at blue operations during this
time was george dyson the son of freeman

1452
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:01,039
time was george dyson the son of freeman
 

1453
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,870
time was george dyson the son of freeman
and so we knew all about

1454
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
and so we knew all about
 

1455
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,549
and so we knew all about
project orion

1456
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559
project orion
 

1457
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,789
project orion
and he found an old

1458
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
and he found an old
 

1459
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,950
and he found an old
film that they'd shot on a beach in la

1460
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
film that they'd shot on a beach in la
 

1461
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,430
film that they'd shot on a beach in la
jolla of a prototype of this that was

1462
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
jolla of a prototype of this that was
 

1463
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,789
jolla of a prototype of this that was
powered by

1464
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
powered by
 

1465
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,750
powered by
uh like

1466
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:13,760
uh like
 

1467
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,149
uh like
uh lumps of c4

1468
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
uh lumps of c4
 

1469
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,070
uh lumps of c4
so that was an idea but for private

1470
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,080
so that was an idea but for private
 

1471
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,029
so that was an idea but for private
company

1472
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:19,039
company
 

1473
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,590
company
obtaining a large number of atomic bombs

1474
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
obtaining a large number of atomic bombs
 

1475
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,389
obtaining a large number of atomic bombs
was probably out of scope so

1476
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
was probably out of scope so
 

1477
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,710
was probably out of scope so
there's more of a theoretical

1478
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:26,720
there's more of a theoretical
 

1479
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,669
there's more of a theoretical
thing there's a

1480
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679

 

1481
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,389

conceptually similar

1482
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:32,399
conceptually similar
 

1483
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,950
conceptually similar
approach using lasers that

1484
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
approach using lasers that
 

1485
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,830
approach using lasers that
uh that freeman worked on

1486
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:37,840
uh that freeman worked on
 

1487
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,909
uh that freeman worked on
with arthur kantrowitz and some others

1488
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
with arthur kantrowitz and some others
 

1489
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,870
with arthur kantrowitz and some others
where you take a pulse blazer

1490
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
where you take a pulse blazer
 

1491
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,950
where you take a pulse blazer
and you fire it at a vehicle that has a

1492
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
and you fire it at a vehicle that has a
 

1493
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,110
and you fire it at a vehicle that has a
block of ice on the back

1494
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
block of ice on the back
 

1495
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,430
block of ice on the back
and the pulse hits the

1496
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
and the pulse hits the
 

1497
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,190
and the pulse hits the
ice and

1498
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,200
ice and
 

1499
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,590
ice and
flashes off a layer of steam that

1500
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,600
flashes off a layer of steam that
 

1501
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,190
flashes off a layer of steam that
becomes plasma

1502
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,200
becomes plasma
 

1503
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,149
becomes plasma
and plasma is opaque because it conducts

1504
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
and plasma is opaque because it conducts
 

1505
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,950
and plasma is opaque because it conducts
and so being opaque it then absorbs all

1506
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
and so being opaque it then absorbs all
 

1507
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,070
and so being opaque it then absorbs all
of the energy from the laser pulse and

1508
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
of the energy from the laser pulse and
 

1509
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,789
of the energy from the laser pulse and
gets really hot and just pushes

1510
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:06,799
gets really hot and just pushes
 

1511
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,830
gets really hot and just pushes
on the back of the the block of ice

1512
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
on the back of the the block of ice
 

1513
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,590
on the back of the the block of ice
and then you wait a moment for that to

1514
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:11,600
and then you wait a moment for that to
 

1515
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,909
and then you wait a moment for that to
dissipate and then you do it again

1516
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:13,919
dissipate and then you do it again
 

1517
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,190
dissipate and then you do it again
so it would just kind of uh vibrate its

1518
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200
so it would just kind of uh vibrate its
 

1519
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,870
so it would just kind of uh vibrate its
way

1520
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
way
 

1521
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,710

00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720

so there your source of energy is on the
ground and you're getting higher

yeah i understand
but how does that have to do with

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,269
ask that that question it was it was
more uh almost a

1654
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
more uh almost a
 

1655
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,070
more uh almost a
symbolic way of saying

1656
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,080
symbolic way of saying
 

1657
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,590
symbolic way of saying
look

1658
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:49,600
look
 

1659
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,389
look
there's

1660
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:50,399
there's
 

1661
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,549
there's
all kinds of physics we haven't

1662
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,559
all kinds of physics we haven't
 

1663
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,590
all kinds of physics we haven't
explored yet um that it's no more crazy

1664
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:57,600
explored yet um that it's no more crazy
 

1665
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,230
explored yet um that it's no more crazy
than the idea of chemical rockets

1666
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,240
than the idea of chemical rockets
 

1667
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,269
than the idea of chemical rockets
um

1668
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,279
um
 

1669
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,389
um
it's just that uh more money's gone into

1670
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
it's just that uh more money's gone into
 

1671
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,190
it's just that uh more money's gone into
chemical rockets right

1672
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,200
chemical rockets right
 

1673
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,750
chemical rockets right
but can i ask you uh

1674
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
but can i ask you uh
 

1675
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,750
but can i ask you uh
a question on propulsion that's a little

1676
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
a question on propulsion that's a little
 

1677
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,430
a question on propulsion that's a little
bit more

1678
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,440
bit more
 

1679
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,950
bit more
out there so

1680
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:14,960
out there so
 

1681
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,389
out there so
i don't know if you've

1682
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:16,399
i don't know if you've
 

1683
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,350
i don't know if you've
seen

1684
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360
seen
 

1685
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,389
seen
quite a

1686
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:18,399
quite a
 

1687
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,950
quite a
a lot of recent articles and reports and

1688
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:20,960
a lot of recent articles and reports and
 

1689
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,710
a lot of recent articles and reports and
so on about

1690
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:22,720
so on about
 

1691
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,029
so on about
uh ufos like the tic tac aircraft i keep

1692
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039
uh ufos like the tic tac aircraft i keep
 

1693
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,029
uh ufos like the tic tac aircraft i keep
seeing a lot of

1694
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
seeing a lot of
 

1695
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,190
seeing a lot of
chatter about it but i haven't gone

1696
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
chatter about it but i haven't gone
 

1697
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,470
chatter about it but i haven't gone
deep into it

1698
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,480
deep into it
 

1699
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,149
deep into it
so the dod released footage

1700
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
so the dod released footage
 

1701
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,710
so the dod released footage
filmed by

1702
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
filmed by
 

1703
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,149
filmed by
pilots

1704
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
pilots
 

1705
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,909
pilots
and there's a lot of reports about

1706
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
and there's a lot of reports about
 

1707
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,310
and there's a lot of reports about
objects that moved in ways they haven't

1708
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
objects that moved in ways they haven't
 

1709
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,950
objects that moved in ways they haven't
seen before that seem to defy the laws

1710
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:46,960
seen before that seem to defy the laws
 

1711
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,269
seen before that seem to defy the laws
of physics

1712
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
of physics
 

1713
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,269
of physics
if we consider the aircraft that we have

1714
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
if we consider the aircraft that we have
 

1715
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,310
if we consider the aircraft that we have
today

1716
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
today
 

1717
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,389
today
and so the reason i asked you

1718
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:54,399
and so the reason i asked you
 

1719
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,269
and so the reason i asked you
that is because it kind of um

1720
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279
that is because it kind of um
 

1721
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,430
that is because it kind of um
to me

1722
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
to me
 

1723
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,149
to me
whatever the heck it is

1724
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:02,159
whatever the heck it is
 

1725
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,990
whatever the heck it is
it's inspiring

1726
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
it's inspiring
 

1727
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,310
it's inspiring
for the possibilities of ideas for

1728
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
for the possibilities of ideas for
 

1729
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,830
for the possibilities of ideas for
propulsion

1730
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:07,840
propulsion
 

1731
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,070
propulsion
if it's like um

1732
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
if it's like um
 

1733
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,110
if it's like um
secret projects from foreign nations

1734
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,120
secret projects from foreign nations
 

1735
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,110
secret projects from foreign nations
or it's physical phenomena that we don't

1736
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
or it's physical phenomena that we don't
 

1737
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,950
or it's physical phenomena that we don't
yet understand like ball lightning all

1738
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
yet understand like ball lightning all
 

1739
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,389
yet understand like ball lightning all
those kinds of things or if it is aliens

1740
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
those kinds of things or if it is aliens
 

1741
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,430
those kinds of things or if it is aliens
or

1742
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,440
or
 

1743
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,909
or
objects from an alien civilization i

1744
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:23,919
objects from an alien civilization i
 

1745
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,750
objects from an alien civilization i
most likely believe it's if it's an

1746
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
most likely believe it's if it's an
 

1747
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,350
most likely believe it's if it's an
object from an alien civilization it's

1748
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
object from an alien civilization it's
 

1749
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,870
object from an alien civilization it's
got to be like

1750
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:28,880
got to be like
 

1751
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,509
got to be like
a really dumb drone they just like got

1752
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:31,519
a really dumb drone they just like got
 

1753
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,909
a really dumb drone they just like got
lost it's definitely not

1754
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:33,919
lost it's definitely not
 

1755
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,669
lost it's definitely not
like the pinnacle

1756
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
like the pinnacle
 

1757
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,310
like the pinnacle
of intelligence it's like some like

1758
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
of intelligence it's like some like
 

1759
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,750
of intelligence it's like some like
teenagers like uh science fair

1760
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
teenagers like uh science fair
 

1761
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,909
teenagers like uh science fair
experiment yeah he just flew for for a

1762
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:43,919
experiment yeah he just flew for for a
 

1763
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,470
experiment yeah he just flew for for a
few centuries out and just landed and

1764
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:46,480
few centuries out and just landed and
 

1765
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,149
few centuries out and just landed and
then we humans are all like really

1766
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
then we humans are all like really
 

1767
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,310
then we humans are all like really
excited about this

1768
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,320
excited about this
 

1769
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,630
excited about this
yes this wild thing i mean what what do

1770
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,640
yes this wild thing i mean what what do
 

1771
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,549
yes this wild thing i mean what what do
you think about those um

1772
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:54,559
you think about those um
 

1773
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,909
you think about those um
first of all like the millions of

1774
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
first of all like the millions of
 

1775
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,590
first of all like the millions of
reports of ufos right there's some

1776
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
reports of ufos right there's some
 

1777
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,230
reports of ufos right there's some
psychology there that's deeply cultural

1778
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
psychology there that's deeply cultural
 

1779
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,430
psychology there that's deeply cultural
uh but also the possibility of aliens

1780
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
uh but also the possibility of aliens
 

1781
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,509
uh but also the possibility of aliens
having visited earth

1782
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
having visited earth
 

1783
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,669
having visited earth
yeah i mean i'd like to see some better

1784
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:07,679
yeah i mean i'd like to see some better
 

1785
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,190
yeah i mean i'd like to see some better
pictures

1786
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,200
pictures
 

1787
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,789
pictures
for the reason i mentioned earlier

1788
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:10,799
for the reason i mentioned earlier
 

1789
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,190
for the reason i mentioned earlier
having to do with the difficulty of

1790
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,200
having to do with the difficulty of
 

1791
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,669
having to do with the difficulty of
traveling between star systems

1792
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
traveling between star systems
 

1793
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,269
traveling between star systems
it's really hard for me to believe it's

1794
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:17,279
it's really hard for me to believe it's
 

1795
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,350
it's really hard for me to believe it's
aliens

1796
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:19,360
aliens
 

1797
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,389
aliens
i just can't understand why you would

1798
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
i just can't understand why you would
 

1799
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,789
i just can't understand why you would
go to all that trouble to transport

1800
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:24,799
go to all that trouble to transport
 

1801
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,950
go to all that trouble to transport
something across light years

1802
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:26,960
something across light years
 

1803
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,389
something across light years
and then

1804
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:28,399
and then
 

1805
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,470
and then
do what these ufos

1806
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
do what these ufos
 

1807
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,149
do what these ufos
are allegedly doing

1808
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,159
are allegedly doing
 

1809
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,149
are allegedly doing
like how is that interesting how does

1810
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:34,159
like how is that interesting how does
 

1811
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,590
like how is that interesting how does
that justify

1812
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:35,600
that justify
 

1813
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,870
that justify
the trip so if you travel

1814
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
the trip so if you travel
 

1815
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,310
the trip so if you travel
across

1816
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
across
 

1817
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,710
across
you know those kinds of distances you'd

1818
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,720
you know those kinds of distances you'd
 

1819
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,190
you know those kinds of distances you'd
make a bigger splash

1820
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,200
make a bigger splash
 

1821
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,830
make a bigger splash
first of all i would expect that the

1822
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
first of all i would expect that the
 

1823
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,230
first of all i would expect that the
the arrival of these things would be

1824
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
the arrival of these things would be
 

1825
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,830
the arrival of these things would be
something we'd notice it's gotta you

1826
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:51,840
something we'd notice it's gotta you
 

1827
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,549
something we'd notice it's gotta you
know decelerate into into our solar

1828
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
know decelerate into into our solar
 

1829
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,590
know decelerate into into our solar
system

1830
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:55,600
system
 

1831
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,549
system
by

1832
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:56,559
by
 

1833
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,310
by
unless it got here really really really

1834
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
unless it got here really really really
 

1835
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,870
unless it got here really really really
slowly so i guess that's

1836
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:00,880
slowly so i guess that's
 

1837
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,110
slowly so i guess that's
that's a possibility and just kind of

1838
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
that's a possibility and just kind of
 

1839
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,430
that's a possibility and just kind of
snuck in so at the end we would detect

1840
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:05,440
snuck in so at the end we would detect
 

1841
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,190
snuck in so at the end we would detect
some kind of footprint in terms of

1842
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
some kind of footprint in terms of
 

1843
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,069
some kind of footprint in terms of
energy you would think so i actually

1844
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:10,079
energy you would think so i actually
 

1845
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,149
energy you would think so i actually
think your idea of a science fair

1846
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:12,159
think your idea of a science fair
 

1847
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,550
think your idea of a science fair
project gone gone bad

1848
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:14,560
project gone gone bad
 

1849
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,190
project gone gone bad
you know it makes more sense

1850
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,200
you know it makes more sense
 

1851
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,629
you know it makes more sense
in in that it would explain why these if

1852
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
in in that it would explain why these if
 

1853
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,710
in in that it would explain why these if
these things are alien technologies

1854
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
these things are alien technologies
 

1855
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,629
these things are alien technologies
they're just kind of

1856
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639
they're just kind of
 

1857
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,629
they're just kind of
hanging around our aircraft carriers for

1858
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
hanging around our aircraft carriers for
 

1859
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,270
hanging around our aircraft carriers for
no particular reason like doing doing

1860
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,280
no particular reason like doing doing
 

1861
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,669
no particular reason like doing doing
not trying to communicate yeah you know

1862
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
not trying to communicate yeah you know
 

1863
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,389
not trying to communicate yeah you know
is it can you imagine a scenario

1864
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:34,399
is it can you imagine a scenario
 

1865
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,589
is it can you imagine a scenario
where

1866
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
where
 

1867
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,149
where
aliens have visited earth or are

1868
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
aliens have visited earth or are
 

1869
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,550
aliens have visited earth or are
visiting earth and we wouldn't notice it

1870
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,560
visiting earth and we wouldn't notice it
 

1871
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,790
visiting earth and we wouldn't notice it
at all oh sure i mean if they've got

1872
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
at all oh sure i mean if they've got
 

1873
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,470
at all oh sure i mean if they've got
technology to

1874
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
technology to
 

1875
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,310
technology to
to get here they've probably got

1876
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,320
to get here they've probably got
 

1877
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,190
to get here they've probably got
technology to conceal the fact oh

1878
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
technology to conceal the fact oh
 

1879
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,950
technology to conceal the fact oh
they're trying to conceal themselves i

1880
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:50,960
they're trying to conceal themselves i
 

1881
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,629
they're trying to conceal themselves i
meant more like they're not trying to

1882
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
meant more like they're not trying to
 

1883
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,869
meant more like they're not trying to
conceal themselves but we're just our

1884
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:54,879
conceal themselves but we're just our
 

1885
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,270
conceal themselves but we're just our
cognitive capabilities are

1886
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,280
cognitive capabilities are
 

1887
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,990
cognitive capabilities are
like too limited and we are not thinking

1888
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,000
like too limited and we are not thinking
 

1889
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,910
like too limited and we are not thinking
big enough we're looking for a little

1890
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920
big enough we're looking for a little
 

1891
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,390
big enough we're looking for a little
green men yeah we're looking for things

1892
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,400
green men yeah we're looking for things
 

1893
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,150
green men yeah we're looking for things
that operate at a time scale that's

1894
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,160
that operate at a time scale that's
 

1895
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,510
that operate at a time scale that's
human-like

1896
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
human-like
 

1897
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,150
human-like
uh you know it's

1898
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,160
uh you know it's
 

1899
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,470
uh you know it's
yeah no i i love thinking about ideas

1900
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
yeah no i i love thinking about ideas
 

1901
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,630
yeah no i i love thinking about ideas
like that that's great science fiction

1902
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:14,640
like that that's great science fiction
 

1903
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,270
like that that's great science fiction
novel father you know that the aliens

1904
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,280
novel father you know that the aliens
 

1905
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,069
novel father you know that the aliens
are are so different uh that we simply

1906
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
are are so different uh that we simply
 

1907
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,990
are are so different uh that we simply
don't don't see them

1908
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,000
don't don't see them
 

1909
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,390
don't don't see them
i mean is there um you know in terms of

1910
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
i mean is there um you know in terms of
 

1911
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,310
i mean is there um you know in terms of
language do you think

1912
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
language do you think
 

1913
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,470
language do you think
it would be difficult

1914
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,480
it would be difficult
 

1915
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,790
it would be difficult
not aliens visiting us but traveling to

1916
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:30,800
not aliens visiting us but traveling to
 

1917
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,589
not aliens visiting us but traveling to
other places to find a common language

1918
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:33,599
other places to find a common language
 

1919
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,150
other places to find a common language
you you've written about the importance

1920
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,160
you you've written about the importance
 

1921
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,910
you you've written about the importance
of language in intelligent civilizations

1922
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
of language in intelligent civilizations
 

1923
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,510
of language in intelligent civilizations
um

1924
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,520
um
 

1925
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,430
um
how difficult is the problem to bridge

1926
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,440
how difficult is the problem to bridge
 

1927
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,390
how difficult is the problem to bridge
the gap between aliens and humans

1928
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,400
the gap between aliens and humans
 

1929
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,870
the gap between aliens and humans
yeah in terms of language so we're not

1930
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:48,880
yeah in terms of language so we're not
 

1931
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,030
yeah in terms of language so we're not
lost in translation yeah i mean there's

1932
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,040
lost in translation yeah i mean there's
 

1933
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,190
lost in translation yeah i mean there's
different takes on that depending on how

1934
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
different takes on that depending on how
 

1935
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,270
different takes on that depending on how
biologically similar they are

1936
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,280
biologically similar they are
 

1937
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,270
biologically similar they are
to us you know i mean there's a school

1938
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
to us you know i mean there's a school
 

1939
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,710
to us you know i mean there's a school
of thought that says

1940
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:58,720
of thought that says
 

1941
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,990
of thought that says
basically

1942
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
basically
 

1943
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,710
basically
uh

1944
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:02,720

 

1945
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,510

advanced life has to be carbon based

1946
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
advanced life has to be carbon based
 

1947
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,750
advanced life has to be carbon based
for just reasons of chemistry so right

1948
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
for just reasons of chemistry so right
 

1949
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,870
for just reasons of chemistry so right
away if you impose that limitation then

1950
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,880
away if you impose that limitation then
 

1951
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,750
away if you impose that limitation then
you're you're kind of assuming a uh

1952
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:13,760
you're you're kind of assuming a uh
 

1953
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,270
you're you're kind of assuming a uh
something that's starting to be

1954
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
something that's starting to be
 

1955
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,430
something that's starting to be
biologically similar to us

1956
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,440
biologically similar to us
 

1957
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,390
biologically similar to us
so if they're about as big as we are and

1958
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
so if they're about as big as we are and
 

1959
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,870
so if they're about as big as we are and
uh you know they um they they kind of

1960
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:22,880
uh you know they um they they kind of
 

1961
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,190
uh you know they um they they kind of
move around in in space you know a

1962
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,200
move around in in space you know a
 

1963
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,670
move around in in space you know a
physical body the way we do then then

1964
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:27,680
physical body the way we do then then
 

1965
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,750
physical body the way we do then then
there's probably a way to to solve that

1966
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:29,760
there's probably a way to to solve that
 

1967
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,230
there's probably a way to to solve that
communication problem

1968
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
communication problem
 

1969
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,109
communication problem
uh if they're you know like beings of

1970
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,119
uh if they're you know like beings of
 

1971
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,510
uh if they're you know like beings of
pure energy from star trek or something

1972
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:37,520
pure energy from star trek or something
 

1973
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,870
pure energy from star trek or something
like that then

1974
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:38,880
like that then
 

1975
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,030
like that then
it's a different story well i love

1976
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
it's a different story well i love
 

1977
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,470
it's a different story well i love
thinking about that kind of stuff too i

1978

you know
 

1983
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,589
you know
consciousness itself may be maybe

1984
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
consciousness itself may be maybe
 

1985
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,670
consciousness itself may be maybe
i mean it could be

1986
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:49,680
i mean it could be
 

1987
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,870
i mean it could be
like you said beings of pure energy

1988
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
like you said beings of pure energy
 

1989
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,270
like you said beings of pure energy
um i i think i think of life

1990
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,280
um i i think i think of life
 

1991
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,750
um i i think i think of life
as just complex systems and the kind of

1992
00:36:59,750 --> 00:36:59,760
as just complex systems and the kind of
 

1993
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,470
as just complex systems and the kind of
forms those complex systems can take

1994
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
forms those complex systems can take
 

1995
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,310
forms those complex systems can take
seems to be much larger than the

1996
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
seems to be much larger than the
 

1997
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,069
seems to be much larger than the
particular biological systems we see

1998
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,079
particular biological systems we see
 

1999
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,829
particular biological systems we see
here on

2000
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:06,839

um i mean
it depends what is more fundamental to

2030
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040
it depends what is more fundamental to
 

2031
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,190
it depends what is more fundamental to
relations across

yeah across intelligent species yeah i
mean um

2036
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800

so i mean
 

2041
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,829
so i mean
uh if your production right you know the

2042
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:53,839
uh if your production right you know the
 

2043
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,750
uh if your production right you know the
the

2044
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:55,760
the
 

2045
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,150
the
when in star trek in classic star trek

2046
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,160
when in star trek in classic star trek
 

2047
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,270
when in star trek in classic star trek
you had to

2048
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,280
you had to
 

2049
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,390
you had to
to really

2050
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:00,400
to really
 

2051
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,190
to really
suspend your disbelief to to think that

2052
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,200
suspend your disbelief to to think that
 

2053
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,390
suspend your disbelief to to think that
um

2054
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,400
um
 

2055
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,349
um
spock was half vulcan and half human

2056
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:07,359
spock was half vulcan and half human
 

2057
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,910
spock was half vulcan and half human
right because that's just

2058
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:09,920
right because that's just
 

2059
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,150
right because that's just
not gonna not gonna work dna wise um

2060
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,160
not gonna not gonna work dna wise um
 

2061
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,670
not gonna not gonna work dna wise um
so um

2062
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:15,680
so um
 

2063
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,270
so um
so if by sex you mean reproductive sex

2064
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,280
so if by sex you mean reproductive sex
 

2065
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,710
so if by sex you mean reproductive sex
then um

2066
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:20,720
then um
 

2067
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,589
then um
uh i would say no unless

2068
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:23,599
uh i would say no unless
 

2069
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,470
uh i would say no unless
you unless you go to a panspermia

2070
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:26,480
you unless you go to a panspermia
 

2071
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,870
you unless you go to a panspermia
kind of theory which is that

2072
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:28,880
kind of theory which is that
 

2073
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,670
kind of theory which is that
uh you know humans were seeded onto the

2074
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:31,680
uh you know humans were seeded onto the
 

2075
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,829
uh you know humans were seeded onto the
planet as part of a galactic uh you know

2076
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:35,839
planet as part of a galactic uh you know
 

2077
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:36,950
planet as part of a galactic uh you know
uh

2078
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:36,960
uh
 

2079
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,829
uh
program of some of some sort

2080
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:39,839
program of some of some sort
 

2081
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,670
program of some of some sort
and then we're just returning home yeah

2082
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:41,680
and then we're just returning home yeah
 

2083
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,190
and then we're just returning home yeah
and hanging out with our

2084
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,200
and hanging out with our
 

2085
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,589
and hanging out with our
old relatives assistant cousins yeah

2086
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
old relatives assistant cousins yeah
 

2087
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,270
old relatives assistant cousins yeah
yeah

2088
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,280
yeah
 

2089
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,430
yeah
but that that doesn't seem

2090
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440
but that that doesn't seem
 

2091
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,030
but that that doesn't seem
you know it doesn't seem

2092
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
you know it doesn't seem
 

2093
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,430
you know it doesn't seem
seem plausible we know that we know that

2094
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,440
seem plausible we know that we know that
 

2095
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,910
seem plausible we know that we know that
humans had sex with neanderthals with

2096
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,920
humans had sex with neanderthals with
 

2097
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,030
humans had sex with neanderthals with
denisovans denisovans

2098
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,040
denisovans denisovans
 

2099
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,750
denisovans denisovans
so you could think of them as aliens

2100
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:01,760
so you could think of them as aliens
 

2101
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,670
so you could think of them as aliens
that that came from our

2102
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:03,680
that that came from our
 

2103
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,710
that that came from our
planet

2104
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:04,720
planet
 

2105
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,750
planet
um

2106
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
um
 

2107
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,790
um
so um so that's a kind of data point i

2108
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:08,800
so um so that's a kind of data point i
 

2109
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,349
so um so that's a kind of data point i
guess

2110
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:11,359

 

2111
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,390

but

2112
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:12,400
but
 

2113
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,150
but
you know if you broaden your definition

2114
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:14,160
you know if you broaden your definition
 

2115
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,470
you know if you broaden your definition
of sex to mean any kind of

2116
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:16,480
of sex to mean any kind of
 

2117
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,670
of sex to mean any kind of
uh gratifying physical

2118
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
uh gratifying physical
 

2119
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,430
uh gratifying physical
interaction then sure

2120
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
interaction then sure
 

2121
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,190
interaction then sure
right

2122
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,200
right
 

2123
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,750
right
dancing and that's that's how we get to

2124
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
dancing and that's that's how we get to
 

2125
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,630
dancing and that's that's how we get to
love

2126
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
love
 

2127
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,550
love
okay and love can take many forms love

2128
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:28,560
okay and love can take many forms love
 

2129
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,550
okay and love can take many forms love
can certainly take many forms i have to

2130
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:30,560
can certainly take many forms i have to
 

2131
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,990
can certainly take many forms i have to
ask you um in terms of space

2132
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,000
ask you um in terms of space
 

2133
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,750
ask you um in terms of space
just looking at where blue origin is

2134
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:35,760
just looking at where blue origin is
 

2135
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,670
just looking at where blue origin is
looking at where spacex is today

2136
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680

 

2137
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,990

and maybe looking out 10 20 years out

2138
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,000
and maybe looking out 10 20 years out
 

2139
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,950
and maybe looking out 10 20 years out
from now

2140
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:42,960
from now
 

2141
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,950
from now
are you impressed of what's happening we

perchlorates uh on the surface of mars
 

2265
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,790
perchlorates uh on the surface of mars
that's going to be big trouble

2266
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:56,800
that's going to be big trouble
 

2267

would best be done for religious reasons
um what about colonizing mars

2284
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
um what about colonizing mars
 

2285
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,109
um what about colonizing mars
can you spin it into a business

2286
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:19,119
can you spin it into a business
 

2287
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,750
can you spin it into a business
proposition it's hard to

2288
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:21,760
proposition it's hard to
 

2289
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,109
proposition it's hard to
think of a resource that's on mars that

2290
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:25,119
think of a resource that's on mars that
 

2291
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,589
think of a resource that's on mars that
could be brought back here cheaply

2292
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:27,599
could be brought back here cheaply
 

2293
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,670
could be brought back here cheaply
enough to compete

2294
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:29,680
enough to compete
 

2295
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,390
enough to compete
with um

2296
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,400
with um
 

2297
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,910
with um
with stuff we could just dig out of the

2298
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:33,920
with stuff we could just dig out of the
 

2299
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,790
with stuff we could just dig out of the
ground here or grow here

2300
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:36,800
ground here or grow here
 

2301
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,030
ground here or grow here
so i don't know if there is a business

2302
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,040
so i don't know if there is a business
 

2303
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,069
so i don't know if there is a business
plan for that or if it's just strictly

2304
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
plan for that or if it's just strictly
 

2305
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,670
plan for that or if it's just strictly

trying to make up his mind right it's
just like

2480
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:53,760
just like
 

2481
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,630

um
 

2483
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,630
um
just go and do it let's dig tunnels

2484
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
just go and do it let's dig tunnels
 

2485
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,390
just go and do it let's dig tunnels
under cities go you know let's uh um

2486
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,400
under cities go you know let's uh um
 

2487
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,390
under cities go you know let's uh um
step one make a joke about on twitter

2488
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
step one make a joke about on twitter
 

2489
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,190
step one make a joke about on twitter
step two actually do it yeah yeah

2490
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,200
step two actually do it yeah yeah
 

2491
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,150
step two actually do it yeah yeah
yeah

2492
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,160
yeah
 

2493
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,030
yeah
and uh i mean things have slowed down uh

2494
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,040
and uh i mean things have slowed down uh
 

2495
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,910
and uh i mean things have slowed down uh
quite our ability to um

2496
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:11,920
quite our ability to um
 

2497
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,190
quite our ability to um
to build things uh uh

2498
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
to build things uh uh
 

2499
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,150
to build things uh uh
at pace um is is a lot less than it was

2500
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,160
at pace um is is a lot less than it was
 

2501
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,910
at pace um is is a lot less than it was
and there's there's reasons for that you

2502
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:19,920
and there's there's reasons for that you
 

2503
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,589
and there's there's reasons for that you
know we're more concerned with safety

2504
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:21,599
know we're more concerned with safety
 

2505
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,309
know we're more concerned with safety
and

2506
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:22,319
and
 

2507
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,309
and
environmental impacts than um than

2508
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
environmental impacts than um than
 

2509
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,150
environmental impacts than um than
people were when they were building

2510
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,160
people were when they were building
 

2511
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,309
people were when they were building
uh some of the great publix works

2512
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
uh some of the great publix works
 

2513
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,069
uh some of the great publix works
projects of the mid

2514
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:30,079
projects of the mid
 

2515
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,230
projects of the mid
20th century

2516
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
20th century
 

2517
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,150
20th century
but even we're at the point now where

2518
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,160
but even we're at the point now where
 

2519
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,910
but even we're at the point now where
even just maintaining the stuff that

2520
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:35,920
even just maintaining the stuff that
 

2521
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,150
even just maintaining the stuff that
we've got is such a huge

2522
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
we've got is such a huge
 

2523
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,750
we've got is such a huge
project

2524
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
project
 

2525
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,990
project
that we need to put big resources into

2526
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,000
that we need to put big resources into
 

2527
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,790
that we need to put big resources into
it and and good minds into it

2528
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:44,800
it and and good minds into it
 

2529
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,630
it and and good minds into it
or else we're going to be we're going to

2530
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
or else we're going to be we're going to
 

2531
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,710
or else we're going to be we're going to
be losing

2532
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
be losing
 

2533
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,390
be losing
things that we

2534
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:50,400
things that we
 

2535
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,150
things that we
take for granted

2536
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:52,160
take for granted
 

2537
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,750
take for granted
do you think that there's a lot to be

2538
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760
do you think that there's a lot to be
 

2539
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,950
do you think that there's a lot to be
done in the digital space that's uh we

2540
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,960
done in the digital space that's uh we
 

2541
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,190
done in the digital space that's uh we
mentioned sort of wikipedia and

2542
00:46:59,190 --> 00:46:59,200
mentioned sort of wikipedia and
 

2543
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,309
mentioned sort of wikipedia and
knowledge

2544
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:00,319
knowledge
 

2545
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,670
knowledge
don't you think there could be a lot of

2546
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:01,680
don't you think there could be a lot of
 

2547
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,990
don't you think there could be a lot of
flourishing in the space of innovation

2548
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
flourishing in the space of innovation
 

2549
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,230
flourishing in the space of innovation
in terms of innovation in in the digital

2550
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:06,240
in terms of innovation in in the digital
 

2551
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,109
in terms of innovation in in the digital
space

2552
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:07,119
space
 

2553
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,190
space
yeah i mean i'd like to see that i think

2554
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
yeah i mean i'd like to see that i think
 

2555
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,109
yeah i mean i'd like to see that i think
it's where

2556
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:11,119
it's where
 

2557
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,510
it's where
a lot of the brain power went during the

2558
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:13,520
a lot of the brain power went during the
 

2559
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,390
a lot of the brain power went during the
last couple of generations

2560
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
last couple of generations
 

2561
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,109
last couple of generations
because people who who might previously

2562
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:19,119
because people who who might previously
 

2563
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,670
because people who who might previously
have been building rockets or

2564
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:21,680
have been building rockets or
 

2565
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,510
have been building rockets or
or other kinds of sort of hard

2566
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:23,520
or other kinds of sort of hard
 

2567
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,030
or other kinds of sort of hard
technologies

2568
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,040
technologies
 

2569
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,589
technologies
ended up instead going into programming

2570
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:27,599
ended up instead going into programming
 

2571
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,349
ended up instead going into programming
computer science

2572
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:29,359
computer science
 

2573
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,349
computer science
which is understandable and great

2574
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
which is understandable and great
 

2575
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,589
which is understandable and great
we've got structural problems right now

2576
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:35,599
we've got structural problems right now
 

2577
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,069
we've got structural problems right now
in the way social media works that are

2578
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:38,079
in the way social media works that are
 

2579
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,630
in the way social media works that are
pretty severe and so

2580
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,640
pretty severe and so
 

2581
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,069
pretty severe and so
i

2582
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
i
 

2583
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,069
i
certainly hope that we're not

2584
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:44,079
certainly hope that we're not
 

2585
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,990
certainly hope that we're not
10 years from now that we're not exactly

2586
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:46,000
10 years from now that we're not exactly
 

2587
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,430
10 years from now that we're not exactly
where we are today

2588
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,440
where we are today
 

2589
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,829
where we are today
when it comes to to that stuff we need

2590
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:49,839
when it comes to to that stuff we need
 

2591
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,589
when it comes to to that stuff we need
to move on

2592
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:51,599
to move on
 

2593
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,270
to move on
the beautiful thing

2594
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
the beautiful thing
 

2595
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,069
the beautiful thing
about problems is they show you how not

2596
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:56,079
about problems is they show you how not
 

2597
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,190
about problems is they show you how not
to do things yeah and they give you give

2598
00:47:59,190 --> 00:47:59,200
to do things yeah and they give you give
 

2599
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,349
to do things yeah and they give you give
opportunity to

2600
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:01,359
opportunity to
 

2601
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,150
opportunity to
new ideas to flourish

2602
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
new ideas to flourish
 

2603
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,309
new ideas to flourish
and to beat out the ideas of the old

2604
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:06,319
and to beat out the ideas of the old
 

2605
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,430
and to beat out the ideas of the old
which is uh

2606
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,440
which is uh
 

2607
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,150
which is uh
a dream for me in in

2608
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,160
a dream for me in in
 

2609
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,670
a dream for me in in
to see um

2610
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:11,680
to see um
 

2611
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,870
to see um
new social media yeah that beats out the

2612
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:14,880
new social media yeah that beats out the
 

2613
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,910
new social media yeah that beats out the
ways to go so i i tend to you perhaps

2614
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:17,920
ways to go so i i tend to you perhaps
 

2615
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,390
ways to go so i i tend to you perhaps

on on his interview with you was talking
 

2665
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,510
on on his interview with you was talking
about

2666

about
 

2667
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,670
about
what data unions or

2668
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
what data unions or
 

2669
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,510
what data unions or
yeah those are a lot of interesting

2670
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:23,520
yeah those are a lot of interesting
 

2671
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,950
yeah those are a lot of interesting
ideas but for me

2672
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:24,960
ideas but for me
 

2673
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,990
ideas but for me
the biggest disagreement

2674
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,000
the biggest disagreement
 

2675
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,630
the biggest disagreement
was in the level of cynicism

2676
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640

00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,240
people that are doing things the wrong
 

2689
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,510
people that are doing things the wrong
way

2690
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:45,520
way
 

2691
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,349
way
you should nevertheless maintain

2692
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:47,359
you should nevertheless maintain
 

2693
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,270
you should nevertheless maintain
optimism because

2694
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,280
optimism because
 

2695
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,109
optimism because
what's important is to find the one

2696
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
what's important is to find the one
 

2697
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,630
what's important is to find the one
person in that room that's going to do

2698
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:52,640
person in that room that's going to do
 

2699
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,390
person in that room that's going to do
things the right way cynicism is going

2700
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
things the right way cynicism is going
 

2701
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,510
things the right way cynicism is going
to completely silence out the whole room

2702
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:57,520
to completely silence out the whole room
 

2703
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,829
to completely silence out the whole room
so he was saying i've i've been here a

2704
00:49:59,829 --> 00:49:59,839
so he was saying i've i've been here a
 

2705
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,870
so he was saying i've i've been here a
long time oh yeah i i've known you know

2706
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
long time oh yeah i i've known you know

00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:05,920
i i underst like how these folks work
 

2709
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,430
i i underst like how these folks work
they think

2710
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:07,440
they think
 

2711
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,109
they think
they're gods

2712
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:09,119
they're gods
 

2713
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,430
they're gods
and they know the right way to do things

2714
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:11,440
and they know the right way to do things
 

2715
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,109
and they know the right way to do things
and they will

2716
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:13,119
and they will
 

2717
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,510
and they will
tell you how to do those things and that

2718
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:15,520
tell you how to do those things and that
 

2719
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,750
tell you how to do those things and that
kind of hubris is going to always lead

2720
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:17,760
kind of hubris is going to always lead
 

2721
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,109
kind of hubris is going to always lead
you astray

2722
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:19,119
you astray
 

2723
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,950
you astray
when you are the one who's engineering

2724
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:20,960
when you are the one who's engineering
 

2725
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,470
when you are the one who's engineering
the algorithms

2726
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:22,480
the algorithms
 

2727
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,950
the algorithms
and there's a lot of deep truth to that

2728
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
and there's a lot of deep truth to that
 

2729
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,190
and there's a lot of deep truth to that
because algorithms are powerful

2730
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,200
because algorithms are powerful
 

2731
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,190
because algorithms are powerful
and uh many people when given power

2732
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,200
and uh many people when given power
 

2733
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,069
and uh many people when given power
do not do the best of things i mean most

2734

2741
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,870
give him power yeah
yes but that doesn't mean that some

2742
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:42,880
yes but that doesn't mean that some
 

2743
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,349
yes but that doesn't mean that some
people are not able to handle the power

2744
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:45,359
people are not able to handle the power
 

2745
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,870
people are not able to handle the power
that some people are not able to come up

00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:35,599
part of it is yeah yeah most of it yeah
 

2795
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,910
part of it is yeah yeah most of it yeah
it's a great place to set it so in it

2796
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:37,920
it's a great place to set it so in it
 

2797
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,069
it's a great place to set it so in it

00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,630
mccool again a texas billionaire oil man

2802
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:44,640
and truck stop magnate
 

2803
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,630

decides to solve climate change to take

2804
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:46,640
decides to solve climate change to take
 

2805
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,589
decides to solve climate change to take
on climate change by himself so this is

2806
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:49,599
on climate change by himself so this is
 

2807
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,390
on climate change by himself so this is
an interesting philosophical exploration

2808
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
an interesting philosophical exploration
 

2809
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,910
an interesting philosophical exploration
of how to solve climate change from a

2810
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:53,920
of how to solve climate change from a
 

2811
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,510
of how to solve climate change from a
perspective that's perhaps different

2812
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
perspective that's perhaps different
 

2813
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,349
perspective that's perhaps different
than we've been thinking about i

2814
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:57,359
than we've been thinking about i
 

2815
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,270
than we've been thinking about i
wouldn't i wouldn't use the word solve

2816
00:51:59,270 --> 00:51:59,280
wouldn't i wouldn't use the word solve
 

2817
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,950
wouldn't i wouldn't use the word solve
but let's say

2818
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
but let's say
 

2819
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,230
but let's say
ameliorate ameliorate the temporary

2820
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:04,240
ameliorate ameliorate the temporary
 

2821
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,270
ameliorate ameliorate the temporary
effects but please take on yeah take on

2822
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:07,280
effects but please take on yeah take on
 

2823
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,030
effects but please take on yeah take on
the challenge so it's it's very

2824
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:09,040
the challenge so it's it's very
 

2825
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,270
the challenge so it's it's very
interesting but as

2826
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
interesting but as
 

2827
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,870
interesting but as
there's a gradual nature to this process

2828
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:14,880
there's a gradual nature to this process
 

2829
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,069
there's a gradual nature to this process
and

2830
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:16,079
and
 

2831
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:21,190
and
i mean just like in in your book

2832
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:21,200

 

2833
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,470

um

2834
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:22,480
um
 

2835
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,670
um
the power of innovation

2836
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:25,680
the power of innovation
 

2837
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,910
the power of innovation
is something that has uh

2838
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:27,920
is something that has uh
 

2839
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,630
is something that has uh
saved us quite a few times in history

2840
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:30,640
saved us quite a few times in history
 

2841
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,190
saved us quite a few times in history
so what role does that play as in this

2842
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:33,200
so what role does that play as in this
 

2843
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,109
so what role does that play as in this
gradual process right so ultimately

2844
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
gradual process right so ultimately
 

2845
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,510
gradual process right so ultimately
we don't solve the problem until we get

2846
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:39,520
we don't solve the problem until we get
 

2847
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,390
we don't solve the problem until we get
the

2848
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,400
the
 

2849
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,790
the
co2 out of the atmosphere

2850
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
co2 out of the atmosphere
 

2851
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,710
co2 out of the atmosphere
um but that is going to take a while um

2852
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:46,720
um but that is going to take a while um
 

2853
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,630
um but that is going to take a while um
we're still adding more

2854
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:48,640
we're still adding more
 

2855
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,870
we're still adding more
uh we haven't even started to

2856
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:50,880
uh we haven't even started to
 

2857
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,510
uh we haven't even started to
to reduce the amount so

2858
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
to reduce the amount so
 

2859
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,069
to reduce the amount so
um so there's two possibilities inside

2860
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
um so there's two possibilities inside
 

2861
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,230
um so there's two possibilities inside
to interrupt reduce the amount that

2862
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:58,240
to interrupt reduce the amount that
 

2863
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,030
to interrupt reduce the amount that
we're putting in the atmosphere and two

2864
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,040
we're putting in the atmosphere and two
 

2865
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,950
we're putting in the atmosphere and two
is removing what we got in the

2866
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:02,960
is removing what we got in the
 

2867
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,430
is removing what we got in the
atmosphere we have to do both right and

2868
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:05,440
atmosphere we have to do both right and
 

2869
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,390
atmosphere we have to do both right and
those are two different kind of uh

2870
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
those are two different kind of uh
 

2871
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,710
those are two different kind of uh
efforts in terms of like what's involved

2872
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:10,720
efforts in terms of like what's involved
 

2873
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,190
efforts in terms of like what's involved
because it stays up there so

2874
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:13,200
because it stays up there so
 

2875
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,349
because it stays up there so
i think just last week china

2876
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
i think just last week china
 

2877
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,190
i think just last week china
announced that they're going to try to

2878
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
announced that they're going to try to
 

2879
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,630
announced that they're going to try to
level off

2880
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:18,640
level off
 

2881
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,790
level off
their co2 emissions

2882
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:20,800
their co2 emissions
 

2883
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,109
their co2 emissions
in like 2030

2884
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:23,119
in like 2030
 

2885
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,190
in like 2030
so 2031 they'll only put as much co2

2886
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
so 2031 they'll only put as much co2
 

2887
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,150
so 2031 they'll only put as much co2
into the atmosphere as they did in 2030

2888
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,160
into the atmosphere as they did in 2030
 

2889
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,349
into the atmosphere as they did in 2030
which is still

2890
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:31,359
which is still
 

2891
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,190
which is still
a lot of co2

2892
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,200
a lot of co2
 

2893
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,549
a lot of co2
in 2060 they're saying will be net zero

2894
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:36,559
in 2060 they're saying will be net zero
 

2895
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,470
in 2060 they're saying will be net zero
so if everyone in the world does that

2896
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480
so if everyone in the world does that
 

2897
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,990
so if everyone in the world does that
and the ppm

2898
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,000
and the ppm
 

2899
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,190
and the ppm
of co2 in the atmosphere by then is say

2900
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:43,200
of co2 in the atmosphere by then is say
 

2901
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,430
of co2 in the atmosphere by then is say
450 parts per million it'll stay at 450

2902
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:47,440
450 parts per million it'll stay at 450
 

2903
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,109
450 parts per million it'll stay at 450
parts per million

2904
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:49,119
parts per million
 

2905
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,589
parts per million
until we take it out

2906
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:51,599
until we take it out
 

2907
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,190
until we take it out
and taking it out

2908
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:53,200
and taking it out
 

2909
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,549
and taking it out
um is hard it's a you know it's a big

2910
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:56,559
um is hard it's a you know it's a big
 

2911
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,030
um is hard it's a you know it's a big
we took us a long time we had to empty

2912
00:53:59,030 --> 00:53:59,040
we took us a long time we had to empty
 

2913
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,109
we took us a long time we had to empty
out huge coal mines

2914
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:01,119
out huge coal mines
 

2915
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,670
out huge coal mines
and oil reservoirs and burn all that

2916
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:03,680
and oil reservoirs and burn all that
 

2917
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,829
and oil reservoirs and burn all that
stuff we had to chop down forests and

2918
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:05,839
stuff we had to chop down forests and
 

2919
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,150
stuff we had to chop down forests and
dig up peat bogs

2920
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:08,160
dig up peat bogs
 

2921
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,349
dig up peat bogs
in order to create all of that co2 and

2922
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:11,359
in order to create all of that co2 and
 

2923
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,549
in order to create all of that co2 and
so we have to reverse all of those

2924
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:14,559
so we have to reverse all of those
 

2925
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,670
so we have to reverse all of those
processes uh somehow in order to

2926
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:17,680
processes uh somehow in order to
 

2927
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,109
processes uh somehow in order to
remove the co2 and get it back down

2928
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:21,119
remove the co2 and get it back down
 

2929
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,349
remove the co2 and get it back down
hopefully into the 200 and some parts

2930
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:23,359
hopefully into the 200 and some parts
 

2931
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,150
hopefully into the 200 and some parts
per million range where it used to be

2932
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
per million range where it used to be
 

2933
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,710
per million range where it used to be
so how about you get a a single texas

2934
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:28,720
so how about you get a a single texas
 

2935
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,069
so how about you get a a single texas
billionaire

2936
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:30,079
billionaire
 

2937
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,829
billionaire
to have a massive gun that blasts huge

2938
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
to have a massive gun that blasts huge
 

2939
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,990
to have a massive gun that blasts huge
quantities of sulfur into the upper

2940
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,000
quantities of sulfur into the upper
 

2941
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,349
quantities of sulfur into the upper
atmosphere so that's idea number one

2942
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:37,359
atmosphere so that's idea number one
 

2943
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,150
atmosphere so that's idea number one
that's uh this is called solar

2944
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:39,160
that's uh this is called solar
 

2945
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,589
that's uh this is called solar
geoengineering and it's uh

2946
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:41,599
geoengineering and it's uh
 

2947
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,150
geoengineering and it's uh
we know that it's a possibility on a

2948
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,160
we know that it's a possibility on a
 

2949
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,470
we know that it's a possibility on a
technical level because volcanoes have

2950
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:46,480
technical level because volcanoes have
 

2951
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,309
technical level because volcanoes have
been doing it forever

2952
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:48,319
been doing it forever
 

2953
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,430
been doing it forever
um so many times in human history we've

2954
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,440
um so many times in human history we've
 

2955
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,069
um so many times in human history we've
seen a volcanic eruption

2956
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:54,079
seen a volcanic eruption
 

2957
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,069
seen a volcanic eruption
that was followed by a global cooling

2958
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
that was followed by a global cooling
 

2959
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,710
that was followed by a global cooling
trend that lasted for a couple of years

2960
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:58,720
trend that lasted for a couple of years
 

2961
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,950
trend that lasted for a couple of years
and one of these things happened i think

2962
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:00,960
and one of these things happened i think
 

2963
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,349
and one of these things happened i think
in the 60s or 70s in indonesia and

2964
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:05,359
in the 60s or 70s in indonesia and
 

2965
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,069
in the 60s or 70s in indonesia and
and the australians sent a a plane up

2966
00:55:08,069 --> 00:55:08,079
and the australians sent a a plane up
 

2967
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,670
and the australians sent a a plane up
into the stratosphere to take some

2968
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:09,680
into the stratosphere to take some
 

2969
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,430
into the stratosphere to take some
samples of the plume

2970
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
samples of the plume
 

2971
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,270
samples of the plume
and when it came back down the

2972
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:13,280
and when it came back down the
 

2973
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,270
and when it came back down the
windscreen of the plane had sort of a

2974
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:15,280
windscreen of the plane had sort of a
 

2975
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,630
windscreen of the plane had sort of a
deposit

2976
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:16,640
deposit
 

2977
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,630
deposit
on it so one of the australian

2978
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:18,640
on it so one of the australian
 

2979
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,470
on it so one of the australian
scientists

2980
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:20,480
scientists
 

2981
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,309
scientists
licked it

2982
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:22,319
licked it
 

2983
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,990
licked it
and reported that it was painfully acid

2984
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,000
and reported that it was painfully acid
 

2985
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,870
and reported that it was painfully acid
so that was our first kind of clue that

2986
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
so that was our first kind of clue that
 

2987
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,870
so that was our first kind of clue that
what was being injected into the

2988
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
what was being injected into the
 

2989
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,190
what was being injected into the
stratosphere was sulfur dioxide

2990
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200
stratosphere was sulfur dioxide
 

2991
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,549
stratosphere was sulfur dioxide
so um

2992
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:36,559
so um
 

2993
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,470
so um
and and so we know

2994
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,480
and and so we know
 

2995
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,470
and and so we know
then well pinot tubo came along in the

2996
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:40,480
then well pinot tubo came along in the
 

2997
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,950
then well pinot tubo came along in the
90s and and did this experiment for us

2998
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:42,960
90s and and did this experiment for us
 

2999
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,309
90s and and did this experiment for us
so we know that

3000
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
so we know that
 

3001
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,030
so we know that
sulfur in the in the stratosphere it

3002
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040
sulfur in the in the stratosphere it
 

3003
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,990
sulfur in the in the stratosphere it
forms little uh spherical droplets of

3004
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:50,000
forms little uh spherical droplets of
 

3005
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,990
forms little uh spherical droplets of
sulfuric acid after it combines with

3006
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,000
sulfuric acid after it combines with
 

3007
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,510
sulfuric acid after it combines with
water and

3008
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:53,520
water and
 

3009
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,549
water and
those bounce back some of the sun's rays

3010
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
those bounce back some of the sun's rays
 

3011
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:57,670
those bounce back some of the sun's rays
and

3012
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:57,680
and
 

3013
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,069
and
reduce the amount of solar energy

3014
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
reduce the amount of solar energy
 

3015
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,190
reduce the amount of solar energy
entering

3016
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:01,200
entering
 

3017
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,069
entering
the troposphere which is where we live

3018
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,079
the troposphere which is where we live
 

3019
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,670
the troposphere which is where we live
so um

3020
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:05,680
so um
 

3021
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,270
so um
so we know that it works and we've we

3022
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
so we know that it works and we've we
 

3023
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,910
so we know that it works and we've we
also know that this stuff goes away

3024
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:09,920
also know that this stuff goes away
 

3025
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,150
also know that this stuff goes away
after a couple of years

3026
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,160
after a couple of years
 

3027
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,030
after a couple of years
so it gradually washes out and so it's

3028
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,040
so it gradually washes out and so it's
 

3029
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,030
so it gradually washes out and so it's
not a permanent thing you have to the

3030
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,040
not a permanent thing you have to the
 

3031
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,670
not a permanent thing you have to the
it's the good news bad news is

3032
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
it's the good news bad news is
 

3033
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,789
it's the good news bad news is
um

3034
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
um
 

3035
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,630
um
good news is it's not permanent so if

3036
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:22,640
good news is it's not permanent so if
 

3037
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,309
good news is it's not permanent so if
you don't like

3038
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
you don't like
 

3039
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,309
you don't like
what's happening you can just stop and

3040
00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:26,319
what's happening you can just stop and
 

3041
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:27,910
what's happening you can just stop and
wait a couple years

3042
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:27,920
wait a couple years
 

3043
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,470
wait a couple years
and you'll get back to where you started

3044
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
and you'll get back to where you started
 

3045
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,630
and you'll get back to where you started
and the the bad news if if you're in

3046
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:32,640
and the the bad news if if you're in
 

3047
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,230
and the the bad news if if you're in
favor of this kind of thing is that you

3048
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240
favor of this kind of thing is that you
 

3049
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,829
favor of this kind of thing is that you
have to keep doing it

3050
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:35,839
have to keep doing it
 

3051
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,030
have to keep doing it
forever

3052
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,040
forever
 

3053
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,109
forever
or um

3054
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
or um
 

3055
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,150
or um
so so this guy is one of those

3056
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
so so this guy is one of those
 

3057
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,789
so so this guy is one of those
he's read these papers he under the tr

3058
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:44,799
he's read these papers he under the tr
 

3059
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,950
he's read these papers he under the tr
the character in the book he knows all

3060
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:46,960
the character in the book he knows all
 

3061
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,750
the character in the book he knows all
this

3062
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
this
 

3063
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,829
this
and all all people who

3064
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:49,839
and all all people who
 

3065
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,549
and all all people who
are familiar with climate science are

3066
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:52,559
are familiar with climate science are
 

3067
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,030
are familiar with climate science are
kind of know this it's a pretty well

3068
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
kind of know this it's a pretty well
 

3069
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,870
kind of know this it's a pretty well
established fact

3070
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:56,880
established fact
 

3071
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,789
established fact
and so um

3072
00:56:58,789 --> 00:56:58,799
and so um
 

3073
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,789
and so um
he just decides he's going to take

3074
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:00,799
he just decides he's going to take
 

3075
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,549
he just decides he's going to take
action unilaterally and and do this

3076
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:04,559
action unilaterally and and do this
 

3077
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,510
action unilaterally and and do this
um

3078
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:05,520
um
 

3079
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,710
um
and so

3080
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
and so
 

3081
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,710
and so
there's different ways to get the sulfur

3082
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:08,720
there's different ways to get the sulfur
 

3083
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,630
there's different ways to get the sulfur
up there but because it's texas he

3084
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:10,640
up there but because it's texas he
 

3085
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,190
up there but because it's texas he
builds the biggest gun in the world

3086
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:13,200
builds the biggest gun in the world
 

3087
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,109
builds the biggest gun in the world
he's just six barrels pointed straight

3088
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
he's just six barrels pointed straight
 

3089
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,510
he's just six barrels pointed straight
up and he begins firing shells loaded

3090
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:17,520
up and he begins firing shells loaded
 

3091
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,789
up and he begins firing shells loaded
with sulfur

3092
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:18,799
with sulfur
 

3093
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,190
with sulfur
into the stratosphere and so the book is

3094
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:21,200
into the stratosphere and so the book is
 

3095
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,670
into the stratosphere and so the book is
about not so much that as

3096
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:23,680
about not so much that as
 

3097
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,390
about not so much that as
how people react to his doing that

3098
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:26,400
how people react to his doing that
 

3099
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,349
how people react to his doing that
what the political ramifications are

3100
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:29,359
what the political ramifications are
 

3101
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,870
what the political ramifications are
around the world because

3102
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:30,880
around the world because
 

3103
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,549
around the world because
you know this is a extremely

3104
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:32,559
you know this is a extremely
 

3105
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:33,990
you know this is a extremely
controversial

3106
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,000
controversial
 

3107
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,950
controversial
idea

3108
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:34,960
idea
 

3109
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,349
idea
and not everyone's on board with it

3110
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
and not everyone's on board with it
 

3111
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,670
and not everyone's on board with it
and even if you

3112
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:39,680
and even if you
 

3113
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,990
and even if you
are willing to consider

3114
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:42,000
are willing to consider
 

3115
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,549
are willing to consider
using a technological intervention the

3116
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:44,559
using a technological intervention the
 

3117
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,390
using a technological intervention the
the fact is that it's going to have

3118
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,400
the fact is that it's going to have
 

3119
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,710
the fact is that it's going to have
different effects on different parts of

3120
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
different effects on different parts of
 

3121
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,549
different effects on different parts of
the world so some areas may suffer

uh and they're not going to be happy
so what do you think uh so in in his

00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:01,839
so what do you think uh so in in his
 

3131
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:06,470
so what do you think uh so in in his
case in tr's case he can get around

00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480

 

3133
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,990

you know getting permission from

00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:08,000
you know getting permission from
 

3135
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,710

change where do you think the solution

3144
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,000
change where do you think the solution
 

3145
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,349
change where do you think the solution
will come from governments working

to unilaterally do this
and you know that's not me advocating it

3198
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:17,440
and you know that's not me advocating it
 

3199
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,150

00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:24,390
it's so
it would be comparatively so cheap and

it would be comparatively so cheap and
 

3205
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,630

yeah no i think that's fair so you know
we may be entering one of those

3280
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
we may be entering one of those
 

3281
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,150
we may be entering one of those
interesting times you know of hardship

3282
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:48,160
interesting times you know of hardship
 

3283
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,710
interesting times you know of hardship
in the chinese curse sense yeah

3284
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720
in the chinese curse sense yeah
 

3285
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,390
in the chinese curse sense yeah
so um

3286
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:52,400
so um
 

3287
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,950
so um
um so i could be wrong but i mean there

3288
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:54,960
um so i could be wrong but i mean there
 

3289
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,190
um so i could be wrong but i mean there
have been some efforts to uh

3290
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:57,200
have been some efforts to uh
 

3291
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,470
have been some efforts to uh
explore

3292
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,480
explore
 

3293
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,750
explore
solar geoengineering uh there was a

3294
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:01,760
solar geoengineering uh there was a
 

3295
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,630
solar geoengineering uh there was a
uh

3296
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:02,640
uh
 

3297
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,630
uh
a plan to send up some balloons high

3298
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:04,640
a plan to send up some balloons high
 

3299
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,150
a plan to send up some balloons high
altitude balloons to take some

3300
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:06,160
altitude balloons to take some
 

3301
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,430
altitude balloons to take some
measurements

3302
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:07,440
measurements
 

3303
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,549
measurements
uh

3304
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:08,559
uh
 

3305
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,910
uh
in scandinavia that got um squashed by

3306
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:11,920
in scandinavia that got um squashed by
 

3307
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,230
in scandinavia that got um squashed by
uh objections from people who lived up

3308
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:14,240
uh objections from people who lived up
 

3309
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,030
uh objections from people who lived up
there uh uh who

3310
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:17,040
there uh uh who
 

3311
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,109
there uh uh who
who were just opposed to

3312
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:19,119
who were just opposed to
 

3313
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,670
who were just opposed to
the whole program on on principle

3314
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,680
the whole program on on principle
 

3315
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,549
the whole program on on principle
um so we'll see a lot more of that

3316
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:24,559
um so we'll see a lot more of that
 

3317
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,109
um so we'll see a lot more of that
and it's going to be a hard program to

3318
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:27,119
and it's going to be a hard program to
 

3319
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,309
and it's going to be a hard program to
advocate for just because i think people

3320
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:30,319
advocate for just because i think people
 

3321
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,510
advocate for just because i think people
don't quite understand how much carbon

3322
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:33,520
don't quite understand how much carbon
 

3323
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,150
don't quite understand how much carbon
dioxide is in the atmosphere

3324
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:36,160
dioxide is in the atmosphere
 

3325
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,510
dioxide is in the atmosphere
and how far we are from from even

3326
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:39,520
and how far we are from from even
 

3327
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,670
and how far we are from from even
slowing down

3328
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:41,680
slowing down
 

3329
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,150
slowing down
the rate that we're adding more to say

3330
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:44,160
the rate that we're adding more to say
 

3331
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,670
the rate that we're adding more to say
nothing of

3332
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680
nothing of
 

3333
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,910
nothing of
bringing that number down

3334
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
bringing that number down
 

3335
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,390
bringing that number down
we're a long way out from from that

3336
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:50,400
we're a long way out from from that
 

3337
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,549
we're a long way out from from that
do you see in terms of portfolio of

3338
01:01:52,549 --> 01:01:52,559
do you see in terms of portfolio of
 

3339
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,870
do you see in terms of portfolio of
solutions us becoming a multi-planetary

3340
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:54,880
solutions us becoming a multi-planetary
 

3341
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,630
solutions us becoming a multi-planetary
species as part of that

3342
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
species as part of that
 

3343
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,230
species as part of that
as a as this also being a motivator for

3344
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:00,240
as a as this also being a motivator for
 

3345
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,349
as a as this also being a motivator for
investing some percent

3346
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:03,359
investing some percent
 

3347
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,309
investing some percent
of gdp into becoming a multi-planetary

3348
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:06,319
of gdp into becoming a multi-planetary
 

3349
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:08,549
of gdp into becoming a multi-planetary
species and what percent should that be

3350
01:02:08,549 --> 01:02:08,559
species and what percent should that be
 

3351
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,950
species and what percent should that be
you think you know in an indirect way

3352
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:10,960
you think you know in an indirect way
 

3353
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,029
you think you know in an indirect way
maybe i mean you know what people will

3354
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:13,039
maybe i mean you know what people will
 

3355
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,150
maybe i mean you know what people will
say which is this the same argument that

3356
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:16,160
say which is this the same argument that
 

3357
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,829
say which is this the same argument that
has been leveled against

3358
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:17,839
has been leveled against
 

3359
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,910
has been leveled against
space exploration since the apollo

3360
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:19,920
space exploration since the apollo
 

3361
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,990
space exploration since the apollo
program which is why we solve

3362
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,000
program which is why we solve
 

3363
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,510
program which is why we solve
our problems here on earth before we uh

3364
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,520
our problems here on earth before we uh
 

3365
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,829
our problems here on earth before we uh
spend money going into space so i've

3366
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:27,839
spend money going into space so i've
 

3367
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,470
spend money going into space so i've
never been a believer in that that

3368
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:30,480
never been a believer in that that
 

3369
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,150
never been a believer in that that
argument

3370
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:32,160
argument
 

3371
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,190
argument
i think

3372
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:33,200
i think
 

3373
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,470
i think
um

3374
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
um
 

3375
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,349
um
there could be uh a sense in which the

3376
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:37,359
there could be uh a sense in which the
 

3377
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,589
there could be uh a sense in which the
new perspective that

3378
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
new perspective that
 

3379
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,589
new perspective that
could be obtained by

3380
01:02:41,589 --> 01:02:41,599
could be obtained by
 

3381
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:42,630
could be obtained by
uh

3382
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:42,640
uh
 

3383
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,069
uh
thinking about

3384
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
thinking about
 

3385
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,109
thinking about
like if we're thinking about

3386
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:45,119
like if we're thinking about
 

3387
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,470
like if we're thinking about
terraforming

3388
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:46,480
terraforming
 

3389
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,510
terraforming
mars

3390
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:47,520
mars
 

3391
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,910
mars
changing its atmosphere making it more

3392
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:49,920
changing its atmosphere making it more
 

3393
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,349
changing its atmosphere making it more
amenable to to life and survival

3394
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:53,359
amenable to to life and survival
 

3395
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,870
amenable to to life and survival
um

3396
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:54,880
um
 

3397
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,309
um
you could see that maybe changing

3398
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:56,319
you could see that maybe changing
 

3399
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,470
you could see that maybe changing
people's opinions about terraforming the

3400
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:58,480
people's opinions about terraforming the
 

3401
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,670
people's opinions about terraforming the
earth

3402
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
earth
 

3403
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,710
earth
yeah

3404
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
yeah
 

3405
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,549
yeah
there are some dangerous consequences to

3406
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:02,559
there are some dangerous consequences to
 

3407
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,069
there are some dangerous consequences to
this particular

3408
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
this particular
 

3409
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,589
this particular
uh idea

3410
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:05,599
uh idea
 

3411
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,109
uh idea
of blasting sulfur uh of geoengineering

3412
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119
of blasting sulfur uh of geoengineering
 

3413
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,230
of blasting sulfur uh of geoengineering
um

3414

3415
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,990

what do you make of sort of

01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,000
what do you make of sort of
 

3417
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,109
what do you make of sort of
big bold ideas that have uh

3418
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:17,119
big bold ideas that have uh
 

3419
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,029
big bold ideas that have uh
that are a double-edged sword are all

3420
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:19,039
that are a double-edged sword are all
 

3421

01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,910
they have uh
they have the potential

01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
they have the potential
 

3427
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,630
they have the potential
to have

3435
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,990
consequences
i wouldn't say all i think you know

3436
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
i wouldn't say all i think you know
 

3437

i wouldn't say all i think you know
going back to the

going back to the
 

3439
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,750
going back to the
what we were talking about earlier you

3440
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:39,760
what we were talking about earlier you
 

3441
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,069
what we were talking about earlier you
know how technology developed in the 50s

3442
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
know how technology developed in the 50s
 

3443
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,870
know how technology developed in the 50s
and 60s there was a period of time there

3444
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:44,880
and 60s there was a period of time there
 

3445
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,630
and 60s there was a period of time there
when

3446
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,640
when
 

3447
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,870
when
people maybe had unrealistic ideas about

3448
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:48,880
people maybe had unrealistic ideas about
 

3449
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,750
people maybe had unrealistic ideas about
new technology and weren't sufficiently

3450
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:51,760
new technology and weren't sufficiently
 

3451
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,190
new technology and weren't sufficiently
attentive to

3452
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:53,200
attentive to
 

3453
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,349
attentive to
the possible downsides

3454
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:55,359
the possible downsides
 

3455
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:57,190
the possible downsides
so

3456
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
so
 

3457
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,029
so
so we got um

3458
01:03:59,029 --> 01:03:59,039
so we got um
 

3459
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,349
so we got um
and and there's a reason why i mean uh

3460
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:01,359
and and there's a reason why i mean uh
 

3461
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:02,150
and and there's a reason why i mean uh
the

3462
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:02,160
the
 

3463
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,589
the
the there's

3464
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:03,599
the there's
 

3465
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,390
the there's
you know in in the mid 20th century we

3466
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:06,400
you know in in the mid 20th century we
 

3467
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,950
you know in in the mid 20th century we
saw you know antibiotics we saw the

3468
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
saw you know antibiotics we saw the
 

3469
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,549
saw you know antibiotics we saw the
polio vaccine we saw

3470
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:12,559

 

3471
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,789

just simple things like refrigerators in

3472
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:14,799
just simple things like refrigerators in
 

3473
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,670
just simple things like refrigerators in
the home you know

3474
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:17,680
the home you know
 

3475
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,150
the home you know
my my grandmother to her dying day

3476
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
my my grandmother to her dying day
 

3477
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,950
my my grandmother to her dying day
called the refrigerator the ice box

3478
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:22,960
called the refrigerator the ice box
 

3479
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,190
called the refrigerator the ice box
because when she grew up it was a box

3480
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:25,200
because when she grew up it was a box
 

3481
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,710
because when she grew up it was a box
with ice in it

3482
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:26,720
with ice in it
 

3483
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,270
with ice in it
so you see all that change and it's

3484
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,280
so you see all that change and it's
 

3485
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,510
so you see all that change and it's
largely for the benefit of people and so

3486
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:31,520
largely for the benefit of people and so
 

3487
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,910
largely for the benefit of people and so
if somebody comes along

3488
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:33,920
if somebody comes along
 

3489
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,109
if somebody comes along
and says hey we're going to build

3490
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:35,119
and says hey we're going to build
 

3491
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,270
and says hey we're going to build
nuclear reactors to to make energy or

3492
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,280
nuclear reactors to to make energy or
 

3493
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,029
nuclear reactors to to make energy or
here's a new

3494
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
here's a new
 

3495
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,029
here's a new
chemical called ddt that's going to kill

3496
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:45,039
chemical called ddt that's going to kill
 

3497
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,829
chemical called ddt that's going to kill
mosquitoes then

3498
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:47,839
mosquitoes then
 

3499
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,589
mosquitoes then
it's easy to

3500
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:49,599
it's easy to
 

3501
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,549
it's easy to
to just buy into that and not be alert

3502
01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:52,559
to just buy into that and not be alert
 

3503
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,190
to just buy into that and not be alert
to the possible downsides

3504
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
to the possible downsides
 

3505
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,549
to the possible downsides
and of course we know that um

3506
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
and of course we know that um
 

3507
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,950
and of course we know that um
the the way that those early reactors

3508
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:00,960
the the way that those early reactors
 

3509
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,630
the the way that those early reactors
were built and the way that the the

3510
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
were built and the way that the the
 

3511
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,430
were built and the way that the the
supply chain uh was built

3512
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:05,440
supply chain uh was built
 

3513
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,789
supply chain uh was built
to to create the fuel um

3514
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:08,799
to to create the fuel um
 

3515
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,029
to to create the fuel um
and deal with the the waste

3516
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:11,039
and deal with the the waste
 

3517
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,870
and deal with the the waste
was was poorly

3518
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,880
was was poorly
 

3519
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,789
was was poorly
thought out and uh

3520
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
thought out and uh
 

3521
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,029
thought out and uh
and and we're still dealing with

3522
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:17,039
and and we're still dealing with
 

3523
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,230
and and we're still dealing with
the uh

3524
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:18,240
the uh
 

3525
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,230
the uh
the resulting problems that places like

3526
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,240
the resulting problems that places like
 

3527
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,109
the resulting problems that places like
hanford in in the state of washington

3528
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:23,119
hanford in in the state of washington
 

3529
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,029
hanford in in the state of washington
and we know that

3530
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:25,039
and we know that
 

3531
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,789
and we know that
ddt although it did kill a lot of

3532
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:26,799
ddt although it did kill a lot of
 

3533
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,549
ddt although it did kill a lot of
insects

3534
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
insects
 

3535
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,870
insects
also had terrible effects on bird

3536
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:30,880
also had terrible effects on bird
 

3537
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,789
also had terrible effects on bird
populations

3538
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:32,799
populations
 

3539
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,950
populations
so the the kind of backlash that

3540
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:34,960
so the the kind of backlash that
 

3541
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,589
so the the kind of backlash that
happened in the 70s that's is still kind

3542
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:37,599
happened in the 70s that's is still kind
 

3543
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,150
happened in the 70s that's is still kind
of going on is is to

3544
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:40,160
of going on is is to
 

3545
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,549
of going on is is to
sort of assume that

3546
01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:42,559
sort of assume that
 

3547
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,029
sort of assume that
everything is a double-edged sword and

3548
01:05:45,029 --> 01:05:45,039
everything is a double-edged sword and
 

3549
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,829
everything is a double-edged sword and
always to look for

3550
01:05:47,829 --> 01:05:47,839
always to look for
 

3551
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,910
always to look for
to you know we have to absolutely

3552
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:49,920
to you know we have to absolutely
 

3553
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,510
to you know we have to absolutely
convince ourselves that the the downside

3554
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:53,520
convince ourselves that the the downside
 

3555
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,390
convince ourselves that the the downside
uh isn't going to come back and and bite

3556
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
uh isn't going to come back and and bite
 

3557
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,109
uh isn't going to come back and and bite
us uh before we can adopt any new

3558
01:05:59,109 --> 01:05:59,119
us uh before we can adopt any new
 

3559
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,069
us uh before we can adopt any new
technology and

3560
01:06:02,069 --> 01:06:02,079
technology and
 

3561
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,630
technology and
i i think the the

3562
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:04,640
i i think the the
 

3563
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,990
i i think the the
people um

3564
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:06,000
people um
 

3565
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,670
people um
people are overly

3566
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:07,680
people are overly
 

3567
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,829
people are overly
sensitized to that now

3568
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839
sensitized to that now
 

3569
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,670
sensitized to that now
yeah it's funny depending on the

3570
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:11,680
yeah it's funny depending on the
 

3571
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,789
yeah it's funny depending on the
technology people are a little bit

3572
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:14,799
technology people are a little bit
 

3573
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:17,190
technology people are a little bit
too terrified of certain technologies

3574
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:17,200
too terrified of certain technologies
 

3575
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,230
too terrified of certain technologies
like artificial intelligence is one

3576
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:20,240
like artificial intelligence is one
 

3577
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,109
like artificial intelligence is one
my sense is

3578
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119

 

3579
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,829

that the things that they're afraid of

3580
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:25,839
that the things that they're afraid of
 

3581
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:27,510
that the things that they're afraid of
aren't the things that are likely going

3582
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:27,520
aren't the things that are likely going
 

3583
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,069
aren't the things that are likely going
to happen in terms of negative things

3584
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:30,079
to happen in terms of negative things
 

3585
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,670
to happen in terms of negative things
it's probably impossible to predict

3586
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
it's probably impossible to predict
 

3587
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,309
it's probably impossible to predict
exactly the unintended negative

3588
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:34,319
exactly the unintended negative
 

3589
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,829
exactly the unintended negative
consequences

3590
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839
consequences
 

3591
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,710
consequences
but what's also interesting is for ai as

3592
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:38,720
but what's also interesting is for ai as
 

3593
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,549
but what's also interesting is for ai as
an example

3594
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:40,559
an example
 

3595
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,470
an example
not people don't think enough about the

3596
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480
not people don't think enough about the
 

3597
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,150
not people don't think enough about the
positive things i mean the same is true

3598
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:44,160
positive things i mean the same is true
 

3599
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,029
positive things i mean the same is true
with social media it's very popular now

3600
01:06:47,029 --> 01:06:47,039
with social media it's very popular now
 

3601
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,029
with social media it's very popular now
for some reason to talk about all the

for some reason to talk about all the
 

3603
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,190
for some reason to talk about all the
negative effects of social media we've

3604
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,200
negative effects of social media we've
 

3605
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,309
negative effects of social media we've
immediately forgotten

how

3608

how

how
incredible it is to connect

incredible it is to connect
 

3611
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,910
incredible it is to connect
across the world how there's a there's a

01:06:59,910 --> 01:06:59,920
across the world how there's a there's a
 

3613
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,309
across the world how there's a there's a
deep loneliness within all of us we long

3614
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:02,319
deep loneliness within all of us we long
 

3615
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,470
deep loneliness within all of us we long
to connect and social media at least in

3616
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,480
to connect and social media at least in
 

3617
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,589
to connect and social media at least in
part

3618
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:05,599
part

01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:08,559
enables that even in its current state
 

3621
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,470
enables that even in its current state
and the all the negative things we see

3622
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:10,480
and the all the negative things we see
 

3623
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,390
and the all the negative things we see
with social media

with social media
currently are also in part just

3626
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:14,559
currently are also in part just
 

3627
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,630
currently are also in part just
revealing the basics of human nature it

3628
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,640
revealing the basics of human nature it
 

3629
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,309
revealing the basics of human nature it
didn't make us worse it's just rev is

3630
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:18,319
didn't make us worse it's just rev is
 

3631
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,549
didn't make us worse it's just rev is
bringing it to the surface and step one

3632
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:20,559
bringing it to the surface and step one
 

3633
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,069
bringing it to the surface and step one
of solving a problem is bringing it to

3634
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
of solving a problem is bringing it to
 

3635
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,470
of solving a problem is bringing it to
the surface the fact that we are divisi

3636
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,480
the surface the fact that we are divisi
 

3637
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,910
the surface the fact that we are divisi
there's a division

3638
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
there's a division
 

3639
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,710
there's a division
the fact that there were easily angered

3640
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:28,720
the fact that there were easily angered
 

3641
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,150
the fact that there were easily angered
and upset and all all of that the witch

3642
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:32,160
and upset and all all of that the witch
 

3643
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,309
and upset and all all of that the witch
hunts all those kinds of things that's

3644
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:34,319
hunts all those kinds of things that's
 

3645
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,630
hunts all those kinds of things that's
human nature and it just reveals that

3646
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:36,640
human nature and it just reveals that
 

3647
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,950
human nature and it just reveals that
allowing us to now work on it it's

3648
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:38,960
allowing us to now work on it it's
 

3649
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,630
allowing us to now work on it it's
therapy

3650
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:40,640
therapy
 

3651
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,630
therapy
and so that's another example of a

3652
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:42,640
and so that's another example of a
 

3653
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,710
and so that's another example of a
technology that's just

3654
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:44,720
technology that's just
 

3655
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,430
technology that's just
where we're not considering this the

3656
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,440
where we're not considering this the
 

3657
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,270
where we're not considering this the
positive effects now and in the future

3658
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:49,280
positive effects now and in the future
 

3659
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,190
positive effects now and in the future
enough of

3660
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,200
enough of
 

3661
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,510
enough of
i have to ask about um

3662
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:53,520
i have to ask about um
 

3663
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,870
i have to ask about um
there's a million things i can ask you

3664
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880
there's a million things i can ask you
 

3665
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,029
there's a million things i can ask you
about but virtual reality i got got to

3666
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:57,039
about but virtual reality i got got to
 

3667
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,670
about but virtual reality i got got to
ask you

3668
01:07:59,670 --> 01:07:59,680

 

3669
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,109

you've thought about virtual reality

3670
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,119
you've thought about virtual reality
 

3671
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,789
you've thought about virtual reality
mixed reality

3672
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:02,799
mixed reality
 

3673
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,630
mixed reality
uh

3674
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:04,640
uh
 

3675
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,029
uh
quite a bit what are the

3676
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
quite a bit what are the
 

3677
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,270
quite a bit what are the
interesting trajectories you see for the

3678
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:09,280
interesting trajectories you see for the
 

3679
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,510
interesting trajectories you see for the
proliferation of virtual reality or

3680
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:11,520
proliferation of virtual reality or
 

3681
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,270
proliferation of virtual reality or
mixed reality yeah so i was

3682
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,280
mixed reality yeah so i was
 

3683
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,950
mixed reality yeah so i was
i was in magic leap for

3684
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:16,960
i was in magic leap for
 

3685
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:17,829
i was in magic leap for
what

3686
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:17,839
what
 

3687
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,470
what
five years um with the best title of all

3688
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:20,480
five years um with the best title of all
 

3689
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,829
five years um with the best title of all
time oh

3690
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:21,839
time oh
 

3691
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:25,189
time oh
thanks chief chief futurist yeah yeah

3692
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:25,199
thanks chief chief futurist yeah yeah
 

3693
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,470
thanks chief chief futurist yeah yeah
and so i

3694
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:26,480
and so i
 

3695
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,910
and so i
sort of had a little squad of people in

3696
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:29,920
sort of had a little squad of people in
 

3697
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,430
sort of had a little squad of people in
seattle doing

3698
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,440
seattle doing
 

3699
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,990
seattle doing
what you might call content r d so we're

3700
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
what you might call content r d so we're
 

3701
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,149
what you might call content r d so we're
trying to make content for ar

3702
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:36,159
trying to make content for ar
 

3703
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:39,030
trying to make content for ar
but um

3704
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:39,040
but um
 

3705
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,749
but um
because it's such a new medium uh we

3706
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:41,759
because it's such a new medium uh we
 

3707
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,470
because it's such a new medium uh we
there's it's more of an engineering r d

3708
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:44,480
there's it's more of an engineering r d
 

3709
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,829
there's it's more of an engineering r d
project almost than a than a creative

3710
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:47,839
project almost than a than a creative
 

3711
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,189
project almost than a than a creative
project so

3712
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:49,199
project so
 

3713
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,550
project so
it was fascinating to see

3714
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:52,560
it was fascinating to see
 

3715
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,709
it was fascinating to see
everything that goes into

3716
01:08:54,709 --> 01:08:54,719
everything that goes into
 

3717
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,149
everything that goes into
making

3718
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:56,159
making
 

3719
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:57,269
making
an ar

3720
01:08:57,269 --> 01:08:57,279
an ar
 

3721
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:58,630
an ar
system

3722
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:58,640
system
 

3723
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,470
system
that runs

3724
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:00,480
that runs
 

3725
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,390
that runs
so ar

3726
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:02,400
so ar
 

3727
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,829
so ar
an ar device if it's really going to do

3728
01:09:05,829 --> 01:09:05,839
an ar device if it's really going to do
 

3729
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:07,510
an ar device if it's really going to do
needs to be running

3730
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
needs to be running
 

3731
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,590
needs to be running
slam in real time

3732
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
slam in real time
 

3733
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,229
slam in real time
and that alone is a big as so for people

3734
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:12,239
and that alone is a big as so for people
 

3735
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:14,070
and that alone is a big as so for people
who don't know first of all virtual

3736
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:14,080
who don't know first of all virtual

is

3740
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:16,880
is
 

3741
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,269
is
creating a almost fully artificial world

3742
01:09:19,269 --> 01:09:19,279
creating a almost fully artificial world
 

3743
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,110
creating a almost fully artificial world
and putting you inside it augmented

3744
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:21,120
and putting you inside it augmented
 

3745
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,269
and putting you inside it augmented
reality ar

3746
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:23,279
reality ar
 

3747
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,269
reality ar
is taking the real world

3748
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
is taking the real world
 

3749
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,110
is taking the real world
and putting top on top

3750
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:27,120
and putting top on top
 

3751
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,510
and putting top on top
putting stuff on top of that real world

3752
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:29,520
putting stuff on top of that real world
 

3753
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,669
putting stuff on top of that real world
and when you say slam that means in real

3754
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:31,679
and when you say slam that means in real
 

3755
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,390
and when you say slam that means in real
time the device needs to be able to

01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
time the device needs to be able to
 

3757
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,910

sense

3758
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:35,920
sense
 

3759
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,990
sense
accurately detect everything about that

3760
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:38,000
accurately detect everything about that
 

3761
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,749
accurately detect everything about that
world sufficiently

3762
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:39,759
world sufficiently
 

3763
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,669
world sufficiently
to be able to reconstruct

01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:41,679
to be able to reconstruct
 

3765
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,990
to be able to reconstruct
the the 3d

3766
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:44,000
the the 3d
 

3767
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,990
the the 3d
uh structure of it so you can put stuff

3768
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:46,000
uh structure of it so you can put stuff
 

3769
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,510
uh structure of it so you can put stuff
on top of it and doing that in real time

3770
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:49,520
on top of it and doing that in real time
 

3771
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,590
on top of it and doing that in real time
presumably not just real time but in a

3772
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
presumably not just real time but in a
 

3773
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,550
presumably not just real time but in a
way that's creates a pleasant experience

01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:54,560
way that's creates a pleasant experience
 

3775
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,870
way that's creates a pleasant experience
for the human perception system

3776
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:56,880
for the human perception system
 

3777
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,149
for the human perception system
is uh

3778
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:58,159
is uh
 

3779
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,990
is uh
yeah that's a that's an engineering

3780
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:00,000
yeah that's a that's an engineering
 

3781
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,590
yeah that's a that's an engineering
project

3782
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:01,600
project
 

3783
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,910
project
right yeah will said and it's just one

3784
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
right yeah will said and it's just one
 

3785
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,830
right yeah will said and it's just one
of the things that

3786
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:05,840
of the things that
 

3787
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,390
of the things that
the system has to do it's also tracking

3788
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:08,400
the system has to do it's also tracking
 

3789
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,510
the system has to do it's also tracking
your eyes

3790
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:09,520
your eyes
 

3791
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,590
your eyes
so it knows what you're looking at uh

3792
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:11,600
so it knows what you're looking at uh
 

3793
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,030
so it knows what you're looking at uh
how far away

3794
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,040
how far away
 

3795
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,590
how far away
what you're looking at is

3796
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
what you're looking at is
 

3797
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,189
what you're looking at is
it's uh

3798
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:17,199
it's uh
 

3799
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:18,470
it's uh
um

3800
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480
um
 

3801
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,110
um
it's performing all those functions um

3802
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:21,120
it's performing all those functions um
 

3803
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,189
it's performing all those functions um
and it's gotta uh

3804
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
and it's gotta uh
 

3805
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,510
and it's gotta uh
keep doing that without you know

3806
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:25,520
keep doing that without you know
 

3807
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,790
keep doing that without you know
burning up the

3808
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:26,800
burning up the

01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,990
and then any content that you want to
add has to sit on top of that it's got

01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,080
at a sufficiently low latency that
 

3827
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,470
at a sufficiently low latency that
it looks real and you don't get sick so

3828
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:52,480
it looks real and you don't get sick so
 

3829
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,550
it looks real and you don't get sick so
it's an amazing thing and

3830
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,560
it's an amazing thing and
 

3831
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,149
it's an amazing thing and
you know magically shipped a device that

3832
01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:58,159
you know magically shipped a device that
 

3833
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:02,229
you know magically shipped a device that
can do that in 2019

3834
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:02,239
can do that in 2019
 

3835
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,750
can do that in 2019
and they're about to ship the ml2

3836
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:05,760
and they're about to ship the ml2
 

3837
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,350
and they're about to ship the ml2
but i don't know any more about that

3838
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:07,360
but i don't know any more about that
 

3839
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,669
but i don't know any more about that
than anyone else because i don't work

3840
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:09,679
than anyone else because i don't work
 

3841
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:10,870
than anyone else because i don't work
there anymore

3842
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:10,880
there anymore
 

3843
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,550
there anymore
um does it still ins to some degree boil

3844
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:14,560
um does it still ins to some degree boil
 

3845
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,669
um does it still ins to some degree boil
down to

3846
01:11:15,669 --> 01:11:15,679
down to
 

3847
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,750
down to
a killer app

3848
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:17,760
a killer app
 

3849
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,990
a killer app
a content question like you said it's

3850
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:20,000
a content question like you said it's
 

3851
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,990
a content question like you said it's
kind of a wide open space nobody knows

3852
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,000
kind of a wide open space nobody knows
 

3853
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,189
kind of a wide open space nobody knows
exactly what's going to be the

3854
01:11:23,189 --> 01:11:23,199
exactly what's going to be the
 

3855
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:25,110
exactly what's going to be the
compelling thing yeah

3856
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,120
compelling thing yeah
 

3857
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,790
compelling thing yeah
so doesn't a super compelling experience

3858
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:28,800
so doesn't a super compelling experience
 

3859
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,630
so doesn't a super compelling experience
of some sort

3860
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:30,640
of some sort
 

3861
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,709
of some sort
alleviate some of the

3862
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:32,719
alleviate some of the
 

3863
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,990
alleviate some of the
need for engineering perfection

3864
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
need for engineering perfection
 

3865
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,390
need for engineering perfection
well there's a base layer of engineering

3866
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:38,400
well there's a base layer of engineering
 

3867
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,430
well there's a base layer of engineering
that you have to have no matter what

3868
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:41,440
that you have to have no matter what
 

3869
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,910
that you have to have no matter what
but you're certainly right that people

3870
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:43,920
but you're certainly right that people
 

3871
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,990
but you're certainly right that people
like in the early days of video games

3872
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,000
like in the early days of video games
 

3873
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,350
like in the early days of video games
put up with

3874
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:47,360
put up with
 

3875
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,910
put up with
kind of low frame rate and what we would

3876
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
kind of low frame rate and what we would
 

3877
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,550
kind of low frame rate and what we would
now call crappy graphics because they

3878
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
now call crappy graphics because they
 

3879
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,950
now call crappy graphics because they
were having so much fun playing doom or

3880
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:54,960
were having so much fun playing doom or
 

3881
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,430
were having so much fun playing doom or
whatever even tetris yeah yeah so um

3882
01:11:59,430 --> 01:11:59,440
whatever even tetris yeah yeah so um
 

3883
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,550
whatever even tetris yeah yeah so um
so for sure that's true and so

3884
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:02,560
so for sure that's true and so
 

3885
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,669
so for sure that's true and so
um

3886
01:12:03,669 --> 01:12:03,679
um
 

3887
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:04,950
um
you know

01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:04,960
you know
 

3889
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:05,910
you know
i was

3890
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:05,920
i was

uh
 

3893
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,030
uh
working on consumer-facing content um

3894
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
working on consumer-facing content um
 

3895
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,790
working on consumer-facing content um
there was a great team in

3896
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:12,800
there was a great team in
 

3897
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,870
there was a great team in
wellington new zealand that that made a

3898
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:14,880
wellington new zealand that that made a
 

3899
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,070
wellington new zealand that that made a
game uh called uh dr groybrot's uh

3900
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,080
game uh called uh dr groybrot's uh
 

3901
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,669
game uh called uh dr groybrot's uh
invaders that

3902
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
invaders that
 

3903
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,030
invaders that
um

3904
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
um
 

3905
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,669
um
that uh

3906
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:23,679
that uh
 

3907
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,870
that uh
realized the the potential of ar gaming

3908
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:26,880
realized the the potential of ar gaming
 

3909
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,310
realized the the potential of ar gaming
in a way that i don't think anything

3910
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
in a way that i don't think anything
 

3911
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,830
in a way that i don't think anything
else has

3912
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:29,840
else has
 

3913
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,030
else has
uh before or since um

3914
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
uh before or since um
 

3915
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,310
uh before or since um
and um

3916
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,320
and um
 

3917
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,750
and um
so that was definitely the strategy um

3918
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:37,760
so that was definitely the strategy um
 

3919
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,110
so that was definitely the strategy um
until uh

3920
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
until uh
 

3921
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,510
until uh
what april

3922
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:40,520
what april
 

3923
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:44,149
what april
2020 which is when the company decided

3924
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
2020 which is when the company decided
 

3925
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,350
2020 which is when the company decided
to

3926
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
to
 

3927
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,149
to
pivot to commercial industrial

3928
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
pivot to commercial industrial
 

3929
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,110
pivot to commercial industrial
applications instead um

3930
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:51,120
applications instead um
 

3931
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,950
applications instead um
so um

3932
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:52,960
so um
 

3933
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,630
so um
and

3934
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:54,640
and
 

3935
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,510
and
you know i

3936
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:55,520
you know i

01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,669
you know i
i haven't seen their their

01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
i haven't seen their their
 

3939
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,430
i haven't seen their their
their financial projections but i

3940
01:12:59,430 --> 01:12:59,440
their financial projections but i
 

3941
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,510
their financial projections but i
assumed they had good reasons for

3942
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,520
assumed they had good reasons for
 

3943
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,830
assumed they had good reasons for
for making that

3944
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:02,840
for making that
 

3945
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,669
for making that
strategic decision um

3946
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:05,679
strategic decision um
 

3947
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,990
strategic decision um
it just means that it's no longer

3948
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:08,000
it just means that it's no longer
 

3949
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,030
it just means that it's no longer
uh necessarily targeted at

3950
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:11,040
uh necessarily targeted at
 

3951
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,110
uh necessarily targeted at
at just end users who want to play a

3952
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:13,120
at just end users who want to play a
 

3953
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,070
at just end users who want to play a
game or or be entertained but it's

3954
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:16,080
game or or be entertained but it's
 

3955
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,790
game or or be entertained but it's
you know that to me from a sort of a

3956
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:18,800
you know that to me from a sort of a
 

3957
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,189
you know that to me from a sort of a
dreamer futurist perspective is

3958
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:21,199
dreamer futurist perspective is
 

3959
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,430
dreamer futurist perspective is
heartbreaking because i i i don't know

3960
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:23,440
heartbreaking because i i i don't know
 

3961
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,110
heartbreaking because i i i don't know
necessarily from

3962
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:25,120
necessarily from
 

3963
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,590
necessarily from
in the vr space but i see this kind of

3964
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:27,600
in the vr space but i see this kind of
 

3965
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,550
in the vr space but i see this kind of
thing

3966
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
thing
 

3967
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,430
thing
with uh with robotics

3968
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:31,440
with uh with robotics
 

3969
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,390
with uh with robotics
where

3970
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:32,400
where
 

3971
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,350
where
to me

3972
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:33,360
to me
 

3973
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,830
to me
the future of robotics is consumer

3974
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:35,840
the future of robotics is consumer
 

3975
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,590
the future of robotics is consumer
facing

3976
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:37,600
facing
 

3977
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,790
facing
and a lot of great roboticists boston

3978
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:40,800
and a lot of great roboticists boston

dynamics and
 

3981
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,030

companies like that are focused on
 

3983
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,910
companies like that are focused on
sort of industrial applications yeah

3984
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:47,920
sort of industrial applications yeah
 

3985
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,229
sort of industrial applications yeah
because for financial business reasons

3986
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:50,239
because for financial business reasons
 

3987
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,630
because for financial business reasons
yeah now i i can see the parallels for

3988
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:52,640
yeah now i i can see the parallels for
 

3989
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,510
yeah now i i can see the parallels for
sure

3990
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:53,520
sure
 

3991
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,229
sure
you know we'll see it was a fun uh

3992
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:56,239
you know we'll see it was a fun uh
 

3993
01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:00,310
you know we'll see it was a fun uh
project you know we uh

3994
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:00,320
project you know we uh
 

3995
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,910
project you know we uh
we worked on um

3996
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:01,920
we worked on um
 

3997
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,910
we worked on um
an app for example called baby goats

3998
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:03,920
an app for example called baby goats
 

3999
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,390
an app for example called baby goats
which just populated your room with

4000
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
which just populated your room with
 

4001
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,149
which just populated your room with
with baby goats that seemed like a

4002
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:08,159
with baby goats that seemed like a
 

4003
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,070
with baby goats that seemed like a
killer app right there well

4004
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080
killer app right there well
 

4005
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,390
killer app right there well
we we thought highly of the of the idea

4006
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:12,400
we we thought highly of the of the idea
 

4007
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,390
we we thought highly of the of the idea
for sure yes um so

4008
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
for sure yes um so
 

4009
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,630
for sure yes um so
but because of the slam

4010
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:16,640
but because of the slam
 

4011
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,990
but because of the slam
uh the

4012
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
uh the
 

4013
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,270
uh the
the um

4014
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:19,280
the um
 

4015
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,430
the um
the system knew for example here's a

4016
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
the system knew for example here's a
 

4017
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,070
the system knew for example here's a
table here's a little end table

4018
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
table here's a little end table
 

4019
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,750
table here's a little end table
we know the heights

4020
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:25,760
we know the heights
 

4021
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,550
we know the heights
uh we know how high our animated baby

4022
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:28,560
uh we know how high our animated baby
 

4023
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,990
uh we know how high our animated baby
goat can jump

4024
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
goat can jump
 

4025
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,870
goat can jump
um

4026
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,880
um
 

4027
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,790
um
and so um

4028
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:32,800
and so um
 

4029
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,790
and so um
so our engineers had to to build a

4030
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
so our engineers had to to build a
 

4031
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,030
so our engineers had to to build a
system for converting the slam

4032
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,040
system for converting the slam
 

4033
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,030
system for converting the slam
primitives into um

4034
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
primitives into um
 

4035
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,030
primitives into um
game engine objects um that that the uh

4036
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:43,040
game engine objects um that that the uh
 

4037
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:43,830
game engine objects um that that the uh
the

4038
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:43,840
the
 

4039
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,990
the
game uh the ai's in the game could

4040
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:46,000
game uh the ai's in the game could
 

4041
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,870
game uh the ai's in the game could
navigate around um

4042
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:48,880
navigate around um
 

4043
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,030
navigate around um
so um and that ended up shipping as more

4044
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
so um and that ended up shipping as more
 

4045
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,229
so um and that ended up shipping as more
of a dev kit or a sort of how-to a

4046
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:54,239
of a dev kit or a sort of how-to a
 

4047
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,350
of a dev kit or a sort of how-to a
sample app than as a

4048
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:57,360
sample app than as a
 

4049
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,550
sample app than as a
a finished

4050
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,560
a finished
 

4051
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,070
a finished
consumer facing

4052
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:00,080
consumer facing
 

4053
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,390
consumer facing
you mean the baby goat ai

4054
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
you mean the baby goat ai
 

4055
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,669
you mean the baby goat ai
yeah yeah

4056
01:15:03,669 --> 01:15:03,679
yeah yeah
 

4057
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,470
yeah yeah
i that seems to me like a world

4058
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:06,480
i that seems to me like a world
 

4059
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,350
i that seems to me like a world
i couldn't entertain myself for hours

4060
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:09,360
i couldn't entertain myself for hours
 

4061
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,310
i couldn't entertain myself for hours
just every day coming home to to to to

4062
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:12,320
just every day coming home to to to to
 

4063
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,270
just every day coming home to to to to
see if baby goes yeah i mean it was an

4064
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:15,280
see if baby goes yeah i mean it was an
 

4065
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,310
see if baby goes yeah i mean it was an
ambient

4066
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
ambient
 

4067
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,229
ambient
kind of it's not it's not a thing that

4068
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:18,239
kind of it's not it's not a thing that
 

4069
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,709
kind of it's not it's not a thing that
you would sit there and play like a a

4070
01:15:20,709 --> 01:15:20,719
you would sit there and play like a a
 

4071
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:23,510
you would sit there and play like a a
video just life yeah yeah but now this

4072
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:23,520
video just life yeah yeah but now this
 

4073
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,830
video just life yeah yeah but now this
baby goes you i mean what's the purpose

4074
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:25,840
baby goes you i mean what's the purpose
 

4075
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,830
baby goes you i mean what's the purpose
of having dogs and cats right in your

4076
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
of having dogs and cats right in your
 

4077
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,630

and you can go and play fetch or
 

4085
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,430
and you can go and play fetch or
something for a while if you want but

4086
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
something for a while if you want but
 

4087
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,229
something for a while if you want but
you don't have to right yeah

4088
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:40,239
you don't have to right yeah
 

4089

you don't have to right yeah
so uh

4090
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:42,239
so uh
 

4091
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,630
so uh
so we worked on that in a bigger

4092
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:44,640
so we worked on that in a bigger
 

4093
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,790
so we worked on that in a bigger
project that was more of a

4094
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:46,800
project that was more of a
 

4095
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,430
project that was more of a
storytelling in a fictional

4096
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,440
storytelling in a fictional
 

4097
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,550
storytelling in a fictional
universe

4098
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:50,560
universe
 

4099
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,470
universe
the hardware is worth a look there's

4100
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:52,480
the hardware is worth a look there's
 

4101
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,270
the hardware is worth a look there's

01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,709
sudden became really bad for some reason
like you're trying to escape it yeah but

4266
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:06,719
like you're trying to escape it yeah but
 

4267
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,390
like you're trying to escape it yeah but
like literally

4268
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
like literally
 

4269
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,510
like literally
it's just more enriching in the same way

4270
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,520
it's just more enriching in the same way
 

4271
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,910
it's just more enriching in the same way
like there's a glimmer in your eye when

4272
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:13,920
like there's a glimmer in your eye when
 

4273
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,950
like there's a glimmer in your eye when
you said you enjoy the physical world

4274
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:16,960
you said you enjoy the physical world
 

4275
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,270
you said you enjoy the physical world
like uh double up on that glimmer for

4276
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:19,280
like uh double up on that glimmer for
 

4277
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,070
like uh double up on that glimmer for
the

4278

the
 

4279
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,830
the
for the virtual reality can you imagine

4280
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:21,840
for the virtual reality can you imagine
 

4281
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,189
for the virtual reality can you imagine
such a world well like i'll give maybe

4282
01:19:25,189 --> 01:19:25,199
such a world well like i'll give maybe
 

4283
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,270
such a world well like i'll give maybe
an example that's a bridge which is that

4284
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:27,280
an example that's a bridge which is that
 

4285
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,709
an example that's a bridge which is that
i've been um i like making things um

4286
01:19:30,709 --> 01:19:30,719
i've been um i like making things um
 

4287
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:33,430
i've been um i like making things um
so i like working in a machine shop and

4288
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:33,440
so i like working in a machine shop and
 

4289
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,550
so i like working in a machine shop and
and making objects with 3d printers or

4290
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:36,560
and making objects with 3d printers or
 

4291
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,390
and making objects with 3d printers or
machines or whatever and

4292
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:38,400
machines or whatever and
 

4293
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,590
machines or whatever and
so i've had to learn how to get good at

4294
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:41,600
so i've had to learn how to get good at
 

4295
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,390
so i've had to learn how to get good at
using a cad program

4296
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:44,400
using a cad program
 

4297
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,790
using a cad program
you know there's many to choose from

4298
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:46,800
you know there's many to choose from
 

4299
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,790
you know there's many to choose from
i use one called fusion 360.

4300
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:50,800
i use one called fusion 360.
 

4301
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,390
i use one called fusion 360.
and

4302
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:52,400
and
 

4303
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,110
and
i can spend hours

4304
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,120
i can spend hours
 

4305
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,270
i can spend hours
in that

4306
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,280
in that
 

4307
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,790
in that
trying to create

4308
01:19:58,790 --> 01:19:58,800
trying to create
 

4309
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,709

imagine and create the things i want to
 

4311
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,950
imagine and create the things i want to
create and it's a

4312
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:02,960
create and it's a
 

4313
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,510
create and it's a
it's not virtual reality exactly but

4314
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:05,520
it's not virtual reality exactly but
 

4315
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,669
it's not virtual reality exactly but
that whole time

4316
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
that whole time
 

4317
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,950
that whole time
i'm you know my whole field of view

4318
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:10,960
i'm you know my whole field of view
 

4319
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,950
i'm you know my whole field of view
is occupied by

4320
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:12,960
is occupied by
 

4321
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,910
is occupied by
uh by this monitor that's showing me a

4322
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:15,920
uh by this monitor that's showing me a
 

4323
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,910
uh by this monitor that's showing me a
window into a three-dimensional space

4324
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:17,920
window into a three-dimensional space
 

4325
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,310

i'm rotating things around i'm

4326
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:20,320
i'm rotating things around i'm
 

4327
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,750
i'm rotating things around i'm
i'm

01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:21,760
i'm

01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,590
i'm
i'm imagining things i'm making things

4331
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,390
i'm imagining things i'm making things
and so that is um you know pretty close

4332
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:26,400
and so that is um you know pretty close
 

4333
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,430
and so that is um you know pretty close
to

4334
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
to
 

4335
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,709
to
um

4336
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:28,719
um
 

4337
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:31,510
um
to to being in virtual reality does that

4338
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:31,520
to to being in virtual reality does that
 

4339
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,110
to to being in virtual reality does that
thing have to exist for you to

4340
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:33,120
thing have to exist for you to
 

4341
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,590
thing have to exist for you to
experience true joy can you stay in

4342
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
experience true joy can you stay in
 

4343
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,189
experience true joy can you stay in
fusion 360

4344
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:37,199
fusion 360
 

4345
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,669
fusion 360
the whole time do you have to 3d print

4346
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:39,679
the whole time do you have to 3d print
 

4347
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:40,470
the whole time do you have to 3d print
it

4348
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:40,480
it
 

4349
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,510
it
and touch it yeah i mean uh that's my

4350
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:43,520
and touch it yeah i mean uh that's my
 

4351
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,149
and touch it yeah i mean uh that's my
game that's that's what i'm up to but

4352
01:20:46,149 --> 01:20:46,159
game that's that's what i'm up to but
 

4353
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:48,310
game that's that's what i'm up to but
you know it happens that um

4354
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
you know it happens that um
 

4355
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,830
you know it happens that um
if you're building

4356
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:49,840
if you're building
 

4357
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,189
if you're building
a virtual environment if you're uh

4358
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:53,199
a virtual environment if you're uh
 

4359
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,270
a virtual environment if you're uh
making a game level or creating a

4360
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:55,280
making a game level or creating a
 

4361
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,629
making a game level or creating a
virtual set for a film or tv production

4362
01:20:58,629 --> 01:20:58,639
virtual set for a film or tv production
 

4363
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,310
virtual set for a film or tv production
the thing that you're designing in the

4364
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,320
the thing that you're designing in the
 

4365
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,430
the thing that you're designing in the
program may never physically exist

4366
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:03,440
program may never physically exist
 

4367
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,229
program may never physically exist
uh

4368
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:04,239
uh
 

4369
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,149
uh
and in fact it's preferable that it

4370
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:06,159
and in fact it's preferable that it
 

4371
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:09,030
and in fact it's preferable that it
doesn't because the whole point of that

4372
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,040
doesn't because the whole point of that
 

4373
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,870
doesn't because the whole point of that
is to um

4374
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:10,880
is to um
 

4375
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,550
is to um
is to to make imaginary things that

4376
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,560
is to to make imaginary things that
 

4377
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,830
is to to make imaginary things that
you couldn't

4378
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
you couldn't
 

4379
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,669
you couldn't
couldn't build otherwise

4380
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:17,679
couldn't build otherwise
 

4381
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,830
couldn't build otherwise
so i think lots of people spend a good

4382
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:19,840
so i think lots of people spend a good
 

4383
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,270
so i think lots of people spend a good
chunk of their working

4384
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:21,280
chunk of their working
 

4385
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,590

it's just that currently the output

it's just that currently the output
 

4393
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,870
it's just that currently the output

you could replace that with a vr headset

01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:35,440
you could replace that with a vr headset
 

4401
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,709
you could replace that with a vr headset
and they'd be doing the same stuff

01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,590
it's one way
but you get to learn about the person

in terms of imagination
 

4459
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,430
in terms of imagination
like that it creates a very

4460
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440

like in my example of of using the cad
 

4539
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,350
like in my example of of using the cad
program

4540
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:09,360
program
 

4541
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,669
program
it gives me the ability to do something

4542
01:24:11,669 --> 01:24:11,679
it gives me the ability to do something
 

4543
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,430
it gives me the ability to do something
i enjoy

4544
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:13,440
i enjoy
 

4545
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,790
i enjoy
which is making

4546
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:14,800
which is making
 

4547
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,030
which is making
imagining things and making things in a

4548
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,040
imagining things and making things in a
 

4549
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,110
imagining things and making things in a
particular way but can we psychoanalyze

4550
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:19,120
particular way but can we psychoanalyze
 

4551
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,270
particular way but can we psychoanalyze
you for a second sure

4552
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:21,280
you for a second sure
 

4553
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,070
you for a second sure
what exactly do you enjoy is there some

4554

what exactly do you enjoy is there some
 

4555
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,350
what exactly do you enjoy is there some
component

4556
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:25,360
component
 

4557
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,430
component
of you building the thing

4558
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,440
of you building the thing
 

4559
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,590
of you building the thing
where you get to at least a little bit

4560
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:29,600
where you get to at least a little bit
 

4561
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,070
where you get to at least a little bit
share with others

4562
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:32,080
share with others
 

4563
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,910
share with others
like is there a human in the loop

4564
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:33,920
like is there a human in the loop
 

4565
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,189
like is there a human in the loop
outside of you in that picture

4566
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:37,199
outside of you in that picture
 

4567
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,830
outside of you in that picture
will anyone ever see it

4568
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:39,840
will anyone ever see it
 

4569
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,629
will anyone ever see it
right

4570
01:24:40,629 --> 01:24:40,639
right
 

4571
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,629
right
yeah there's a source of your enjoyment

4572
01:24:42,629 --> 01:24:42,639
yeah there's a source of your enjoyment
 

4573
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,110
yeah there's a source of your enjoyment
because i would argue that

4574
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:45,120
because i would argue that
 

4575
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,470
because i would argue that
perhaps

4576
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:46,480
perhaps
 

4577
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,709
perhaps
when like the the turtles all the way

4578
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
when like the the turtles all the way
 

4579
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,470
when like the the turtles all the way
down when you get to the bottom turtle

4580
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:50,480
down when you get to the bottom turtle
 

4581
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,709
down when you get to the bottom turtle
it has to do with other sharing with

4582
01:24:52,709 --> 01:24:52,719
it has to do with other sharing with
 

4583
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:54,550
it has to do with other sharing with
other humans yeah and if you can then

4584
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:54,560
other humans yeah and if you can then
 

4585
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,149
other humans yeah and if you can then
put those humans

4586
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:56,159
put those humans
 

4587
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:58,550
put those humans
inside the vr world

4588
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:58,560
inside the vr world
 

4589
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,709
inside the vr world
then then you start to

4590
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:00,719
then then you start to
 

4591
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,030
then then you start to
then then you can okay for example you

4592
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:03,040
then then you can okay for example you
 

4593
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,189
then then you can okay for example you
could do it in the physical world

4594
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:05,199
could do it in the physical world
 

4595
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,550
could do it in the physical world
the the 3d printing but you share it in

4596
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:08,560
the the 3d printing but you share it in
 

4597
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,390
the the 3d printing but you share it in
in in the virtual world and that's where

4598
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:10,400
in in the virtual world and that's where
 

4599
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,189
in in the virtual world and that's where
the source of happiness is i think

4600
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:13,199
the source of happiness is i think
 

4601
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,910
the source of happiness is i think
at least speaking for myself i'm always

4602
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:15,920
at least speaking for myself i'm always
 

4603
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,470
at least speaking for myself i'm always
thinking in terms of an audience and

4604
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:18,480
thinking in terms of an audience and
 

4605
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,790
thinking in terms of an audience and
at some level i feel like i'm i'm doing

4606
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:20,800
at some level i feel like i'm i'm doing
 

4607
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,669
at some level i feel like i'm i'm doing
this for someone or communicating

4608
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:23,679
this for someone or communicating
 

4609
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,350
this for someone or communicating
to someone even if there's not a

4610
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:25,360
to someone even if there's not a
 

4611
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,830
to someone even if there's not a
specific someone in mind

4612
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:27,840
specific someone in mind
 

4613
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,709
specific someone in mind
it could just be an abstract theoretical

4614
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:30,719
it could just be an abstract theoretical
 

4615
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:31,910
it could just be an abstract theoretical
someone

4616
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:31,920
someone
 

4617
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,110
someone
um

4618
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:33,120
um
 

4619
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,189
um
and it's like another app i spend a lot

4620
01:25:35,189 --> 01:25:35,199
and it's like another app i spend a lot
 

4621
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:38,310
and it's like another app i spend a lot
of time in is mathematica okay and when

4622
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,320
of time in is mathematica okay and when
 

4623
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,510
of time in is mathematica okay and when
i do particular

4624
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:39,520
i do particular
 

4625
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,070
i do particular
yeah yeah and when i do a mathematica

4626
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:42,080
yeah yeah and when i do a mathematica
 

4627
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,350
yeah yeah and when i do a mathematica
notebook if i'm trying to figure

4628
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:43,360
notebook if i'm trying to figure
 

4629
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,950
notebook if i'm trying to figure
something out i spend a lot of time

4630
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:44,960
something out i spend a lot of time
 

4631
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,990
something out i spend a lot of time
typing

just

4634
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:47,440
just
 

4635
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,990
just
my stuff is just a huge blocks of of

01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:53,120
text just me thinking out loud and then
 

4639
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,790

some graphs and calculations and stuff

4640
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:56,800
some graphs and calculations and stuff
 

4641
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,110
some graphs and calculations and stuff
because to me

4642
01:25:59,110 --> 01:25:59,120
because to me
 

4643
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,910
because to me
that act of of explaining

4644
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:01,920
that act of of explaining
 

4645
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,030
that act of of explaining
things and commenting

4646
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,040
things and commenting
 

4647
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,270
things and commenting
helps me understand what i'm doing and

4648
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:07,280
helps me understand what i'm doing and
 

4649
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,750
helps me understand what i'm doing and
there's kind of an audience uh an

4650
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:09,760
there's kind of an audience uh an
 

4651
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,390
there's kind of an audience uh an
amorphous audience in your mind yeah

4652
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:12,400
amorphous audience in your mind yeah
 

4653
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,470
amorphous audience in your mind yeah
like i mean most of this stuff nobody

4654
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:14,480
like i mean most of this stuff nobody
 

4655
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,550
like i mean most of this stuff nobody
will ever see and yet

4656
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:16,560
will ever see and yet
 

4657
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,950
will ever see and yet
i'm creating it as if there were an

4658
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:18,960
i'm creating it as if there were an
 

4659
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,750
i'm creating it as if there were an
audience that might read this stuff

4660
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:21,760
audience that might read this stuff
 

4661
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,590
audience that might read this stuff
because that i have to that's a

4662
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:23,600
because that i have to that's a
 

4663
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,110
because that i have to that's a
necessary constraint that helps me

4664
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:27,120
necessary constraint that helps me
 

4665
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,590
necessary constraint that helps me
um do a better job

4666
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,600
um do a better job
 

4667
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,270
um do a better job
what's the uh

4668
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:31,280
what's the uh
 

4669
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,270
what's the uh
this might be tricky question to answer

4670
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:33,280
this might be tricky question to answer
 

4671
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,669
this might be tricky question to answer
what's uh comes to mind as a

4672
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
what's uh comes to mind as a
 

4673
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,350
what's uh comes to mind as a
particularly beautiful thing that you're

4674
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:37,360
particularly beautiful thing that you're
 

4675
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,629
particularly beautiful thing that you're
proud of that you create inside

4676
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:38,639
proud of that you create inside
 

4677
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:40,030
proud of that you create inside
mathematica

4678
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:40,040
mathematica
 

4679
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,070
mathematica
visualization-wise or

4680
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:42,080
visualization-wise or
 

4681
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,149
visualization-wise or
uh something that just comes to memory

4682
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:44,159
uh something that just comes to memory
 

4683
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:47,110
uh something that just comes to memory
if it's possible to retrieve

4684
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:47,120
if it's possible to retrieve
 

4685
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,149
if it's possible to retrieve
so

4686
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:48,159
so
 

4687
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,950
so
the the thing i've spent the most

4688
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:50,960
the the thing i've spent the most
 

4689
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,709
the the thing i've spent the most
amount of time on

4690
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:52,719
amount of time on
 

4691
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:55,750
amount of time on
is i got obsessed um

4692
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:55,760
is i got obsessed um
 

4693
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,830
is i got obsessed um
a long time ago

4694
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:57,840
a long time ago
 

4695
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,669
a long time ago
was trying to tile

4696
01:26:59,669 --> 01:26:59,679
was trying to tile
 

4697
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:02,550
was trying to tile
the globe with hexagons yes

4698
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:02,560
the globe with hexagons yes
 

4699
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,669
the globe with hexagons yes
and um or actual globe

4700
01:27:05,669 --> 01:27:05,679
and um or actual globe
 

4701
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,990
and um or actual globe
well any spherical and

4702
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,000
well any spherical and
 

4703
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,149
well any spherical and
object yeah but but with an eye towards

4704
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:10,159
object yeah but but with an eye towards
 

4705
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:13,910
object yeah but but with an eye towards
uh putting it on the earth and so uh and

4706
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:13,920
uh putting it on the earth and so uh and
 

4707
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,990
uh putting it on the earth and so uh and
have it be recursive so

4708
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:16,000
have it be recursive so
 

4709
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,709
have it be recursive so
you can have hexagons within hexagons

4710
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
you can have hexagons within hexagons
 

4711
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,189
you can have hexagons within hexagons
which is hard because and probably a bad

4712
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:21,199
which is hard because and probably a bad
 

4713
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,350
which is hard because and probably a bad
idea because you can't

4714
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,360
idea because you can't
 

4715
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,790
idea because you can't
tile

4716
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:24,800
tile
 

4717
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,149
tile
a hexagon with smaller hexagons

4718
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:28,159
a hexagon with smaller hexagons
 

4719
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:30,550
a hexagon with smaller hexagons
they don't they stick out

4720
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:30,560
they don't they stick out
 

4721
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,669
they don't they stick out
got it so they're oh they stick out so

4722
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
got it so they're oh they stick out so
 

4723
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:34,550
got it so they're oh they stick out so
there's a

4724
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
there's a
 

4725
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,030
there's a
can you do some kind of fractal hexagon

4726
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,040
can you do some kind of fractal hexagon
 

4727
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,709
can you do some kind of fractal hexagon
situation yeah yeah so so it's that and

4728
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:40,719
situation yeah yeah so so it's that and
 

4729
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,189
situation yeah yeah so so it's that and

roger's a little above my my level um
he's into hexagons as well yeah and

4748
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:07,520
he's into hexagons as well yeah and
 

4749
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,270
he's into hexagons as well yeah and
tiling yeah yeah so um so i did a lot of

4750
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
tiling yeah yeah so um so i did a lot of
 

4751
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,950
tiling yeah yeah so um so i did a lot of
that and i thought you know it was

4752
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:12,960
that and i thought you know it was
 

4753
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,070
that and i thought you know it was
pretty cool but um if there's some like

4754
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
pretty cool but um if there's some like
 

4755
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,149
pretty cool but um if there's some like
surprisingly intractable

4756
01:28:18,149 --> 01:28:18,159
surprisingly intractable
 

4757
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,750
surprisingly intractable
problems that keep coming up like

4758
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:21,760
problems that keep coming up like
 

4759
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,790
problems that keep coming up like
you you've always got to have

4760
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:24,800
you you've always got to have
 

4761
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,629
you you've always got to have
some pentagons like if you start with a

4762
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
some pentagons like if you start with a
 

4763
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,950
some pentagons like if you start with a
icosahedron which is

4764
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:28,960
icosahedron which is
 

4765
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,830
icosahedron which is
equilateral triangles which is a logical

4766
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:31,840
equilateral triangles which is a logical
 

4767
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,229
equilateral triangles which is a logical
place to start

4768
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:34,239
place to start
 

4769
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,390
place to start
you can cover those with hexagons but

4770
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:36,400
you can cover those with hexagons but
 

4771
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,590
you can cover those with hexagons but
every

4772
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:37,600
every
 

4773
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,750
every
vertex where

4774
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:39,760
vertex where
 

4775
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,110
vertex where
where the

4776
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:41,120
where the
 

4777
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,350
where the
the triangles come together

4778
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:43,360
the triangles come together
 

4779
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,229
the triangles come together
is a pentagon has to be a pentagon

4780
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:46,239
is a pentagon has to be a pentagon
 

4781
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:47,830
is a pentagon has to be a pentagon
oh interesting so there's all hexagons

4782
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:47,840
oh interesting so there's all hexagons
 

4783
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,110
oh interesting so there's all hexagons
and then there's a pentagon at the

4784
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:49,120
and then there's a pentagon at the
 

4785
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,430
and then there's a pentagon at the
intersections yeah yeah cool how do you

4786
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:51,440
intersections yeah yeah cool how do you
 

4787
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,270
intersections yeah yeah cool how do you
figure that out is that a known fact

4788
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,280
figure that out is that a known fact
 

4789
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,030
figure that out is that a known fact
well it's just if you look at uh yeah

4790
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:55,040
well it's just if you look at uh yeah
 

4791
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,870
well it's just if you look at uh yeah
like just by incidentally this thing got

4792
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:56,880
like just by incidentally this thing got
 

4793
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,470
like just by incidentally this thing got
it yeah yeah so

4794
01:28:58,470 --> 01:28:58,480
it yeah yeah so
 

4795
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,110
it yeah yeah so
so you can't make that go away

4796
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:01,120
so you can't make that go away
 

4797
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,070
so you can't make that go away
so

4798
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,080
so
 

4799
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,149
so
any system that you come up with to do

4800
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:04,159
any system that you come up with to do
 

4801
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,910
any system that you come up with to do
this has got to have

4802
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:05,920
this has got to have
 

4803
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,350
this has got to have
this

4804
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,360
this
 

4805
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,990
this
exceptions built into it for for those

4806
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
exceptions built into it for for those
 

4807
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,430
exceptions built into it for for those
12 you could have

4808
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:11,440
12 you could have
 

4809
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,990
12 you could have
quintillions of hexagons

4810
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,000
quintillions of hexagons
 

4811
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,950
quintillions of hexagons
but you've still got to have 12

4812
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:16,960
but you've still got to have 12
 

4813
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,310
but you've still got to have 12
pentagons somewhere

4814
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:20,320
pentagons somewhere
 

4815
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,470
pentagons somewhere
so um

4816
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:22,480
so um
 

4817
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,189
so um
so i've blown a hell of a lot of time on

4818
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
so i've blown a hell of a lot of time on
 

4819
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,990
so i've blown a hell of a lot of time on
on that over the years by the way

4820
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:28,000
on that over the years by the way
 

4821
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,550
on that over the years by the way
a lot of those kind of uh problems are

4822
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:30,560
a lot of those kind of uh problems are
 

4823
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,629
a lot of those kind of uh problems are
very difficult to prove something about

4824
01:29:32,629 --> 01:29:32,639
very difficult to prove something about
 

4825
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:33,510
very difficult to prove something about
yeah

4826
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:33,520
yeah
 

4827
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,790
yeah
yeah

4828
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,800
yeah
 

4829
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,750
yeah
yeah

4830
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:35,760
yeah
 

4831
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,110
yeah
and i think uber did it because someone

4832
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:39,120
and i think uber did it because someone
 

4833
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,990
and i think uber did it because someone
one of my friends who uh

4834
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,000
one of my friends who uh
 

4835
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,910
one of my friends who uh
who knows of my

4836
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:43,920
who knows of my
 

4837
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,390
who knows of my
my interest in this and who likes to

4838
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:46,400
my interest in this and who likes to
 

4839
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,870
my interest in this and who likes to
to give me a hard time

4840
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:48,880
to give me a hard time
 

4841
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,790
to give me a hard time
sent me a link this is a couple years

4842
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:50,800
sent me a link this is a couple years
 

4843
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,390
sent me a link this is a couple years
ago to

4844
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:52,400
ago to
 

4845
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,750
ago to
some

4846
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:53,760
some
 

4847
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,550
some
code base that i think came out of uber

4848
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:56,560
code base that i think came out of uber
 

4849
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,950
code base that i think came out of uber
where they had done this

4850
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:58,960
where they had done this
 

4851
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,550
where they had done this
you know you break break down the whole

4852
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:00,560
you know you break break down the whole
 

4853
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,629
you know you break break down the whole
surface of the earth into into little

4854
01:30:02,629 --> 01:30:02,639
surface of the earth into into little
 

4855
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,310
surface of the earth into into little
hexagons

4856
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:04,320
hexagons
 

4857
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,110
hexagons
so um that was a real knife through the

4858
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:07,120
so um that was a real knife through the
 

4859
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,149
so um that was a real knife through the
heart

4860
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:08,159
heart
 

4861
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:08,950
heart
um

4862
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:08,960
um
 

4863
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:09,910
um
but

4864
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:09,920
but
 

4865
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,990
but
i'll probably come back to it

4866
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,000
i'll probably come back to it
 

4867
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,990
i'll probably come back to it
someday

4868
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:14,000
someday
 

4869
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,510
someday
is there something special about

4870
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:15,520
is there something special about
 

4871
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,910
is there something special about
hexagons are you interested in all kinds

4872
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:17,920
hexagons are you interested in all kinds
 

4873
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,110
hexagons are you interested in all kinds
of tiling

4874
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:19,120
of tiling
 

4875
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,470
of tiling
uh well

4876
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:20,480
uh well
 

4877
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,310
uh well
i'm interested in all kinds of tiling

4878
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,320
i'm interested in all kinds of tiling
 

4879
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,390
i'm interested in all kinds of tiling
but i'm not

4880
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:24,400
but i'm not
 

4881
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,110
but i'm not
i know my limitations like as a as a

4882
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:27,120
i know my limitations like as a as a
 

4883
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,950
i know my limitations like as a as a
math guy um

4884
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:28,960
math guy um
 

4885
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,750
math guy um
so

4886
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:29,760
so
 

4887
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,550
so
hexagons are about my speed

4888
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:32,560
hexagons are about my speed
 

4889
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,510
hexagons are about my speed
um you know just a sufficient amount of

4890
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:35,520
um you know just a sufficient amount of
 

4891
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,270
um you know just a sufficient amount of
complexity yeah

4892
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,280
complexity yeah
 

4893
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:38,229
complexity yeah
yeah

4894
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:38,239
yeah
 

4895
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:41,189
yeah
so but no tiling is a really interesting

4896
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:41,199
so but no tiling is a really interesting
 

4897
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,990
so but no tiling is a really interesting
problem both two and three dimensional

4898
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,000
problem both two and three dimensional
 

4899
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,870
problem both two and three dimensional
tiling problems are fascinating and

4900
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:46,880
tiling problems are fascinating and
 

4901
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,550
tiling problems are fascinating and
they're one of those ancient puzzles

4902
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:48,560
they're one of those ancient puzzles
 

4903
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,990
they're one of those ancient puzzles
that has

4904
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:52,000

 

4905
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,350

attracted

4906
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,360
attracted
 

4907
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:58,709
attracted
brainiacs for for centuries

4908
01:30:58,709 --> 01:30:58,719

 

4909
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:00,790

let me ask you a little bit about ai

4910
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:00,800
let me ask you a little bit about ai
 

4911
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,870
let me ask you a little bit about ai
okay

4912
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:02,880

proliferation of ai in society over the
 

4923
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,629
proliferation of ai in society over the
next couple of decades do you think

4924
01:31:12,629 --> 01:31:12,639
next couple of decades do you think
 

4925
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:15,189
next couple of decades do you think
about this kind of stuff i

4926
01:31:15,189 --> 01:31:15,199
about this kind of stuff i
 

4927
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:17,350
about this kind of stuff i
do not think about it a lot because it's

4928
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:17,360
do not think about it a lot because it's
 

4929
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,189
do not think about it a lot because it's
a deep topic and i'm not i don't

4930
01:31:19,189 --> 01:31:19,199
a deep topic and i'm not i don't
 

4931
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:21,910
a deep topic and i'm not i don't
consider myself super well informed

4932
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:21,920
consider myself super well informed
 

4933
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:25,110
consider myself super well informed
about it and ai seems to be a term that

4934
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:25,120
about it and ai seems to be a term that
 

4935
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,590
about it and ai seems to be a term that
has applied to a lot of different

4936
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:27,600
has applied to a lot of different
 

4937
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,709
has applied to a lot of different
things

4938
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:28,719
things
 

4939
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:30,950
things
so i've messed around just a tiny little

4940
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:30,960
so i've messed around just a tiny little
 

4941
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,430
so i've messed around just a tiny little
bit with with neural nets

4942
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:33,440
bit with with neural nets
 

4943
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,550
bit with with neural nets
with uh

4944
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:34,560
with uh
 

4945
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,270
with uh
what's it called pca principle component

4946
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280
what's it called pca principle component
 

4947
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,830
what's it called pca principle component
analysis so i guess i tend to think in

4948
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:39,840
analysis so i guess i tend to think in
 

4949
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,510
analysis so i guess i tend to think in
terms of sort of granular bottom-up

4950
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:43,520
terms of sort of granular bottom-up
 

4951
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,590
terms of sort of granular bottom-up
um

4952
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:45,600
um
 

4953
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,470
um
ideas rather than big picture

4954
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:48,480
ideas rather than big picture
 

4955
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,550
ideas rather than big picture
top down you know oh god so like very

4956
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:50,560
top down you know oh god so like very
 

4957
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,390
top down you know oh god so like very
specific algorithms like how are they

4958
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:52,400
specific algorithms like how are they
 

4959
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,390
specific algorithms like how are they
going to

4960
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:54,400
going to
 

4961
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,229
going to
what problem are they going to solve in

4962
01:31:56,229 --> 01:31:56,239
what problem are they going to solve in
 

4963
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:58,550
what problem are they going to solve in
society such that that has like a lot of

4964
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:58,560
society such that that has like a lot of
 

4965
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,030
society such that that has like a lot of
big ripple effects so yeah

4966
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,040
big ripple effects so yeah
 

4967
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,390
big ripple effects so yeah
i mean

4968
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:02,400
i mean
 

4969
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,189
i mean
we could talk a particular successful ai

4970
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:05,199
we could talk a particular successful ai
 

4971
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:06,629
we could talk a particular successful ai
systems

4972
01:32:06,629 --> 01:32:06,639
systems
 

4973
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:08,950
systems
and success defining different ways of

01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:08,960
and success defining different ways of
 

4975
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,550
and success defining different ways of
recent years so

4976
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:10,560
recent years so
 

4977
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,870
recent years so
one is language models with gpt-3

4978
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:14,880
one is language models with gpt-3
 

4979
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,110
one is language models with gpt-3
most importantly they're self-supervised

4980
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,120
most importantly they're self-supervised
 

4981
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,870
most importantly they're self-supervised
meaning they don't require much

4982
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:18,880
meaning they don't require much
 

4983
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,070
meaning they don't require much
supervision from humans which means

4984
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,080
supervision from humans which means
 

4985
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,990
supervision from humans which means
they can learn by just reading a huge

4986
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,000
they can learn by just reading a huge
 

4987
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,629
they can learn by just reading a huge
amount of content created by humans so

4988
01:32:26,629 --> 01:32:26,639
amount of content created by humans so
 

4989
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:28,390
amount of content created by humans so
read the internet and from that be able

4990
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400
read the internet and from that be able
 

4991
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,149
read the internet and from that be able
to generate text and do all kinds of

4992
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:30,159
to generate text and do all kinds of
 

4993
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:31,590
to generate text and do all kinds of
things like that

4994
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:31,600
things like that
 

4995
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,189
things like that
it's possible to have a big enough

4996
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:33,199
it's possible to have a big enough
 

4997
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:36,070
it's possible to have a big enough
neural network it's going to be able to

4998
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:36,080
neural network it's going to be able to
 

4999
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,229
neural network it's going to be able to
have conversations with humans

5000
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:38,239
have conversations with humans
 

5001
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:41,430
have conversations with humans
based on just reading human language

5002
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:41,440
based on just reading human language
 

5003
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,430
based on just reading human language
that's an interesting idea to me the

5004
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:43,440
that's an interesting idea to me the
 

5005
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,270
that's an interesting idea to me the
very interesting idea

5006
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:45,280
very interesting idea
 

5007
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,590
very interesting idea
that people don't think about it

5008
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:47,600
that people don't think about it
 

5009
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,229
that people don't think about it
as ai because it's they're kind of dumb

5010
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
as ai because it's they're kind of dumb
 

5011

getting a sensor suite that allows you
 

5041
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,390
getting a sensor suite that allows you

yeah i don't need to deeply understand

5052
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
yeah i don't need to deeply understand
 

5053
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,669
yeah i don't need to deeply understand
uh my surroundings at a level of like

like uh
 

5057
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,669
like uh
at a level beyond of what will hurt if i

5058

at a level beyond of what will hurt if i
 

5059
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:42,149
at a level beyond of what will hurt if i
run into it yeah yeah yeah but even that

5060
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:42,159
run into it yeah yeah yeah but even that
 

5061
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:44,870
run into it yeah yeah yeah but even that
is hard that's that's hard but the thing

5062
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:44,880
is hard that's that's hard but the thing
 

5063
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,550
is hard that's that's hard but the thing
that i think

5064
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:46,560
that i think
 

5065
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,149
that i think
people don't

5066
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
people don't
 

5067
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:51,510
people don't
uh in the space explorer enough is the

5068
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:51,520
uh in the space explorer enough is the
 

5069
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,310
uh in the space explorer enough is the
human robot interaction

5070
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:54,320
human robot interaction
 

5071
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,910
human robot interaction
part of the

5072
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:55,920
part of the
 

5073
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,470
part of the
of the picture which is how it makes

5074
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:58,480
of the picture which is how it makes
 

5075
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,510
of the picture which is how it makes
humans feel how robots make humans feel

5076
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:01,520
humans feel how robots make humans feel
 

5077
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:02,950
humans feel how robots make humans feel
and i think that's going to have a very

5078
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:02,960
and i think that's going to have a very
 

5079
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,790
and i think that's going to have a very
significant impact

5080
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:04,800
significant impact
 

5081
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,550
significant impact
in uh

5082
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:06,560
in uh
 

5083
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,189
in uh
in the near future in society which is

5084
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:09,199
in the near future in society which is
 

5085
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,669
in the near future in society which is
the more you integrate ai systems of

5086
01:34:11,669 --> 01:34:11,679
the more you integrate ai systems of
 

5087
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:14,470
the more you integrate ai systems of
whatever form into society where humans

5088
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:14,480
whatever form into society where humans
 

5089
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,590
whatever form into society where humans
are

5090
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:15,600
are
 

5091
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,629
are
uh

5092
01:34:16,629 --> 01:34:16,639
uh
 

5093
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:19,350
uh
in contact with them regularly

5094
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,360
in contact with them regularly
 

5095
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,510
in contact with them regularly
so they could be embodied robotics or

5096
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:21,520
so they could be embodied robotics or
 

5097
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,669
so they could be embodied robotics or
that could be social media algorithms i

5098
01:34:23,669 --> 01:34:23,679
that could be social media algorithms i
 

5099
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,750
that could be social media algorithms i
think that has a very significant impact

5100
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:25,760
think that has a very significant impact
 

5101
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,629
think that has a very significant impact
and

5102
01:34:26,629 --> 01:34:26,639
and
 

5103
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:29,030
and
people often think like ai needs to be

5104
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:29,040
people often think like ai needs to be
 

5105
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,590
people often think like ai needs to be
super smart to have an impact i think it

5106
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:31,600
super smart to have an impact i think it
 

5107
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,270
super smart to have an impact i think it
needs to be super

5108
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:33,280
needs to be super
 

5109
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,669
needs to be super
integrated with society to have an

5110
01:34:35,669 --> 01:34:35,679
integrated with society to have an
 

5111
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:37,430
integrated with society to have an
impact and more and more that's

5112
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:37,440
impact and more and more that's
 

5113
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,790
impact and more and more that's
happening

5114
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:38,800
happening
 

5115
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,390
happening
even if they're dumb

5116
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:40,400
even if they're dumb
 

5117
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,830
even if they're dumb
yeah yeah no the um i mean a lot of my

5118
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:43,840
yeah yeah no the um i mean a lot of my
 

5119
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,109
yeah yeah no the um i mean a lot of my
exposure

5120
01:34:45,109 --> 01:34:45,119
exposure
 

5121
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:49,590
exposure
to robots is is that i'm

5122
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:49,600
to robots is is that i'm
 

5123
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,350
to robots is is that i'm
associated with a

5124
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:51,360
associated with a
 

5125
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,950
associated with a
combat robotics

5126
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:52,960
combat robotics
 

5127
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,030
combat robotics
team and i've been to a few battlebots

5128
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:55,040
team and i've been to a few battlebots
 

5129
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,430
team and i've been to a few battlebots
competitions and that's not like in a

5130
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:57,440
competitions and that's not like in a
 

5131
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,030
competitions and that's not like in a
lot of ways

5132
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,040
lot of ways
 

5133
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,550
lot of ways
that's pretty far from the kind of

5134
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:00,560
that's pretty far from the kind of
 

5135
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,950
that's pretty far from the kind of
robotics you're talking about um because

5136
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:02,960
robotics you're talking about um because
 

5137
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,750
robotics you're talking about um because
the these robots are remote controlled

5138
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:05,760
the these robots are remote controlled
 

5139
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,310
the these robots are remote controlled
they're they're not autonomous um

5140
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:08,320
they're they're not autonomous um
 

5141
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,669
they're they're not autonomous um
and so

5142
01:35:09,669 --> 01:35:09,679
and so
 

5143
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,229
and so
um they're pretty simple but

5144
01:35:12,229 --> 01:35:12,239
um they're pretty simple but
 

5145
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:15,189
um they're pretty simple but
um it's interesting to watch people's

5146
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:15,199
um it's interesting to watch people's
 

5147
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:18,709
um it's interesting to watch people's
emotional reactions to different robots

5148
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:18,719
emotional reactions to different robots
 

5149
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:20,870
emotional reactions to different robots
so there was one that was in the last

5150
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:20,880
so there was one that was in the last
 

5151
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,350
so there was one that was in the last
year's season the 2020

5152
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:23,360
year's season the 2020
 

5153
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,270
year's season the 2020
season called rusty

5154
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:25,280
season called rusty
 

5155
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,629
season called rusty
that uh

5156
01:35:26,629 --> 01:35:26,639
that uh
 

5157
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,870
that uh
was just uh like put together out of

5158
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:28,880
was just uh like put together out of
 

5159
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,149
was just uh like put together out of
spare parts and it looked kind of cute

5160
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159
spare parts and it looked kind of cute
 

5161
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,709
spare parts and it looked kind of cute
and it became this huge crowd favorite

5162
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
and it became this huge crowd favorite
 

5163
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,229
and it became this huge crowd favorite
because you could see it was made of

5164
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:36,239
because you could see it was made of
 

5165
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:38,950
because you could see it was made of
like salad bowls and you know random

5166
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:38,960
like salad bowls and you know random
 

5167
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,790
like salad bowls and you know random
pieces of hardware that this guy had

5168
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:40,800
pieces of hardware that this guy had
 

5169
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,109
pieces of hardware that this guy had
like scavenged from his farm

5170
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:43,119
like scavenged from his farm
 

5171
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:45,430
like scavenged from his farm
and so immediately

5172
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:45,440
and so immediately
 

5173
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,350
and so immediately
people kind of fell in love with this

5174
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:47,360
people kind of fell in love with this
 

5175
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,270
people kind of fell in love with this
one particular robot

5176
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:49,280
one particular robot
 

5177
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,629
one particular robot
whereas they might

5178
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:50,639
whereas they might
 

5179
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,870
whereas they might
other robots might be like the bad guy

5180
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:52,880
other robots might be like the bad guy
 

5181
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,830
other robots might be like the bad guy
in a

5182
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:53,840
in a
 

5183
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,109
in a
yeah you know if you think of

5184
01:35:55,109 --> 01:35:55,119
yeah you know if you think of
 

5185
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:58,550
yeah you know if you think of
professional wrestling you know the heel

5186
01:35:58,550 --> 01:35:58,560
professional wrestling you know the heel
 

5187
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,709
professional wrestling you know the heel
and the baby face

5188
01:36:00,709 --> 01:36:00,719
and the baby face
 

5189
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:03,109
and the baby face
so people do for reasons that are hard

5190
01:36:03,109 --> 01:36:03,119
so people do for reasons that are hard
 

5191
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:05,990
so people do for reasons that are hard
to understand form these emotional

5192
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:06,000
to understand form these emotional
 

5193
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,990
to understand form these emotional
reactions we form narratives in the same

5194
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:08,000
reactions we form narratives in the same
 

5195
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,910
reactions we form narratives in the same
way we do when we meet human beings we

5196
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:09,920
way we do when we meet human beings we
 

5197
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,830
way we do when we meet human beings we
tell stories about these objects and

5198
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
tell stories about these objects and
 

5199
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,510
tell stories about these objects and
they can be intelligent and they can be

5200
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:13,520
they can be intelligent and they can be
 

5201
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,830
they can be intelligent and they can be
biological or they can be

5202
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:15,840
biological or they can be
 

5203
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,310
biological or they can be
in almost almost close to inanimate

5204
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:18,320
in almost almost close to inanimate
 

5205
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,390
in almost almost close to inanimate
objects yeah and that to me is kind of

5206
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:20,400
objects yeah and that to me is kind of
 

5207
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,189
objects yeah and that to me is kind of
fascinating and

5208
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:23,199
fascinating and
 

5209
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:24,950
fascinating and
if robots

5210
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:24,960
if robots
 

5211
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,270
if robots
choose to lean into that

5212
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,280
choose to lean into that
 

5213
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,510
choose to lean into that
it creates an interesting world

5214
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:29,520
it creates an interesting world
 

5215
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,229
it creates an interesting world
if they start uh using feedback loops to

5216
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:32,239
if they start uh using feedback loops to
 

5217
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:34,470
if they start uh using feedback loops to
make themselves cuter

5218
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:34,480
make themselves cuter
 

5219
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,070
make themselves cuter
not just cuter but everything that

5220
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:36,080
not just cuter but everything that
 

5221
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,390
not just cuter but everything that
humans do let's not let's let's let's

humans do let's not let's let's let's
 

5223
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,189
humans do let's not let's let's let's
let's not speak harshly robots humans do

5224
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:41,199
let's not speak harshly robots humans do
 

5225
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,270
let's not speak harshly robots humans do
the same no i didn't was wasn't meaning

5226
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:43,280
the same no i didn't was wasn't meaning

it
 

5229
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,070
it
but right humans

5230
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:46,080
but right humans

01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:49,520
will change their appearance yes they're

just on instagram all the time how do i

5236
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:51,600
just on instagram all the time how do i
 

5237
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,030
just on instagram all the time how do i
look cuter that's the fundamental

5238
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,040
look cuter that's the fundamental
 

5239
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,030
look cuter that's the fundamental
question i ask myself yeah so why

5240
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:55,040
question i ask myself yeah so why
 

5241
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,510
question i ask myself yeah so why
wouldn't why wouldn't a robot wanna it's

5242
01:36:57,510 --> 01:36:57,520
wouldn't why wouldn't a robot wanna it's
 

5243
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,189
wouldn't why wouldn't a robot wanna it's
like oh wow people

5244
01:36:59,189 --> 01:36:59,199
like oh wow people
 

5245
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:00,870
like oh wow people
people really don't like the you know

5246
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:00,880
people really don't like the you know
 

5247
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,070
people really don't like the you know
quad mount

5248
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:02,080
quad mount
 

5249
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,030
quad mount
machine gun you know on top of my turret

5250
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:05,040
machine gun you know on top of my turret
 

5251
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,189
machine gun you know on top of my turret
maybe i should get rid of that and that

5252
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:07,199
maybe i should get rid of that and that
 

5253
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:08,870
maybe i should get rid of that and that
would you know people would feel more at

5254
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:08,880
would you know people would feel more at
 

5255
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,830
would you know people would feel more at
ease

5256
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:09,840
ease
 

5257
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,470
ease
uh or or lean into it yeah proud of it

5258
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:12,480
uh or or lean into it yeah proud of it
 

5259
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,910
uh or or lean into it yeah proud of it
yeah uh like uh you won't take my gun

5260
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:15,920
yeah uh like uh you won't take my gun
 

5261
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,669
yeah uh like uh you won't take my gun
whatever the saying is

5262
01:37:17,669 --> 01:37:17,679
whatever the saying is
 

5263
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:20,550
whatever the saying is
from my dead cold hands

5264
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:20,560
from my dead cold hands
 

5265
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,669
from my dead cold hands
um

5266
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:21,679
um
 

5267
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,430
um
i mean their their personality adding

5268
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:23,440
i mean their their personality adding
 

5269
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,030
i mean their their personality adding
personalities such that you can start to

5270
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:25,040
personalities such that you can start to
 

5271
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,750
personalities such that you can start to
heal you can start to weave narratives

5272
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:27,760
heal you can start to weave narratives
 

5273
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,910
heal you can start to weave narratives
i think that's a

5274
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:29,920
i think that's a
 

5275
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:34,070
i think that's a
fascinating place where

5276
01:37:34,070 --> 01:37:34,080

 

5277
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,109

there's this feedback loop like you said

5278
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:37,119
there's this feedback loop like you said
 

5279
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:38,709
there's this feedback loop like you said
where

5280
01:37:38,709 --> 01:37:38,719
where
 

5281
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:40,550
where
ai

5282
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:40,560
ai
 

5283
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,709
ai
when it's especially when it's embodied

5284
01:37:42,709 --> 01:37:42,719
when it's especially when it's embodied
 

5285
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:45,669
when it's especially when it's embodied
puts a mirror to ourselves

5286
01:37:45,669 --> 01:37:45,679
puts a mirror to ourselves
 

5287
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:48,070
puts a mirror to ourselves
just like other humans are our close

5288
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,080
just like other humans are our close
 

5289
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,189
just like other humans are our close
friends

5290
01:37:49,189 --> 01:37:49,199
friends
 

5291
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:52,629
friends
they kind of teach us about ourselves

5292
01:37:52,629 --> 01:37:52,639
they kind of teach us about ourselves
 

5293
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,870
they kind of teach us about ourselves
we teach each other and through that

5294
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
we teach each other and through that
 

5295
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,030
we teach each other and through that
process grow close

5296
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:57,040
process grow close
 

5297
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:02,070
process grow close
and it to me it's so fascinating to um

5298
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,080
and it to me it's so fascinating to um
 

5299
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,149
and it to me it's so fascinating to um
to expand the space

5300
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:04,159
to expand the space
 

5301
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:06,070
to expand the space
of deep meaningful interactions beyond

5302
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:06,080
of deep meaningful interactions beyond
 

5303
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,229
of deep meaningful interactions beyond
just humans

5304
01:38:08,229 --> 01:38:08,239
just humans
 

5305
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:10,149
just humans
that um

5306
01:38:10,149 --> 01:38:10,159
that um
 

5307
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,390
that um
that's the opportunity i see

5308
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:12,400
that's the opportunity i see
 

5309
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,270
that's the opportunity i see
with with robots and with ai systems

5310
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:15,280
with with robots and with ai systems
 

5311
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,830
with with robots and with ai systems
and that's why i don't like

5312
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:17,840
and that's why i don't like
 

5313
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,590
and that's why i don't like
my biggest problem social media

5314
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:19,600
my biggest problem social media
 

5315
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,790
my biggest problem social media
algorithms

5316
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
algorithms
 

5317
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,950
algorithms
is the lack of transparency it's not the

5318
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:22,960
is the lack of transparency it's not the
 

5319
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,910
is the lack of transparency it's not the
existence of the algorithms it's

5320
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
existence of the algorithms it's
 

5321
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,070
existence of the algorithms it's
uh well there's many things one is the

5322
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:28,080
uh well there's many things one is the
 

5323
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,669
uh well there's many things one is the
data data should be controlled by the

5324
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:29,679
data data should be controlled by the
 

5325
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:32,229
data data should be controlled by the
individual by people yeah themselves

5326
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,239
individual by people yeah themselves
 

5327
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,470
individual by people yeah themselves
so uh but also the lack of transparency

5328
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:34,480
so uh but also the lack of transparency
 

5329
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,550
so uh but also the lack of transparency
and how the algorithms work and change

5330
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,560
and how the algorithms work and change
 

5331
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,629
and how the algorithms work and change
your perception of what's real

5332
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
your perception of what's real
 

5333
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,430
your perception of what's real
yeah yeah in hidden ways yeah

5334
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:41,440
yeah yeah in hidden ways yeah
 

5335
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,750
yeah yeah in hidden ways yeah
in hidden ways yeah like you should be

5336
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:43,760
in hidden ways yeah like you should be
 

5337
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,270
in hidden ways yeah like you should be
aware just like when you take i don't

5338
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:45,280
aware just like when you take i don't
 

5339
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,430
aware just like when you take i don't
know if you take psychedelics

5340
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,440
know if you take psychedelics
 

5341
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,030
know if you take psychedelics
you should be aware that you took the

5342
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:49,040
you should be aware that you took the
 

5343
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,270
you should be aware that you took the
second hour it shouldn't be a surprise

5344
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:51,280
second hour it shouldn't be a surprise
 

5345
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,590
second hour it shouldn't be a surprise
yeah and second you should

5346
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:53,600
yeah and second you should
 

5347
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,629
yeah and second you should
i mean

5348
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:54,639
i mean
 

5349
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,910
i mean
uh become a student and a scholar and

5350
01:38:57,910 --> 01:38:57,920
uh become a student and a scholar and
 

5351
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,430
uh become a student and a scholar and
there should be research done there

5352
01:38:59,430 --> 01:38:59,440
there should be research done there
 

5353
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,830
there should be research done there
should be open conversation about how

5354
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:01,840
should be open conversation about how
 

5355
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,990
should be open conversation about how
your perception is changed and you

5356
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:04,000
your perception is changed and you
 

5357
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,430
your perception is changed and you
and then you are

5358
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:05,440
and then you are
 

5359
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:09,189
and then you are
become your own guide in this world of

5360
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:09,199
become your own guide in this world of
 

5361
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:11,590
become your own guide in this world of
altered perception because arguably none

5362
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:11,600
altered perception because arguably none
 

5363
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,109
altered perception because arguably none
of it is real

5364
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:13,119
of it is real
 

5365
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:16,550
of it is real
you get to choose the flavor of real

5366
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:16,560
you get to choose the flavor of real
 

5367
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,590
you get to choose the flavor of real
um

5368
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:17,600
um
 

5369
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,870
um
i mean

5370
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:18,880
i mean
 

5371
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,590
i mean
this is something you explore

5372
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:21,600
this is something you explore
 

5373
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,229
this is something you explore
quite a bit do you um

5374
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
quite a bit do you um
 

5375
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:25,830
quite a bit do you um
yourself

5376
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:25,840
yourself
 

5377
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,070
yourself
think that there is

5378
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,080
think that there is
 

5379
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,870
think that there is
a bottom to it where there is reality

5380
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:30,880
a bottom to it where there is reality
 

5381
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,030
a bottom to it where there is reality
there's a base layer of reality

5382
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:33,040
there's a base layer of reality
 

5383
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,310
there's a base layer of reality
that physics

5384
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,320
that physics
 

5385
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,030
that physics
can

5386
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,040
can
 

5387
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,830
can
explore and our human perception sort of

5388
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:37,840
explore and our human perception sort of
 

5389
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,390
explore and our human perception sort of
layer stuff is there's is there let's go

5390
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:40,400
layer stuff is there's is there let's go
 

5391
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,510
layer stuff is there's is there let's go
to plato

5392
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
to plato
 

5393
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,790
to plato
is there such a thing as truth

5394
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:44,800
is there such a thing as truth
 

5395
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,590
is there such a thing as truth
i lean towards the platonic view of

5396
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:47,600
i lean towards the platonic view of
 

5397
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,310
i lean towards the platonic view of
things so i believe that mathematical

5398
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:50,320
things so i believe that mathematical
 

5399
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,310
things so i believe that mathematical
objects haven't

5400
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,320
objects haven't
 

5401
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,390
objects haven't
a reality that

5402
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:54,400
a reality that
 

5403
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:57,510
a reality that
it's not all made up by by human minds

5404
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:57,520
it's not all made up by by human minds
 

5405
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,790
it's not all made up by by human minds
um

5406
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:58,800
um
 

5407
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,310
um
and i don't know

5408
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:00,320
and i don't know
 

5409
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,229
and i don't know
where that reality

5410
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:02,239
where that reality
 

5411
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:04,870
where that reality
comes from i can't explain it but but i

5412
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:04,880
comes from i can't explain it but but i
 

5413
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,430
comes from i can't explain it but but i
do think that mathematical objects are

5414
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:07,440
do think that mathematical objects are
 

5415
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:12,149
do think that mathematical objects are
discovered and not uh invented

5416
01:40:12,149 --> 01:40:12,159

 

5417
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:13,030

not a lot but i did some
 

5425
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,070
not a lot but i did some
some reading of husserole when i was

5426
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:22,080
some reading of husserole when i was
 

5427
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,149
some reading of husserole when i was
writing anathem

5428
01:40:24,149 --> 01:40:24,159
writing anathem
 

5429
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,430

01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:27,440
and he's a
 

5433
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:30,390
and he's a
you know 20th century phenomenologist

5434
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:30,400
you know 20th century phenomenologist
 

5435
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,669
you know 20th century phenomenologist
and he's writing in the he's writing at

5436
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:33,679
and he's writing in the he's writing at
 

5437
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:35,270
and he's writing in the he's writing at
the same time as

5438
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:35,280
the same time as
 

5439
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,430
the same time as
as scientists are starting to understand

5440
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:37,440
as scientists are starting to understand
 

5441
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,709
as scientists are starting to understand
atoms

5442
01:40:38,709 --> 01:40:38,719
atoms
 

5443
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:42,149
atoms
and and becoming aware that

5444
01:40:42,149 --> 01:40:42,159
and and becoming aware that
 

5445
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:44,709
and and becoming aware that
that when we look at this table

5446
01:40:44,709 --> 01:40:44,719
that when we look at this table
 

5447
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,229
that when we look at this table
it's really just a

5448
01:40:46,229 --> 01:40:46,239
it's really just a
 

5449
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:49,990
it's really just a
slab of almost entirely vacuum and

5450
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:50,000
slab of almost entirely vacuum and
 

5451
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,790
slab of almost entirely vacuum and
there's a very sparse

5452
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:52,800
there's a very sparse
 

5453
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,830
there's a very sparse
uh arrangement of tiny tiny little

5454
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:55,840
uh arrangement of tiny tiny little
 

5455
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,109
uh arrangement of tiny tiny little
particles there um occupying that space

5456
01:40:59,109 --> 01:40:59,119
particles there um occupying that space
 

5457
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,950
particles there um occupying that space
that interact with each other in such a

5458
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:00,960
that interact with each other in such a
 

5459
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,470
that interact with each other in such a
way that

5460
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:02,480
way that
 

5461
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:06,870
way that
our brains perceive this object

5462
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:06,880
our brains perceive this object
 

5463
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:07,990
our brains perceive this object
so

5464
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:08,000
so
 

5465
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,430
so
that's kind of kind of the beginnings of

5466
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:10,440
that's kind of kind of the beginnings of
 

5467
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,229
that's kind of kind of the beginnings of
phenomenology

5468
01:41:12,229 --> 01:41:12,239
phenomenology
 

5469
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:13,510
phenomenology
um

5470
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:13,520
um
 

5471
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,470
um
and um and his stuff is pretty hard to

5472
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:16,480
and um and his stuff is pretty hard to
 

5473
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,149
and um and his stuff is pretty hard to
um

5474
01:41:18,149 --> 01:41:18,159
um
 

5475
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:19,830
um
hard to read

5476
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
hard to read
 

5477
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,830
hard to read
it you really have to

5478
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:21,840
it you really have to
 

5479
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,950
it you really have to
take it in small bites

5480
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:24,960
take it in small bites
 

5481
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,910
take it in small bites
and go a little bit at a time but he's

5482
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:27,920
and go a little bit at a time but he's
 

5483
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,149
and go a little bit at a time but he's
trying to come to grips with these

5484
01:41:30,149 --> 01:41:30,159
trying to come to grips with these
 

5485
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,550
trying to come to grips with these
with these kinds of of questions

5486
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:32,560
with these kinds of of questions
 

5487
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,350
with these kinds of of questions
how did you come to grips with it

5488
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:35,360
how did you come to grips with it
 

5489
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,310
how did you come to grips with it
like why why is this table feel solid

5490
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:38,320
like why why is this table feel solid
 

5491
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,790
like why why is this table feel solid
well i mean we're an evolved system that

5492
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:40,800
well i mean we're an evolved system that
 

5493
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,830
well i mean we're an evolved system that
there's we have biological advantages in

5494
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:43,840
there's we have biological advantages in
 

5495
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,030
there's we have biological advantages in
in knowing

5496
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:45,040
in knowing
 

5497
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,189
in knowing
where solid objects are so we've got

5498
01:41:47,189 --> 01:41:47,199
where solid objects are so we've got
 

5499
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:50,790
where solid objects are so we've got
this system in our head that

5500
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:50,800

 

5501
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,109

that integrates our perceptions into

5502
01:41:53,109 --> 01:41:53,119
that integrates our perceptions into
 

5503
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:53,990
that integrates our perceptions into
this

5504
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:54,000
this
 

5505
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,189
this
coherent view of things

5506
01:41:57,189 --> 01:41:57,199
coherent view of things
 

5507
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:58,790
coherent view of things
that

5508
01:41:58,790 --> 01:41:58,800
that
 

5509
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,470
that
one of the

5510
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,480
one of the
 

5511
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,189
one of the
take-homes that i i like

5512
01:42:03,189 --> 01:42:03,199
take-homes that i i like
 

5513
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:04,910
take-homes that i i like
from whosoereal is the idea of

5514
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:04,920
from whosoereal is the idea of
 

5515
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,350
from whosoereal is the idea of
inter-subjectivity and the idea that

5516
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:07,360
inter-subjectivity and the idea that
 

5517
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,750
inter-subjectivity and the idea that
a fundamental

5518
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:09,760
a fundamental
 

5519
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,189
a fundamental
requirement for us to stay sane is

5520
01:42:13,189 --> 01:42:13,199
requirement for us to stay sane is
 

5521
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,830
requirement for us to stay sane is
for us to share our perceptions

5522
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:15,840
for us to share our perceptions
 

5523
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,310
for us to share our perceptions
and have them ratified by other

5524
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:18,320
and have them ratified by other
 

5525
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,310
and have them ratified by other
and they don't even have to be people

5526
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
and they don't even have to be people
 

5527
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,109
and they don't even have to be people
but

5528
01:42:21,109 --> 01:42:21,119
but
 

5529
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:21,990
but
um

5530
01:42:21,990 --> 01:42:22,000
um
 

5531
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,550
um
that you know a prisoner in solitary

5532
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:24,560
that you know a prisoner in solitary
 

5533
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,310
that you know a prisoner in solitary
confinement might

5534
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:26,320
confinement might
 

5535
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,590
confinement might
domesticate a mouse or even insects

5536
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:29,600
domesticate a mouse or even insects
 

5537
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,109
domesticate a mouse or even insects
uh because

5538
01:42:31,109 --> 01:42:31,119
uh because
 

5539
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:33,510
uh because
they perceive the same things that the

5540
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:33,520
they perceive the same things that the
 

5541
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,910
they perceive the same things that the
prisoner perceives um

5542
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:35,920
prisoner perceives um
 

5543
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,550
prisoner perceives um
and uh and so convince

5544
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:38,560
and uh and so convince
 

5545
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,070
and uh and so convince
convince him that he's not just

5546
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:40,080
convince him that he's not just
 

5547
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,950
convince him that he's not just
hallucinating yeah there's a

5548
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:42,960
hallucinating yeah there's a
 

5549
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,030
hallucinating yeah there's a
establish a consensus

5550
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:45,040
establish a consensus
 

5551
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:45,990
establish a consensus
yeah

5552
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,000
yeah
 

5553
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,149
yeah
but see that doesn't mean it's any of it

5554
01:42:48,149 --> 01:42:48,159
but see that doesn't mean it's any of it
 

5555
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:49,109
but see that doesn't mean it's any of it
is real

5556
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:49,119
is real
 

5557
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,910
is real
you just establish a consensus

5558
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:51,920
you just establish a consensus
 

5559
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,629
you just establish a consensus
it uh it could be very um yeah

5560
01:42:54,629 --> 01:42:54,639
it uh it could be very um yeah
 

5561
01:42:54,639 --> 01:43:00,229
it uh it could be very um yeah
very distant from something that um

5562
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:00,239

 

5563
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:02,870

something that's real in in um

5564
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:02,880
something that's real in in um
 

5565
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,870
something that's real in in um
engineering sense of real

5566
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:04,880
engineering sense of real
 

5567
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,109
engineering sense of real
like that you could build it using

5568
01:43:07,109 --> 01:43:07,119
like that you could build it using
 

5569
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,149
like that you could build it using
physics

5570
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:08,159
physics
 

5571
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:10,550
physics
but i think that uh you know valuable

5572
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:10,560
but i think that uh you know valuable
 

5573
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,350
but i think that uh you know valuable
application for an ai robot would be

5574
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:13,360
application for an ai robot would be
 

5575
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,310
application for an ai robot would be
just

5576
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:14,320
just
 

5577
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:17,510
just
to do nothing except that it just um

5578
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:17,520
to do nothing except that it just um
 

5579
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,470
to do nothing except that it just um
so

5580
01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:18,480
so
 

5581
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,750
so
um consensus it just sits there yeah and

5582
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:21,760
um consensus it just sits there yeah and
 

5583
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,390
um consensus it just sits there yeah and
if if you hear a door slam

5584
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:24,400
if if you hear a door slam
 

5585
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,990
if if you hear a door slam
you might turn to

5586
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,000
you might turn to
 

5587
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,149
you might turn to
to see what it is if the robot

5588
01:43:28,149 --> 01:43:28,159
to see what it is if the robot
 

5589
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:30,229
to see what it is if the robot
at the same time turns

5590
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:30,239
at the same time turns
 

5591
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,310
at the same time turns
to to look at the door slam it's

5592
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:32,320
to to look at the door slam it's
 

5593
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,270
to to look at the door slam it's
ratifying your perception but isn't that

5594
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:35,280
ratifying your perception but isn't that
 

5595
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,350
ratifying your perception but isn't that
the basis of love

5596
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:37,360
the basis of love
 

5597
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:41,430
the basis of love
is when the door slams you both look

5598
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:41,440
is when the door slams you both look
 

5599
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,470
is when the door slams you both look
but for deeper things

5600
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:44,480
but for deeper things
 

5601
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:47,830
but for deeper things
you both hear the same music

5602
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:47,840

 

5603
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,149

and others don't i mean isn't that

5604
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:50,159
and others don't i mean isn't that
 

5605
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,990
and others don't i mean isn't that
what that

5606
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:52,000
what that
 

5607
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,550
what that
that's by by love i mean depth of human

5608
01:43:54,550 --> 01:43:54,560
that's by by love i mean depth of human
 

5609
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,430
that's by by love i mean depth of human
connection yeah like it that that's

5610
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:57,440
connection yeah like it that that's
 

5611
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,550
connection yeah like it that that's
or not

5612
01:43:58,550 --> 01:43:58,560
or not
 

5613
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,390
or not
you arrive at similar

5614
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:00,400
you arrive at similar
 

5615
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,109
you arrive at similar
reactions uh without having to

5616
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:03,119
reactions uh without having to
 

5617
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:06,070
reactions uh without having to
to explicitly communicate it yeah yeah

5618
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:06,080
to explicitly communicate it yeah yeah
 

5619
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:09,030
to explicitly communicate it yeah yeah
but we could start with a a robot that

5620
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:09,040
but we could start with a a robot that
 

5621
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,590
but we could start with a a robot that
listens explicitly for the

5622
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:11,600
listens explicitly for the
 

5623
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,270
listens explicitly for the
slam doors yeah but no i've scary sounds

5624
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:15,280
slam doors yeah but no i've scary sounds
 

5625
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:18,070
slam doors yeah but no i've scary sounds
i i can think of so an example of this

5626
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:18,080
i i can think of so an example of this
 

5627
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,430
i i can think of so an example of this
is you know

5628
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,440

 

5629
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,350

when i when i went to college you know

5630
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:23,360
when i when i went to college you know
 

5631
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,229
when i when i went to college you know
we'd be sitting at the cafeteria a you

would happen
 

5651
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,310
would happen
and

contact with someone you didn't know
 

5657
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,070
contact with someone you didn't know
at the other end of the table and in

5658
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,080
at the other end of the table and in
 

5659
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,350
at the other end of the table and in
that moment

5660
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:55,360
that moment
 

5661
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,189
that moment
you would realize

5662
01:44:57,189 --> 01:44:57,199
you would realize
 

5663
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:59,910
you would realize
this person is reacting this person

5664
01:44:59,910 --> 01:44:59,920
this person is reacting this person
 

5665

01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:07,920
appears to get the joke or
 

5673
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,149
appears to get the joke or
to understand what just happened but

5674
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:10,159
to understand what just happened but
 

5675

to understand what just happened but
random stranger down there and i we have

5676
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:12,560
random stranger down there and i we have
 

5677
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,950
random stranger down there and i we have
this connection yeah and then you build

5678
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:14,960
this connection yeah and then you build
 

5679
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,390
this connection yeah and then you build
on that so then

5680
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:16,400
on that so then
 

5681
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,750
on that so then
the next time

5682
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:17,760
the next time
 

5683
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,149
the next time
something happens you automatically

5684
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:20,159
something happens you automatically

you're hanging out together yeah because
you you know you've already established

5694
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:30,000
you you know you've already established
 

5695
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,310
you you know you've already established
without even talking to each other

5696
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:32,320
without even talking to each other
 

5697
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,950
without even talking to each other
that uh you're on the same wavelength

5698
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:34,960
that uh you're on the same wavelength
 

5699
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:35,990
that uh you're on the same wavelength
yeah

5700
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:36,000
yeah
 

5701
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,390
yeah
it's seemingly so simple

5702
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:38,400
it's seemingly so simple
 

5703
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,470
it's seemingly so simple
what's so powerful that's establishing

5704
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:40,480
what's so powerful that's establishing
 

5705
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,149
what's so powerful that's establishing
that you're on the same wavelength yeah

5706
01:45:42,149 --> 01:45:42,159
that you're on the same wavelength yeah
 

5707
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:44,390
that you're on the same wavelength yeah
at some level yeah

5708
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:44,400
at some level yeah
 

5709
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,070
at some level yeah
there's no reason why you and a toaster

5710
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:46,080
there's no reason why you and a toaster
 

5711
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:47,990
there's no reason why you and a toaster
can't have that

5712
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:48,000
can't have that
 

5713
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,629
can't have that
i'm just saying

5714
01:45:50,629 --> 01:45:50,639
i'm just saying
 

5715
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:51,970
i'm just saying
this smell burned to you

5716
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:51,980
this smell burned to you

[Laughter]
 

5719
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,430
[Laughter]
exactly i think it's

5720
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:55,440
exactly i think it's
 

5721
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,830
exactly i think it's
if a toaster could just say that to you

5722
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:57,840
if a toaster could just say that to you
 

5723
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,629
if a toaster could just say that to you
yeah

5724
01:45:58,629 --> 01:45:58,639
yeah
 

5725
01:45:58,639 --> 01:45:59,550
yeah
yeah

5726
01:45:59,550 --> 01:45:59,560

pre-blockchain as you point out
 

5773
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:57,830
pre-blockchain as you point out
so

5774
01:46:57,830 --> 01:46:57,840
so
 

5775
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:58,709

um
 

5777
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:01,350
um
at that point uh i was kind of reacting

5778
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:01,360
at that point uh i was kind of reacting
 

5779
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,310
at that point uh i was kind of reacting
to what i was seeing among

5780
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:04,320
to what i was seeing among
 

5781
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,709
to what i was seeing among
people like the bay area cypherpunks in

people like the bay area cypherpunks in
 

5783
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:08,790

berkeley there was some sun there was a

5784
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:08,800
berkeley there was some sun there was a
 

5785
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,550
berkeley there was some sun there was a
branch here in austin as well

5786
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:12,560
branch here in austin as well
 

5787
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:15,189
branch here in austin as well
and a lot of their

5788
01:47:15,189 --> 01:47:15,199
and a lot of their
 

5789
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:16,870
and a lot of their
thinking was

5790
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:16,880
thinking was
 

5791
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,950
thinking was
so based on the idea that you would have

5792
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:18,960
so based on the idea that you would have
 

5793
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,390
so based on the idea that you would have
to have

5794
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:20,400
to have
 

5795
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:24,629
to have
a physical uh region of the earth that

5796
01:47:24,629 --> 01:47:24,639
a physical uh region of the earth that
 

5797
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,109
a physical uh region of the earth that
was free of government

5798
01:47:27,109 --> 01:47:27,119
was free of government
 

5799
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:28,550
was free of government
interference

5800
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:28,560
interference
 

5801
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:31,030
interference
you couldn't achieve that freedom

5802
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:31,040
you couldn't achieve that freedom
 

5803
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,109
you couldn't achieve that freedom
by purely mathematical

5804
01:47:33,109 --> 01:47:33,119
by purely mathematical
 

5805
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:35,270
by purely mathematical
means on the network you actually had to

5806
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:35,280
means on the network you actually had to
 

5807
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,149
means on the network you actually had to
have you know a room somewhere with

5808
01:47:38,149 --> 01:47:38,159
have you know a room somewhere with
 

5809
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:40,229
have you know a room somewhere with
servers in it um

5810
01:47:40,229 --> 01:47:40,239
servers in it um
 

5811
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:41,669
servers in it um
that that

5812
01:47:41,669 --> 01:47:41,679
that that
 

5813
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:43,510
that that
a government couldn't come and and

5814
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:43,520
a government couldn't come and and
 

5815
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,629
a government couldn't come and and
meddle with

5816
01:47:44,629 --> 01:47:44,639
meddle with
 

5817
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:47,270
meddle with
and so a lot of ideation happened around

5818
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,280
and so a lot of ideation happened around
 

5819
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,590
and so a lot of ideation happened around
that view of things that

5820
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:49,600
that view of things that
 

5821
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,030
that view of things that
there were efforts to figure out

5822
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:51,040
there were efforts to figure out
 

5823
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,109
there were efforts to figure out
jurisdictions where this might work

5824
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:53,119
jurisdictions where this might work
 

5825
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:55,350
jurisdictions where this might work
there was a lot of interest for a while

5826
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:55,360
there was a lot of interest for a while
 

5827
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,310
there was a lot of interest for a while
in anguilla which is a caribbean island

5828
01:47:58,310 --> 01:47:58,320
in anguilla which is a caribbean island
 

5829
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:01,350
in anguilla which is a caribbean island
that had some unusual jurisdictional

5830
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:01,360
that had some unusual jurisdictional
 

5831
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,790
that had some unusual jurisdictional
properties

5832
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:02,800
properties
 

5833
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,070
properties
there was sea land sea land which is a

5834
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:06,080
there was sea land sea land which is a
 

5835
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,229
there was sea land sea land which is a
platform in the north sea

5836
01:48:08,229 --> 01:48:08,239
platform in the north sea
 

5837
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,189
platform in the north sea
um

5838
01:48:09,189 --> 01:48:09,199
um
 

5839
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:10,870
um
and so there was a lot of effort that

5840
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:10,880
and so there was a lot of effort that
 

5841
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,629
and so there was a lot of effort that
went into finding these physical

5842
01:48:12,629 --> 01:48:12,639
went into finding these physical
 

5843
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:15,750
went into finding these physical
locations that that were deemed kind of

5844
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:15,760
locations that that were deemed kind of
 

5845
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,109
locations that that were deemed kind of
safe

5846
01:48:17,109 --> 01:48:17,119
safe
 

5847
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:18,790
safe
and that all

5848
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:18,800
and that all
 

5849
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,229
and that all
goes away

5850
01:48:20,229 --> 01:48:20,239
goes away
 

5851
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:21,030
goes away
with

5852
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:21,040
with
 

5853
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,229
with
blockchain

5854
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:22,239
blockchain
 

5855
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:25,510
blockchain
it's no longer necessary

5856
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:25,520
it's no longer necessary
 

5857
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,109
it's no longer necessary
and so that really changes the picture

5858
01:48:27,109 --> 01:48:27,119
and so that really changes the picture
 

5859
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:28,760
and so that really changes the picture
in a lot of ways because

5860
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:28,770
in a lot of ways because
 

5861
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:29,910
in a lot of ways because
[Music]

5862
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:29,920
[Music]
 

5863
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,669
[Music]
you no longer have

5864
01:48:31,669 --> 01:48:31,679
you no longer have
 

5865
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:34,149
you no longer have
i mean from a novelist point of view the

5866
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:34,159
i mean from a novelist point of view the
 

5867
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:37,030
i mean from a novelist point of view the
old system was a lot more fun to work

5868
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,040
old system was a lot more fun to work
 

5869
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,270
old system was a lot more fun to work
with because it gives you a situation

5870
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:39,280
with because it gives you a situation
 

5871
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,550
with because it gives you a situation
where hackers

5872
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:40,560
where hackers
 

5873
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,629
where hackers
are wandering around in strange parts of

5874
01:48:42,629 --> 01:48:42,639
are wandering around in strange parts of
 

5875
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:44,950
are wandering around in strange parts of
the world you know trying to set up

5876
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:44,960
the world you know trying to set up
 

5877
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,870
the world you know trying to set up
server rooms so that's a great

5878
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:46,880
server rooms so that's a great
 

5879
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,790
server rooms so that's a great
storytelling

5880
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:48,800
storytelling
 

5881
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:49,990
storytelling
thing

5882
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:50,000
thing
 

5883
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,510
thing
there's still a little bit of that right

5884
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,520
there's still a little bit of that right
 

5885
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,910
there's still a little bit of that right
in the modern world but it's just

5886
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:53,920
in the modern world but it's just
 

5887
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,830
in the modern world but it's just
there's several server rooms as opposed

5888
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:55,840
there's several server rooms as opposed
 

5889
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,470
there's several server rooms as opposed
to one centralized one yeah yeah and

5890
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:58,480
to one centralized one yeah yeah and
 

5891
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,950
to one centralized one yeah yeah and
there's the like the new wrinkle is the

5892
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:00,960
there's the like the new wrinkle is the
 

5893
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,510
there's the like the new wrinkle is the
need to do a lot of computation

5894
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:03,520
need to do a lot of computation
 

5895
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:04,870
need to do a lot of computation
and to keep your

5896
01:49:04,870 --> 01:49:04,880
and to keep your
 

5897
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:05,990
and to keep your
your uh

5898
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:06,000
your uh

your uh
your your gpus from melting down so

5900
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:09,280
your your gpus from melting down so
 

5901
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:12,070
your your gpus from melting down so
people building things in iceland or or

5902
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:12,080
people building things in iceland or or
 

5903

people building things in iceland or or
in shipping containers on the bottom of

5904
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:13,760
in shipping containers on the bottom of
 

5905
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,750
in shipping containers on the bottom of
the ocean or whatever

5906
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:15,760
the ocean or whatever

the ocean or whatever
um

5908
01:49:16,709 --> 01:49:16,719
um
 

5909
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:18,870
um
so um but there's still governments

5910
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:18,880
so um but there's still governments
 

5911
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,310
so um but there's still governments
involved and there's they're still from

5912
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:20,320
involved and there's they're still from
 

5913
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,910
involved and there's they're still from
a novelist perspective interesting

5914
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:21,920
a novelist perspective interesting
 

5915
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,430
a novelist perspective interesting
dynamics

5916
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:23,440
dynamics
 

5917
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,310
dynamics
what is big governments like china and

5918
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:26,320
what is big governments like china and
 

5919
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,550
what is big governments like china and
and more sort of renegade governments

5920
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:28,560
and more sort of renegade governments
 

5921
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,310
and more sort of renegade governments
from all over the world trying to

5922
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:30,320
from all over the world trying to
 

5923
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,149
from all over the world trying to
contend with this idea

5924
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:32,159
contend with this idea
 

5925
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:35,189
contend with this idea
of what to do uh in terms of control and

5926
01:49:35,189 --> 01:49:35,199
of what to do uh in terms of control and
 

5927
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:37,830
of what to do uh in terms of control and
power over these kinds of

5928
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:37,840
power over these kinds of
 

5929
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:40,390
power over these kinds of
centers that do the mining of the yeah

5930
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:40,400
centers that do the mining of the yeah
 

5931
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,950
centers that do the mining of the yeah
of the cryptocurrency yeah so we're in a

5932
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:42,960
of the cryptocurrency yeah so we're in a
 

5933
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,270
of the cryptocurrency yeah so we're in a
stage now that kind of goes beyond the

5934
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:45,280
stage now that kind of goes beyond the
 

5935
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:46,229
stage now that kind of goes beyond the
initial

5936
01:49:46,229 --> 01:49:46,239
initial
 

5937
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:47,589
initial
like there's

5938
01:49:47,589 --> 01:49:47,599
like there's
 

5939
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,709
like there's
the stuff i was describing in

5940
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:50,719
the stuff i was describing in
 

5941
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:53,669
the stuff i was describing in
kryptonomicon had a little bit of error

5942
01:49:53,669 --> 01:49:53,679
kryptonomicon had a little bit of error
 

5943
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:56,550
kryptonomicon had a little bit of error
about it of the underpants gnomes uh in

5944
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:56,560
about it of the underpants gnomes uh in
 

5945
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,149
about it of the underpants gnomes uh in
that you know we're gonna we're gonna

5946
01:49:58,149 --> 01:49:58,159
that you know we're gonna we're gonna
 

5947
01:49:58,159 --> 01:49:59,750
that you know we're gonna we're gonna
build this system

5948
01:49:59,750 --> 01:49:59,760
build this system
 

5949
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,030
build this system
and then

5950
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:01,040
and then
 

5951
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,750
and then
we'll make money somehow uh but the the

5952
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:03,760
we'll make money somehow uh but the the
 

5953
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:06,629
we'll make money somehow uh but the the
intermediate step was was left out

5954
01:50:06,629 --> 01:50:06,639
intermediate step was was left out
 

5955
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:08,390
intermediate step was was left out
um

5956
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:08,400
um
 

5957
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,870
um
and that is uh

5958
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:10,880
and that is uh
 

5959
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:13,430
and that is uh
uh i i think we're now

5960
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:13,440
uh i i think we're now
 

5961
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,470
uh i i think we're now
so

5962
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:14,480
so
 

5963
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,950
so
into that phase of the thing where the

5964
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:16,960
into that phase of the thing where the
 

5965
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,229
into that phase of the thing where the
where bitcoin

5966
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:18,239
where bitcoin
 

5967
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:20,070
where bitcoin
you know blockchain exists people know

5968
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:20,080
you know blockchain exists people know
 

5969
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,350
you know blockchain exists people know
how it works

5970
01:50:21,350 --> 01:50:21,360
how it works
 

5971
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,149
how it works
uh bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

5972
01:50:24,149 --> 01:50:24,159
uh bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
 

5973
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:26,470
uh bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
exist people are using them and it's

5974
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:26,480
exist people are using them and it's
 

5975
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,390
exist people are using them and it's
sort of like okay what now you know

5976
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:28,400
sort of like okay what now you know
 

5977
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,390
sort of like okay what now you know
where does this all lead

5978
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:30,400
where does this all lead
 

5979
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,669
where does this all lead
um

5980
01:50:31,669 --> 01:50:31,679
um
 

5981
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:34,070
um
so um do you have a sense of where it

5982
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:34,080
so um do you have a sense of where it
 

5983
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,709
so um do you have a sense of where it
all leads like is it is it possible that

5984
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:36,719
all leads like is it is it possible that
 

5985
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:39,430
all leads like is it is it possible that
the set of technology kind of

5986
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:39,440
the set of technology kind of
 

5987
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:43,430
the set of technology kind of
continues to have

5988
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440

 

5989
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,589

transformational effects on

5990
01:50:45,589 --> 01:50:45,599
transformational effects on
 

5991
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:47,350
transformational effects on
not just sort of

5992
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:47,360
not just sort of
 

5993
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:49,510
not just sort of
finance but

5994
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:49,520
finance but
 

5995
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:52,550
finance but
who gets to have power in this world

5996
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:52,560
who gets to have power in this world
 

5997
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,189
who gets to have power in this world
so the decentralization of power

5998
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:55,199
so the decentralization of power
 

5999
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:58,070
so the decentralization of power
you know big questions right so i guess

6000
01:50:58,070 --> 01:50:58,080
you know big questions right so i guess
 

6001
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:01,350
you know big questions right so i guess
there's a little bit of the cynic in me

6002
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,360
there's a little bit of the cynic in me
 

6003
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:02,470
there's a little bit of the cynic in me
thinking that

6004
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:02,480
thinking that
 

6005
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,870
thinking that
as soon as it becomes important enough

6006
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:04,880
as soon as it becomes important enough
 

6007
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,589
as soon as it becomes important enough
the existing banks and people in power

6008
01:51:07,589 --> 01:51:07,599
the existing banks and people in power
 

6009
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:10,470
the existing banks and people in power
are gonna sort of control it i guess an

6010
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:10,480
are gonna sort of control it i guess an
 

6011
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:13,109
are gonna sort of control it i guess an
easy answer is that maybe it won't be a

6012
01:51:13,109 --> 01:51:13,119
easy answer is that maybe it won't be a
 

6013
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:16,470
easy answer is that maybe it won't be a
big change in the end um

6014
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:16,480
big change in the end um
 

6015
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:20,470
big change in the end um
there's a utopian strain sometimes in in

6016
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:20,480
there's a utopian strain sometimes in in
 

6017
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,950
there's a utopian strain sometimes in in
the way people think about this that

6018
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:22,960
the way people think about this that
 

6019
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:25,189
the way people think about this that
i'm not so sure about

6020
01:51:25,189 --> 01:51:25,199
i'm not so sure about
 

6021
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:27,589
i'm not so sure about
there there's a there is a technological

6022
01:51:27,589 --> 01:51:27,599
there there's a there is a technological
 

6023
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:29,350
there there's a there is a technological
aspect to

6024
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:29,360
aspect to
 

6025
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:32,390
aspect to
bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

6026
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:32,400
bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
 

6027
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,950
bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
that make it a little easier

6028
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:34,960
that make it a little easier
 

6029
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:39,270
that make it a little easier
to uh pull along the utopian thread yeah

6030
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:39,280
to uh pull along the utopian thread yeah
 

6031
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,270
to uh pull along the utopian thread yeah
because it's harder for governments to

6032
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:41,280
because it's harder for governments to
 

6033
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,550
because it's harder for governments to
control

6034
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:42,560
control
 

6035
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:45,350
control
bitcoin yeah i mean they they have much

6036
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:45,360
bitcoin yeah i mean they they have much
 

6037
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,109
bitcoin yeah i mean they they have much
fewer options

6038
01:51:47,109 --> 01:51:47,119
fewer options
 

6039
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:49,350
fewer options
the they can ban they can make it

6040
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:49,360
the they can ban they can make it
 

6041
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,709
the they can ban they can make it
illegal

6042
01:51:50,709 --> 01:51:50,719
illegal
 

6043
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:52,950
illegal
it's more difficult yeah so technology

6044
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:52,960
it's more difficult yeah so technology
 

6045
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,950
it's more difficult yeah so technology
here is on the side of the powerless the

6046
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:54,960
here is on the side of the powerless the
 

6047
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:57,990
here is on the side of the powerless the
voiceless which is a very interesting

6048
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:58,000
voiceless which is a very interesting
 

6049
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,990
voiceless which is a very interesting
idea of course yes it does have a

6050
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:00,000
idea of course yes it does have a
 

6051
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,430
idea of course yes it does have a
utopian

6052
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:01,440
utopian
 

6053
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,510
utopian
feel to it but we have been making

6054
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:03,520
feel to it but we have been making
 

6055
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,589
feel to it but we have been making
progress throughout human history yeah

6056
01:52:05,589 --> 01:52:05,599
progress throughout human history yeah
 

6057
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,189
progress throughout human history yeah
maybe this is what progress looks like

6058
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:07,199
maybe this is what progress looks like
 

6059
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,310
maybe this is what progress looks like
there will be

6060
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:08,320
there will be
 

6061
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,629
there will be
the powerful and the greedy

6062
01:52:10,629 --> 01:52:10,639
the powerful and the greedy
 

6063
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:12,470
the powerful and the greedy
and the bureaucrats that take advantage

6064
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:12,480
and the bureaucrats that take advantage
 

6065
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,589
and the bureaucrats that take advantage
of it skim off the top kind of thing

6066
01:52:15,589 --> 01:52:15,599
of it skim off the top kind of thing
 

6067
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:17,750
of it skim off the top kind of thing
but maybe this does give um

6068
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:17,760
but maybe this does give um
 

6069
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:19,350
but maybe this does give um
more power to people that haven't had

6070
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:19,360
more power to people that haven't had
 

6071
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:20,709
more power to people that haven't had
power before

6072
01:52:20,709 --> 01:52:20,719
power before
 

6073
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:24,149
power before
in a good way like distributing power

6074
01:52:24,149 --> 01:52:24,159
in a good way like distributing power
 

6075
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:28,310
in a good way like distributing power
and enabling sort of more um

6076
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:28,320
and enabling sort of more um
 

6077
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,070
and enabling sort of more um
greater resistance to sort of uh

6078
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,080
greater resistance to sort of uh
 

6079
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,629
greater resistance to sort of uh
dictatorships and authoritarian regimes

6080
01:52:32,629 --> 01:52:32,639
dictatorships and authoritarian regimes
 

6081
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:34,149
dictatorships and authoritarian regimes
that kind of thing

6082
01:52:34,149 --> 01:52:34,159
that kind of thing
 

6083
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:34,950
that kind of thing
um

6084
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:34,960
um
 

6085
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:38,149
um
and also enabling all kinds of

6086
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:38,159
and also enabling all kinds of
 

6087
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,070
and also enabling all kinds of
technologies built built on top of it

6088
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:40,080
technologies built built on top of it
 

6089
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,750
technologies built built on top of it
ultimately when you

6090
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:41,760
ultimately when you
 

6091
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,430
ultimately when you
digitize money uh you know money is a

6092
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:45,440
digitize money uh you know money is a
 

6093
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,589
digitize money uh you know money is a
kind of speech or is it's kind of like

6094
01:52:47,589 --> 01:52:47,599
kind of speech or is it's kind of like
 

6095
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:48,629
kind of speech or is it's kind of like
um

6096
01:52:48,629 --> 01:52:48,639
um
 

6097
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:51,430
um
mechanism of

6098
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:51,440
mechanism of
 

6099
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,189
mechanism of
how humans interact

6100
01:52:53,189 --> 01:52:53,199
how humans interact
 

6101
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:54,790
how humans interact
and if you make that digital more and

6102
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:54,800
and if you make that digital more and
 

6103
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,870
and if you make that digital more and
more of the world moves to the digital

6104
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:56,880
more of the world moves to the digital
 

6105
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,750
more of the world moves to the digital
space and then you could have

6106
01:52:59,750 --> 01:52:59,760
space and then you could have
 

6107
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,189
space and then you could have
the

6108
01:53:01,189 --> 01:53:01,199
the
 

6109
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:02,790
the
then you can finally fully live in that

6110
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:02,800
then you can finally fully live in that
 

6111
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,870
then you can finally fully live in that
virtual reality with the toaster and

6112
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:04,880
virtual reality with the toaster and
 

6113
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:05,750
virtual reality with the toaster and
then

6114
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:05,760
then
 

6115
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:06,550
then
yeah

6116
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:06,560
yeah
 

6117
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,709
yeah
yeah in a lot of ways i think in that

6118
01:53:08,709 --> 01:53:08,719
yeah in a lot of ways i think in that
 

6119
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:10,950
yeah in a lot of ways i think in that
realm of technology that the money per

6120
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:10,960
realm of technology that the money per
 

6121
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,189
realm of technology that the money per
se is one of the less interesting things

6122
01:53:13,189 --> 01:53:13,199
se is one of the less interesting things
 

6123
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:15,109
se is one of the less interesting things
you can do with it so i think you know

6124
01:53:15,109 --> 01:53:15,119
you can do with it so i think you know
 

6125
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:17,350
you can do with it so i think you know
cryptographically enforceable contracts

6126
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:17,360
cryptographically enforceable contracts
 

6127
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:20,790
cryptographically enforceable contracts
and um and organizations built on those

6128
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:20,800
and um and organizations built on those
 

6129
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:23,510
and um and organizations built on those
that seems to me like it's got more

6130
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:23,520
that seems to me like it's got more
 

6131
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:26,870
that seems to me like it's got more
potential for change just because we do

6132
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:26,880
potential for change just because we do
 

6133
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,470
potential for change just because we do
already have

6134
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:28,480
already have
 

6135
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,990
already have
money

6136

6138
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:32,560
and although it's an old system
 

6139
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:35,430
and although it's an old system
um it's been digitized to a large extent

6140
01:53:35,430 --> 01:53:35,440
um it's been digitized to a large extent
 

6141

01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:52,390
sort of uh
making it more formal it's like

6156
01:53:52,390 --> 01:53:52,400
making it more formal it's like
 

6157
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:55,350
making it more formal it's like
mathematica more structured the

6158

mathematica more structured the
 

6159
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:59,030
mathematica more structured the

of uh
 

6163
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,910
of uh
all kinds of data about the the

6164
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:02,920
all kinds of data about the the
 

6165
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:05,830
all kinds of data about the the
the stuff in the world so they can make

6166
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:05,840
the stuff in the world so they can make
 

6167
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,790
the stuff in the world so they can make
contracts between people that in that's

6168
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:08,800
contracts between people that in that's
 

6169
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,550
contracts between people that in that's
grounded in data and that's actually

6170
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:10,560
grounded in data and that's actually
 

6171
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,750
grounded in data and that's actually
getting closer to

6172
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:13,760

 

6173
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,669

something like truth

6174
01:54:15,669 --> 01:54:15,679
something like truth
 

6175
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:17,189
something like truth
because then you can make agreements

6176
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:17,199
because then you can make agreements
 

6177
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:19,350
because then you can make agreements
based on actual data versus kind of

6178
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:19,360
based on actual data versus kind of
 

6179
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:22,790
based on actual data versus kind of
perceptions of data and if you can

6180
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:22,800
perceptions of data and if you can
 

6181
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,229
perceptions of data and if you can
formalize

6182
01:54:24,229 --> 01:54:24,239
formalize
 

6183
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:26,310
formalize
like distribute the power of who gets to

6184
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:26,320
like distribute the power of who gets to
 

6185
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,070
like distribute the power of who gets to
tell the story yeah

6186
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:28,080
tell the story yeah
 

6187
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:30,709
tell the story yeah
that that's an interesting kind of um

6188
01:54:30,709 --> 01:54:30,719
that that's an interesting kind of um
 

6189
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:33,430
that that's an interesting kind of um
resistance yeah again the

6190
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:33,440
resistance yeah again the
 

6191
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,189
resistance yeah again the
powerful in the space of narrative yeah

6192
01:54:35,189 --> 01:54:35,199
powerful in the space of narrative yeah

david brin has been saying for a while

6194
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:37,119
david brin has been saying for a while
 

6195
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:38,629
david brin has been saying for a while
that um

6196
01:54:38,629 --> 01:54:38,639
that um
 

6197
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:41,830
that um
the only way to settle arguments with

6198
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:41,840
the only way to settle arguments with
 

6199
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:44,229
the only way to settle arguments with
you know across the political divide

6200
01:54:44,229 --> 01:54:44,239
you know across the political divide
 

6201
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:46,629
you know across the political divide
is to to make bets

6202
01:54:46,629 --> 01:54:46,639
is to to make bets
 

6203
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:48,310
is to to make bets
so people can say

6204
01:54:48,310 --> 01:54:48,320
so people can say
 

6205
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,430
so people can say
you know

6206
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:49,440
you know
 

6207
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,990
you know
the election was stolen or you know what

6208
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:52,000
the election was stolen or you know what
 

6209
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,070
the election was stolen or you know what
whatever controversial

6210
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:54,080
whatever controversial
 

6211
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,070
whatever controversial
position they're they're taking

6212
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:56,080
position they're they're taking
 

6213
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:56,950
position they're they're taking
um

6214
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:56,960
um
 

6215
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:00,550
um
and they'll keep saying it until you

6216
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:00,560
and they'll keep saying it until you
 

6217
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:01,669
and they'll keep saying it until you
you uh

6218
01:55:01,669 --> 01:55:01,679
you uh
 

6219
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:05,350
you uh
you wager real money on it

6220
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:05,360
you wager real money on it
 

6221
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,950
you wager real money on it
so um

6222
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:06,960
so um
 

6223
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,910
so um
so maybe there's something there

6224
01:55:09,910 --> 01:55:09,920
so maybe there's something there
 

6225
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:12,950
so maybe there's something there
if you could uh kind of turn that into a

you've been handwriting your work for

6422
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:37,440
you've been handwriting your work for
 

6423
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,430
you've been handwriting your work for
the past 20 years since writing the

6424
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:39,440
the past 20 years since writing the
 

6425
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,830
the past 20 years since writing the
baroque cycle what are the pros and cons

6426
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:41,840
baroque cycle what are the pros and cons
 

6427
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:44,950
baroque cycle what are the pros and cons
of handwriting versus typing for me i

6428
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:44,960
of handwriting versus typing for me i
 

6429
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:46,950
of handwriting versus typing for me i
started it as an experiment when i

6430
01:58:46,950 --> 01:58:46,960
started it as an experiment when i
 

6431
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:49,270
started it as an experiment when i
started the baroque cycle because i had

6432
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:49,280
started the baroque cycle because i had
 

6433
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,109
started the baroque cycle because i had
noticed that if i sometimes if i was

6434
01:58:51,109 --> 01:58:51,119
noticed that if i sometimes if i was
 

6435
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:51,990
noticed that if i sometimes if i was
stuck

6436
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:52,000
stuck
 

6437
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,070
stuck
having a hard time getting started if i

6438
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:54,080
having a hard time getting started if i
 

6439
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:55,669
having a hard time getting started if i
just picked up a pen

6440
01:58:55,669 --> 01:58:55,679
just picked up a pen
 

6441
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:58,709
just picked up a pen
and started writing it was easy to

6442
01:58:58,709 --> 01:58:58,719
and started writing it was easy to
 

6443
01:58:58,719 --> 01:58:59,910
and started writing it was easy to
to go

6444
01:58:59,910 --> 01:58:59,920
to go
 

6445
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,270
to go
so

6446
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:01,280
so
 

6447
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:04,149
so
i just decided to keep with that if it

6448
01:59:04,149 --> 01:59:04,159
i just decided to keep with that if it
 

6449
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:06,070
i just decided to keep with that if it
got in my way i didn't like it i could

6450
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:06,080
got in my way i didn't like it i could
 

6451
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:07,669
got in my way i didn't like it i could
always just go back to the word

6452
01:59:07,669 --> 01:59:07,679
always just go back to the word
 

6453
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:10,070
always just go back to the word
processor it'd be fine so but i never

6454
01:59:10,070 --> 01:59:10,080
processor it'd be fine so but i never
 

6455
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,910
processor it'd be fine so but i never
that never happened so

6456
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:11,920
that never happened so
 

6457
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,310
that never happened so
there's a certain security that comes

6458
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:14,320
there's a certain security that comes
 

6459
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,550
there's a certain security that comes
from knowing that it's ink on paper and

6460
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:16,560
from knowing that it's ink on paper and
 

6461
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,390
from knowing that it's ink on paper and
there's no

6462
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:18,400
there's no
 

6463
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,709
there's no
operating system crash or software

6464
01:59:20,709 --> 01:59:20,719
operating system crash or software
 

6465
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:24,950
operating system crash or software
failure that can obliterate it

6466
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:24,960

 

6467
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,310

there's

6468
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,320

 

6469
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:31,030

it's a slower output

6470
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:31,040
it's a slower output
 

6471
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:32,870
it's a slower output
technique and so

6472
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:32,880
technique and so
 

6473
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,990
technique and so
um

6474
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
um
 

6475
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,390
um
a sentence or a paragraph spends a

6476
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:36,400
a sentence or a paragraph spends a
 

6477
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,870
a sentence or a paragraph spends a
longer time in the buffer up here

6478
01:59:38,870 --> 01:59:38,880
longer time in the buffer up here
 

6479
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:41,189
longer time in the buffer up here
before it gets committed

6480
01:59:41,189 --> 01:59:41,199
before it gets committed
 

6481
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:43,589
before it gets committed
to paper whereas i can type really fast

6482
01:59:43,589 --> 01:59:43,599
to paper whereas i can type really fast
 

6483
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:44,550
to paper whereas i can type really fast
and so

6484
01:59:44,550 --> 01:59:44,560
and so
 

6485
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,910
and so
i can slam things out before i've really

6486
01:59:47,910 --> 01:59:47,920
i can slam things out before i've really
 

6487
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:49,270
i can slam things out before i've really
thought them through so i think the

6488
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:49,280
thought them through so i think the
 

6489
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:54,070
thought them through so i think the
first draft quality ends up being higher

6490
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:54,080

 

6491
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:57,030

and then editing first draft of editing

6492
01:59:57,030 --> 01:59:57,040
and then editing first draft of editing
 

6493
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,910
and then editing first draft of editing
is just faster because

6494
01:59:59,910 --> 01:59:59,920
is just faster because
 

6495
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:01,270
is just faster because
instead of like trying to move the

6496
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:01,280
instead of like trying to move the
 

6497
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:04,149
instead of like trying to move the
cursor around or whatever

6498
02:00:04,149 --> 02:00:04,159
cursor around or whatever
 

6499
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:06,229
cursor around or whatever
or you know hitting the backspace key i

6500
02:00:06,229 --> 02:00:06,239
or you know hitting the backspace key i
 

6501
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:07,189
or you know hitting the backspace key i
can just

6502
02:00:07,189 --> 02:00:07,199
can just
 

6503
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:09,189
can just
draw a line through a word or a sentence

6504
02:00:09,189 --> 02:00:09,199
draw a line through a word or a sentence
 

6505
02:00:09,199 --> 02:00:09,990
draw a line through a word or a sentence
or

6506
02:00:09,990 --> 02:00:10,000
or
 

6507
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,310
or
just around a whole paragraph and exit

6508
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:12,320
just around a whole paragraph and exit
 

6509
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:13,270
just around a whole paragraph and exit
out

6510
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,280
out
 

6511
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:14,229
out
um

6512
02:00:14,229 --> 02:00:14,239
um
 

6513
02:00:14,239 --> 02:00:16,629
um
and in doing so i very quickly created

6514
02:00:16,629 --> 02:00:16,639
and in doing so i very quickly created
 

6515
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:18,310
and in doing so i very quickly created
an edit but i've also left behind a

6516
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:18,320
an edit but i've also left behind a
 

6517
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,470
an edit but i've also left behind a
record of what the text was prior to the

6518
02:00:20,470 --> 02:00:20,480
record of what the text was prior to the
 

6519
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,990
record of what the text was prior to the
edit

6520
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:22,000
edit
 

6521
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,149
edit
of course you know all the digital

6522
02:00:24,149 --> 02:00:24,159
of course you know all the digital
 

6523

of course you know all the digital
versions have those quote-unquote

6524
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:26,320
versions have those quote-unquote
 

6525
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,149
versions have those quote-unquote
features but their

6526
02:00:28,149 --> 02:00:28,159
features but their
 

6527
02:00:28,159 --> 02:00:31,189
features but their
experience is different yeah yeah is

6528
02:00:31,189 --> 02:00:31,199
experience is different yeah yeah is
 

6529
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:33,750
experience is different yeah yeah is
there a romance to just

6533
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,270

you know the touch of the pen to the

6534
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:39,280
you know the touch of the pen to the
 

6535
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:42,229
you know the touch of the pen to the
paper doing what has been done for

6536
02:00:42,229 --> 02:00:42,239
paper doing what has been done for
 

6537
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:44,229
paper doing what has been done for
centuries i think there is i think

6538
02:00:44,229 --> 02:00:44,239
centuries i think there is i think
 

6539
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:45,669
centuries i think there is i think
there's a

6540
02:00:45,669 --> 02:00:45,679
there's a
 

6541
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:47,669
there's a
just the simplicity of it

just the simplicity of it
 

6543
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:50,229
just the simplicity of it
and not having any intermediary

6544
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:50,239
and not having any intermediary
 

6545
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:52,709
and not having any intermediary
technology beyond the pen

6546
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:52,719
technology beyond the pen
 

6547
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:54,550
technology beyond the pen
and the paper

6548
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:54,560
and the paper
 

6549
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,430
and the paper
is just very simple and clean

6550
02:00:57,430 --> 02:00:57,440
is just very simple and clean
 

6551
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:00,950
is just very simple and clean
and

6552
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:00,960

 

6553
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,870

so i've got a bunch of fountain pens and

6554
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:02,880
so i've got a bunch of fountain pens and
 

6555
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:06,229
so i've got a bunch of fountain pens and
i i started buying fancy paper from

6556
02:01:06,229 --> 02:01:06,239
i i started buying fancy paper from
 

6557
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:09,510

futuristic question because emacs has
 

6585
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,950
futuristic question because emacs has
been around forever

6586

uh certainly in the in the um
 

6721
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,470
uh certainly in the in the um
software engineering space

6722
02:04:20,470 --> 02:04:20,480
software engineering space
 

6723
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:22,550
software engineering space
and it's interesting to think about

6724
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:22,560
and it's interesting to think about
 

6725
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:25,589
and it's interesting to think about
technologies that sort of last

6726
02:04:25,589 --> 02:04:25,599
technologies that sort of last
 

6727
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:28,149
technologies that sort of last
for a very long time

6728
02:04:28,149 --> 02:04:28,159
for a very long time
 

6729
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:31,589
for a very long time
and just kind of being in the

6730
02:04:31,589 --> 02:04:31,599
and just kind of being in the
 

6731
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:33,589
and just kind of being in the
what is it how do they get by it's like

6732
02:04:33,589 --> 02:04:33,599
what is it how do they get by it's like
 

6733
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:36,310
what is it how do they get by it's like
the the

6734
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:36,320

 

6735
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,470

the cockroaches of software or yeah the

6736
02:04:38,470 --> 02:04:38,480
the cockroaches of software or yeah the
 

6737
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,550
the cockroaches of software or yeah the
bacteria are soft or something they like

6738
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:40,560
bacteria are soft or something they like
 

6739
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,550
bacteria are soft or something they like
this base thing that nobody everybody's

6740
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:42,560
this base thing that nobody everybody's
 

6741
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,790
this base thing that nobody everybody's
just became reliant on

6742
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:44,800
just became reliant on
 

6743
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:45,830
just became reliant on
uh

6744
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840
uh
 

6745
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,830
uh
and they just outlast everything else

6746
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:47,840
and they just outlast everything else
 

6747
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:50,629
and they just outlast everything else
and slowly slowly adjust with the times

6748
02:04:50,629 --> 02:04:50,639
and slowly slowly adjust with the times
 

6749
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:52,550
and slowly slowly adjust with the times
with a little bit of a delay with a

6750
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:52,560
with a little bit of a delay with a
 

6751
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,390
with a little bit of a delay with a
little bit of customization by

6752
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:54,400
little bit of customization by
 

6753
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,629
little bit of customization by
individuals kind of that

6754
02:04:56,629 --> 02:04:56,639
individuals kind of that
 

6755
02:04:56,639 --> 02:04:58,390
individuals kind of that
but they're always there in the shadows

6756
02:04:58,390 --> 02:04:58,400
but they're always there in the shadows
 

6757
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:01,109
but they're always there in the shadows
yeah and they outlast everybody else

6758
02:05:01,109 --> 02:05:01,119
yeah and they outlast everybody else
 

6759
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:02,790
yeah and they outlast everybody else
and i wonder if that's

6760
02:05:02,790 --> 02:05:02,800
and i wonder if that's
 

6761
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:04,229
and i wonder if that's
that might be the story for a lot of

6762
02:05:04,229 --> 02:05:04,239
that might be the story for a lot of
 

6763
02:05:04,239 --> 02:05:05,830
that might be the story for a lot of
technologies especially in the software

6764
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:05,840
technologies especially in the software
 

6765
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:07,910
technologies especially in the software
space yeah shell scripts you know all

6766
02:05:07,910 --> 02:05:07,920
space yeah shell scripts you know all
 

6767
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:10,870
space yeah shell scripts you know all
that stuff you you you can't run the

6768
02:05:10,870 --> 02:05:10,880
that stuff you you you can't run the
 

6769
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:13,030
that stuff you you you can't run the
modern world without

6770
02:05:13,030 --> 02:05:13,040
modern world without
 

6771
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:15,030
modern world without
a bunch of shell scripts

6772
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:15,040
a bunch of shell scripts
 

6773
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,669
a bunch of shell scripts
you know booting out machines and

6774
02:05:17,669 --> 02:05:17,679
you know booting out machines and
 

6775
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:20,390
you know booting out machines and
and running things so um

6776
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:20,400
and running things so um
 

6777
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,550
and running things so um
it's

6778
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:22,560
it's
 

6779
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,149
it's
that is going to be a hard thing to to

6780
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:24,159
that is going to be a hard thing to to
 

6781
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:25,430
that is going to be a hard thing to to
replace

6782
02:05:25,430 --> 02:05:25,440
replace
 

6783
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,270
replace
and then tech for type setting that you

6784
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:27,280
and then tech for type setting that you
 

6785
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,030
and then tech for type setting that you
use you said

6786
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:29,040
use you said
 

6787
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,870
use you said
for when i when i want to print it out

6788
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:30,880
for when i when i want to print it out
 

6789
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:33,589
for when i when i want to print it out
yeah i just have some simple uh

6790
02:05:33,589 --> 02:05:33,599
yeah i just have some simple uh
 

6791
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:37,270
yeah i just have some simple uh
macros that i use but then i have to um

6792
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:37,280
macros that i use but then i have to um
 

6793
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,109
macros that i use but then i have to um
the the publisher put their foot down

6794
02:05:39,109 --> 02:05:39,119
the the publisher put their foot down
 

6795
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:41,510
the the publisher put their foot down
and they they want it in in word

6796
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:41,520
and they they want it in in word
 

6797
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:43,430
and they they want it in in word
format now so

6798
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:43,440
format now so
 

6799
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:44,470
format now so
um

6800
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:44,480
um
 

6801
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:48,790
um
years ago i wrote some macros to convert

6802
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:48,800
years ago i wrote some macros to convert
 

6803
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,870
years ago i wrote some macros to convert
and this time

6804
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:50,880
and this time
 

6805
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,069
and this time
what did i do

6806
02:05:52,069 --> 02:05:52,079
what did i do
 

6807
02:05:52,079 --> 02:05:53,350
what did i do
copy paste

6808
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,360
copy paste
 

6809
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:57,350
copy paste
no i um i use of regular expressions so

6810
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:57,360
no i um i use of regular expressions so
 

6811
02:05:57,360 --> 02:06:00,950
no i um i use of regular expressions so
i was to do italics in

6812
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:00,960
i was to do italics in
 

6813
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,629
i was to do italics in
you know you you put it in curly

6814
02:06:02,629 --> 02:06:02,639
you know you you put it in curly
 

6815
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:05,189
you know you you put it in curly
brackets and you do backslash id

6816
02:06:05,189 --> 02:06:05,199
brackets and you do backslash id
 

6817
02:06:05,199 --> 02:06:06,709
brackets and you do backslash id
and then you type what you want to type

6818
02:06:06,709 --> 02:06:06,719
and then you type what you want to type
 

6819
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:09,669
and then you type what you want to type
and that's how you get italics in tech

6820
02:06:09,669 --> 02:06:09,679
and that's how you get italics in tech
 

6821
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:10,550
and that's how you get italics in tech
so

6822
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:10,560
so
 

6823
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,709
so
you can create a regular expression

6824
02:06:12,709 --> 02:06:12,719
you can create a regular expression
 

6825
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:15,830
you can create a regular expression
that'll look for some text between curly

6826
02:06:15,830 --> 02:06:15,840
that'll look for some text between curly
 

6827
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,830
that'll look for some text between curly
brackets preceded by

6828
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:17,840
brackets preceded by
 

6829
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:20,310
brackets preceded by
backslash i.t and then

6830
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:20,320
backslash i.t and then
 

6831
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,790
backslash i.t and then
instead

6832
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:22,800
instead
 

6833
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:25,669
instead
convert that to italics and word will do

6834
02:06:25,669 --> 02:06:25,679
convert that to italics and word will do
 

6835
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:27,990
convert that to italics and word will do
that

6836
02:06:27,990 --> 02:06:28,000
that
 

6837
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,830
that
word if you go deep enough into its

6838
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:29,840
word if you go deep enough into its
 

6839
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:32,149
word if you go deep enough into its
search and replace

6840
02:06:32,149 --> 02:06:32,159
search and replace
 

6841
02:06:32,159 --> 02:06:34,550
search and replace
ui can do regular expressions is just

6842
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:34,560
ui can do regular expressions is just
 

6843
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,470
ui can do regular expressions is just
reg apps

6844
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:36,480
reg apps
 

6845
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:38,709
reg apps
yeah it's funny that you did that yeah i

6846
02:06:38,709 --> 02:06:38,719
yeah it's funny that you did that yeah i
 

6847
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:40,390
yeah it's funny that you did that yeah i
mean i'm sure there's tools that help

6848
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:40,400
mean i'm sure there's tools that help
 

6849
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:42,709
mean i'm sure there's tools that help
you with that kind of thing but but the

6850
02:06:42,709 --> 02:06:42,719
you with that kind of thing but but the
 

6851
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:45,430
you with that kind of thing but but the
task is sufficiently

6852
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:45,440
task is sufficiently
 

6853
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:46,950
task is sufficiently
simple

6854
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:46,960
simple
 

6855
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,470
simple
to where you can do a much better job

6856
02:06:48,470 --> 02:06:48,480
to where you can do a much better job
 

6857
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:51,430
to where you can do a much better job
than anyone anybody else's tool can yeah

6858
02:06:51,430 --> 02:06:51,440
than anyone anybody else's tool can yeah
 

6859
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:53,830
than anyone anybody else's tool can yeah
yeah so this is a fascinating process it

6860
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:53,840
yeah so this is a fascinating process it
 

6861
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,990
yeah so this is a fascinating process it
works fine for me yeah

6862
02:06:55,990 --> 02:06:56,000
works fine for me yeah
 

6863
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,510
works fine for me yeah
and it keeps you from messing around

6864
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:57,520
and it keeps you from messing around
 

6865
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:58,870
and it keeps you from messing around
with formatting

6866
02:06:58,870 --> 02:06:58,880
with formatting
 

6867
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:00,069
with formatting
yeah like

6868
02:07:00,069 --> 02:07:00,079
yeah like
 

6869
02:07:00,079 --> 02:07:02,550
yeah like
oh what if i put this chapter heading

6870
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:02,560
oh what if i put this chapter heading
 

6871
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:04,069
oh what if i put this chapter heading
you know in

6872
02:07:04,069 --> 02:07:04,079
you know in
 

6873
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:06,229
you know in
you know a sans-serif font you know it's

6874
02:07:06,229 --> 02:07:06,239
you know a sans-serif font you know it's
 

6875
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:08,950
you know a sans-serif font you know it's
a it's just classic wanking

6876
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:08,960
a it's just classic wanking
 

6877
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:12,550
a it's just classic wanking
um and so you the the

6878
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:12,560
um and so you the the
 

6879
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,790
um and so you the the
those options are closed off in what i'm

6880
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:14,800
those options are closed off in what i'm
 

6881
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,149
those options are closed off in what i'm
doing

6882
02:07:16,149 --> 02:07:16,159
doing
 

6883
02:07:16,159 --> 02:07:18,149
doing

scenario in their heads like a kind of
 

6935
02:08:08,239 --> 02:08:10,870
scenario in their heads like a kind of
virtual reality and see

virtual reality and see
 

6937
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:12,550

know a bunch of stuff now about how to
 

6947
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:25,350
know a bunch of stuff now about how to
stay alive that they could not have

as far as we know they can't
 

6969

tell more complicated stories
 

6971
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:48,870
tell more complicated stories
so it's a part of us yeah

6972
02:08:48,870 --> 02:08:48,880
so it's a part of us yeah
 

6973
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:50,470
so it's a part of us yeah
the the the collective intelligence

6974
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:50,480
the the the collective intelligence
 

6975
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:51,910
the the the collective intelligence
seems to be one of the the key

6976
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:51,920
seems to be one of the the key
 

6977
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:54,629
seems to be one of the the key
characteristics of the of homo sapiens

6978
02:08:54,629 --> 02:08:54,639
characteristics of the of homo sapiens
 

6979
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:56,149
characteristics of the of homo sapiens
the ability to

6980
02:08:56,149 --> 02:08:56,159
the ability to
 

6981
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:58,310
the ability to
share ideas and hold ideas together in

share ideas and hold ideas together in
 

6983
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:00,390
share ideas and hold ideas together in
our minds and storytelling is the

6984
02:09:00,390 --> 02:09:00,400
our minds and storytelling is the
 

6985
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,310
our minds and storytelling is the
fundamental aspect of that maybe even

6986
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:02,320
fundamental aspect of that maybe even
 

6987
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:06,069
fundamental aspect of that maybe even
language itself is more fundamental yeah

6988
02:09:06,069 --> 02:09:06,079
language itself is more fundamental yeah
 

6989
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:06,870
language itself is more fundamental yeah
because

6990
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:06,880
because
 

6991
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,470
because
the language is required to do the

6992
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:08,480
the language is required to do the
 

6993
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,629
the language is required to do the
storytelling or maybe they evolve

6994
02:09:10,629 --> 02:09:10,639
storytelling or maybe they evolve
 

6995
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:13,350
storytelling or maybe they evolve
together maybe they co-evolve yeah

6996
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:13,360
together maybe they co-evolve yeah
 

6997
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:15,430
together maybe they co-evolve yeah

7135
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:49,910
i'm not i'm not sure what that is
uh maybe because it becomes more real to

7136
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:49,920
uh maybe because it becomes more real to
 

7137
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:52,709
uh maybe because it becomes more real to
the people writing the story maybe it

the readers to suspend their
their disbelief and there's all kinds of

02:12:01,589 --> 02:12:01,599
their disbelief and there's all kinds of
 

7149
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:04,229
their disbelief and there's all kinds of
triggers and little tells that can break

triggers and little tells that can break
 

7151
02:12:04,239 --> 02:12:07,109
triggers and little tells that can break
that right um and once it's broken it's

7152
02:12:07,109 --> 02:12:07,119
that right um and once it's broken it's
 

7153
02:12:07,119 --> 02:12:09,109
that right um and once it's broken it's
really hard to get it back

7154
02:12:09,109 --> 02:12:09,119
really hard to get it back
 

7155
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:11,430
really hard to get it back
uh yeah you know a lot of times that's

7156
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:11,440
uh yeah you know a lot of times that's
 

7157
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:13,270
uh yeah you know a lot of times that's
the end somebody will just close the

7158
02:12:13,270 --> 02:12:13,280
the end somebody will just close the
 

7159
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:14,629
the end somebody will just close the

02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:17,830
pick it up
i get to ask you've answered this

7164
02:12:17,830 --> 02:12:17,840
i get to ask you've answered this
 

7165
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:21,189
i get to ask you've answered this
question but i got to ask you

7166
02:12:21,189 --> 02:12:21,199
question but i got to ask you
 

7167
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:23,189
question but i got to ask you
the most impossible question for an

7168
02:12:23,189 --> 02:12:23,199
the most impossible question for an
 

7169
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:25,189
the most impossible question for an
author to answer but

7170
02:12:25,189 --> 02:12:25,199
author to answer but
 

7171
02:12:25,199 --> 02:12:27,589

02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:30,069
which neil stephenson book
should one read first

7174
02:12:30,069 --> 02:12:30,079
should one read first
 

7175
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:32,629
should one read first
so when people ask me that i usually ask

7176
02:12:32,629 --> 02:12:32,639
so when people ask me that i usually ask
 

7177
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:34,390
so when people ask me that i usually ask
them what they like to read

7178
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:34,400
them what they like to read
 

7179
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,589
them what they like to read
right because

7180
02:12:35,589 --> 02:12:35,599
right because
 

7181
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:36,550
right because
i mean

7182
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:36,560
i mean
 

7183
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:37,750
i mean
there's

7184
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:37,760
there's
 

7185
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,510
there's
the best known one is probably snow

7186
02:12:39,510 --> 02:12:39,520
the best known one is probably snow
 

7187
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,750
the best known one is probably snow
crash but that's a

7188
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,760
crash but that's a
 

7189
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,830
crash but that's a
a cyberpunk novel that's at the same

7190
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:43,840
a cyberpunk novel that's at the same
 

7191
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:46,870
a cyberpunk novel that's at the same
time making fun of cyberpunk

7192
02:12:46,870 --> 02:12:46,880
time making fun of cyberpunk
 

7193
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:49,589
time making fun of cyberpunk
so it's kind of got some layers to it

7194
02:12:49,589 --> 02:12:49,599
so it's kind of got some layers to it
 

7195
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:50,709
so it's kind of got some layers to it
that

7196
02:12:50,709 --> 02:12:50,719
that
 

7197
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:52,149
that
might not

7198
02:12:52,149 --> 02:12:52,159
might not
 

7199
02:12:52,159 --> 02:12:54,790
might not
seem so funny if you don't have that if

7200
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:54,800
seem so funny if you don't have that if
 

7201
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,790
seem so funny if you don't have that if
you don't get the joke right

7202
02:12:56,790 --> 02:12:56,800
you don't get the joke right
 

7203
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,709
you don't get the joke right
so

7204
02:12:58,709 --> 02:12:58,719
so
 

7205
02:12:58,719 --> 02:12:59,830
so
there's

7206
02:12:59,830 --> 02:12:59,840
there's
 

7207
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:01,189
there's
i've written as you point out i've

7208
02:13:01,189 --> 02:13:01,199
i've written as you point out i've
 

7209
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:02,390
i've written as you point out i've
written historical

7210
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:02,400

7211
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,550

um
uh but hopefully the story is told

7294
02:14:36,149 --> 02:14:36,159
uh but hopefully the story is told
 

7295
02:14:36,159 --> 02:14:38,790
uh but hopefully the story is told
through a cast of characters that uh

7296
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:38,800
through a cast of characters that uh
 

7297
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:40,629
through a cast of characters that uh
people can relate to

7298
02:14:40,629 --> 02:14:40,639
people can relate to

uh
so uh it does go kind of deep eventually

7304
02:14:47,350 --> 02:14:47,360
so uh it does go kind of deep eventually
 

7305
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:48,229
so uh it does go kind of deep eventually
on

7306
02:14:48,229 --> 02:14:48,239
on
 

7307
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:50,310

02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:54,870
um
people were able to get through it

7314
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:54,880
people were able to get through it
 

7315
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:56,390
people were able to get through it
anyway or some people just skip over

7316
02:14:56,390 --> 02:14:56,400
anyway or some people just skip over
 

7317
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:57,270
anyway or some people just skip over
that

7318
02:14:57,270 --> 02:14:57,280
that
 

7319
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,550
that
it's fine

7320
02:14:58,550 --> 02:14:58,560
it's fine
 

7321
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:00,069
it's fine
you know

7322
02:15:00,069 --> 02:15:00,079
you know
 

7323
02:15:00,079 --> 02:15:00,870
you know
um

7324
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:00,880

to mind
 

7333
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:12,950
to mind
that you learned from as a writer as a

7334
02:15:12,950 --> 02:15:12,960
that you learned from as a writer as a
 

7335

that you learned from as a writer as a
philosopher as a mathematician as an

7336
02:15:15,189 --> 02:15:15,199
philosopher as a mathematician as an
 

7337
02:15:15,199 --> 02:15:16,870
philosopher as a mathematician as an
engineer

7338
02:15:16,870 --> 02:15:16,880
engineer
 

7339
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:18,390
engineer
this is one of these questions where i

7340
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:18,400
this is one of these questions where i
 

7341
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:20,629
this is one of these questions where i
always blank out and then when i'm

7342
02:15:20,629 --> 02:15:20,639
always blank out and then when i'm
 

7343
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:23,669
always blank out and then when i'm
walking out the door oh i'll remember

7344
02:15:23,669 --> 02:15:23,679
walking out the door oh i'll remember
 

7345
02:15:23,679 --> 02:15:26,069
walking out the door oh i'll remember
12. so this is a random selection that

7346
02:15:26,069 --> 02:15:26,079
12. so this is a random selection that
 

7347
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:29,430
12. so this is a random selection that
doesn't represent the top the top ones

7348
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:29,440
doesn't represent the top the top ones
 

7349
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:31,589
doesn't represent the top the top ones
um well i mentioned you know gulag

02:25:17,750 --> 02:25:17,760
different environment like uh
 

7891
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:19,910
different environment like uh
you know austin

7892
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:19,920
you know austin
 

7893

uh has some of this
um

7896
02:25:23,190 --> 02:25:23,200
um
 

7897
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:26,150
um
so as a pretty kind of utopian

7898
02:25:26,150 --> 02:25:26,160
so as a pretty kind of utopian
 

7899
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:27,830
so as a pretty kind of utopian
other than the weather and a few other

7900
02:25:27,830 --> 02:25:27,840
other than the weather and a few other
 

7901
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:28,870
other than the weather and a few other
things

7902
02:25:28,870 --> 02:25:28,880
things
 

7903
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:31,830
things
uh environment to grow up in

7904
02:25:31,830 --> 02:25:31,840
uh environment to grow up in
 

7905
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:33,830
uh environment to grow up in
the the martial art i ended up doing is

7906
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:33,840
the the martial art i ended up doing is
 

7907
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:35,990
the the martial art i ended up doing is
sword stuff which is

7908
02:25:35,990 --> 02:25:36,000
sword stuff which is
 

7909
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,389
sword stuff which is
interesting because it uses a different

7910
02:25:38,389 --> 02:25:38,399
interesting because it uses a different
 

7911
02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:40,550
interesting because it uses a different
feedback loop so when you're if you're

7912
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:40,560
feedback loop so when you're if you're
 

7913
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:43,349
feedback loop so when you're if you're
grappling

7914
02:25:43,349 --> 02:25:43,359

 

7915
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:46,070

everything is through sense of touch

7916
02:25:46,070 --> 02:25:46,080
everything is through sense of touch
 

7917
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:49,110
everything is through sense of touch
and your sense of touch is very old

7918
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:49,120
and your sense of touch is very old
 

7919
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:52,389
and your sense of touch is very old
and simple right like earthworms

7920
02:25:52,389 --> 02:25:52,399
and simple right like earthworms
 

7921
02:25:52,399 --> 02:25:54,710
and simple right like earthworms
don't have don't even have eyes but you

7922
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:54,720
don't have don't even have eyes but you
 

7923
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:56,309
don't have don't even have eyes but you
they can tell when they're being touched

7924
02:25:56,309 --> 02:25:56,319
they can tell when they're being touched
 

7925
02:25:56,319 --> 02:25:57,510
they can tell when they're being touched
right so

7926
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:57,520
right so
 

7927
02:25:57,520 --> 02:25:59,510
right so
it's very fast

7928
02:25:59,510 --> 02:25:59,520
it's very fast
 

7929
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:00,790
it's very fast
um

7930
02:26:00,790 --> 02:26:00,800
um
 

7931
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:02,389
um
and uh

7932
02:26:02,389 --> 02:26:02,399
and uh
 

7933
02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:04,309
and uh
with um

7934
02:26:04,309 --> 02:26:04,319
with um
 

7935
02:26:04,319 --> 02:26:07,429
with um
with a standoff or like boxing or some

7936
02:26:07,429 --> 02:26:07,439
with a standoff or like boxing or some
 

7937
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:10,070
with a standoff or like boxing or some
kind of sword fighting you're

7938
02:26:10,070 --> 02:26:10,080
kind of sword fighting you're
 

7939
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:11,429
kind of sword fighting you're
you're not touching the other person

7940
02:26:11,429 --> 02:26:11,439
you're not touching the other person
 

7941
02:26:11,439 --> 02:26:13,270
you're not touching the other person
most of the time your

7942
02:26:13,270 --> 02:26:13,280
most of the time your
 

7943
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:15,670
most of the time your
your uh your visual system is doing

7944
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:15,680
your uh your visual system is doing
 

7945
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:19,429
your uh your visual system is doing
something way more it's doing slam

7946
02:26:19,429 --> 02:26:19,439
something way more it's doing slam
 

7947
02:26:19,439 --> 02:26:21,030
something way more it's doing slam
and trying to figure out what the other

7948
02:26:21,030 --> 02:26:21,040
and trying to figure out what the other
 

7949
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:23,110
and trying to figure out what the other
person is up to

7950
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:23,120
person is up to
 

7951
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:25,110
person is up to
and so

7952
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:25,120
and so
 

7953
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:28,070
and so
that always fell more my speed

7954
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:28,080
that always fell more my speed
 

7955
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:29,270
that always fell more my speed
so in

7956
02:26:29,270 --> 02:26:29,280
so in
 

7957
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:31,910
so in
in olympic style fencing

7958
02:26:31,910 --> 02:26:31,920
in olympic style fencing
 

7959
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:32,870
in olympic style fencing
your

7960
02:26:32,870 --> 02:26:32,880
your
 

7961
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:35,590
your
it doesn't start really until you're

7962
02:26:35,590 --> 02:26:35,600
it doesn't start really until you're
 

7963
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:37,510
it doesn't start really until you're
crossing blades with the other person

7964
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:37,520
crossing blades with the other person
 

7965
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:39,670
crossing blades with the other person
and now you're back to wrestling you're

7966
02:26:39,670 --> 02:26:39,680
and now you're back to wrestling you're
 

7967
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:40,870
and now you're back to wrestling you're
feeling

7968
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:40,880
feeling
 

7969
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,790
feeling
what they're doing and it's all about

7970
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:42,800
what they're doing and it's all about
 

7971
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:44,309
what they're doing and it's all about
that but

7972
02:26:44,309 --> 02:26:44,319
that but
 

7973
02:26:44,319 --> 02:26:47,190
that but
some of the older sword arts um

7974
02:26:47,190 --> 02:26:47,200
some of the older sword arts um
 

7975
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:49,990
some of the older sword arts um
don't engage the the blade that way you

7976
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:50,000
don't engage the the blade that way you
 

7977
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,630
don't engage the the blade that way you
stand off their range and then you make

7978
02:26:52,630 --> 02:26:52,640
stand off their range and then you make
 

7979
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:53,510
stand off their range and then you make
cutting

7980
02:26:53,510 --> 02:26:53,520
cutting
 

7981
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:54,950
cutting
attacks

7982
02:26:54,950 --> 02:26:54,960
attacks
 

7983
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:55,660
attacks
and um

7984
02:26:55,660 --> 02:26:55,670
and um
 

7985
02:26:55,670 --> 02:26:56,950
and um
[Music]

7986
02:26:56,950 --> 02:26:56,960
[Music]
 

7987
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:57,750
[Music]
and

7988
02:26:57,750 --> 02:26:57,760
and
 

7989
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:00,950
and
uh and so so those are all processed

7990
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:00,960
uh and so so those are all processed
 

7991
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:02,710
uh and so so those are all processed
visually and

7992
02:27:02,710 --> 02:27:02,720
visually and
 

7993
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:04,950
visually and
i think i'm more of a slow

7994
02:27:04,950 --> 02:27:04,960
i think i'm more of a slow
 

7995
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:06,070
i think i'm more of a slow
thinker

7996
02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:06,080
thinker
 

7997
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:07,830
thinker
so it works for me

7998
02:27:07,830 --> 02:27:07,840
so it works for me
 

7999
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:10,469
so it works for me
better i mean the same so it has the

8000
02:27:10,469 --> 02:27:10,479
better i mean the same so it has the
 

8001
02:27:10,479 --> 02:27:11,270
better i mean the same so it has the
same

8002
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:11,280
same
 

8003
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:13,030
same
the artistry and the beauty of boxing i

8004
02:27:13,030 --> 02:27:13,040
the artistry and the beauty of boxing i
 

8005
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:14,790
the artistry and the beauty of boxing i
suppose just like you said

8006
02:27:14,790 --> 02:27:14,800
suppose just like you said
 

8007
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:16,710
suppose just like you said
is like there's no there's no contact

8008
02:27:16,710 --> 02:27:16,720
is like there's no there's no contact
 

8009
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:18,870
is like there's no there's no contact
and it's all processed visually and i'm

8010
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:18,880
and it's all processed visually and i'm
 

8011
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:21,670
and it's all processed visually and i'm
sure there's a dance of its own yeah

8012
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:21,680
sure there's a dance of its own yeah
 

8013
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:23,429
sure there's a dance of its own yeah
that that depends on the characteristic

8014
02:27:23,429 --> 02:27:23,439
that that depends on the characteristic
 

8015
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:25,830
that that depends on the characteristic
of a sword involved yeah there's a set

8016
02:27:25,830 --> 02:27:25,840
of a sword involved yeah there's a set
 

8017
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:29,190
of a sword involved yeah there's a set
of of stances and and uh basic reactions

8018
02:27:29,190 --> 02:27:29,200
of of stances and and uh basic reactions
 

8019
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:31,590
of of stances and and uh basic reactions
that you try to learn that are thought

8020
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:31,600
that you try to learn that are thought
 

8021
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,110
that you try to learn that are thought
to be

8022
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:33,120
to be
 

8023
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:37,030
to be
defensible um and and safe or safer

8024
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:37,040
defensible um and and safe or safer
 

8025
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:37,830
defensible um and and safe or safer
and

8026
02:27:37,830 --> 02:27:37,840
and
 

8027
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:39,510
and
so it tends to be a series of short

8028
02:27:39,510 --> 02:27:39,520

it's required to be innovative in this
world you think quite a bit about the

8204

future what advice would you give them
 

8211
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:05,110
future what advice would you give them
i think a big part of it is

8212
02:31:05,110 --> 02:31:05,120
i think a big part of it is
 

8213
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:09,349
i think a big part of it is
finding the thing that you will do

8214
02:31:09,349 --> 02:31:09,359

 

8215
02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:11,910

happily and

8216
02:31:11,910 --> 02:31:11,920
happily and
 

8217
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:13,830
happily and
i don't want to say obsessively because

8218
02:31:13,830 --> 02:31:13,840
i don't want to say obsessively because
 

8219
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:16,070
i don't want to say obsessively because
that sounds like maybe it's pathological

8220
02:31:16,070 --> 02:31:16,080
that sounds like maybe it's pathological
 

8221
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:16,870
that sounds like maybe it's pathological
but

8222
02:31:16,870 --> 02:31:16,880
but
 

8223
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:19,429
but
but if you can find a thing that you'll

8224
02:31:19,429 --> 02:31:19,439
but if you can find a thing that you'll
 

8225
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:21,030
but if you can find a thing that you'll
you know you'll sit down you'll start

8226
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:21,040
you know you'll sit down you'll start
 

8227
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,469
you know you'll sit down you'll start
doing it and

8228
02:31:22,469 --> 02:31:22,479
doing it and
 

8229
02:31:22,479 --> 02:31:24,870
doing it and
hours later you kind of snap out of it

8230
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:24,880
hours later you kind of snap out of it
 

8231
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,870
hours later you kind of snap out of it
where did the time go

8232
02:31:26,870 --> 02:31:26,880
where did the time go
 

8233
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:29,910
where did the time go
um then

8234
02:31:29,910 --> 02:31:29,920
um then
 

8235
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:31,670
um then
that's a really key

8236
02:31:31,670 --> 02:31:31,680
that's a really key
 

8237
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:33,429
that's a really key
discovery for

8238
02:31:33,429 --> 02:31:33,439
discovery for
 

8239
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:35,510
discovery for
anyone to make about themselves when

8240
02:31:35,510 --> 02:31:35,520
anyone to make about themselves when
 

8241
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:37,030
anyone to make about themselves when
they're young

8242
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:37,040
they're young
 

8243
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:39,990
they're young
because if you don't have that

8244
02:31:39,990 --> 02:31:40,000
because if you don't have that
 

8245
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,270
because if you don't have that
it's hard to

8246
02:31:41,270 --> 02:31:41,280
it's hard to
 

8247
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:43,110
it's hard to
to figure out where you should put your

8248
02:31:43,110 --> 02:31:43,120
to figure out where you should put your
 

8249
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:44,309
to figure out where you should put your
energies

8250
02:31:44,309 --> 02:31:44,319
energies
 

8251
02:31:44,319 --> 02:31:45,349
energies
you know

8252
02:31:45,349 --> 02:31:45,359
you know
 

8253
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:46,790
you know
and as you might have the best

8254
02:31:46,790 --> 02:31:46,800
and as you might have the best
 

8255
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,550
and as you might have the best
intentions you might say i you know i

8256
02:31:48,550 --> 02:31:48,560
intentions you might say i you know i
 

8257
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:49,590
intentions you might say i you know i
want

8258
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:49,600
want
 

8259
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,830
want
world peace or whatever

8260
02:31:51,830 --> 02:31:51,840
world peace or whatever
 

8261
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:54,230
world peace or whatever
uh but um

8262
02:31:54,230 --> 02:31:54,240
uh but um
 

8263
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:55,110
uh but um
uh

8264
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:55,120
uh
 

8265
02:31:55,120 --> 02:31:56,389
uh
at the end of the day what really

8266
02:31:56,389 --> 02:31:56,399
at the end of the day what really
 

8267
02:31:56,399 --> 02:31:59,510
at the end of the day what really
matters is how do you spend your time

8268
02:31:59,510 --> 02:31:59,520
matters is how do you spend your time
 

8269
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,830
matters is how do you spend your time
and are you spending it in a way that's

8270
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:01,840
and are you spending it in a way that's
 

8271
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:03,670
and are you spending it in a way that's
productive uh

8272
02:32:03,670 --> 02:32:03,680
productive uh
 

8273
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,349
productive uh
and um

8274
02:32:05,349 --> 02:32:05,359
and um
 

8275
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:06,550
and um
uh

8276
02:32:06,550 --> 02:32:06,560
uh
 

8277
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:08,790
uh
because it doesn't matter how smart you

8278
02:32:08,790 --> 02:32:08,800
because it doesn't matter how smart you
 

8279
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:11,110
because it doesn't matter how smart you
are or well-intentioned you are unless

8280
02:32:11,110 --> 02:32:11,120
are or well-intentioned you are unless
 

8281
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:11,990
are or well-intentioned you are unless
you've

8282
02:32:11,990 --> 02:32:12,000
you've
 

8283
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,349
you've
figured that out

8284
02:32:13,349 --> 02:32:13,359
figured that out
 

8285
02:32:13,359 --> 02:32:15,349
figured that out
and so finding that thing in which you

8286
02:32:15,349 --> 02:32:15,359
and so finding that thing in which you
 

8287
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:17,670
and so finding that thing in which you
can sort of you naturally lose yourself

8288
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:17,680
can sort of you naturally lose yourself
 

8289
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:18,550
can sort of you naturally lose yourself
in

8290
02:32:18,550 --> 02:32:18,560
in
 

8291
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:21,270
in
the thing is

8292
02:32:21,270 --> 02:32:21,280

 

8293
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:23,270

at least for me

8294
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,280
at least for me
 

8295
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:25,510
at least for me
there's a lot of things like that but i

8296
02:32:25,510 --> 02:32:25,520
there's a lot of things like that but i
 

8297
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:28,230
there's a lot of things like that but i
first have to overcome the initial hump

8298
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:28,240
first have to overcome the initial hump
 

8299
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:30,870
first have to overcome the initial hump
of really sucking at that thing

8300
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:30,880
of really sucking at that thing
 

8301
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:33,670
of really sucking at that thing
like the fun starts a little bit

8302
02:32:33,670 --> 02:32:33,680
like the fun starts a little bit
 

8303
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:35,510
like the fun starts a little bit
after the first hump of really sucking

8304
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:35,520
after the first hump of really sucking
 

8305
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:37,910
after the first hump of really sucking
and then you could suck just regularly

8306
02:32:37,910 --> 02:32:37,920
and then you could suck just regularly
 

8307
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:39,030
and then you could suck just regularly
yeah

8308
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:39,040
yeah
 

8309
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:41,270
yeah
so often people oftentimes people can

8310
02:32:41,270 --> 02:32:41,280
so often people oftentimes people can
 

8311
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:43,349
so often people oftentimes people can
give up too early i think i mean that's

8312
02:32:43,349 --> 02:32:43,359
give up too early i think i mean that's
 

8313
02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:45,750
give up too early i think i mean that's
true with mathematics for me it's

8314
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:45,760
true with mathematics for me it's
 

8315
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:47,349
true with mathematics for me it's
for a lot of people

8316
02:32:47,349 --> 02:32:47,359
for a lot of people
 

8317
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:48,790
for a lot of people
is if you just give it a chance to

8318
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:48,800
is if you just give it a chance to
 

8319
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:49,910
is if you just give it a chance to
struggle

8320
02:32:49,910 --> 02:32:49,920
struggle
 

8321
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:51,910
struggle
if you give yourself time to struggle

8322
02:32:51,910 --> 02:32:51,920
if you give yourself time to struggle
 

8323
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:54,070
if you give yourself time to struggle
you'll find a way

8324
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:54,080
you'll find a way
 

8325
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:56,389
you'll find a way
you'll find the thing within that thing

8326
02:32:56,389 --> 02:32:56,399
you'll find the thing within that thing
 

8327
02:32:56,399 --> 02:32:58,870
you'll find the thing within that thing
that you can lose track of time with

8328
02:32:58,870 --> 02:32:58,880
that you can lose track of time with
 

8329
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:00,389
that you can lose track of time with
yeah that's a key

8330
02:33:00,389 --> 02:33:00,399
yeah that's a key
 

8331
02:33:00,399 --> 02:33:03,110
yeah that's a key
detail that um

8332
02:33:03,110 --> 02:33:03,120
detail that um
 

8333
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:05,110
detail that um
there's an important thing to add to to

8334
02:33:05,110 --> 02:33:05,120
there's an important thing to add to to
 

8335
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:07,110
there's an important thing to add to to
what i said which is that

8336
02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:07,120
what i said which is that
 

8337
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:09,349
what i said which is that
this might not happen the first time you

8338
02:33:09,349 --> 02:33:09,359
this might not happen the first time you
 

8339
02:33:09,359 --> 02:33:10,630
this might not happen the first time you
do a thing

8340
02:33:10,630 --> 02:33:10,640
do a thing
 

8341
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:12,870
do a thing
maybe it will but um

8342
02:33:12,870 --> 02:33:12,880
maybe it will but um
 

8343
02:33:12,880 --> 02:33:15,429
maybe it will but um
uh you might have to climb that learning

8344
02:33:15,429 --> 02:33:15,439
uh you might have to climb that learning
 

8345
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:17,270
uh you might have to climb that learning
curve and um

8346
02:33:17,270 --> 02:33:17,280
curve and um
 

8347
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:19,110
curve and um
if there's pressures in your life that

8348
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:19,120
if there's pressures in your life that
 

8349
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:22,150
if there's pressures in your life that
are making you feel bad about that

8350
02:33:22,150 --> 02:33:22,160
are making you feel bad about that
 

8351
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:23,349
are making you feel bad about that
then

8352
02:33:23,349 --> 02:33:23,359
then
 

8353
02:33:23,359 --> 02:33:25,110
then
it might prevent you

8354
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:25,120
it might prevent you
 

8355
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:26,070
it might prevent you
from

8356
02:33:26,070 --> 02:33:26,080
from
 

8357
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:29,990
from
from getting where you need to be

8358
02:33:29,990 --> 02:33:30,000

 

8359
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:33,110

so there's some complexity there

8360
02:33:33,110 --> 02:33:33,120
so there's some complexity there
 

8361
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:34,389
so there's some complexity there
that may can make this kind of

8362
02:33:34,389 --> 02:33:34,399
that may can make this kind of
 

8363
02:33:34,399 --> 02:33:36,630
that may can make this kind of
non-obvious

8364
02:33:36,630 --> 02:33:36,640
non-obvious
 

8365
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:38,630
non-obvious
but uh that's what

8366
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:38,640
but uh that's what
 

8367
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:40,070
but uh that's what
that's why we

8368
02:33:40,070 --> 02:33:40,080
that's why we
 

8369
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:42,230
that's why we
need you know good teachers

8370
02:33:42,230 --> 02:33:42,240

02:36:20,469 --> 02:36:20,479
and they just pass those on from one
 

8523
02:36:20,479 --> 02:36:23,110
and they just pass those on from one
uh generation to the next and nothing

8524
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:23,120
uh generation to the next and nothing
 

8525
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:24,230
uh generation to the next and nothing
changes

8526
02:36:24,230 --> 02:36:24,240
changes
 

8527
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:25,510
changes
but that

8528
02:36:25,510 --> 02:36:25,520
but that
 

8529
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:27,750
but that
huge changes have happened

8530
02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:27,760
huge changes have happened
 

8531
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:29,830
huge changes have happened
when people sort of

8532
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:29,840
when people sort of
 

8533
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:31,830
when people sort of
follow and whatever you want to call it

8534
02:36:31,830 --> 02:36:31,840
follow and whatever you want to call it
 

8535
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:34,830
follow and whatever you want to call it
the scientific method or enlightenment

8536
02:36:34,830 --> 02:36:34,840
the scientific method or enlightenment
 

8537
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:37,510
the scientific method or enlightenment
uh there's different ways of thinking

8538
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:37,520
uh there's different ways of thinking
 

8539
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:40,469
uh there's different ways of thinking
about it but basically explanatory

8540
02:36:40,469 --> 02:36:40,479
about it but basically explanatory
 

8541
02:36:40,479 --> 02:36:42,710
about it but basically explanatory
it's it's about the power of of

8542
02:36:42,710 --> 02:36:42,720
it's it's about the power of of
 

8543
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:44,389
it's it's about the power of of
explanations

8544
02:36:44,389 --> 02:36:44,399
explanations
 

8545
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:46,469
explanations
and being able to figure out why things

8546
02:36:46,469 --> 02:36:46,479
and being able to figure out why things
 

8547
02:36:46,479 --> 02:36:48,070
and being able to figure out why things
are the way they are

8548
02:36:48,070 --> 02:36:48,080
are the way they are
 

8549
02:36:48,080 --> 02:36:52,150
are the way they are
and that has created changes in our um

8550
02:36:52,150 --> 02:36:52,160
and that has created changes in our um
 

8551
02:36:52,160 --> 02:36:54,230
and that has created changes in our um
thinking in our way of life over the

8552
02:36:54,230 --> 02:36:54,240
thinking in our way of life over the
 

8553
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:56,950
thinking in our way of life over the
last few centuries that are

8554
02:36:56,950 --> 02:36:56,960
last few centuries that are
 

8555
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,150
last few centuries that are
explosive

8556
02:36:58,150 --> 02:36:58,160
explosive
 

8557
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:00,309
explosive
compared to anything that came before

8558
02:37:00,309 --> 02:37:00,319
compared to anything that came before
 

8559
02:37:00,319 --> 02:37:04,710

and david sort of verges on classifying
 

8561
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:07,030
and david sort of verges on classifying
this as like a force of nature

8562
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:07,040
this as like a force of nature
 

8563
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:10,550
this as like a force of nature
in its potential transformative power

8564
02:37:10,550 --> 02:37:10,560
in its potential transformative power
 

8565
02:37:10,560 --> 02:37:12,389
in its potential transformative power
if we keep going

8566
02:37:12,389 --> 02:37:12,399
if we keep going
 

8567
02:37:12,399 --> 02:37:13,590
if we keep going
um

8568
02:37:13,590 --> 02:37:13,600
um
 

8569
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:15,510
um
you know we could uh

8570
02:37:15,510 --> 02:37:15,520
you know we could uh
 

8571
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:17,110
you know we could uh
you know if we figure out how to

8572
02:37:17,110 --> 02:37:17,120
you know if we figure out how to
 

8573
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,349
you know if we figure out how to
colonize the universe

8574
02:37:19,349 --> 02:37:19,359
colonize the universe
 

8575
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:21,670
colonize the universe
like you were talking about earlier

8576
02:37:21,670 --> 02:37:21,680
like you were talking about earlier
 

8577
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:24,790
like you were talking about earlier
how this spread to other star systems

8578
02:37:24,790 --> 02:37:24,800
how this spread to other star systems
 

8579
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:26,309
how this spread to other star systems
then it is

8580
02:37:26,309 --> 02:37:26,319
then it is
 

8581
02:37:26,319 --> 02:37:29,270
then it is
effectively a force of nature

8582
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:29,280
effectively a force of nature
 

8583
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:31,670
effectively a force of nature
this kind of drive to understand more

8584
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:31,680
this kind of drive to understand more
 

8585
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:33,190
this kind of drive to understand more
and more and more deeper and deeper and

8586
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:33,200
and more and more deeper and deeper and
 

8587
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:34,389
and more and more deeper and deeper and
deeper

8588
02:37:34,389 --> 02:37:34,399
deeper
 

8589
02:37:34,399 --> 02:37:36,230
deeper
and to engineer stuff so that we can

8590
02:37:36,230 --> 02:37:36,240
and to engineer stuff so that we can
 

8591
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:38,389
and to engineer stuff so that we can
understand even more yeah

8592
02:37:38,389 --> 02:37:38,399
understand even more yeah
 

8593
02:37:38,399 --> 02:37:41,429
understand even more yeah
yeah it's the the well it's the old the

8594
02:37:41,429 --> 02:37:41,439
yeah it's the the well it's the old the
 

8595
02:37:41,439 --> 02:37:43,590
yeah it's the the well it's the old the
universe created us to understand itself

8596
02:37:43,590 --> 02:37:43,600
universe created us to understand itself
 

8597
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:45,190
universe created us to understand itself
maybe that's the uh

8598
02:37:45,190 --> 02:37:45,200
maybe that's the uh
 

8599
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:47,429
maybe that's the uh
the whole purpose

8600
02:37:47,429 --> 02:37:47,439
the whole purpose
 

8601
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:49,190
the whole purpose
yeah

8602
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:49,200
yeah
 

8603
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:51,349
yeah
it's it is an interesting peculiar side

8604
02:37:51,349 --> 02:37:51,359
it's it is an interesting peculiar side
 

8605
02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:52,630
it's it is an interesting peculiar side
effect

8606
02:37:52,630 --> 02:37:52,640
effect
 

8607
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:54,630
effect
of the way we've been created is we seem

8608
02:37:54,630 --> 02:37:54,640
of the way we've been created is we seem
 

8609
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:56,469
of the way we've been created is we seem
to be conscious beings we seem to have

8610
02:37:56,469 --> 02:37:56,479
to be conscious beings we seem to have
 

8611
02:37:56,479 --> 02:37:59,190
to be conscious beings we seem to have
little egos we seem to

8612
02:37:59,190 --> 02:37:59,200
little egos we seem to
 

8613
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:01,750
little egos we seem to
be born and die pretty quickly

8614
02:38:01,750 --> 02:38:01,760
be born and die pretty quickly
 

8615
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:04,070
be born and die pretty quickly
there's a bunch of drama we're all

8616
02:38:04,070 --> 02:38:04,080
there's a bunch of drama we're all
 

8617
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:05,590
there's a bunch of drama we're all
within ourselves

8618
02:38:05,590 --> 02:38:05,600
within ourselves
 

8619
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:08,230
within ourselves
pretty unique and we fall in love and

8620
02:38:08,230 --> 02:38:08,240
pretty unique and we fall in love and
 

8621
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,950
pretty unique and we fall in love and
start wars and there's hate and all the

8622
02:38:10,950 --> 02:38:10,960
start wars and there's hate and all the
 

8623
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:12,710
start wars and there's hate and all the
the full interesting dynamic of it so

8624
02:38:12,710 --> 02:38:12,720
the full interesting dynamic of it so
 

8625
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:14,469
the full interesting dynamic of it so
it's not just about the individual

8626
02:38:14,469 --> 02:38:14,479
it's not just about the individual
 

8627
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:15,670
it's not just about the individual
people

8628
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:15,680
people
 

8629
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:17,750
people
yeah somehow like the concert that we

8630
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:17,760
yeah somehow like the concert that we
 

8631
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:20,230
yeah somehow like the concert that we
played together

8632
02:38:20,230 --> 02:38:20,240
played together
 

8633
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:21,030
played together
yeah

8634
02:38:21,030 --> 02:38:21,040
yeah
 

8635
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:22,710
yeah
yeah so

8636
02:38:22,710 --> 02:38:22,720
yeah so
 

8637
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:24,469
yeah so
that's kind of interesting there's a lot

8638
02:38:24,469 --> 02:38:24,479
that's kind of interesting there's a lot
 

8639
02:38:24,479 --> 02:38:26,950
that's kind of interesting there's a lot
of peculiar aspects of that that i

8640
02:38:26,950 --> 02:38:26,960
of peculiar aspects of that that i
 

8641
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:28,389
of peculiar aspects of that that i
wonder if they're fundamental or just

8642
02:38:28,389 --> 02:38:28,399
wonder if they're fundamental or just
 

8643
02:38:28,399 --> 02:38:30,550
wonder if they're fundamental or just
quirks of evolution

8644
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:30,560
quirks of evolution
 

8645
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:32,469
quirks of evolution
whether it's whether it's death whether

8646
02:38:32,469 --> 02:38:32,479
whether it's whether it's death whether
 

8647
02:38:32,479 --> 02:38:35,190
whether it's whether it's death whether
it's love whether all those things

8648
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:35,200
it's love whether all those things
 

8649
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:37,990
it's love whether all those things
i wonder if they're um

8650
02:38:37,990 --> 02:38:38,000
i wonder if they're um
 

8651
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:39,750
i wonder if they're um
from an engineering perspective when

8652
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:39,760
from an engineering perspective when
 

8653
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:41,190
from an engineering perspective when
we're trying to create that intelligent

8654
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:41,200
we're trying to create that intelligent
 

8655
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:43,590
we're trying to create that intelligent
toaster that listens for the

8656
02:38:43,590 --> 02:38:43,600
toaster that listens for the
 

8657
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:46,710
toaster that listens for the
for the slam door

8658
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:46,720
for the slam door
 

8659
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:50,870
for the slam door
and this and the smell of burning toast

8660
02:38:50,870 --> 02:38:50,880

 

8661
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:51,830

whether

8662
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:51,840
whether
 

8663
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:53,910
whether
that toaster it should be afraid of

8664
02:38:53,910 --> 02:38:53,920
that toaster it should be afraid of
 

8665
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:55,830
that toaster it should be afraid of
death and should fall in love just like

8666
02:38:55,830 --> 02:38:55,840
death and should fall in love just like
 

8667
02:38:55,840 --> 02:38:58,469
death and should fall in love just like
we do

8668
02:38:58,469 --> 02:38:58,479
