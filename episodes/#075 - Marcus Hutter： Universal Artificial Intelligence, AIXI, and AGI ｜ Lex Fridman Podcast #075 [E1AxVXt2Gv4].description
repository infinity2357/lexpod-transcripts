Marcus Hutter is a senior research scientist at DeepMind and professor at Australian National University. Throughout his career of research, including with JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber and Shane Legg, he has proposed a lot of interesting ideas in and around the field of artificial general intelligence, including the development of the AIXI model which is a mathematical approach to AGI that incorporates ideas of Kolmogorov complexity, Solomonoff induction, and reinforcement learning.
