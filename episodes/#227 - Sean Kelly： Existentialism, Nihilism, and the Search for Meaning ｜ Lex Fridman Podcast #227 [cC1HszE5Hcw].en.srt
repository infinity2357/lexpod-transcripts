but that's a weird thing to say about it

58
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
but that's a weird thing to say about it
 

59
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,270
but that's a weird thing to say about it
because most of those people denied that

60
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
because most of those people denied that
 

61
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,990
because most of those people denied that
they were existentialists and um

62
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
they were existentialists and um
 

63
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,870
they were existentialists and um
and in fact i i think of it as a

64
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
and in fact i i think of it as a
 

65
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,670
and in fact i i think of it as a
movement that has a much longer history

66
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
movement that has a much longer history
 

67
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,710
movement that has a much longer history
so when i try to describe what the core

68
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
so when i try to describe what the core
 

69
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,190
so when i try to describe what the core
idea of existentialism is

70
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
idea of existentialism is
 

71
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,030
idea of existentialism is
it's an idea that you find expressed in

72
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
it's an idea that you find expressed in
 

73
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,469
it's an idea that you find expressed in
different ways in a bunch of these

74
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
different ways in a bunch of these
 

75
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,950
different ways in a bunch of these
people one of the ways that it's

76
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
people one of the ways that it's
 

77
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,390
people one of the ways that it's
expressed

78
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
expressed
 

79
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,830
expressed
is that

80
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
is that
 

81
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,510
is that
sartre will say

82
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
sartre will say
 

83
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,230
sartre will say
that existentialism is the view that

84
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
that existentialism is the view that
 

85
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,670
that existentialism is the view that
there is no god and at least his form of

86
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
there is no god and at least his form of
 

87
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,830
there is no god and at least his form of
existentialism he calls it atheistic

88
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
existentialism he calls it atheistic
 

89
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,310
existentialism he calls it atheistic
existentialism there is no god

90
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
existentialism there is no god
 

91
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,710
existentialism there is no god
and since there's no god there must be

92
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
and since there's no god there must be
 

93
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,429
and since there's no god there must be
some other being around

94
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
some other being around
 

95
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,389
some other being around
who does something like what god does

96
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
who does something like what god does
 

97
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,990
who does something like what god does
otherwise there wouldn't be any

00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
otherwise there wouldn't be any
 

99
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,950
otherwise there wouldn't be any
possibility for significance in life

100
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
possibility for significance in life
 

101
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,789
possibility for significance in life
and that being is us

102
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
and that being is us
 

103
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,910
and that being is us
and the feature of us according to sart

104
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
and the feature of us according to sart
 

105
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,709

the other existentialists
that puts us in the position to be able

111
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,550
that puts us in the position to be able
to play that role is that we're the

112
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
to play that role is that we're the
 

113

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
assart says it existence precedes
 

117
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,350
assart says it existence precedes
essence

118
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
essence
 

119
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,270

121
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,869
that's that's the catchphrase for
existentialism and then you have to try

122
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
existentialism and then you have to try
 

123
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,270
existentialism and then you have to try
to figure out what it means

124
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
to figure out what it means
 

125
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,030
to figure out what it means
what is existence what is presence and

168
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
be you by deciding to do this or that
 

169
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,030
be you by deciding to do this or that
and the key feature of how to do that

170
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
and the key feature of how to do that
 

171
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,949
and the key feature of how to do that
right for sartre

172
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
right for sartre
 

173
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,869
right for sartre
is to do it in the full recognition of

174
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
is to do it in the full recognition of
 

175
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,509
is to do it in the full recognition of
the fact that when you make that choice

176
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
the fact that when you make that choice
 

177
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,470
the fact that when you make that choice
nobody is responsible for it other than

178
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
nobody is responsible for it other than
 

179
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,430
nobody is responsible for it other than
you

180
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
you
 

181
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,670
you
so you don't make the choice because god

182
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
so you don't make the choice because god
 

183
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,670
so you don't make the choice because god
tells you to you don't make the choice

184
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
tells you to you don't make the choice
 

185
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,110
tells you to you don't make the choice
because some

186
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
because some
 

187
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,910
because some
utilitarian calculus about what what

188
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
utilitarian calculus about what what
 

189
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,070
utilitarian calculus about what what
it's right to do tells you to do you

190
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
it's right to do tells you to do you
 

191
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,149
it's right to do tells you to do you
don't make the choice because some other

192
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
don't make the choice because some other
 

193
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,630
don't make the choice because some other
philosophical theory tells you to do it

194
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
philosophical theory tells you to do it
 

195
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,869
philosophical theory tells you to do it
there's literally nothing on the basis

196
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
there's literally nothing on the basis
 

197
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,789
there's literally nothing on the basis
of which you make the choice

198
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
of which you make the choice
 

199
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,990
of which you make the choice
other than the fact that in that moment

200
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
other than the fact that in that moment
 

201
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,149
other than the fact that in that moment
you're you're the one making it

202
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
you're you're the one making it
 

203
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,149
you're you're the one making it
you are a conscious

204
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
you are a conscious
 

205
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,030
you are a conscious
thinking being that made a decision so

206
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
thinking being that made a decision so
 

207
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,110
thinking being that made a decision so
all the questions about physics and free

208
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
all the questions about physics and free
 

209
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,990
all the questions about physics and free
will

210
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
will
 

211
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,710
will
are out the window yeah that's right if

212
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
are out the window yeah that's right if
 

213
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,589
are out the window yeah that's right if
you were a determinist about the mind if

214
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
you were a determinist about the mind if
 

215
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,350
you were a determinist about the mind if
you were a physicalist about the mind if

216
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
you were a physicalist about the mind if
 

217
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,949
you were a physicalist about the mind if
you thought there was nothing to your

218
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
you thought there was nothing to your
 

219
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,149
you thought there was nothing to your
choices

220
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
choices
 

221
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,350
choices
other than the activity of the brain

222
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
other than the activity of the brain
 

223
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,750
other than the activity of the brain
that's governed by physical laws

224
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
that's governed by physical laws
 

225
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,069
that's governed by physical laws
then there's some sense in which it

226
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
then there's some sense in which it
 

227
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,189
then there's some sense in which it
would seem at any rate like um you're

228
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
would seem at any rate like um you're
 

229
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,189
would seem at any rate like um you're
not the ground of that choice the ground

230
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
not the ground of that choice the ground
 

231
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,790
not the ground of that choice the ground
of that choice was the physical universe

232
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
of that choice was the physical universe
 

233
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,469
of that choice was the physical universe
and the laws that govern it

234
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
and the laws that govern it
 

235
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,230
and the laws that govern it
and then you'd have no responsibility

236
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
and then you'd have no responsibility
 

237
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,390
and then you'd have no responsibility
and so sart's view is that the thing

238
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
and so sart's view is that the thing
 

239
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,469
and so sart's view is that the thing
that's special about us used to be

240
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
that's special about us used to be
 

241
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,150
that's special about us used to be
special about god

242
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
special about god
 

243
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,030
special about god
is that we're responsible for

244
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
is that we're responsible for
 

245
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,030
is that we're responsible for
becoming the being that makes the

246
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
becoming the being that makes the
 

247
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,629
becoming the being that makes the
choices that we do

248
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
choices that we do
 

249
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,830
choices that we do
and sart thinks that that simultaneously

250
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
and sart thinks that that simultaneously
 

251
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,550
and sart thinks that that simultaneously
empowering i mean it practically puts us

252
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
empowering i mean it practically puts us
 

253
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,150
empowering i mean it practically puts us
in the place of god

254
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
in the place of god
 

255
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,990
in the place of god
and also terrifying

256
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
and also terrifying
 

257
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,790
and also terrifying
because what responsibility how can you

258
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
because what responsibility how can you
 

259
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,830
because what responsibility how can you
possibly

260
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
possibly
 

261
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,230
possibly
take on that responsibility and he

262
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
take on that responsibility and he
 

263
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,830
take on that responsibility and he
thinks it's worse than that he thinks

264
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
thinks it's worse than that he thinks
 

265
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,950
thinks it's worse than that he thinks
that

00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
that
 

267
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,030
that
it's always happening

268
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
it's always happening
 

269
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,270
it's always happening
everything that you do

270
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
everything that you do
 

271
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,950
everything that you do
uh is the result of some choice that

272
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
uh is the result of some choice that
 

273
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,710
uh is the result of some choice that
you've made the posture that you sit in

274
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
you've made the posture that you sit in
 

275
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,790
you've made the posture that you sit in
the way you hold someone's gaze when

276
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
the way you hold someone's gaze when
 

277
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,390
the way you hold someone's gaze when
you're having a conversation with them

278
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
you're having a conversation with them
 

279
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,749
you're having a conversation with them
or not

280
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
or not
 

281
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,710
or not
the choice to make a note

282
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
the choice to make a note
 

283
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,550
the choice to make a note
when someone says something

284
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
when someone says something
 

285
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,390
when someone says something
or not make a note

286
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
or not make a note
 

287
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,430
or not make a note
everything that you do presents you as a

288
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
everything that you do presents you as a
 

289
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,029
everything that you do presents you as a
being who makes decisions and you're

290
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
being who makes decisions and you're
 

291
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,270
being who makes decisions and you're
responsible for all of them so it's

292
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
responsible for all of them so it's
 

293
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,670
responsible for all of them so it's
constantly happening and furthermore

294
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
constantly happening and furthermore
 

295
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,909
constantly happening and furthermore
there's no fact about you

296
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919

 

297
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,950

independent of the choices and actions

298
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
independent of the choices and actions
 

299
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,670
independent of the choices and actions
you've performed so you don't get to say

300
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
you've performed so you don't get to say
 

301
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,350
you've performed so you don't get to say
search example i really am a great

302
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
search example i really am a great
 

303
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,510
search example i really am a great
writer i just haven't written my great

304
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
writer i just haven't written my great
 

305
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,950
writer i just haven't written my great
book yet

306
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
book yet
 

307
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,070
book yet
if you haven't written your great book

308
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
if you haven't written your great book
 

309
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,749
if you haven't written your great book
you're not a great writer

310
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
you're not a great writer
 

311
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,070
you're not a great writer
and so it's it's terrifying it puts a

312
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
and so it's it's terrifying it puts a
 

313
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,909
and so it's it's terrifying it puts a
huge burden on us

314
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
huge burden on us
 

315
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,870
huge burden on us
and um and that's why sart says

316
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
and um and that's why sart says
 

317
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,189
and um and that's why sart says
on his view of existentialism

318
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
on his view of existentialism
 

319
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,710
on his view of existentialism
human beings are the beings that are

320
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
human beings are the beings that are
 

321
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,029
human beings are the beings that are
condemned to be free

322
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
condemned to be free
 

323
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,110
condemned to be free
our freedom consists in our ability and

324
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
our freedom consists in our ability and
 

325
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,510
our freedom consists in our ability and
our responsibility to to make these

326
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
our responsibility to to make these
 

327
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,189
our responsibility to to make these
choices and to become someone through

328
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
choices and to become someone through
 

329
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,670
choices and to become someone through
making them and we can't get we can't

330
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,630
and the contours of the role are
predetermined by someone other than him

494
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
predetermined by someone other than him
 

495
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,430
predetermined by someone other than him
so he starts as acting in bad faith

496
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
so he starts as acting in bad faith
 

497
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,190
so he starts as acting in bad faith
and that's

498
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
and that's
 

499
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,829
and that's
criticizable because it's acting in such

500
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
criticizable because it's acting in such
 

501
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,470
criticizable because it's acting in such
a way as to fail to take responsibility

502
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
a way as to fail to take responsibility
 

503
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,389
a way as to fail to take responsibility
for the kind of being sart thinks you

so you're not taking response so that's
 

509
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,509
so you're not taking response so that's
one example and i think you know i think

if you've ever met a teenager you've
known someone who who does that

516
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
known someone who who does that
 

517
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,630
known someone who who does that
teenagers try on roles they think if i

518
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
teenagers try on roles they think if i
 

519
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,350
teenagers try on roles they think if i
dressed like this i would be cool so

520
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
dressed like this i would be cool so
 

521
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,910
dressed like this i would be cool so
i'll dress like this or if i spoke like

522
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
i'll dress like this or if i spoke like
 

523

this or acted like this
 

525
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,070
this or acted like this
and it's natural for a teenager who's

526
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
and it's natural for a teenager who's
 

527
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,230
and it's natural for a teenager who's
trying to figure out what their you know

528
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
trying to figure out what their you know
 

529
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,670
trying to figure out what their you know
what their identity is to go through a

530
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
what their identity is to go through a
 

531
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,430
what their identity is to go through a
phase like that but if you continue to

532
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
phase like that but if you continue to
 

533
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,269
phase like that but if you continue to
do that then you're you're really

534
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
do that then you're you're really
 

535
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,110
do that then you're you're really
passing it so that's one example the

536
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
passing it so that's one example the
 

537
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,790
passing it so that's one example the
other example he gives

538
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
other example he gives
 

539
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,550
other example he gives
is an example uh not of passing off

540
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
is an example uh not of passing off
 

541

pretending that someone else
 

545
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,790
pretending that someone else
is the ground of your choice but passing

546
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
is the ground of your choice but passing
 

547
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,949

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,750
and the date the evening reaches moment
when

575
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,470
that's the moment in the date where you
are and so you make a choice you decide

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
are and so you make a choice you decide
 

577
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,069
are and so you make a choice you decide
i think it's think it's that time and

you hold the hand
 

581
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,269
you hold the hand
and what should happen is that the other

582
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
and what should happen is that the other
 

583
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,110
and what should happen is that the other
person also makes a choice on sart's

doing and copying them
 

679
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,710
doing and copying them
yeah exactly so

680
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
yeah exactly so
 

681
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,670
yeah exactly so
sart thinks that

682
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
sart thinks that
 

683
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,710
sart thinks that
in the ideal you should try to resist

684
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
in the ideal you should try to resist
 

685
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,430
in the ideal you should try to resist
that other existentialists think

686
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
that other existentialists think
 

687
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,870
that other existentialists think
that

688
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
that
 

689
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,990
that
that's actually a clue to how you should

690
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
that's actually a clue to how you should
 

691
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,590
that's actually a clue to how you should
live well yeah so sarge says somewhere

00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
else hell is other people
 

695
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,829
else hell is other people
why is hell other people for start well

696
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
why is hell other people for start well
 

697
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,910
why is hell other people for start well
because other people are making choices

698
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
because other people are making choices
 

699
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,030
because other people are making choices
also

700
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
also
 

701
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,910
also
and when other people make choices

702
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
and when other people make choices
 

703
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,030
and when other people make choices
they

704
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
they
 

705
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,150
they
put some pressure on me

706
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
put some pressure on me
 

707
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,069
put some pressure on me
to think that the choice they made is

708
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
to think that the choice they made is
 

709
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,509
to think that the choice they made is
one that i should

710
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
one that i should
 

711
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,269
one that i should
uh copy or one that i should

712
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
uh copy or one that i should
 

713
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,949
uh copy or one that i should
sort of promote

714
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
sort of promote
 

715
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,110
sort of promote
but if i do it because they did it then

716
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
but if i do it because they did it then
 

717
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,590
but if i do it because they did it then
i'm in bad faith for sorry

718
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
i'm in bad faith for sorry
 

719
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,710
i'm in bad faith for sorry
so it's it is as if sart's view is like

720
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
so it's it is as if sart's view is like
 

721
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,190
so it's it is as if sart's view is like
we would be better if we were all alone

722
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
we would be better if we were all alone
 

723
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,509
we would be better if we were all alone
i mean this this is this is really

724
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
i mean this this is this is really
 

725
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,269
i mean this this is this is really
simplifying starts position and this is

726
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
simplifying starts position and this is
 

727
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,829
simplifying starts position and this is
really just mostly start in a certain

728
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
really just mostly start in a certain
 

729
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,470
really just mostly start in a certain
period of his of his formation

730
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
period of his of his formation
 

731
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,430
period of his of his formation
but anyhow we can imagine that view and

732
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
but anyhow we can imagine that view and
 

733
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,189
but anyhow we can imagine that view and
i think there's something to the idea

734
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
i think there's something to the idea
 

735
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,269
i think there's something to the idea
that's art is attracted to it at least

736
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
that's art is attracted to it at least
 

737
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,670
that's art is attracted to it at least
in the mid 40s can you dig into hell as

738
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
in the mid 40s can you dig into hell as
 

739
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,790

741
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,870
other people is there some obviously
it's kind of a almost like a literary

742
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
it's kind of a almost like a literary
 

743
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,590
it's kind of a almost like a literary
like you push the point strongly to

744
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
like you push the point strongly to
 

745
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,670
like you push the point strongly to
really explore that point

746
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
really explore that point
 

747
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,069
really explore that point
but is there some sense in that other

748
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
but is there some sense in that other
 

749
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,430
but is there some sense in that other
people

750
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
people
 

751
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,750
people
ruin the experience of what it means to

752
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
ruin the experience of what it means to
 

753
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,269
ruin the experience of what it means to
be human

754
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
be human
 

755
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,350
be human
i think for start the phenomenon is this

756
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
i think for start the phenomenon is this
 

757
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,310
i think for start the phenomenon is this
like it's not just that you wear clothes

758

like it's not just that you wear clothes
 

759
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,590
like it's not just that you wear clothes
because people wear clothes in our

because people wear clothes in our
society like you have a particular style

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,350
you wear a particular kind of clothes
right and for sartre like to have that

766
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
right and for sartre like to have that
 

767
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,629
right and for sartre like to have that
style authentically in good faith rather

768
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
style authentically in good faith rather
 

769
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,150
style authentically in good faith rather
than in bad faith

770
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
than in bad faith
 

771
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,310
than in bad faith
it has to come from you you have to make

772
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
it has to come from you you have to make
 

773
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,670
it has to come from you you have to make
the choice

774
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
the choice
 

775
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,910
the choice
but other people are making choices also

776
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
but other people are making choices also
 

777
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,550
but other people are making choices also
and like you're looking at their choices

778
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
and like you're looking at their choices
 

779
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,870
and like you're looking at their choices
and you're thinking that guy looks good

780
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
and you're thinking that guy looks good
 

781
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,550
and you're thinking that guy looks good
maybe i could try that one on and

782
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
maybe i could try that one on and
 

783
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,389
maybe i could try that one on and
if you try it on because you were

784
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
if you try it on because you were
 

785
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,389
if you try it on because you were
influenced by the fact that you thought

786
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
influenced by the fact that you thought
 

787
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,310
influenced by the fact that you thought
that guy was doing it well

788
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
that guy was doing it well
 

789
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,670
that guy was doing it well
then there's some important sense in

790
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
then there's some important sense in
 

791
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,509
then there's some important sense in
which although that's a resource for a

792
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
which although that's a resource for a
 

793
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,670
which although that's a resource for a
choice for you it's also acting in bad

794
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
choice for you it's also acting in bad
 

795
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,870
choice for you it's also acting in bad
faith

796
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
faith
 

797
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,829
faith
so

798
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
so
 

799
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,790
so
so god and god wouldn't do that right

800
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
so god and god wouldn't do that right
 

801
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,790
so god and god wouldn't do that right
god wouldn't be influenced by others

802
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
god wouldn't be influenced by others
 

803
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,509
god wouldn't be influenced by others
decisions and if that's the model

804
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
decisions and if that's the model
 

805
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,030
decisions and if that's the model
then that's i think that's the sense in

806
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
then that's i think that's the sense in
 

807
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,389
then that's i think that's the sense in
which he thinks hell is other people

808
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
which he thinks hell is other people
 

809
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,870
which he thinks hell is other people
what do you think parenting is then it's

810
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
what do you think parenting is then it's
 

811
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,550
what do you think parenting is then it's
like what because god doesn't have a

812
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
like what because god doesn't have a
 

813
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,509
like what because god doesn't have a
parent yeah so aren't we significantly

814
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
parent yeah so aren't we significantly
 

815
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,750
parent yeah so aren't we significantly
influenced first of all in the first few

816
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
influenced first of all in the first few

937
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,430

of life yeah you have that's a

of life yeah you have that's a
 

939
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,190
of life yeah you have that's a
fundamental part of life you can't just

all together all together yeah exactly
 

945
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,430
all together all together yeah exactly
you can't escape it all together but

946
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
you can't escape it all together but
 

947
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,750
you can't escape it all together but
nevertheless you are riding a wave

948

nevertheless you are riding a wave
 

949
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,990
nevertheless you are riding a wave
and you make a decision of the in the

950
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
and you make a decision of the in the
 

951
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,590
and you make a decision of the in the
writing of the way you can't control the

952
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
writing of the way you can't control the
 

953
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,669
writing of the way you can't control the
wave but you should be uh

954
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
wave but you should be uh
 

955
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,470
wave but you should be uh
like

956
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
like
 

957
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,710
like
as you ride it you should be making

958
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
as you ride it you should be making
 

959
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,150
as you ride it you should be making
certain kinds of decisions and take

960
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
certain kinds of decisions and take
 

961
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,990
certain kinds of decisions and take

00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,080
for it so
 

965
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,669
for it so
why does this

966
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
why does this
 

967
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,070
why does this
matter at all the the chain of decisions

968
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
matter at all the the chain of decisions
 

969
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,270

you make

970
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280

995
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,990
you're born there's just a fact about
you your soul

996
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
you your soul
 

997
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,029
you your soul
is either gold silver or bronze that's

998
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
is either gold silver or bronze that's
 

999
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,310
is either gold silver or bronze that's
those are the three kinds of people

1000
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
those are the three kinds of people
 

1001
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,710
those are the three kinds of people
there are and you're born that way and

1002
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
there are and you're born that way and
 

1003
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,870
there are and you're born that way and
if your soul is gold then we should

1004
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
if your soul is gold then we should
 

1005
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,190
if your soul is gold then we should
identify that and make you a philosopher

1006
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
identify that and make you a philosopher
 

1007
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,669
identify that and make you a philosopher
king yeah and if your soul is silver

1008
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
king yeah and if your soul is silver
 

1009
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,870
king yeah and if your soul is silver
well you're not going to be a

1010
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
well you're not going to be a
 

1011
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,549
well you're not going to be a
philosopher king you're not capable of

1012
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
philosopher king you're not capable of
 

1013
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,310
philosopher king you're not capable of
it but you could be a good warrior and

1014
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
it but you could be a good warrior and
 

1015
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,909
it but you could be a good warrior and
we should make you that and if your soul

1016
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
we should make you that and if your soul
 

1017
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,750
we should make you that and if your soul
is bronze then you should be a farmer

1018
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
is bronze then you should be a farmer
 

1019
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,430
is bronze then you should be a farmer
laborer or something like that and

1020
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,440
laborer or something like that and
 

1021
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,110
laborer or something like that and
that's a fact about you

1022
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
that's a fact about you
 

1023
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,549
that's a fact about you
that

1024
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
that
 

1025
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,669
that
identifies you forever and for always

1026
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
identifies you forever and for always
 

1027
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,470
identifies you forever and for always
independent of anything you do about it

1028
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
independent of anything you do about it
 

1029
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,270
independent of anything you do about it
and so that's the alternative view and

1030
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
and so that's the alternative view and
 

1031
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,510
and so that's the alternative view and
you you could have modern versions of it

1032
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
you you could have modern versions of it
 

1033
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,270
you you could have modern versions of it
you could say the thing that identifies

1034
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
you could say the thing that identifies
 

1035
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,789
you could say the thing that identifies
you is your iq

1036
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
you is your iq
 

1037
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,310
you is your iq
or your genetic makeup or

1038
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
or your genetic makeup or
 

1039
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,990
or your genetic makeup or
the percentage of fast twitch muscle

1040
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
the percentage of fast twitch muscle
 

1041
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,710
the percentage of fast twitch muscle
fibers you've got or whatever it could

1042
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
fibers you've got or whatever it could
 

1043
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,270
fibers you've got or whatever it could
be something it's totally independent of

1044
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
be something it's totally independent of
 

1045
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,510
be something it's totally independent of
any choice that you've made independent

1046
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
any choice that you've made independent
 

1047
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,870
any choice that you've made independent
of the kind of thing about which you

1048
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
of the kind of thing about which you
 

1049
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,470
of the kind of thing about which you
could make a choice

1050
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
could make a choice
 

1051
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,590
could make a choice
and it

1052
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
and it
 

1053
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,070
and it
and it categorizes you it makes you the

1054
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
and it categorizes you it makes you the
 

1055
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,430
and it categorizes you it makes you the
person that you are that's the that's

1056
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
person that you are that's the that's
 

1057
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,310
person that you are that's the that's
the thing that started and the

1058
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
the thing that started and the
 

1059
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,549
the thing that started and the
existentialists are against

1060
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
existentialists are against
 

1061
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,270
existentialists are against
uh

1062
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
uh
 

1063
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,070
uh
so

1064
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
so
 

1065
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,710
so
this idea that something about you is

1066
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
this idea that something about you is
 

1067
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,350
this idea that something about you is
forever limiting the space of possible

1068
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
forever limiting the space of possible
 

1069
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,830
forever limiting the space of possible
decisions you can make sarcha says

1070
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
decisions you can make sarcha says
 

1071
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,870
decisions you can make sarcha says
no the space is unlimited start is the

1072
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
no the space is unlimited start is the
 

1073
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,110
no the space is unlimited start is the
the philosopher of radical freedom

1074
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
the philosopher of radical freedom
 

1075
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,549
the philosopher of radical freedom
radical freedom yeah radical freedom and

1076
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
radical freedom yeah radical freedom and
 

1077
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,510
radical freedom yeah radical freedom and
then you could have other

1078
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
then you could have other
 

1079
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,310
then you could have other
existentialists who say look we are free

1080
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
existentialists who say look we are free
 

1081
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,470
existentialists who say look we are free
but we gotta we gotta understand what

1082
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
but we gotta we gotta understand what
 

1083
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,230
but we gotta we gotta understand what
the way in which our freedom is limited

1084
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
the way in which our freedom is limited
 

1085
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,470
the way in which our freedom is limited
by certain aspects of the kind of being

1086
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
by certain aspects of the kind of being
 

1087
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,789
by certain aspects of the kind of being
that we are if we were radically free we

1088
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
that we are if we were radically free we
 

1089
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,549
that we are if we were radically free we
really would be like god in the

1090
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
really would be like god in the
 

1091
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,950
really would be like god in the
traditional medieval sense

1092
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
traditional medieval sense
 

1093
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,510
traditional medieval sense
and and not sort of these folks start

1094
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
and and not sort of these folks start
 

1095
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,230
and and not sort of these folks start
with the idea that look whatever we are

1096
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
with the idea that look whatever we are
 

1097
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,149
with the idea that look whatever we are
that's a kind of limit point that we're

1098
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:16,159
that's a kind of limit point that we're
 

1099
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,830
that's a kind of limit point that we're
not going to reach

1100
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
not going to reach
 

1101
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,630
not going to reach
so

1102
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,640
so
 

1103
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,310
so
what what are the ways in which we're

1104
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,320
what what are the ways in which we're
 

1105
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,990
what what are the ways in which we're
constrained that

1106
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
constrained that
 

1107
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,390
constrained that
that that being the way the medievals

1108
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
that that being the way the medievals
 

1109
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,430
that that being the way the medievals
understood him wasn't constrained so can

1110
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
understood him wasn't constrained so can
 

1111
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,909
understood him wasn't constrained so can
you maybe comment on what is nihilism

1112
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
you maybe comment on what is nihilism
 

1113
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,470
you maybe comment on what is nihilism
and is it at all a useful

1114
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
and is it at all a useful
 

1115
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,549
and is it at all a useful
other sort of group of ideas that you

1116
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
other sort of group of ideas that you
 

1117
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,310
other sort of group of ideas that you
resist against in defining

1118
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
resist against in defining
 

1119
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,710
resist against in defining
existentialism yes good excellent so

1120
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
existentialism yes good excellent so
 

1121
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,230
existentialism yes good excellent so
nihilism

00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:57,640
he
 

1141
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,270
he
identifies the condition of the modern

world as nihilistic
and that's

and that's
 

1147
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,669
and that's
a descriptive claim he's looking around

1148
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
a descriptive claim he's looking around
 

1149
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,470
a descriptive claim he's looking around
him

transgression in the garden of eden
and to have the project of trying to

and to have the project of trying to
 

1191
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,430
and to have the project of trying to
understand how as a sinful being you

1192
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
understand how as a sinful being you
 

1193
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,590
understand how as a sinful being you
could nevertheless live a life a

virtuous life how could you do that and
 

1197
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,669
virtuous life how could you do that and
it had to do with for them getting in

1198
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
it had to do with for them getting in
 

1199
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,830
it had to do with for them getting in
the right relation to god he just says

1200
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
the right relation to god he just says
 

1201
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,789
the right relation to god he just says
we we

1202
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
we we
 

1203
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,710
we we
that doesn't make sense to us anymore in

1204
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
that doesn't make sense to us anymore in
 

1205
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,710
that doesn't make sense to us anymore in
the end of the 19th century

1206
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
the end of the 19th century
 

1207
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,750
the end of the 19th century
god is dead says nietzsche famously

1208
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,760
god is dead says nietzsche famously
 

1209
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,510
god is dead says nietzsche famously
and what does that mean well it means

1210
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
and what does that mean well it means
 

1211
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,710
and what does that mean well it means
something like

1212
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
something like
 

1213
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,350
something like
the role that god used to play in our

1214
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
the role that god used to play in our
 

1215
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,230
the role that god used to play in our
understanding of ourselves as a culture

1216
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
understanding of ourselves as a culture
 

1217
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,590
understanding of ourselves as a culture
isn't a role that

1218
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:19,600
isn't a role that
 

1219
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,430
isn't a role that
that god can play anymore

1220
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
that god can play anymore
 

1221
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,830
that god can play anymore
and so nietzsche says

1222
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
and so nietzsche says
 

1223
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,909
and so nietzsche says
the role that god used to play was the

1224
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:25,919
the role that god used to play was the
 

1225
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,310
the role that god used to play was the
role of grounding our existence he was

1226
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
role of grounding our existence he was
 

1227
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,070
role of grounding our existence he was
what it is in virtue of which we are who

1228
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
what it is in virtue of which we are who
 

1229
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,350
what it is in virtue of which we are who
we are

1230
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
we are
 

1231
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,990
we are
and nietzsche says

1232
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
and nietzsche says
 

1233
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,070
and nietzsche says
the idea that there is a being that

1234
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
the idea that there is a being that
 

1235
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,070
the idea that there is a being that
makes us what we are doesn't make sense

1236
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
makes us what we are doesn't make sense
 

1237
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,149
makes us what we are doesn't make sense
anymore that's like atheism so artists

1238
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
anymore that's like atheism so artists
 

1239
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,750
anymore that's like atheism so artists
taking that from nature and so the

1240
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
taking that from nature and so the
 

1241
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,669
taking that from nature and so the
question is

1242
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
question is
 

1243
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,470
question is
what does ground our existence and the

1244
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
what does ground our existence and the
 

1245
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,029
what does ground our existence and the
answer is knee hill nothing

1246
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
answer is knee hill nothing
 

1247
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,950
answer is knee hill nothing
and so nihilism is the idea that there's

1248
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:50,960
and so nihilism is the idea that there's
 

1249
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,350
and so nihilism is the idea that there's
nothing outside of us that grounds our

1250
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360
nothing outside of us that grounds our
 

1251
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,789
nothing outside of us that grounds our
existence

1252
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
existence
 

1253
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,750
existence
and then nietzsche asks the question

1254
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,760
and then nietzsche asks the question
 

1255
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,110
and then nietzsche asks the question
well what are we supposed to do about

1256
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
well what are we supposed to do about
 

1257
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,990
well what are we supposed to do about
that how do we live

1258
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
that how do we live
 

1259
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,750
that how do we live
and i i you know

1260
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
and i i you know
 

1261
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,510
and i i you know
i think nietzsche has a different story

1262
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
i think nietzsche has a different story
 

1263
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,110
i think nietzsche has a different story
than start about that

1264
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
than start about that
 

1265
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,029
than start about that
nietzsche doesn't say

1266
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:09,039
nietzsche doesn't say
 

1267
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,870
nietzsche doesn't say
doesn't emphasize

1268
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
doesn't emphasize
 

1269
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,190
doesn't emphasize
this notion of radical freedom nietzsche

1270
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
this notion of radical freedom nietzsche
 

1271
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,029
this notion of radical freedom nietzsche
emphasizes something else

1272
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
emphasizes something else
 

1273
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,310
emphasizes something else
he says

1274
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
he says
 

1275
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,710
he says
we're artists of life

1276
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
we're artists of life
 

1277
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,590
we're artists of life
and artists are interesting because

1278
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:23,600
and artists are interesting because
 

1279
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,029
and artists are interesting because
the natural way of thinking about

1280
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039
the natural way of thinking about
 

1281
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,870
the natural way of thinking about
artists is that they're responding to

1282
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880
artists is that they're responding to
 

1283
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,149
artists is that they're responding to
something

1284
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:28,159
something
 

1285
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,149
something
they find themselves in a situation and

1286
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
they find themselves in a situation and
 

1287
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,750
they find themselves in a situation and
they say this is what's going to make

1288
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:31,760
they say this is what's going to make
 

1289
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,190
they say this is what's going to make
sense of the situation this is what i

1290
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,200
sense of the situation this is what i
 

1291
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,510
sense of the situation this is what i
have to write this is the way i have to

1292
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
have to write this is the way i have to
 

1293
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,270
have to write this is the way i have to
dance this is the way i've got to play

1294
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
dance this is the way i've got to play
 

1295
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,789
dance this is the way i've got to play
the music

1296
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
the music
 

1297
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,789
the music
and nietzsche says we should live like

1298
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
and nietzsche says we should live like
 

1299
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,190
and nietzsche says we should live like
that there are constraints but like

1300
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
that there are constraints but like
 

1301
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,230
that there are constraints but like
understanding what they are is

1302
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,240

00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
constraints not anything would have
 

1445

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,950
played anything
most of what anyone would have played

1450
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960
most of what anyone would have played
 

1451

most of what anyone would have played
would have sounded terrible

1452

would have sounded terrible
 

1453
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,269
would have sounded terrible
but the constraints aren't like

1454
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:25,279
but the constraints aren't like
 

1455
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,669
but the constraints aren't like
pre-existing they're sort of

1456
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:27,679
pre-existing they're sort of
 

1457
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,909
pre-existing they're sort of
what's happening now in the moment for

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,190
they have to make it right
and there's there's something about

and there's there's something about
 

1483
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,909
and there's there's something about
music too so you basically have to make

1484
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919
music too so you basically have to make
 

1485
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:54,950
music too so you basically have to make
music

music
 

1487
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,909
music
of all the moments of life and there is

1488
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
of all the moments of life and there is
 

1489
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,310
of all the moments of life and there is
something about music why is music so

1490
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
something about music why is music so
 

1491
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,510
something about music why is music so
compelling

1492
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
compelling
 

1493
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,190
compelling
and when you listen to it something

1494
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
and when you listen to it something
 

1495
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,510
and when you listen to it something
about certain kinds of music it connects

1496
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
about certain kinds of music it connects
 

1497
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,510
about certain kinds of music it connects
with you it doesn't make any sense but

1498
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,520
with you it doesn't make any sense but
 

1499
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,990
with you it doesn't make any sense but
in that same way for nietzsche

1500
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
in that same way for nietzsche
 

1501
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,990
in that same way for nietzsche
you should be a creative force

1502
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
you should be a creative force
 

1503
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,710
you should be a creative force
that creates a musical masterpiece

1504
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:14,720
that creates a musical masterpiece
 

1505
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,789
that creates a musical masterpiece
exactly and i think what's interesting

1506
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
exactly and i think what's interesting
 

1507
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,470
exactly and i think what's interesting
is the question what does it mean to be

1508
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
is the question what does it mean to be
 

1509
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,549
is the question what does it mean to be
a creative force there there's a

1510
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
a creative force there there's a
 

1511
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,430
a creative force there there's a
traditional notion of creation

1512
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
traditional notion of creation
 

1513
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,909
traditional notion of creation
that we associate with with god

1514
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
that we associate with with god
 

1515
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,470
that we associate with with god
god creates ex nihilo out of nothing

1516
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
god creates ex nihilo out of nothing
 

1517
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,590
god creates ex nihilo out of nothing
and

1518
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,600
and
 

1519
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,190
and
you might think that nihilism thinks

1520
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200
you might think that nihilism thinks
 

1521
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,590
you might think that nihilism thinks
that we should do that create ex nihilo

1522
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
that we should do that create ex nihilo
 

1523
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,669
that we should do that create ex nihilo
because it's about how there's nothing

1524
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
because it's about how there's nothing
 

1525
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,190
because it's about how there's nothing
at our ground but i think the right way

1526
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
at our ground but i think the right way
 

1527
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,149
at our ground but i think the right way
to read nietzsche is to recognize that

1528
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
to read nietzsche is to recognize that
 

1529
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,149
to read nietzsche is to recognize that
we don't create out of nothing miles

question
 

1591
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,990
question
and the possible set of answers that our

1592
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
and the possible set of answers that our
 

1593
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,310
and the possible set of answers that our
world today provides

1594
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320
world today provides
 

1595
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,510
world today provides
good so i i mean i i think that

1596
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,520
good so i i mean i i think that
 

1597
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,669
good so i i mean i i think that
there's something super perceptive about

1598
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:57,679
there's something super perceptive about
 

1599
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,230
there's something super perceptive about
nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition

1600
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,240
nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition
 

1601
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,230
nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition
at the end of the 19th century

1602
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,240
at the end of the 19th century
 

1603
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,789
at the end of the 19th century
so not so far from the condition that i

1604
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
so not so far from the condition that i
 

1605
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,830
so not so far from the condition that i
think we're currently in

1606
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:07,840
think we're currently in
 

1607
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,669
think we're currently in
and i think there's an interesting

1608
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:09,679
and i think there's an interesting
 

1609
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,029
and i think there's an interesting
question what we're supposed to respond

1610
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
question what we're supposed to respond
 

1611
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,389
question what we're supposed to respond
what we're supposed to do in response

1612
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
what we're supposed to do in response
 

1613
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,070
what we're supposed to do in response
but what what is the condition that

1614
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,080
but what what is the condition that
 

1615
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,430
but what what is the condition that
we're currently in when nietzsche says

1616
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,440
we're currently in when nietzsche says
 

1617
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,870
we're currently in when nietzsche says
god is dead

1618
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
god is dead
 

1619
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,510
god is dead
i think like i was saying before he he

1620
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,520
i think like i was saying before he he
 

1621
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,389
i think like i was saying before he he
means something like the role that god

1622
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
means something like the role that god
 

1623
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,789
means something like the role that god
used to play in grounding our existence

1624
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:24,799
used to play in grounding our existence
 

1625
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,190
used to play in grounding our existence
is not a role that works for us anymore

1626
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,200
is not a role that works for us anymore
 

1627
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,789
is not a role that works for us anymore
as a culture

1628
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
as a culture
 

1629
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,669
as a culture
and when people talk about a view like

1630
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
and when people talk about a view like
 

1631
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,750
and when people talk about a view like
that nowadays they use a different

1632
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
that nowadays they use a different
 

1633
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,669
that nowadays they use a different
terminology but i think it's roughly

1634
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
terminology but i think it's roughly
 

1635
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,510
terminology but i think it's roughly
what nietzsche was aiming at

1636
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
what nietzsche was aiming at
 

1637
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,389
what nietzsche was aiming at
they say we live in a secular age

1638
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
they say we live in a secular age
 

1639
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,310
they say we live in a secular age
our age is a secular age and so what

1640
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
our age is a secular age and so what
 

1641
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,710
our age is a secular age and so what
what do people mean when they say that

1642
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
what do people mean when they say that
 

1643
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,990
what do people mean when they say that
i think

1644
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,000
i think
 

1645
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,510
i think
first of all it's a descriptive claim it

1646
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,520
first of all it's a descriptive claim it
 

1647
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,710
first of all it's a descriptive claim it
could be wrong

1648
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
could be wrong
 

1649
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,990
could be wrong
the question is does this really

1650
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
the question is does this really
 

1651
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,149
the question is does this really
describe the way we experience ourselves

1652
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:52,159
describe the way we experience ourselves
 

1653
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,630
describe the way we experience ourselves
as a culture or as a culture in the west

1654
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:54,640
as a culture or as a culture in the west
 

1655
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,110
as a culture or as a culture in the west
or wherever it is that we are

1656
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,120
or wherever it is that we are
 

1657
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,630
or wherever it is that we are
so what does it mean to say that we live

1658
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640
so what does it mean to say that we live
 

1659
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,630
so what does it mean to say that we live
in a secular age an age in which god is

1660
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
in a secular age an age in which god is
 

1661
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,389
in a secular age an age in which god is
dead well it first thing is it doesn't

1662
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:02,399
dead well it first thing is it doesn't
 

1663
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,070
dead well it first thing is it doesn't
mean there are no religious believers

1664
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080

1665
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,669
mean there are no religious believers
because there are plenty there are lots

1666
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
because there are plenty there are lots

because there are plenty there are lots
of people who

people who
really find that to be an important

really find that to be an important
 

1677
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,190
really find that to be an important
aspect of the way they live their lives

but
it does mean

1682
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
it does mean
 

1683
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,549
it does mean
that for those people

used to be in previous ages so what's

1692
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,720
used to be in previous ages so what's
 

1693
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,909
used to be in previous ages so what's
that role

1694
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:33,919
that role
 

1695
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,590
that role
we'll go back to the high middle ages

1696
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
we'll go back to the high middle ages
 

1697
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,310
we'll go back to the high middle ages
that was clearly not a secular age

1698
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
that was clearly not a secular age
 

1699
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,310
that was clearly not a secular age
that was a religious age

1700

that was a religious age
and so there we are in 1300 dante is

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,150
that are overtaken modern culture so a
secular world is still full of meaning

1946
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,160
secular world is still full of meaning
 

1947
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,910
secular world is still full of meaning
good well i think that's the interesting

1948
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:05,920
good well i think that's the interesting
 

1949
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,829
good well i think that's the interesting
question i i think i think it's

1950
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:07,839
question i i think i think it's
 

1951
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,150
question i i think i think it's
certainly possible for a secular world

1952
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,160
certainly possible for a secular world
 

1953
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,910
certainly possible for a secular world
to be a world in which we live

1954
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:11,920
to be a world in which we live
 

1955
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,550
to be a world in which we live
meaningful lives worthwhile lives lives

1956
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:14,560
meaningful lives worthwhile lives lives
 

1957
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,710
meaningful lives worthwhile lives lives
that uh are

1958
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
that uh are
 

1959
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,870
that uh are
sort of um worthy of respect and that we

1960
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:20,880
sort of um worthy of respect and that we
 

1961
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,750
sort of um worthy of respect and that we
can be proud of of aiming to live

1962
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:23,760
can be proud of of aiming to live
 

1963
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,150
can be proud of of aiming to live
but but i think it is a hard question

1964
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
but but i think it is a hard question
 

1965
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,910
but but i think it is a hard question
what we're doing when we do that and

1966
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
what we're doing when we do that and
 

1967
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,829
what we're doing when we do that and
that's the that is the question of

1968
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:29,839
that's the that is the question of
 

1969
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,990
that's the that is the question of
existence sort of what does it mean

1970
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,000
existence sort of what does it mean
 

1971
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,950
existence sort of what does it mean
to exist in a way that brings us out at

1972
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
to exist in a way that brings us out at
 

1973
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,710
to exist in a way that brings us out at
our best as the beings that we are

1974
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:36,720
our best as the beings that we are
 

1975
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,790
our best as the beings that we are
that's the question for existentialism

1976
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:40,800

 

1977
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,670

so besides sartre who do you is the

1978
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
so besides sartre who do you is the
 

1979
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,910
so besides sartre who do you is the
most important existentialist to

1980
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:47,920
most important existentialist to
 

1981
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,829
most important existentialist to
understand for others what ideas in

1982
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:49,839
understand for others what ideas in
 

1983
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,990
understand for others what ideas in
particular of theirs do you like

1984
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
particular of theirs do you like
 

1985
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,870
particular of theirs do you like
maybe

1986
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
maybe
 

1987
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,270
maybe
other existential it's not just one yeah

1988
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,280
other existential it's not just one yeah
 

1989
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,390
other existential it's not just one yeah
so sartre is the grounding strong

1990
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:58,400
so sartre is the grounding strong
 

1991
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,710
so sartre is the grounding strong
atheistic existentialism statement who

1992
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:00,720
atheistic existentialism statement who
 

1993
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,670
atheistic existentialism statement who
else is

1994
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:01,680
else is
 

1995
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,069
else is
uh there so in i'm teaching an

1996
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:04,079
uh there so in i'm teaching an
 

1997
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,470
uh there so in i'm teaching an
existentialism course now and i think

1998
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480
existentialism course now and i think
 

1999
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,310
existentialism course now and i think
the tradition goes back at least to the

2000
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,320
the tradition goes back at least to the
 

2001
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,910
the tradition goes back at least to the
17th century

2002
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:09,920
17th century
 

2003
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,829
17th century
um and i'll just tell you some of the

2004
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:11,839
um and i'll just tell you some of the
 

2005
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,829
um and i'll just tell you some of the
figures that that i'm teaching there we

2006
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
figures that that i'm teaching there we
 

2007
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,030
figures that that i'm teaching there we
could talk about any of them that you

2008
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,040
could talk about any of them that you
 

2009
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,150
could talk about any of them that you
like

2010
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
like
 

2011
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,790
like
the the figure i start with is pascal

2012
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:18,800
the the figure i start with is pascal
 

2013
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,150
the the figure i start with is pascal

mathematician
 

2019
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,030
mathematician
uh from the 17th century he died i'm

2020
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,040
uh from the 17th century he died i'm
 

2021
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,510
uh from the 17th century he died i'm
terrible with dates but i think 1661 or

2022
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,520
terrible with dates but i think 1661 or
 

2023
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,589
terrible with dates but i think 1661 or
something like that middle of the 17th

2024
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:29,599
something like that middle of the 17th
 

2025
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,630
something like that middle of the 17th
century brilliant polymath sort of we

2026
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:32,640
century brilliant polymath sort of we
 

2027
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,710
century brilliant polymath sort of we
have computer languages named after him

2028
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
have computer languages named after him
 

2029
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,630
have computer languages named after him
he built the first mechanical

2030
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:36,640
he built the first mechanical
 

2031
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,510
he built the first mechanical
calculating machine he's but he he was

2032
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:39,520
calculating machine he's but he he was
 

2033
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,390
calculating machine he's but he he was
also

2034
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,400
also
 

2035
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,190
also
deeply invested in his understanding of

2036
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
deeply invested in his understanding of
 

2037
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,750
deeply invested in his understanding of
what christianity was

2038
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:45,760
what christianity was
 

2039
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,390
what christianity was
and he thought that

2040
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,400
and he thought that
 

2041
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,630
and he thought that
everyone before him

2042
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:50,640
everyone before him
 

2043
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,550
everyone before him
had really misunderstood what

2044
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
had really misunderstood what
 

2045
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,990
had really misunderstood what
christianity was that they'd really um

2046
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,000
christianity was that they'd really um
 

2047
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,710
christianity was that they'd really um
attempted to think about it not as a way

2048
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:58,720
attempted to think about it not as a way
 

2049
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,630
attempted to think about it not as a way
of living a life

2050
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:00,640
of living a life
 

2051
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,550
of living a life
but as a set of beliefs

2052
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,560
but as a set of beliefs
 

2053
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,990
but as a set of beliefs
that you can have

2054
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
that you can have
 

2055
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,390
that you can have
and which you can justify

2056
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,400
and which you can justify
 

2057
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,870
and which you can justify
and i think that's the first

2058
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:08,880
and i think that's the first
 

2059
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,190
and i think that's the first
move that's kind that's really pretty

2060
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,200
move that's kind that's really pretty
 

2061
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,550
move that's kind that's really pretty
interesting and then figures like

2062
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
interesting and then figures like
 

2063
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,790
interesting and then figures like
kierkegaard and dostoyevsky

2064
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:14,800
kierkegaard and dostoyevsky
 

2065
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,430
kierkegaard and dostoyevsky
um developed that move and and they're

2066
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
um developed that move and and they're
 

2067
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,870
um developed that move and and they're
all of those are

2068
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:18,880
all of those are
 

2069
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,630
all of those are
take themselves to be defending an

2070
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
take themselves to be defending an
 

2071
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,990
take themselves to be defending an
interpretation of a certain kind of

2072
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,000
interpretation of a certain kind of
 

2073
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,670
interpretation of a certain kind of
christianity

2074
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:23,680
christianity
 

2075
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,589
christianity
an existential interpretation of

2076
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:25,599
an existential interpretation of
 

2077
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,109
an existential interpretation of
christianity

2078
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:27,119
christianity
 

2079
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,790
christianity
and then i think there are other figures

2080
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:28,800
and then i think there are other figures
 

2081
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,510
and then i think there are other figures
other theistic figures uh figures like

2082
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,520
other theistic figures uh figures like
 

2083
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,270
other theistic figures uh figures like
um camus and uh fanon who

2084
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
um camus and uh fanon who
 

2085
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,550
um camus and uh fanon who
mid 20th century figures and then i'll

2086
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,560
mid 20th century figures and then i'll
 

2087
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,390
mid 20th century figures and then i'll
just mention the figure who i think is

2088
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,400
just mention the figure who i think is
 

2089
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,790
just mention the figure who i think is
the most interesting is martin heidegger

2090
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:42,800
the most interesting is martin heidegger
 

2091
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,510
the most interesting is martin heidegger
he's a complicated figure uh because by

2092
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
he's a complicated figure uh because by
 

2093
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,430
he's a complicated figure uh because by
the way when you said uh sorry to

2094
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,440
the way when you said uh sorry to
 

2095
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,150
the way when you said uh sorry to
interrupt that when you said camus

2096
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,160
interrupt that when you said camus
 

2097
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,630
interrupt that when you said camus
you meant atheistic i think that camus

2098
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:52,640
you meant atheistic i think that camus
 

2099
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,470
you meant atheistic i think that camus
is an atheistic existentialist yeah i'm

2100
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480
is an atheistic existentialist yeah i'm
 

2101
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,870
is an atheistic existentialist yeah i'm
happy to talk about that so okay so we

2102
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:56,880
happy to talk about that so okay so we
 

2103
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,190
happy to talk about that so okay so we
got it's like sports cards yeah yeah the

2104
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,200

he says

2290
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
he says
 

2291
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,589
he says
um look there's a a conditional

2292
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
um look there's a a conditional
 

2293
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,589
um look there's a a conditional
statement is true

2294
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:29,599
statement is true

if there is no god then everything is

permitted
 

2299
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,069
permitted
and then there's a second premise

2300
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:36,079
and then there's a second premise
 

2301
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,510
and then there's a second premise
there is no god

that's sart's view i mean he's an
 

2305

conclusion

2308
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,800
conclusion
 

2309
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,790
conclusion
everything is permitted

2310
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:44,800
everything is permitted
 

2311
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,510
everything is permitted
and that starts radical freedom

2312
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:47,520
and that starts radical freedom
 

2313
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,589
and that starts radical freedom
and if you think about the structure of

2314
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:49,599
and if you think about the structure of
 

2315
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,430
and if you think about the structure of
the brothers karamazov i think

2316
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:51,440
the brothers karamazov i think
 

2317
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,670
the brothers karamazov i think
dostoevsky though he never says it this

2318
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,680
dostoevsky though he never says it this
 

2319
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,069
dostoevsky though he never says it this
way would run the argument differently

2320
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
way would run the argument differently
 

2321
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,470
way would run the argument differently
it's a modus tollens instead of a modus

2322
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:58,480
it's a modus tollens instead of a modus
 

2323
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,030
it's a modus tollens instead of a modus
ponens the argument for dostoevsky would

2324
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
ponens the argument for dostoevsky would
 

2325
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,910
ponens the argument for dostoevsky would
go like this yeah conditional statement

00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,920
go like this yeah conditional statement
 

2327
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,510
go like this yeah conditional statement
if there is no god then everything is

and there is a price to pay that's not a
 

2343
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,990
and there is a price to pay that's not a

responsibility
 

2349
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,069
responsibility
to have to recognize that you're at

2350
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,079
to have to recognize that you're at
 

2351

having been involved in whatever way you
 

2355
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,109
having been involved in whatever way you
were and letting that happen or bringing

were and letting that happen or bringing
 

2357
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,790
were and letting that happen or bringing
it about that it does happen

2358
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:36,800
it about that it does happen
 

2359
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,470
it about that it does happen
is to pay a price

2360
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,480
is to pay a price
 

2361
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,109
is to pay a price
so we're not beings that are constituted

2362
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
so we're not beings that are constituted
 

2363
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,550
so we're not beings that are constituted
in such a way

2364
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:42,560
in such a way
 

2365
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,390
in such a way
that everything is permitted

2366
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,400
that everything is permitted
 

2367
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,790
that everything is permitted
look at the facts of your existence

2368
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:46,800
look at the facts of your existence
 

2369
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,430
look at the facts of your existence
so not everything is permitted

2370
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
so not everything is permitted
 

2371
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,710
so not everything is permitted
therefore

2372
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
therefore
 

2373
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,390
therefore
there is a god

2374
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:54,400

 

2375
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,230

and and and the and the presence of a

2376
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,240
and and and the and the presence of a
 

2377
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,230
and and and the and the presence of a
god for dostoevsky i think it's just

2378
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,240
god for dostoevsky i think it's just
 

2379
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,950
god for dostoevsky i think it's just
found in this fact that when we do bad

2380
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:00,960
found in this fact that when we do bad
 

2381
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,870
found in this fact that when we do bad
things we feel guilty for them with that

2382
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
things we feel guilty for them with that
 

2383
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,190
things we feel guilty for them with that
we find ourselves to be responsible for

2384
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
we find ourselves to be responsible for
 

2385
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,349
we find ourselves to be responsible for
things even when we didn't intend to do

2386
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:07,359
things even when we didn't intend to do
 

2387
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,950
things even when we didn't intend to do
them but we just allowed ourselves to be

2388
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
them but we just allowed ourselves to be
 

2389
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,870
them but we just allowed ourselves to be
involved in them and the nature of god

2390
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:10,880
involved in them and the nature of god
 

2391
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,150
involved in them and the nature of god
for just the yeski is i mean unclear

2392
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,160
for just the yeski is i mean unclear
 

2393
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,150
for just the yeski is i mean unclear
i mean it's a very complex exploration

2394
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,160
i mean it's a very complex exploration
 

2395
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,829
i mean it's a very complex exploration
in itself and he

2396
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:17,839
in itself and he
 

2397
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,829
in itself and he
basically god speaks through several of

2398
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:19,839
basically god speaks through several of
 

2399
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,390
basically god speaks through several of
his characters in in complicated ways

2400
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:22,400
his characters in in complicated ways
 

2401
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,230
his characters in in complicated ways
yeah so it's not like a trivial

2402
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240

 

2403
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,069

it's totally not trivial and it's not a

2404
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:28,079
it's totally not trivial and it's not a
 

2405
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,349
it's totally not trivial and it's not a
a being that exists outside of time and

2406
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:31,359
a being that exists outside of time and
 

2407
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,870
a being that exists outside of time and
none of that is sort of relevant for

2408
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
none of that is sort of relevant for
 

2409
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,030
none of that is sort of relevant for
dostoevsky for him it's a question about

2410
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,040
dostoevsky for him it's a question about
 

2411
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,109
dostoevsky for him it's a question about
how we live our lives do we live our

2412
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
how we live our lives do we live our
 

2413
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,109
how we live our lives do we live our
lives in the mood that christianity says

2414
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:39,119
lives in the mood that christianity says
 

2415
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,630
lives in the mood that christianity says
it makes available to us which is the

2416
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:40,640
it makes available to us which is the
 

2417
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,630
it makes available to us which is the
mood of joy

2418
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:42,640
mood of joy
 

2419
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,710
mood of joy
is there um maybe this is a bit of a

2420
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:44,720
is there um maybe this is a bit of a
 

2421
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,270
is there um maybe this is a bit of a
tangent but so i'm a russian speaker

2422
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,280
tangent but so i'm a russian speaker
 

2423
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,710

i do think different languages allow you
to think in different ways and that

00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
to think in different ways and that
 

2519
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,430
to think in different ways and that
there's a sort of a mode of exist a way

there's a sort of a mode of exist a way
 

2521
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,030
there's a sort of a mode of exist a way
of being that's captured by a language

2522
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,040
of being that's captured by a language
 

2523
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,030
of being that's captured by a language
that it makes certain ways of thinking

2524
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:39,040
that it makes certain ways of thinking
 

2525
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,430
that it makes certain ways of thinking
about yourself or others more natural

2526
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
about yourself or others more natural
 

2527
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,230
about yourself or others more natural
and it closes off other ways of thinking

2528
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,240
and it closes off other ways of thinking
 

2529
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,309
and it closes off other ways of thinking
about yourself and others and so i think

2530
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:48,319
about yourself and others and so i think
 

2531
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,950
about yourself and others and so i think

feel like some of the ideas

2656
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
feel like some of the ideas
 

2657
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,190
feel like some of the ideas
that are conveyed to language are

2658
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:09,200
that are conveyed to language are
 

2659
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,270
that are conveyed to language are
actually can be put outside of language

2660
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:11,280
actually can be put outside of language
 

2661
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,230
actually can be put outside of language
so one of the challenges i have to do is

translations than others and that can be
 

2747
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,309
translations than others and that can be
really helpful for the non-native

2748
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:42,319
really helpful for the non-native
 

2749
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,390
really helpful for the non-native
speaker because

by paying attention to

2752
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:46,800
by paying attention to
 

2753
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,670
by paying attention to
the

2754
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:47,680
the
 

2755
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,230
the
places where translators diverge in

2756
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,240
places where translators diverge in
 

2757
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,150
places where translators diverge in
their translations of a given word or a

2758
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,160
their translations of a given word or a
 

2759
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,910
their translations of a given word or a
phrase or something like that you can

2760
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:53,920
phrase or something like that you can
 

2761
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,630
phrase or something like that you can
start to get the idea that somehow the

2762
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
start to get the idea that somehow the
 

2763
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,790
start to get the idea that somehow the
words that we have in english

2764
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:58,800
words that we have in english
 

2765
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,790
words that we have in english
they don't have the same contours as the

2766
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:00,800
they don't have the same contours as the
 

2767
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,950
they don't have the same contours as the
word in russian that's being translated

2768
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:02,960
word in russian that's being translated
 

2769
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,630
word in russian that's being translated
and then you can start to ask about what

2770
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
and then you can start to ask about what
 

2771
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,109
and then you can start to ask about what
those differences are

2772
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:07,119
those differences are
 

2773
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,750
those differences are
and i i think it's i think it's there's

2774
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:09,760
and i i think it's i think it's there's
 

2775
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,589
and i i think it's i think it's there's
a kind of magic to it i mean it's

2776
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:11,599
a kind of magic to it i mean it's
 

2777
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,430
a kind of magic to it i mean it's
astonishing how rich and affecting

2778
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
astonishing how rich and affecting
 

2779
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,030
astonishing how rich and affecting

probably can get some deep understanding
of ideas in those books by seeing the

2840
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,200
of ideas in those books by seeing the
 

2841
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,109
of ideas in those books by seeing the
struggle of the translators to capture

2842
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:25,119
struggle of the translators to capture
 

2843
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,270

and it's got this earthy
 

2909
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,950
and it's got this earthy
feel to it it sort of invokes the notion

uh sort of what you could run your
 

2917
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,069
uh sort of what you could run your
fingers through that would have a kind

2918
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:52,079
fingers through that would have a kind
 

2919
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,150
fingers through that would have a kind
of honesty to it

2920
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,160
of honesty to it
 

2921
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,109
of honesty to it
and

2922
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
and
 

2923
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,589
and
there's no latin word for that but in

2924
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
there's no latin word for that but in
 

2925
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,470

2926
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:00,480
eckart's interpretation of christianity
 

2927
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,549
eckart's interpretation of christianity
that's like the fundamental thing you

00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
that's like the fundamental thing you
 

2929
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,069
that's like the fundamental thing you
don't understand god until you

2930
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
don't understand god until you
 

2931
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,510
don't understand god until you
understand the way in which he is our

ground

2934
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:06,960
ground
 

2935
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,990
ground
and all of a sudden this mysticism gets

2936
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,000
and all of a sudden this mysticism gets
 

2937
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,470
and all of a sudden this mysticism gets
a kind of german can't

2938
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:12,480
a kind of german can't
 

2939
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,950
a kind of german can't
that makes sense to the people who speak

and that reveals something totally
different

existence was that was covered over by
 

2951
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,670
existence was that was covered over by
the fact that it always been done in

3223
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,470
giving up and committing suicide and i
thought well it's kind of a happy ending

3224
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:26,480
thought well it's kind of a happy ending
 

3225
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,510
thought well it's kind of a happy ending
but but but i also thought it it's a dim

3226
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
but but but i also thought it it's a dim
 

3227
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,150
but but but i also thought it it's a dim
view of what our our existence amounts

3228
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
view of what our our existence amounts
 

3229
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,030
view of what our our existence amounts
to

3230
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:33,040
to
 

3231
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,190
to
so i i think there's something

3232
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,200
so i i think there's something
 

3233
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,270
so i i think there's something
fascinating about that

3234
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
fascinating about that
 

3235
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,549
fascinating about that
but what i

3236
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:38,559
but what i
 

3237
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,789
but what i
came to believe and i tried to write

3238
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
came to believe and i tried to write
 

3239
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,470
came to believe and i tried to write
about this once i know you read the

3240
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:42,480
about this once i know you read the
 

3241
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,950
about this once i know you read the
thing about aliveness that i published

3242
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:44,960
thing about aliveness that i published
 

3243
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,430
thing about aliveness that i published
once that's secretly a criticism of

3244
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:47,440
once that's secretly a criticism of
 

3245
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,270
once that's secretly a criticism of
camus i don't think i mentioned camu in

3246
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:49,280
camus i don't think i mentioned camu in
 

3247
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,750
camus i don't think i mentioned camu in
there but i think camus has got the

3248
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
there but i think camus has got the
 

3249
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,430
there but i think camus has got the
phenomenon wrong

3250
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:53,440
phenomenon wrong
 

3251
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,670
phenomenon wrong
or he's missed some important aspect of

3252
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:55,680
or he's missed some important aspect of
 

3253
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,309
or he's missed some important aspect of
it because in camus view

3254
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
it because in camus view
 

3255
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,789
it because in camus view
when you experience your day as sort of

3256
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:00,799
when you experience your day as sort of
 

3257
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,950
when you experience your day as sort of
going on in this deadening way and

3258
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
going on in this deadening way and
 

3259
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,630
going on in this deadening way and
you're just doing the things that you

3260
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:04,640
you're just doing the things that you
 

3261
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,270
you're just doing the things that you
always do the way you always do them

3262
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280
always do the way you always do them
 

3263
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,990
always do the way you always do them
for camus that reveals the truth about

3264
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:10,000
for camus that reveals the truth about
 

3265
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,670
for camus that reveals the truth about
what our lives are

3266
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
what our lives are
 

3267
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,589
what our lives are
but i think there's some aspect at least

3268
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:13,599
but i think there's some aspect at least
 

3269
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,230
but i think there's some aspect at least
for me and maybe maybe he just didn't

3270
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:16,240
for me and maybe maybe he just didn't
 

3271
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,789
for me and maybe maybe he just didn't
feel this or didn't have access to it

3272
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:18,799
feel this or didn't have access to it
 

3273
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,109
feel this or didn't have access to it
maybe others don't but for me there's an

3274
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:21,119
maybe others don't but for me there's an
 

3275
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,150
maybe others don't but for me there's an
extra part to it which is somehow

3276
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:24,160
extra part to it which is somehow
 

3277
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,349
extra part to it which is somehow
that yes that's the way things are

3278
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:27,359
that yes that's the way things are
 

3279
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,230
that yes that's the way things are
and it's inadequate

3280
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:30,240
and it's inadequate
 

3281
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,870
and it's inadequate
and there's something that's missing

3282
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
and there's something that's missing
 

3283
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,430
and there's something that's missing
from that aspect of our existence

3284
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:35,440
from that aspect of our existence
 

3285
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,750
from that aspect of our existence
that could be there

3286
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:37,760
that could be there
 

3287
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,069
that could be there
and it feels like our lives are not

3288
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:40,079
and it feels like our lives are not
 

3289
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,470
and it feels like our lives are not
about just putting up with that and

3290
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:42,480
about just putting up with that and
 

3291
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,430
about just putting up with that and
sticking it to the gods by embracing it

3292
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:45,440
sticking it to the gods by embracing it
 

3293
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,710
sticking it to the gods by embracing it
but seeking that absence part of it the

3294
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:48,720
but seeking that absence part of it the
 

3295
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,910
but seeking that absence part of it the
part that's

3296
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
part that's
 

3297
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,470
part that's
recognizable in its absence

3298
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:52,480
recognizable in its absence
 

3299
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,470
recognizable in its absence
in your experience of that

3300
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:54,480
in your experience of that
 

3301

i think we do have the experience of the
 

3305
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,910
i think we do have the experience of the
presence of that in moments when

3306
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:01,920
presence of that in moments when

when they really felt alive and it could
 

3323

the gesture is reciprocated

3338
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,000

01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,950
or maybe you feel it in some moment when
you are

3342
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
you are
 

3343
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,430
you are
doing a kind of peak athletic thing or

3344
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:41,440
doing a kind of peak athletic thing or
 

3345
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,589
doing a kind of peak athletic thing or
watching somebody else do a peak

3346
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:43,599
watching somebody else do a peak
 

3347
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:44,950
watching somebody else do a peak
athletic thing

3348
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:44,960
athletic thing
 

3349
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,030
athletic thing
um but i think there are moments when we

3350
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:47,040
um but i think there are moments when we
 

3351
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,030
um but i think there are moments when we
when it feels like it's not like the way

3352
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:51,040
when it feels like it's not like the way
 

3353
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,990
when it feels like it's not like the way
camus is describing things

3354
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,000
camus is describing things
 

3355
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,549
camus is describing things
and it's better because of that so i

3356
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:56,559
and it's better because of that so i
 

3357
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,670
and it's better because of that so i
think one really powerful way

3358
01:00:59,670 --> 01:00:59,680
think one really powerful way
 

3359
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,950
think one really powerful way
to uh for me to understand aliveness

3360
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
to uh for me to understand aliveness
 

3361
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,190
to uh for me to understand aliveness
is to think about to go into a darker

3362
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,200
is to think about to go into a darker
 

3363
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,270
is to think about to go into a darker
territory is to think about suicide and

01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:07,280
territory is to think about suicide and
 

3365

a certain kind of
 

3379

where you look in the mirror
and ask do i

want to kill myself today
this is the question that camus asks

01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:33,520
this is the question that camus asks
 

3389
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,349
this is the question that camus asks
this question this philosophical

01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
and
 

3395
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,750
and
there is people

who
when they're depressed say

when they're depressed say
 

3401
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,870
when they're depressed say
not only do they say i want to kill

3402
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:44,880
not only do they say i want to kill
 

3403
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,789
not only do they say i want to kill
myself or i don't they say it doesn't

myself or i don't they say it doesn't
 

3405

and that's chemistry that's whatever

3408
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:51,599
and that's chemistry that's whatever
 

3409
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,470
and that's chemistry that's whatever
that is that's chemistry in our mind

that is that's chemistry in our mind
 

3411
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,190
that is that's chemistry in our mind
and then on the flip side of that for me

3412
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:57,200
and then on the flip side of that for me
 

3413
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,109
and then on the flip side of that for me
i've had some low points but i've very

i've had some low points but i've very

01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:01,039
been very fortunate to
 

3417
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:03,829
been very fortunate to
not suffer from that kind of depression

3418
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:03,839
not suffer from that kind of depression
 

3419
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,470
not suffer from that kind of depression
i am the opposite which is

great music or any of that i'm just
 

3427
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,109

mundane things like as you were saying

3430
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:19,760
mundane things like as you were saying
 

3431
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,750
mundane things like as you were saying
it i was drinking this thing and it's

3432
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:21,760
it i was drinking this thing and it's
 

3433
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,589
it i was drinking this thing and it's
cold and for some reason the coldness of

3434
01:02:23,589 --> 01:02:23,599
cold and for some reason the coldness of
 

3435
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,430
cold and for some reason the coldness of
that was uh

3436
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:25,440
that was uh
 

3437
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,069
that was uh
like oh great like refrigeration i don't

3438
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:28,079
like oh great like refrigeration i don't
 

3439
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,309
like oh great like refrigeration i don't
know there was a joy in that like i

3440
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:30,319
know there was a joy in that like i
 

3441
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,230
know there was a joy in that like i
can't put it into words but i just felt

3442
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
can't put it into words but i just felt
 

3443
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,309
can't put it into words but i just felt
great and then just so many things you

3444
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:34,319
great and then just so many things you
 

3445
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,150
great and then just so many things you
look out in nature

3446
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:36,160
look out in nature
 

3447
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,190
look out in nature
there's a nice breeze and just like

3448
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:39,200
there's a nice breeze and just like
 

3449
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,349
there's a nice breeze and just like
it's amazing so that

3450
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:41,359
it's amazing so that
 

3451
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,750
it's amazing so that
that doesn't feel

3452
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760
that doesn't feel
 

3453
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,710
that doesn't feel
like i'm embracing the absurd that seems

3454
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:46,720
like i'm embracing the absurd that seems
 

3455
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,029
like i'm embracing the absurd that seems
like i'm getting some nice like dopamine

3456
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:49,039
like i'm getting some nice like dopamine
 

3457
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,069
like i'm getting some nice like dopamine
hits

3458
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:50,079
hits
 

3459
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,549
hits
in whatever the chemistry is from just

3460
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:52,559
in whatever the chemistry is from just
 

3461
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,789
in whatever the chemistry is from just
the basics of life and that is the

3462
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:54,799
the basics of life and that is the
 

3463
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,789
the basics of life and that is the
source of aliveness however my brain is

3464
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:56,799
source of aliveness however my brain is
 

3465
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:57,829
source of aliveness however my brain is
built

3466
01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:57,839
built
 

3467
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,190
built
it's gotten

3468
01:02:59,190 --> 01:02:59,200
it's gotten
 

3469
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,789
it's gotten
a natural

3470
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:00,799
a natural
 

3471
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:03,430
a natural
sort of mechanism for

3472
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:03,440
sort of mechanism for
 

3473
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,109
sort of mechanism for
for aliveness

3474
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:05,119
for aliveness
 

3475
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,829
for aliveness
and and so the one nice way to see the

3476
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:07,839
and and so the one nice way to see the
 

3477
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:11,029
and and so the one nice way to see the
absence of aliveness is to look at the

3478
01:03:11,029 --> 01:03:11,039
absence of aliveness is to look at the
 

3479
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,990
absence of aliveness is to look at the
chemical the clinical depression

3480
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,000
chemical the clinical depression
 

3481
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,630
chemical the clinical depression
and so that camus doesn't seem to

3482
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640
and so that camus doesn't seem to
 

3483
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,710
and so that camus doesn't seem to
contend with that at all in asking the

3484
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
contend with that at all in asking the
 

3485
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,710
contend with that at all in asking the
question of suicide because when you

3486
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720
question of suicide because when you
 

3487
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,789
question of suicide because when you
look in the mirror and ask like if i ask

3488
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:22,799
look in the mirror and ask like if i ask
 

3489
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,190
look in the mirror and ask like if i ask
myself do i want to kill myself today i

3490
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
myself do i want to kill myself today i
 

3491
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,950
myself do i want to kill myself today i
ask that question in a different way

3492
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:26,960
ask that question in a different way
 

3493
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,270
ask that question in a different way
more like a stoic way often like

3494
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
more like a stoic way often like
 

3495
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,829
more like a stoic way often like
basically every day is you know what if

3496
01:03:31,829 --> 01:03:31,839
basically every day is you know what if
 

3497
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,470
basically every day is you know what if
i die today it's more like contemplating

3498
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:34,480
i die today it's more like contemplating
 

3499
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,029
i die today it's more like contemplating
your mortality every single day

3500
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:37,039
your mortality every single day
 

3501
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,630
your mortality every single day
you know uh that excites me

3502
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:40,640
you know uh that excites me
 

3503
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,829
you know uh that excites me
the possibility that this is my last day

3504
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:43,839
the possibility that this is my last day
 

3505
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,910
the possibility that this is my last day
that you know it just reminds me how

3506
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:45,920
that you know it just reminds me how
 

3507
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,750
that you know it just reminds me how
amazing life is and that's that's

3508
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:47,760
amazing life is and that's that's
 

3509
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,510
amazing life is and that's that's
chemistry i don't know what that is but

3510
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:49,520
chemistry i don't know what that is but
 

3511
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,349
chemistry i don't know what that is but
that's not that's certainly not

3512
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:53,359
that's not that's certainly not
 

3513
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,230
that's not that's certainly not
some kind of philosophical decision i

3514
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:56,240
some kind of philosophical decision i
 

3515
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,750
some kind of philosophical decision i
made i am a little bit riding a wave of

3516
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
made i am a little bit riding a wave of
 

3517
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,750
made i am a little bit riding a wave of
the chemistry of the genetics i've been

3518
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:01,760
the chemistry of the genetics i've been
 

3519
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,950
the chemistry of the genetics i've been
given

3520
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
given
 

3521
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,349
given
of the dopamine so that that question of

3522
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:05,359
of the dopamine so that that question of
 

3523
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,109
of the dopamine so that that question of
suicide um

3524
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
suicide um
 

3525
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,829
suicide um
by the way do you find that formulation

3526
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:09,839
by the way do you find that formulation
 

3527
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:14,470
by the way do you find that formulation
of the question of existentialism

3528
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:14,480

 

3529
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,910

i know you didn't want to teach it

3530
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
i know you didn't want to teach it
 

3531
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,750
i know you didn't want to teach it
because obviously suicide is a very

3532
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:17,760
because obviously suicide is a very
 

3533
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,430
because obviously suicide is a very
difficult word especially for young

3534
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
difficult word especially for young
 

3535
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,750
difficult word especially for young
minds but do you think that's a useful

3536
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:21,760
minds but do you think that's a useful
 

3537
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,270
minds but do you think that's a useful
formulation of the question of

3538
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:23,280
formulation of the question of
 

3539
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,109
formulation of the question of
existentialism

3540
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:25,119
existentialism
 

3541
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:27,029
existentialism
like him saying this is the most

3542
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:27,039
like him saying this is the most
 

3543
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,910
like him saying this is the most
important question of suicide i think i

3544
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:29,920
important question of suicide i think i
 

3545
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,829
important question of suicide i think i
think there is something to it if you

3546
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:31,839
think there is something to it if you
 

3547
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,549
think there is something to it if you
read the question as the question

3548
01:04:34,549 --> 01:04:34,559
read the question as the question
 

3549
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,029
read the question as the question
what is it in virtue of which it ought

3550
01:04:37,029 --> 01:04:37,039
what is it in virtue of which it ought
 

3551
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:37,990
what is it in virtue of which it ought
to be

3552
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:38,000
to be
 

3553
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,470
to be
desirable to conti to live the lives

3554
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:40,480
desirable to conti to live the lives
 

3555
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,029
desirable to conti to live the lives
that we're capable of of living that's

3556
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:43,039
that we're capable of of living that's
 

3557
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,029
that we're capable of of living that's
that's a deep question yeah that's a

3558
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:45,039
that's a deep question yeah that's a
 

3559
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,510
that's a deep question yeah that's a
question that gets focused

3560
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:47,520
question that gets focused
 

3561
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,589
question that gets focused
when someone asks themselves whether

3562
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:49,599
when someone asks themselves whether
 

3563
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,230
when someone asks themselves whether
they ought to continue to live that life

3564
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:52,240
they ought to continue to live that life
 

3565
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:52,950
they ought to continue to live that life
who

3566
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960
who
 

3567
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,990
who
would the famous line nothing focuses

3568
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,000
would the famous line nothing focuses
 

3569
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,510
would the famous line nothing focuses
the mind more than one's impending

3570
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,520
the mind more than one's impending
 

3571
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,910
the mind more than one's impending
execution

3572
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
execution
 

3573
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,589
execution
i mean i think that's i think there's

3574
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:01,599
i mean i think that's i think there's
 

3575
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:02,789
i mean i think that's i think there's
something

3576
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:02,799
something
 

3577
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,750
something
important about that that recognizing

3578
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:05,760
important about that that recognizing
 

3579
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,870
important about that that recognizing
the riskiness and the vulnerability of

3580
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:08,880
the riskiness and the vulnerability of
 

3581
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,349
the riskiness and the vulnerability of
one's existence is

3582
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:11,359
one's existence is
 

3583
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,990
one's existence is
super important and the idea and i think

3584
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:14,000
super important and the idea and i think
 

3585
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,069
super important and the idea and i think
that if we didn't have that

3586
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:16,079
that if we didn't have that
 

3587
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,589
that if we didn't have that
our lives

3588
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:17,599
our lives
 

3589
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,630
our lives
wouldn't be capable of being meaningful

3590
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
wouldn't be capable of being meaningful
 

3591
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,109
wouldn't be capable of being meaningful
if they weren't risky and vulnerable

3592
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:23,119
if they weren't risky and vulnerable
 

3593
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,950
if they weren't risky and vulnerable
there would be nothing to lose

3594
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
there would be nothing to lose
 

3595
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,470
there would be nothing to lose
and it's only because they're things to

3596
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:26,480
and it's only because they're things to
 

3597
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,750
and it's only because they're things to
lose that they can come to have the

3598
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:27,760
lose that they can come to have the
 

3599
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,510
lose that they can come to have the
significance that they do so yeah i

3600
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
significance that they do so yeah i
 

3601
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,230
significance that they do so yeah i
think

3602
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:30,240
think
 

3603
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,309
think
not against the idea that that's

3604
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:32,319
not against the idea that that's
 

3605
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:35,190
not against the idea that that's
a deep way of approaching the questions

3606
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,200
a deep way of approaching the questions
 

3607
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,150
a deep way of approaching the questions
at the core of of existentialism but as

3608
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
at the core of of existentialism but as
 

3609
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,309
at the core of of existentialism but as
you say i was worried for a while about

3610
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:40,319
you say i was worried for a while about
 

3611
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,950
you say i was worried for a while about
how i was gonna how i was gonna teach it

3612
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:42,960
how i was gonna how i was gonna teach it
 

3613
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,150
how i was gonna how i was gonna teach it
well i think there's a difference

3614
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:44,160
well i think there's a difference
 

3615
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,589
well i think there's a difference
between suicide and not living i

3616
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:47,599
between suicide and not living i
 

3617
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,870
between suicide and not living i
because suicide is an action yeah so it

3618
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:50,880
because suicide is an action yeah so it
 

3619
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,230
because suicide is an action yeah so it
feels like to me

3620
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:54,240

 

3621
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,829

like suicide doesn't make sense because

3622
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
like suicide doesn't make sense because
 

3623
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,390
like suicide doesn't make sense because
you know imagine you're in like a hotel

3624
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:00,400
you know imagine you're in like a hotel
 

3625
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,190
you know imagine you're in like a hotel
and you're saying the room i'm in sucks

3626
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,200
and you're saying the room i'm in sucks
 

3627
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,430
and you're saying the room i'm in sucks
but like there's other rooms so

3628
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:05,440
but like there's other rooms so
 

3629
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,829
but like there's other rooms so
like maybe explore those other rooms

3630
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:07,839
like maybe explore those other rooms
 

3631
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,230
like maybe explore those other rooms
maybe you'll find

3632
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:10,240
maybe you'll find
 

3633
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,549
maybe you'll find
meaning in those other rooms like

3634
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:12,559
meaning in those other rooms like
 

3635
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:13,910
meaning in those other rooms like
basically

3636
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:13,920
basically
 

3637
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,750
basically
embracing the fact that you don't know

3638
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:15,760
embracing the fact that you don't know
 

3639
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,950
embracing the fact that you don't know
everything

3640
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
everything
 

3641
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,270
everything
and there's uh you need time to explore

3642
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:19,280
and there's uh you need time to explore
 

3643
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,270
and there's uh you need time to explore
everything it's like

3644
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:21,280
everything it's like
 

3645
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,349
everything it's like
once you've explored everything then

3646
01:06:23,349 --> 01:06:23,359
once you've explored everything then
 

3647
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,670
once you've explored everything then
maybe you can make a full decision but

3648
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:25,680
maybe you can make a full decision but
 

3649
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,430
maybe you can make a full decision but
it's um

3650
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:27,440
it's um
 

3651
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,029
it's um
unfair to make

3652
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
unfair to make
 

3653
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,390
unfair to make
a decision

3654
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400
a decision
 

3655
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,789
a decision
it's i would say unethical

3656
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:32,799
it's i would say unethical
 

3657
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,710
it's i would say unethical
to make a decision until you've explored

3658
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:34,720
to make a decision until you've explored
 

3659
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,510
to make a decision until you've explored
all the rooms in the hotel yeah and this

3660
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:37,520
all the rooms in the hotel yeah and this
 

3661
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,190
all the rooms in the hotel yeah and this
gets focused in in the brothers

3662
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,200
gets focused in in the brothers
 

3663
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,150
gets focused in in the brothers
karamazov of course there's one brother

3664
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:42,160
karamazov of course there's one brother
 

3665
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:42,950
karamazov of course there's one brother
who

3666
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:42,960
who
 

3667
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,270
who
uh is really asking that question is

3668
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:45,280
uh is really asking that question is
 

3669
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,510
uh is really asking that question is
asking the question of suicide he's

3670
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:47,520
asking the question of suicide he's
 

3671
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,510
asking the question of suicide he's
asking the question whether

3672
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:49,520
asking the question whether
 

3673
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,589
asking the question whether
the world that we live in is a world

3674
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:51,599
the world that we live in is a world
 

3675
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,309
the world that we live in is a world
that's worth living in

3676
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
that's worth living in
 

3677
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,430
that's worth living in
and i think that characters as you say

3678
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:57,440
and i think that characters as you say
 

3679
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,910
and i think that characters as you say
very ill i mean that and and it's

3680
01:06:59,910 --> 01:06:59,920
very ill i mean that and and it's
 

3681
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,349
very ill i mean that and and it's
possible

3682
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:01,359
possible
 

3683
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:02,630
possible
um

3684
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:02,640
um
 

3685
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,150
um
and often because as you say of you know

3686
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:06,160
and often because as you say of you know
 

3687
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,710
and often because as you say of you know
brain chemistry physiologies there's

3688
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:08,720
brain chemistry physiologies there's
 

3689
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,990
brain chemistry physiologies there's
certainly a physical ground to that to

3690
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,000
certainly a physical ground to that to
 

3691
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,190
certainly a physical ground to that to
that situation to that condition

3692
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:15,200
that situation to that condition
 

3693
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,750
that situation to that condition
but i think it is it is possible for

3694
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:17,760
but i think it is it is possible for
 

3695
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,390
but i think it is it is possible for
someone to be in that situation

3696
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,400
someone to be in that situation
 

3697
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,069
someone to be in that situation
i think that

3698
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
i think that
 

3699
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,150
i think that
ivan karamazov who's the who's the

3700
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160
ivan karamazov who's the who's the
 

3701
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,789
ivan karamazov who's the who's the

and for a moment it's like you're
falling you don't

you you there's nothing supporting you
 

3907
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:13,910
you you there's nothing supporting you
until you're captured by your totally

3908
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:13,920
until you're captured by your totally
 

3909
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,030
until you're captured by your totally
new understanding of what was going on

3910
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:17,040
new understanding of what was going on
 

3911
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,550
new understanding of what was going on
and that humor necessarily has that kind

3912
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:20,560
and that humor necessarily has that kind
 

3913
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,830
and that humor necessarily has that kind
of destabilizing feature to it and

3914
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
of destabilizing feature to it and
 

3915
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,990
of destabilizing feature to it and
that's like the riskiness that's like

3916
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000
that's like the riskiness that's like
 

3917
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,590
that's like the riskiness that's like
the riskiness that you were you're

3918
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:27,600
the riskiness that you were you're
 

3919
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,590
the riskiness that you were you're
pointing to if if there aren't risks in

3920
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:29,600
pointing to if if there aren't risks in
 

3921
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,310
pointing to if if there aren't risks in
your life if your life is totally safe

3922
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
your life if your life is totally safe
 

3923
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,830
your life if your life is totally safe
then there's no possibility of

3924
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:33,840
then there's no possibility of
 

3925
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,470
then there's no possibility of
significance and so i think on eric's

3926
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:36,480
significance and so i think on eric's
 

3927
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,270
significance and so i think on eric's

the importance of the riskiness and
 

3933
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,229
the importance of the riskiness and
vulnerability in your life to its having

3934

is through our will to sort of

4148
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:41,600
is through our will to sort of
 

4149
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,910
is through our will to sort of
powerfully bring something about

powerfully bring something about
 

4151
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,350
powerfully bring something about

01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:47,360
and um if we're gonna do that in a way
 

4153

that reflects the fact that nothing
 

4155
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,910
that reflects the fact that nothing
means anything then what we should do is

4156
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:51,920
means anything then what we should do is
 

4157
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,510
means anything then what we should do is
take these things

4158
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
take these things
 

4159
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,990
take these things
these actions that people always thought

4160
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:56,000
these actions that people always thought
 

4161
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,070
these actions that people always thought
were bad

4162
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:58,080
were bad
 

4163
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,229
were bad
and do them and show that there's

4164
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:00,239
and do them and show that there's
 

4165
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,310
and do them and show that there's
nothing wrong with doing them

4166
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,320
nothing wrong with doing them
 

4167
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,470
nothing wrong with doing them
and so they decided they would murder

4168
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:04,480
and so they decided they would murder
 

4169
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,510
and so they decided they would murder
someone

4170
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
someone
 

4171
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,510
someone
not because they were angry at them just

4172
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:07,520
not because they were angry at them just
 

4173
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,030
not because they were angry at them just
someone they'd never met it was

4174
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:09,040
someone they'd never met it was
 

4175
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,229
someone they'd never met it was
important that it was someone they'd

never met it was totally unmotivated act
 

4179
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:16,470
never met it was totally unmotivated act
and they thought we'll embrace nihilism

4180
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,480

01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,709
it's like start saying you can pretend
you're not taking responsibility you you

4342
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:18,719
you're not taking responsibility you you
 

4343
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,470
you're not taking responsibility you you
you could pretend that you don't have to

4344
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:20,480
you could pretend that you don't have to
 

4345
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,149
you could pretend that you don't have to
make a decision that is making a

4346
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:22,159
make a decision that is making a
 

4347
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:23,270
make a decision that is making a
decision

4348
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:23,280
decision
 

4349
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,350
decision
not caring as a way of caring

4350
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:25,360
not caring as a way of caring
 

4351
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,750
not caring as a way of caring
and so i think the existentialists that

4352
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:27,760
and so i think the existentialists that
 

4353
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,870
and so i think the existentialists that
i'm interested in think that we do care

4354
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
i'm interested in think that we do care
 

4355
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,950
i'm interested in think that we do care
that's that's constitutive of what it is

4356
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:32,960
that's that's constitutive of what it is
 

4357
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,630
that's that's constitutive of what it is
to be us

4358
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:34,640
to be us
 

4359
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,070
to be us
and so they'll they'll think that the

4360
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
and so they'll they'll think that the
 

4361
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,630
and so they'll they'll think that the
stoics got it wrong but that that leaves

4362
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:38,640
stoics got it wrong but that that leaves
 

4363
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,510
stoics got it wrong but that that leaves
open

4364
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
open
 

4365
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,030
open
a huge range of moves about

4367
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,229
a huge range of moves about
how we inhabit that

4368
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:46,239
how we inhabit that
 

4369
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,590
how we inhabit that
existence well

4370
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:49,600

 

4371
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,270

let me ask about

4372
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:51,280
let me ask about

but it's been a long time since i've

4412
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:35,440
but it's been a long time since i've
 

4413
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,510
but it's been a long time since i've
read her stuff i read it in high school

4414
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:37,520
read her stuff i read it in high school
 

4415
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,030
read her stuff i read it in high school
i read the fountainhead in high school

4416
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:39,040
i read the fountainhead in high school
 

4417

i read the fountainhead in high school
and atlas shrugged but that's at this

4418
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:41,360
and atlas shrugged but that's at this
 

4419
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,950
and atlas shrugged but that's at this
point a very long time ago i think i

4420
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:42,960
point a very long time ago i think i
 

4421
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,470
point a very long time ago i think i
read something about objective

4422
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:44,480
read something about objective
 

4423
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,709
read something about objective
epistemology or something too

4424
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:46,719
epistemology or something too
 

4425
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:49,350
epistemology or something too
so you know my my view about her could

4426
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:49,360
so you know my my view about her could
 

4427
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,910
so you know my my view about her could
be based on a total misunderstanding of

4428
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
be based on a total misunderstanding of
 

4429
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,590
be based on a total misunderstanding of
of what she's up to

4430
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:53,600
of what she's up to
 

4431
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,629
of what she's up to
but sort of my my caricature of her and

4432
01:20:56,629 --> 01:20:56,639
but sort of my my caricature of her and
 

4433
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,790
but sort of my my caricature of her and
tell me if i've got it wrong

4434
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:58,800
tell me if i've got it wrong
 

4435
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,830
tell me if i've got it wrong
is that she's

4436
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:01,840
is that she's
 

4437
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,030
is that she's
sort of

4438
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:03,040
sort of
 

4439
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,870
sort of
motivated by

4440
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:04,880
motivated by
 

4441
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,750
motivated by
a kind of i think it's maybe sometimes

4442
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:07,760
a kind of i think it's maybe sometimes
 

4443
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,550
a kind of i think it's maybe sometimes
you call it libertarianism but

4444
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:10,560
you call it libertarianism but
 

4445
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,310
you call it libertarianism but
maybe let's in the context of our

4446
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:12,320
maybe let's in the context of our
 

4447
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,189
maybe let's in the context of our
discussion um tie it back to sartre a

4448
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
discussion um tie it back to sartre a
 

4449
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,510
discussion um tie it back to sartre a
kind of view according to which we're

4450
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:17,520
kind of view according to which we're
 

4451
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,590
kind of view according to which we're
the being who has to contend with the

4452
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:19,600
the being who has to contend with the
 

4453
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,430
the being who has to contend with the
fact that we're radically free to do

4454
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:21,440
fact that we're radically free to do
 

4455
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,270
fact that we're radically free to do
stuff and we're just not being

4456
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:23,280
stuff and we're just not being
 

4457
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,070
stuff and we're just not being
courageous or brave enough when we don't

4458
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
courageous or brave enough when we don't
 

4459
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,950
courageous or brave enough when we don't
do that and the people to admire

4460
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:28,960
do that and the people to admire
 

4461
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,189
do that and the people to admire
are the people who make stuff out of

4462
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
are the people who make stuff out of
 

4463
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,390
are the people who make stuff out of
nothing

4464
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
nothing
 

4465
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,790
nothing
um so maybe that's a bad caricature no

4466
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:34,800
um so maybe that's a bad caricature no
 

4467
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,430
um so maybe that's a bad caricature no
no but i i think uh no i think that's

4468
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:37,440
no but i i think uh no i think that's
 

4469
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,350
no but i i think uh no i think that's
pretty accurate i'm not again very

4470
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,360
pretty accurate i'm not again very
 

4471
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,390
pretty accurate i'm not again very
knowledgeable about the full depth of

4472
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,400
knowledgeable about the full depth of
 

4473
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,790
knowledgeable about the full depth of
her philosophy but i think she takes

4474
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:46,800

 

4475
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,950

a view of the world that's similar to

4476
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:48,960
a view of the world that's similar to
 

4477
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,229
a view of the world that's similar to
saturate in

4478
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
saturate in
 

4479
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,830
saturate in
in the conclusions

4480
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:51,840
in the conclusions
 

4481
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,790
in the conclusions
but

4482
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
but
 

4483
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,470
but
makes stronger statements about

epistemology

4486
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:56,239
epistemology
 

4487
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:59,270
epistemology
that first of all everything is knowable

4488
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
that first of all everything is knowable
 

4489
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,950
that first of all everything is knowable
and there's some you should always

01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:00,960
and there's some you should always
 

4491
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,950
and there's some you should always
operate through reason

4492
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:02,960
operate through reason
 

4493
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,229
operate through reason
like reason is very important like uh

4494
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:06,239
like reason is very important like uh
 

4495
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:07,669
like reason is very important like uh
it's like uh

4496
01:22:07,669 --> 01:22:07,679
it's like uh
 

4497
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,590
it's like uh
you start with a few axioms and you

4498
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:09,600
you start with a few axioms and you
 

4499
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,910
you start with a few axioms and you
build on top of that and

4500
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920
build on top of that and
 

4501
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,189
build on top of that and
the axioms that everybody should operate

4502
01:22:15,189 --> 01:22:15,199
the axioms that everybody should operate
 

4503
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,030
the axioms that everybody should operate
on are the same

4504
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:17,040
on are the same
 

4505
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,070
on are the same
again reality is objective it's not

4506
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:20,080
again reality is objective it's not
 

4507
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,350
again reality is objective it's not
subjective

4508
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:21,360
subjective
 

4509
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,149
subjective
and so from that you can derive the

4510
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:24,159
and so from that you can derive the
 

4511
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:26,470
and so from that you can derive the
entirety of how humans should behave at

4512
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
entirety of how humans should behave at
 

4513
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,229
entirety of how humans should behave at
the individual level

4514
01:22:28,229 --> 01:22:28,239
the individual level
 

4515
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,470
the individual level
and at the societal level and there's a

4516
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:30,480
and at the societal level and there's a
 

4517
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,149
and at the societal level and there's a
few conclusions

4518
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
few conclusions
 

4519
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,430
few conclusions
she would talk about virtue of

4520
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:33,440
she would talk about virtue of
 

4521
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,629
she would talk about virtue of
selfishness

4522
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:34,639
selfishness
 

4523
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,310
selfishness
and sort of a lot of people use that to

4524
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:36,320
and sort of a lot of people use that to
 

4525
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,149
and sort of a lot of people use that to
dismiss her look she's very selfish and

4528
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:39,600
so on she
 

4529
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,750
so on she
actually meant something very different

you know i was recently looking at like
a list of

4600
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,120
a list of
 

4601
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,470
a list of
the most

4602
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:02,480
the most
 

4603
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,270
the most
important women of the 20th century in

4604
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280
important women of the 20th century in
 

4605
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,790
important women of the 20th century in
terms of thought not science or but like

4606
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:08,800
terms of thought not science or but like
 

4607
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,750
terms of thought not science or but like
thought

4608
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:09,760
thought
 

4609
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,750
thought
and she wasn't in that list

4610
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
and she wasn't in that list
 

4611
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,669
and she wasn't in that list
and i just i see this time and time

4612
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:13,679
and i just i see this time and time
 

4613
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:14,550
and i just i see this time and time
again

4614
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:14,560
again
 

4615
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,550
again
and it doesn't make sense to me why

4616
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:16,560
and it doesn't make sense to me why
 

4617
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,310
and it doesn't make sense to me why
she's so

4618
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,320
she's so
 

4619
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,110
she's so
kind of dismissed because clearly she's

4620
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:21,120
kind of dismissed because clearly she's
 

4621
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,990
kind of dismissed because clearly she's
an author of some of the most read books

4622
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,000
an author of some of the most read books
 

4623
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,430
an author of some of the most read books
like ever

4624
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:25,440
like ever
 

4625
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,229
like ever
and

4626
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:26,239
and
 

4627
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:29,750
and
she clearly had very strong ideas that

4628
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:29,760
she clearly had very strong ideas that
 

4629
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,510
she clearly had very strong ideas that
should be contended with you know um

4630
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:33,520
should be contended with you know um
 

4631
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,270
should be contended with you know um
and that that's why it kind of didn't

4632
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:35,280
and that that's why it kind of didn't
 

4633
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,350
and that that's why it kind of didn't
make sense to me

4634
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:37,360
make sense to me
 

4635
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,189
make sense to me
because she's also a creature of her

4636
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:39,199
because she's also a creature of her
 

4637
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,030
because she's also a creature of her
time and an important one

4638
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:41,040
time and an important one
 

4639
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,189
time and an important one
she's a creation of the soviet union

4640
01:24:43,189 --> 01:24:43,199
she's a creation of the soviet union
 

4641
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,430
she's a creation of the soviet union
somebody who left because of that and so

4642
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:45,440
somebody who left because of that and so
 

4643
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,830
somebody who left because of that and so
some of her the strength of her ideas

4644
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:47,840
some of her the strength of her ideas
 

4645
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,950
some of her the strength of her ideas
has to do

4646
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:48,960
has to do
 

4647
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,709
has to do
with how much she dislikes that

4648
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:50,719
with how much she dislikes that
 

4649
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,229
with how much she dislikes that
particular uh

4650
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:52,239
particular uh
 

4651
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:56,070
particular uh
philosophy and uh way of life

4652
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,080
philosophy and uh way of life
 

4653
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,950
philosophy and uh way of life
but also she's a creature of like sartre

4654
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:58,960
but also she's a creature of like sartre
 

4655
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,270
but also she's a creature of like sartre
and like death whole like nietzsche

4656
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,280
and like death whole like nietzsche
 

4657
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,270
and like death whole like nietzsche
and so on now one of the other

4658
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:03,280
and so on now one of the other
 

4659
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,510
and so on now one of the other
criticisms is she doesn't integrate

4660
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:05,520
criticisms is she doesn't integrate
 

4661
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,390
criticisms is she doesn't integrate
herself into this history she keeps

4662
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:08,400
herself into this history she keeps
 

4663
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,830
herself into this history she keeps

01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,910
like one of the things i find
interesting about beauvoir is that she

4718
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:05,920
interesting about beauvoir is that she
 

4719
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,590
interesting about beauvoir is that she
takes seriously

4720
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:07,600
takes seriously
 

4721
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,709

the thing that

4722
01:26:08,709 --> 01:26:08,719
the thing that
 

4723
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:11,750
the thing that
sartre didn't which is our throneness

4724
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:11,760
sartre didn't which is our throneness
 

4725
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,750
sartre didn't which is our throneness
which is our um the sense in which

4726
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:15,760
which is our um the sense in which
 

4727
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,830
which is our um the sense in which
we're born into a situation that's

4728
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:17,840
we're born into a situation that's
 

4729
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,189
we're born into a situation that's
already got a significance for her

4730
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:21,199
already got a significance for her
 

4731
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,709
already got a significance for her
i think it was easier for her to to

4732
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:22,719
i think it was easier for her to to
 

4733
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,790
i think it was easier for her to to
recognize that than sartre because she

4734
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:24,800
recognize that than sartre because she
 

4735
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,990
recognize that than sartre because she
was a woman

4736
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:26,000
was a woman
 

4737
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,110
was a woman
and sartre seems to act as if

4738
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:29,120
and sartre seems to act as if
 

4739
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,550
and sartre seems to act as if
you know there are no constraints or at

4740
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:30,560
you know there are no constraints or at
 

4741
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,709
you know there are no constraints or at
least there shouldn't be we're pretty

4742
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:32,719
least there shouldn't be we're pretty
 

4743
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,750
least there shouldn't be we're pretty
close

4744
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:33,760
close
 

4745
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,070
close
as you know privileged white males yeah

4746
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:36,080
as you know privileged white males yeah
 

4747
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,669
as you know privileged white males yeah
exactly if we could just get rid of the

4748
01:26:37,669 --> 01:26:37,679
exactly if we could just get rid of the
 

4749
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,990
exactly if we could just get rid of the
last bits of them we would be god like

4750
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:40,000
last bits of them we would be god like
 

4751
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,990
last bits of them we would be god like
we're supposed to be yeah uh and i think

4752
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
we're supposed to be yeah uh and i think
 

4753
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,790
we're supposed to be yeah uh and i think
beauvoir sort of sees things differently

4754
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
beauvoir sort of sees things differently
 

4755
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,110
beauvoir sort of sees things differently
i think she reckons one does not one's

4756
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:47,120
i think she reckons one does not one's
 

4757
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,470
i think she reckons one does not one's
not born but becomes a woman she says so

4758
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,480
not born but becomes a woman she says so
 

4759
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,149
not born but becomes a woman she says so

4830
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:15,360
him in a particular social position with

and
 

4835
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,390
and
that that's um if you if you don't have

4836
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:20,400
that that's um if you if you don't have
 

4837
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,070
that that's um if you if you don't have
that experience it's much harder to

4838
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:22,080
that experience it's much harder to
 

4839
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,430
that experience it's much harder to
recognize

4840
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:23,440
recognize
 

4841
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,669
recognize
the um the way in which what we're

4842
01:28:25,669 --> 01:28:25,679
the um the way in which what we're
 

4843
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,270
the um the way in which what we're
thrown into something we might not have

4844
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:27,280
thrown into something we might not have
 

4845
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,110
thrown into something we might not have
chosen

4846
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:29,120
chosen
 

4847
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,350
chosen
so the idea that that

4848
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:31,360
so the idea that that
 

4849
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,830
so the idea that that
that that's not an aspect of our

4850
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:33,840
that that's not an aspect of our
 

4851
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,430
that that's not an aspect of our
existence um which as you'd describe in

4852
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:37,440
existence um which as you'd describe in
 

4853
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,830
existence um which as you'd describe in
rand's views it's she sounds more like

4854
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:39,840
rand's views it's she sounds more like
 

4855
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,030
rand's views it's she sounds more like
sorry she sounds more like it either

4856
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:43,040
sorry she sounds more like it either
 

4857
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,870
sorry she sounds more like it either
it's not an aspect of our existence or

4858
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:44,880
it's not an aspect of our existence or
 

4859
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,870
it's not an aspect of our existence or
at least we ought to sort of aim at its

4860
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:46,880
at least we ought to sort of aim at its
 

4861
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,950
at least we ought to sort of aim at its
not being and yeah almost act as if it's

4862
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:48,960
not being and yeah almost act as if it's
 

4863
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,750
not being and yeah almost act as if it's
not yeah exactly if it's not and so i i

4864
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:51,760
not yeah exactly if it's not and so i i
 

4865
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,350
not yeah exactly if it's not and so i i
think from my point of view i don't i

4866
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:53,360
think from my point of view i don't i
 

4867
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,149
think from my point of view i don't i
don't pretend that i'm explaining the

4868
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:56,159
don't pretend that i'm explaining the
 

4869
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,149
don't pretend that i'm explaining the
public reception of her i'm just sort of

4870
01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:58,159
public reception of her i'm just sort of
 

4871
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,390
public reception of her i'm just sort of
trying to trying to say how i understand

4872
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:00,400
trying to trying to say how i understand
 

4873
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,590
trying to trying to say how i understand
her in this

4874
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:01,600
her in this
 

4875
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,390
her in this
um intellectual context from my point of

4876
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:04,400
um intellectual context from my point of
 

4877
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,870
um intellectual context from my point of
view that's not something big big to

4878
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:06,880
view that's not something big big to
 

4879
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,590
view that's not something big big to
miss and the ambition to think that

4880
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:09,600
miss and the ambition to think that
 

4881
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,950
miss and the ambition to think that
really what's happening is that we're

4882
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
really what's happening is that we're
 

4883
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,510
really what's happening is that we're
all the same we're all rational beings

4884
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,520
all the same we're all rational beings
 

4885
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,189
all the same we're all rational beings
we're all beings who if we just got the

4886
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:15,199
we're all beings who if we just got the
 

4887
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:18,070
we're all beings who if we just got the
axioms of our existence right and made

4888
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:18,080
axioms of our existence right and made
 

4889
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,550
axioms of our existence right and made
good judgments and reasoned in an

4890
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:20,560
good judgments and reasoned in an
 

4891
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,350
good judgments and reasoned in an
appropriate way would

4892
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:23,360
appropriate way would
 

4893
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,189
appropriate way would
optimize ourselves

4894
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
optimize ourselves
 

4895
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,590
optimize ourselves
that feels to me like

4896
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:27,600
that feels to me like
 

4897
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,990
that feels to me like
a kind of natural

4898
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:30,000
a kind of natural
 

4899
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,070
a kind of natural
end point of

4900
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:32,080
end point of
 

4901
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,550
end point of
the philosophical tradition i mean plato

4902
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:34,560
the philosophical tradition i mean plato
 

4903
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,390
the philosophical tradition i mean plato
starts off with a view that helps us in

4904
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:36,400
starts off with a view that helps us in
 

4905
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,470
starts off with a view that helps us in
that direction and the enlightenment

4906
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:38,480
that direction and the enlightenment
 

4907
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,790
that direction and the enlightenment
moves us further in that direction

4908
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
moves us further in that direction
 

4909
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,990
moves us further in that direction
but from my point of view that movement

4910
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,000
but from my point of view that movement
 

4911
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,830
but from my point of view that movement
has led us astray

4912
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:45,840
has led us astray
 

4913
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,750
has led us astray
because it's missed something really

4914
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:47,760
because it's missed something really
 

4915
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,629
because it's missed something really
important that's crucial to the kind of

4916
01:29:50,629 --> 01:29:50,639
important that's crucial to the kind of
 

4917
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:52,629
important that's crucial to the kind of
being that that we are

4918
01:29:52,629 --> 01:29:52,639
being that that we are
 

4919
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:54,310
being that that we are
yeah and this is

4920
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:54,320
yeah and this is
 

4921
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,390
yeah and this is
the music exactly

4922
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:56,400
the music exactly
 

4923
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,750
the music exactly
that's just abuse

4924
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:57,760
that's just abuse
 

4925
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,990
that's just abuse
let's talk about throneness and i think

4926
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:00,000
let's talk about throneness and i think
 

4927
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,350
let's talk about throneness and i think
you mentioned that in the context of

4928
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:01,360
you mentioned that in the context of
 

4929
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,310
you mentioned that in the context of
heidegger yeah so can we talk about

4930
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:04,320
heidegger yeah so can we talk about
 

4931
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,830
heidegger yeah so can we talk about
heidegger okay who is this philosopher

4932
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:07,840
heidegger okay who is this philosopher
 

4933
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,590
heidegger okay who is this philosopher
what are some

4934
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:09,600
what are some
 

4935
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,510
what are some
fascinating ideas that he brought to the

4936
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:11,520
fascinating ideas that he brought to the
 

4937
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,590
fascinating ideas that he brought to the
world okay so martin heidegger was a

4938
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:13,600
world okay so martin heidegger was a
 

4939
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,390
world okay so martin heidegger was a
german philosopher he he i do know when

4940
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:16,400
german philosopher he he i do know when
 

4941
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,470
german philosopher he he i do know when
he was born in 1889

4942
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
he was born in 1889
 

4943
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,310
he was born in 1889
but i don't know that only by accident

4944
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,320
but i don't know that only by accident
 

4945
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,590
but i don't know that only by accident
it's because it's the same year that

4946
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:21,600
it's because it's the same year that
 

4947
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,510
it's because it's the same year that
wittgenstein an austrian philosopher was

4948
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:23,520
wittgenstein an austrian philosopher was
 

4949
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,590
wittgenstein an austrian philosopher was
born and the same year that hitler was

4950
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:25,600
born and the same year that hitler was
 

4951
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,910
born and the same year that hitler was
born so if i've remembered my dates

4952
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:27,920
born so if i've remembered my dates
 

4953
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,350
born so if i've remembered my dates
right and someone will call in and

4954
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:29,360
right and someone will call in and
 

4955
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,990
right and someone will call in and
correct me otherwise uh but that's the

4956
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
correct me otherwise uh but that's the
 

4957
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,950
correct me otherwise uh but that's the
way it it sort of sits in my memory bank

4958
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:34,960
way it it sort of sits in my memory bank
 

4959
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,550
way it it sort of sits in my memory bank
and it's interesting that the three of

4960
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:36,560
and it's interesting that the three of
 

4961
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,189
and it's interesting that the three of
them were born at the same time uh

4962
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:39,199
them were born at the same time uh
 

4963
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:41,110
them were born at the same time uh
wittgenstein and heidegger share some

4964
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:41,120
wittgenstein and heidegger share some
 

4965
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,790
wittgenstein and heidegger share some
similarities

4966
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:42,800
similarities
 

4967
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,390
similarities
but then it's also interesting that

4968
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:44,400
but then it's also interesting that
 

4969
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,709
but then it's also interesting that
heidegger was

4970
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:46,719
heidegger was
 

4971
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:48,310
heidegger was
was a nazi i mean this is a very

4972
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,320
was a nazi i mean this is a very
 

4973
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,310
was a nazi i mean this is a very
disturbing fact about his personal

4974
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:50,320
disturbing fact about his personal
 

4975
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,149
disturbing fact about his personal
political background

4976
01:30:52,149 --> 01:30:52,159
political background
 

4977
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,790
political background
um and so it's something that anyone who

4978
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:54,800
um and so it's something that anyone who
 

4979

um

5092
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,040
um
 

5093
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,149
um
and it's this uh if you live in a

5096
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:01,600
community
 

5097
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,870
community
where

01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:08,159
norms of the community rather than
 

5103
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:10,149

01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:12,310
elevated
then there's two things that you have to

5106
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:12,320
then there's two things that you have to
 

5107
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,590
then there's two things that you have to
recognize

5108
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:13,600
recognize
 

5109
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,149
recognize
one is that you bear some responsibility

5110
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:16,159
one is that you bear some responsibility
 

5111
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,189
one is that you bear some responsibility
for that

5112
01:33:17,189 --> 01:33:17,199
for that
 

5113
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,750
for that
not necessarily because you chose it

5114
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:19,760
not necessarily because you chose it
 

5115
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,590
not necessarily because you chose it
maybe you reviled it maybe you were

5116
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:21,600
maybe you reviled it maybe you were
 

5117
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,870
maybe you reviled it maybe you were
against it but there's some way in which

5118
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:24,880
against it but there's some way in which
 

5119
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,070
against it but there's some way in which
we all act in accordance with the norms

5120
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:28,080
we all act in accordance with the norms
 

5121
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,790
we all act in accordance with the norms
of our culture we all give in to them in

5122
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:30,800
of our culture we all give in to them in
 

5123
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,270
of our culture we all give in to them in
some way or another and if those norms

5124
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:33,280
some way or another and if those norms
 

5125
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,629
some way or another and if those norms
are broken

5126
01:33:34,629 --> 01:33:34,639
are broken
 

5127
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,470
are broken
then there's some way in which we've

5128
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:36,480
then there's some way in which we've
 

5129
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,870
then there's some way in which we've
allowed ourselves to be responsible for

5130
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:38,880
allowed ourselves to be responsible for
 

5131
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,790
allowed ourselves to be responsible for
for broken norms

5132
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:40,800
for broken norms
 

5133
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,470
for broken norms
we've become responsible for broken

5134
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:42,480
we've become responsible for broken
 

5135
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,070
we've become responsible for broken
norms and i i do think you have to face

5136
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:44,080
norms and i i do think you have to face
 

5137
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,350

up to that

5138
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,360
up to that
 

5139
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,149
up to that
i think that um let's just take gender

5140
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159

and that's a way of
 

5195
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:45,189
and that's a way of
taking responsibility by refusing to do

01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:56,320
lives we ought to recognize that
 

5205
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,669
lives we ought to recognize that
recognize that even in situations where

5206
01:34:59,669 --> 01:34:59,679
recognize that even in situations where
 

5207
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,550
recognize that even in situations where
you maybe didn't decide to do it you you

5208
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:02,560

and then
 

5215
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,310
and then
devote yourself to trying to figure out

5216
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:08,320
devote yourself to trying to figure out

5618
01:42:29,669 --> 01:42:29,679
and it's organized around the idea
 

5619
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:32,390
and it's organized around the idea
that to be something

5620
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:32,400
that to be something
 

5621
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,990
that to be something
is to be

5622
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,000
is to be
 

5623
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,910
is to be
what's sitting there

5624
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:35,920
what's sitting there
 

5625
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,109
what's sitting there
as an infinitely flexible

to be optimized and made efficient
 

5631
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:48,870
to be optimized and made efficient
and heidegger thinks that uh that's

5632
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:48,880
and heidegger thinks that uh that's
 

5633
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:49,990
and heidegger thinks that uh that's
that's

5634
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:50,000
that's
 

5635
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,709
that's
not just the way we think of

not just the way we think of

or you know the

the river when we put a hydroelectric
 

5643

way we understand ourselves too
we think of ourselves as this reserve

we think of ourselves as this reserve

students about it i ask them you know
 

5663
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,109
students about it i ask them you know
like

01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:25,119
like
 

5665
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,830

what's the goal of your day
is it to get as many things into it as

is it to get as many things into it as
 

5671
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:35,350
is it to get as many things into it as
possible is it to feel like i've i've

the feeling
 

5683
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,390
the feeling
uh that i think we all

5684
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:48,400
uh that i think we all
 

5685
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,350
uh that i think we all
have

have
 

5687
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:52,550
have
that there's some pressure to do that to

01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,560
that there's some pressure to do that to
 

5689
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,030
that there's some pressure to do that to
relate to ourselves that way

5690
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:55,040
relate to ourselves that way
 

5691
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,510
relate to ourselves that way
is a clue to what heidegger thinks the

01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:57,520
is a clue to what heidegger thinks the
 

5693
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,990
is a clue to what heidegger thinks the
technological age is about

01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:00,000
technological age is about
 

5695

technological age is about

and he thinks that's different from
 

5697
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:04,790

every other age in history

every other age in history

of realm

that represents the world in a certain

that represents the world in a certain
 

5715
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,430
that represents the world in a certain
way and we are closed in on ourselves in

01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:25,440
way and we are closed in on ourselves in
 

5717
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,750
way and we are closed in on ourselves in
the sense that um we have a special

the sense that um we have a special

relation to our representations

01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,070
relation to our representations
uh and that's that's what the realm of

uh and that's that's what the realm of

pre-socratic age to be was to be what
 

5731
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:43,910
pre-socratic age to be was to be what
whooshes up and lingers for a while and

whooshes up and lingers for a while and
 

5733
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,270
whooshes up and lingers for a while and
fades away the paradigm of of what is

fades away the paradigm of of what is

01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,990
fades away the paradigm of of what is
where thunderstorms and

01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:50,000
where thunderstorms and
 

5737
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,870
where thunderstorms and
the anger of the gods achilles battle

01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:52,880
the anger of the gods achilles battle
 

5739
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,830
the anger of the gods achilles battle
fury and it overtakes everything and

5740
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:55,840
fury and it overtakes everything and
 

5741
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,709
fury and it overtakes everything and
stays for a while and then leaves the

5742
01:44:58,709 --> 01:44:58,719
stays for a while and then leaves the
 

5743
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:00,790
stays for a while and then leaves the
the flowers blooming in spring and

5744
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:00,800
the flowers blooming in spring and
 

5745
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,350
the flowers blooming in spring and
that's very different from the way we

5746
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360
that's very different from the way we
 

5747
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,669
that's very different from the way we
experience ourselves and so the so the

5748
01:45:05,669 --> 01:45:05,679
experience ourselves and so the so the
 

5749
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,910
experience ourselves and so the so the
question is um what are we supposed to

5750
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:07,920
question is um what are we supposed to
 

5751
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,229
question is um what are we supposed to
do in the face of that and heidegger

5752
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:10,239
do in the face of that and heidegger
 

5753
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:11,510
do in the face of that and heidegger
thinks that

from the pre-socratics forward
 

5763
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,430
from the pre-socratics forward
is that

01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:21,440
is that

01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,030
is that
there is

there is
 

5767
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,229
there is
some entity that's the ground

some entity that's the ground
 

5769
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:28,310
some entity that's the ground
of the way we understand everything to

of the way we understand everything to

things that they are

things that they are
for the enlightenment it was us

for the enlightenment it was us

and heidegger thinks

5784
01:45:42,229 --> 01:45:42,239
and heidegger thinks
 

5785
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,470
and heidegger thinks
um whatever it is that stands at the

5786
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:44,480
um whatever it is that stands at the
 

5787
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,790
um whatever it is that stands at the
ground of what we are is not another

5788
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:46,800
ground of what we are is not another
 

5789
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,590
ground of what we are is not another
thing it's not another entity and we're

5790
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:49,600
thing it's not another entity and we're
 

5791
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,910
thing it's not another entity and we're
relating to it in the wrong way if we

5792
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:51,920
relating to it in the wrong way if we
 

5793
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,590
relating to it in the wrong way if we
think of it like that

5794
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:53,600
think of it like that
 

5795
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,270
think of it like that
there's some way and he this is partly

5796
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:55,280
there's some way and he this is partly
 

5797
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,750
there's some way and he this is partly
why i was interested in meister eckhart

5798
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:57,760
why i was interested in meister eckhart
 

5799
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,990
why i was interested in meister eckhart
he says what there is is there's giving

5800
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,000
he says what there is is there's giving
 

5801
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,590
he says what there is is there's giving
going on

5802
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:01,600
going on
 

5803
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,030
going on
in the world

5804
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:03,040
in the world
 

5805
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,189
in the world
and we're

5806
01:46:05,189 --> 01:46:05,199
and we're
 

5807
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:07,910
and we're
the grateful recipient of it

5808
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:07,920
the grateful recipient of it
 

5809
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:09,669
the grateful recipient of it
and the giving is like

5810
01:46:09,669 --> 01:46:09,679
and the giving is like
 

5811
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:11,350
and the giving is like
whatever it is it's the social norms

5812
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:11,360
whatever it is it's the social norms
 

5813
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,590
whatever it is it's the social norms
that were thrown into we didn't choose

5814
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:13,600
that were thrown into we didn't choose
 

5815
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,270
that were thrown into we didn't choose
them they were given to us and that's

5816
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:15,280
them they were given to us and that's
 

5817
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,430
them they were given to us and that's
the ground that is what makes it

5818
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:17,440
the ground that is what makes it
 

5819
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,270
the ground that is what makes it
possible for anything to be intelligible

5820
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,280
possible for anything to be intelligible
 

5821
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,270
possible for anything to be intelligible
at all if we lived outside of

5822
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:21,280
at all if we lived outside of
 

5823
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,669
at all if we lived outside of
communities if we lived in a world where

5824
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:23,679
communities if we lived in a world where
 

5825
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:26,149
communities if we lived in a world where
there were no social norms at all

5826
01:46:26,149 --> 01:46:26,159
there were no social norms at all
 

5827
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:27,830
there were no social norms at all
nothing would mean anything

5828
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:27,840
nothing would mean anything
 

5829
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,510
nothing would mean anything
nothing would have any significance

5830
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
nothing would have any significance
 

5831
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,830
nothing would have any significance
nothing would be regular in the way that

5832
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:31,840
nothing would be regular in the way that
 

5833
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,070
nothing would be regular in the way that
things need to be regular in order for

01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:34,080
things need to be regular in order for
 

5835
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:36,550
things need to be regular in order for
there to be departures or manifestations

5836
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:36,560
there to be departures or manifestations
 

5837
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:40,709
there to be departures or manifestations
of that regularity uh so so community

5838
01:46:40,709 --> 01:46:40,719
of that regularity uh so so community
 

5839
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:42,870
of that regularity uh so so community
norms are crucial

5840
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:42,880
norms are crucial
 

5841
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,590
norms are crucial
but they're also always updating

5842
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:45,600
but they're also always updating
 

5843
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,709
but they're also always updating
we place um we have some responsibility

5844
01:46:48,709 --> 01:46:48,719
we place um we have some responsibility
 

5845
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:49,830
we place um we have some responsibility
for

5846
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:49,840
for
 

5847
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,350
for
what they are and the way in which

5848
01:46:51,350 --> 01:46:51,360
what they are and the way in which
 

5849
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,669
what they are and the way in which
they're updating themselves

5850
01:46:53,669 --> 01:46:53,679
they're updating themselves
 

5851
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:55,750
they're updating themselves
and yet we didn't ever choose it to be

5852
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:55,760
and yet we didn't ever choose it to be
 

5853
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,030
and yet we didn't ever choose it to be
that way

5854
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:57,040
that way
 

5855
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,189
that way
so those norms are somehow

5856
01:46:59,189 --> 01:46:59,199
so those norms are somehow
 

5857
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:00,390
so those norms are somehow
giving

5858
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:00,400
giving
 

5859
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,310
giving
significance to us

5860
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:02,320
significance to us
 

5861
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:05,669
significance to us
in a way that that we're implicated in

5862
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:05,679
in a way that that we're implicated in
 

5863
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,709
in a way that that we're implicated in
we have some relation to and all that

5864
01:47:08,709 --> 01:47:08,719
we have some relation to and all that
 

5865
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:10,629
we have some relation to and all that
gets covered over if you think of us as

5866
01:47:10,629 --> 01:47:10,639
gets covered over if you think of us as
 

5867
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:13,109
gets covered over if you think of us as
efficient resources to be optimized is

5868
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:13,119
efficient resources to be optimized is
 

5869
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:16,310
efficient resources to be optimized is
that a conflicting view that we are

5870
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:16,320
that a conflicting view that we are
 

5871
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,870
that a conflicting view that we are
resources to be optimized is that is

5872
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:18,880
resources to be optimized is that is
 

5873
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,070
resources to be optimized is that is
that somehow

5874
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,080
that somehow
 

5875
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,910
that somehow
deeply conflicting with the fact that

5876
01:47:21,910 --> 01:47:21,920
deeply conflicting with the fact that
 

5877
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,830
deeply conflicting with the fact that
there's a ground that we stand on

5878
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:23,840
there's a ground that we stand on
 

5879
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,229
there's a ground that we stand on
absolutely so what heidegger thinks is

5880
01:47:26,229 --> 01:47:26,239
absolutely so what heidegger thinks is
 

5881
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,390
absolutely so what heidegger thinks is
that this is this he calls this the

5882
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:28,400
that this is this he calls this the
 

5883
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,189
that this is this he calls this the
supreme danger of the technological age

5884
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:31,199
supreme danger of the technological age
 

5885
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:33,510
supreme danger of the technological age
is that without ever having chosen it

5886
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:33,520
is that without ever having chosen it
 

5887
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,830
is that without ever having chosen it
without ever having decided it this is

5888
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:35,840
without ever having decided it this is
 

5889
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,510
without ever having decided it this is
the way we understand what it is to be

5890
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:37,520
the way we understand what it is to be
 

5891
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,870
the way we understand what it is to be
us

5892
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:38,880
us
 

5893
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,950
us
but he thinks that um it's also he says

5894
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:42,960
but he thinks that um it's also he says
 

5895
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,350
but he thinks that um it's also he says
quoting holderly in this 18th century

5896
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:45,360
quoting holderly in this 18th century
 

5897
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,750
quoting holderly in this 18th century
german poet he says in

5898
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:47,760
german poet he says in
 

5899
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,149
german poet he says in
in the supreme danger lies the saving

5900
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:50,159
in the supreme danger lies the saving
 

5901
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,870
in the supreme danger lies the saving
possibility so what does that mean it

5902
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:52,880
possibility so what does that mean it
 

5903
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,430
possibility so what does that mean it
means that we this is the this is the

5904
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,440
means that we this is the this is the
 

5905
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,870
means that we this is the this is the
understanding that we've been thrown

5906
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:56,880
understanding that we've been thrown
 

5907
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,790
understanding that we've been thrown
into that we've been given it's the gift

5908
01:47:58,790 --> 01:47:58,800
into that we've been given it's the gift
 

5909
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,109
into that we've been given it's the gift
that was given to us it's supremely

5910
01:48:01,109 --> 01:48:01,119
that was given to us it's supremely
 

5911
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:03,430
that was given to us it's supremely
dangerous if we let ourselves live that

5912
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:03,440
dangerous if we let ourselves live that
 

5913
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,229
dangerous if we let ourselves live that
way we'll destroy ourselves

5914
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:06,239
way we'll destroy ourselves
 

5915
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,629
way we'll destroy ourselves
but it's also the saving possibility

5916
01:48:08,629 --> 01:48:08,639
but it's also the saving possibility
 

5917
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:09,510
but it's also the saving possibility
because

5918
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:09,520
because
 

5919
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:14,149
because
if we recognize that we never chose that

5920
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:14,159
if we recognize that we never chose that
 

5921
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:15,109
if we recognize that we never chose that
that

5922
01:48:15,109 --> 01:48:15,119
that
 

5923
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:17,189
that
it was given to us

5924
01:48:17,189 --> 01:48:17,199
it was given to us
 

5925
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,270
it was given to us
but also we were implicated in its being

5926
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:19,280
but also we were implicated in its being
 

5927
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,189
but also we were implicated in its being
given and we could find a way to

5928
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:21,199
given and we could find a way to
 

5929
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:24,229
given and we could find a way to
supersede it that it's the ground but

5930
01:48:24,229 --> 01:48:24,239
supersede it that it's the ground but
 

5931
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:27,109
supersede it that it's the ground but
it's also updatable it calls the ground

5932
01:48:27,109 --> 01:48:27,119
it's also updatable it calls the ground
 

5933
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:29,910
it's also updatable it calls the ground
the groundless ground

5934
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:29,920
the groundless ground
 

5935
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,990
the groundless ground
it's it's not like an entity which is

5936
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:32,000
it's it's not like an entity which is
 

5937
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,149

eternal and non-changing is always

eternal and non-changing is always
 

5943
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,229
eternal and non-changing is always
updating itself and we're always

5944
01:48:40,229 --> 01:48:40,239
updating itself and we're always
 

5945
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:43,030
updating itself and we're always
involved in it's being updated but we're

5946
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:43,040
involved in it's being updated but we're
 

5947
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,510
involved in it's being updated but we're
only involved in it in the right way if

only involved in it in the right way if
 

5949
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,709
only involved in it in the right way if
we listen

5950
01:48:46,709 --> 01:48:46,719
we listen
 

5951
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:49,189
we listen
like miles davis

5952
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:49,199

01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:51,189
like miles davis
so optimization

5954
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
so optimization
 

5955
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,030
so optimization
is not a good

5956
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:53,040
is not a good
 

5957
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,270
is not a good
way to live life

5958
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:55,280
way to live life
 

5959
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,070
way to live life
if you thought that it was obviously

5960
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:58,080
if you thought that it was obviously
 

5961
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,390
if you thought that it was obviously
clear that that was

5962
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:00,400
clear that that was
 

5963
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,950
clear that that was
the relevant value so obviously clear

5964
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:02,960
the relevant value so obviously clear
 

5965
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,229
the relevant value so obviously clear
that it never even occurred to you to

5966
01:49:04,229 --> 01:49:04,239
that it never even occurred to you to
 

5967
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,950
that it never even occurred to you to
ask whether it was right to think that

5968
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:06,960
ask whether it was right to think that
 

5969
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,830
ask whether it was right to think that
then you would be in danger yeah got it

5970
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
then you would be in danger yeah got it
 

5971
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,550
then you would be in danger yeah got it
so yeah there is some in this modern

5972
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:12,560
so yeah there is some in this modern
 

5973
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,790
so yeah there is some in this modern
technological age in in the full meaning

5974
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:14,800
technological age in in the full meaning
 

5975
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,270
technological age in in the full meaning

01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:17,280
of the word technology that's updated to
 

5977
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:19,990
of the word technology that's updated to
actual modern age with

01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:20,000
actual modern age with

actual modern age with
a lot more technology going on

5980
01:49:22,629 --> 01:49:22,639
a lot more technology going on
 

5981
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,950
a lot more technology going on
it uh it does feel like

01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:24,960
it uh it does feel like
 

5983
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,830
it uh it does feel like
like colleagues of mine in tech space

5984
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:26,840
like colleagues of mine in tech space
 

5985
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:29,430

01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:40,470
is um
the inefficiencies exactly and i think

5998
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:40,480
the inefficiencies exactly and i think
 

5999
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,870
the inefficiencies exactly and i think
if you think about other other contexts

6000

if you think about other other contexts

01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,790
if you think about other other contexts

i mean we're unique in this respect this

i mean we're unique in this respect this
this period in history is unlike any

6006
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:49,840
this period in history is unlike any
 

6007
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,229
this period in history is unlike any
previous no nobody ever felt that way

6008
01:49:52,229 --> 01:49:52,239
previous no nobody ever felt that way
 

6009
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:54,470
previous no nobody ever felt that way
right but think about but it's also true

6010
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:54,480
right but think about but it's also true
 

6011
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,470
right but think about but it's also true
that nobody no previous period in

6012
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:56,480
that nobody no previous period in
 

6013
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:58,310
that nobody no previous period in
history was nihilistic

6014
01:49:58,310 --> 01:49:58,320
history was nihilistic
 

6015
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,629
history was nihilistic
so our condition is tied up that sort of

6016
01:50:00,629 --> 01:50:00,639
so our condition is tied up that sort of
 

6017
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:03,430
so our condition is tied up that sort of
thing is meant to be a response to the

01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:03,440

01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:05,430
thing is meant to be a response to the

6020
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:05,440
felt lack of a ground
 

6021
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,629

and

6022
01:50:06,629 --> 01:50:06,639
and
 

6023
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:10,470
and
so no no previous epoch in history felt

6024
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:10,480
so no no previous epoch in history felt
 

6025

what people said
things that were surprising and new to

6262
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:31,360
things that were surprising and new to
 

6263
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:34,390
things that were surprising and new to
him and that's humility actually that is

6264
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:34,400
him and that's humility actually that is
 

6265
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:37,270
him and that's humility actually that is
listening to the world absolutely

6266
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:37,280
listening to the world absolutely
 

6267
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:39,830
listening to the world absolutely
absolutely he was always ready to be

6268
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:39,840
absolutely he was always ready to be
 

6269
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,189
absolutely he was always ready to be
surprised

6270
01:54:41,189 --> 01:54:41,199
surprised
 

6271
01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:41,990
surprised
by

6272
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:42,000
by
 

6273
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,550
by
something that someone said yeah and

6274
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:44,560
something that someone said yeah and
 

6275
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,470
something that someone said yeah and
there's something astonishing about that

6276
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:46,480
there's something astonishing about that
 

6277
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,430
there's something astonishing about that
so his influence was you know for people

6278
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:49,440
so his influence was you know for people
 

6279
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,189
so his influence was you know for people
who didn't know him through his

6280
01:54:51,189 --> 01:54:51,199
who didn't know him through his
 

6281
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,189
who didn't know him through his
interpretations of these texts he wrote

6282
01:54:53,189 --> 01:54:53,199
interpretations of these texts he wrote
 

6283
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:55,189
interpretations of these texts he wrote
about a huge range of stuff but for

6284
01:54:55,189 --> 01:54:55,199
about a huge range of stuff but for
 

6285
01:54:55,199 --> 01:54:56,870
about a huge range of stuff but for
people who did know him it was through

6286
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:56,880
people who did know him it was through
 

6287
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,709
people who did know him it was through
his presence it was through the way he

6288
01:54:58,709 --> 01:54:58,719
his presence it was through the way he
 

6289
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:01,750
his presence it was through the way he
carried himself in in his life

6290
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:01,760
carried himself in in his life
 

6291
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,709
carried himself in in his life
and uh so in any case that that's who he

6292
01:55:04,709 --> 01:55:04,719
and uh so in any case that that's who he
 

6293
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:07,510
and uh so in any case that that's who he
was we i graduated

6294
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:07,520
was we i graduated
 

6295
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:10,070
was we i graduated
after many years as a graduate student i

6296
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,080
after many years as a graduate student i
 

6297
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,910
after many years as a graduate student i
i didn't start in philosophy i started

6298
01:55:11,910 --> 01:55:11,920
i didn't start in philosophy i started
 

6299
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,430
i didn't start in philosophy i started
in math math and computer science

6300
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:13,440
in math math and computer science
 

6301
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,350
in math math and computer science
actually and then i did a lot of work in

6302
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:15,360
actually and then i did a lot of work in
 

6303
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,270
actually and then i did a lot of work in
computational neuroscience for a few

6304
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:17,280
computational neuroscience for a few
 

6305
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,750
computational neuroscience for a few
years it's a fascinating journey we'll

6306
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:19,760
years it's a fascinating journey we'll
 

6307
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,149
years it's a fascinating journey we'll
we'll get to it through our friendly

6308
01:55:22,149 --> 01:55:22,159
we'll get to it through our friendly
 

6309
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:23,510
we'll get to it through our friendly
conversation about artificial

6310
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:23,520
conversation about artificial
 

6311
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,830
conversation about artificial
intelligence okay i'm sure

6312
01:55:25,830 --> 01:55:25,840
intelligence okay i'm sure
 

6313
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,830
intelligence okay i'm sure
because you're you're basically

6314
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,840
because you're you're basically
 

6315
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,669
because you're you're basically
fascinated with the

6316
01:55:29,669 --> 01:55:29,679
fascinated with the
 

6317
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:32,149
fascinated with the
philosophy of mind of the human mind but

6318
01:55:32,149 --> 01:55:32,159
philosophy of mind of the human mind but
 

6319
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:35,830
philosophy of mind of the human mind but
rooted in a curiosity of mind through

6320
01:55:35,830 --> 01:55:35,840
rooted in a curiosity of mind through
 

6321
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,830
rooted in a curiosity of mind through
the it's artificial

6322
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:37,840
the it's artificial
 

6323
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,990
the it's artificial
through the engineering of mind yeah

6324
01:55:39,990 --> 01:55:40,000
through the engineering of mind yeah
 

6325
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,470
through the engineering of mind yeah
yeah that's right so bur so bert i mean

6326
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:42,480
yeah that's right so bur so bert i mean
 

6327
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:44,149
yeah that's right so bur so bert i mean
the reason i was attracted to him

6328
01:55:44,149 --> 01:55:44,159
the reason i was attracted to him
 

6329
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:47,109
the reason i was attracted to him
actually is is because of his uh to

6330
01:55:47,109 --> 01:55:47,119
actually is is because of his uh to
 

6331
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:49,669
actually is is because of his uh to
begin with was because of his criticisms

6332
01:55:49,669 --> 01:55:49,679
begin with was because of his criticisms
 

6333
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,669
begin with was because of his criticisms
of what was called traditional symbolic

6334
01:55:51,669 --> 01:55:51,679
of what was called traditional symbolic
 

6335
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:54,310
of what was called traditional symbolic
ai in the 70s and 80s

6336
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:54,320
ai in the 70s and 80s
 

6337
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,229
ai in the 70s and 80s
so i came to berkeley as a graduate

6338
01:55:56,229 --> 01:55:56,239
so i came to berkeley as a graduate
 

6339
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:58,310
so i came to berkeley as a graduate
student who'd done a lot of math and a

6340
01:55:58,310 --> 01:55:58,320
student who'd done a lot of math and a
 

6341
01:55:58,320 --> 01:55:59,510
student who'd done a lot of math and a
lot of computer science a lot of

6342
01:55:59,510 --> 01:55:59,520
lot of computer science a lot of
 

6343
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,669
lot of computer science a lot of
computational neuroscience i

6344
01:56:01,669 --> 01:56:01,679
computational neuroscience i
 

6345
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:04,550
computational neuroscience i
i noticed that you had you

6346
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:04,560
i noticed that you had you
 

6347
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,149
i noticed that you had you
interview a lot of a lot of people in

6348
01:56:06,149 --> 01:56:06,159
interview a lot of a lot of people in
 

6349
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:09,430
interview a lot of a lot of people in
this world and i had a teacher at brown

6350
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:09,440
this world and i had a teacher at brown
 

6351
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:12,550
this world and i had a teacher at brown
as an undergraduate uh jim anderson who

6352
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:12,560
as an undergraduate uh jim anderson who
 

6353
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,550
as an undergraduate uh jim anderson who
wrote with jeff hinton a big book on

6354
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:14,560
wrote with jeff hinton a big book on
 

6355
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,430
wrote with jeff hinton a big book on
neural networks um so so i had i was

6356
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:17,440
neural networks um so so i had i was
 

6357
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,109
neural networks um so so i had i was
interested in that

6358
01:56:19,109 --> 01:56:19,119
interested in that
 

6359
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:22,229
interested in that
not so interested in traditional ai like

6360
01:56:22,229 --> 01:56:22,239
not so interested in traditional ai like
 

6361
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:24,470
not so interested in traditional ai like
sort of lisp programmings things that

6362
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:24,480
sort of lisp programmings things that
 

6363
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,070
sort of lisp programmings things that
went on in the 80s

6364
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:26,080
went on in the 80s
 

6365
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,510
went on in the 80s
because it felt

6366
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:27,520
because it felt
 

6367
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,790
because it felt
sort of

6368
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:28,800
sort of
 

6369
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,550
sort of
you know when you made a system do

6370
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:30,560
you know when you made a system do
 

6371
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,470
you know when you made a system do
something all of a sudden it was an un

6372
01:56:32,470 --> 01:56:32,480
something all of a sudden it was an un
 

6373
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:34,790
something all of a sudden it was an un
interesting thing to have done

6374
01:56:34,790 --> 01:56:34,800
interesting thing to have done
 

6375
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,550
interesting thing to have done
the fact that you'd solved the problem

6376
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:36,560
the fact that you'd solved the problem
 

6377
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:37,750
the fact that you'd solved the problem
then made it clear that the problem

6378
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:37,760
then made it clear that the problem
 

6379
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,510
then made it clear that the problem
wasn't an interesting one to solve

6380
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:39,520
wasn't an interesting one to solve
 

6381
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:40,470
wasn't an interesting one to solve
that's right

6382
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:40,480
that's right
 

6383
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,550
that's right
and i had that experience and and bert

6384
01:56:42,550 --> 01:56:42,560
and i had that experience and and bert
 

6385
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,470
and i had that experience and and bert
had criticisms of of um symbolic ai what

6386
01:56:46,470 --> 01:56:46,480
had criticisms of of um symbolic ai what
 

6387
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:49,669
had criticisms of of um symbolic ai what
he called good old-fashioned ai gofi

6388
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:49,679
he called good old-fashioned ai gofi
 

6389
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:51,990
he called good old-fashioned ai gofi
and um and i was attracted to those

6390
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,000
and um and i was attracted to those
 

6391
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,990
and um and i was attracted to those
criticisms because

6392
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,000
criticisms because
 

6393
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,149
criticisms because
it felt to me that there was something

6394
01:56:56,149 --> 01:56:56,159
it felt to me that there was something
 

6395
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:59,270
it felt to me that there was something
lacking in in in that project and i

6396
01:56:59,270 --> 01:56:59,280
lacking in in in that project and i
 

6397
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,510
lacking in in in that project and i
didn't know what it was i i just felt

6398
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:01,520
didn't know what it was i i just felt
 

6399
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,950
didn't know what it was i i just felt
its absence

6400
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:02,960
its absence
 

6401
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,149
its absence
and uh

6402
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:04,159
and uh
 

6403
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:08,470
and uh
then i learned that all his arguments

6404
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:08,480
then i learned that all his arguments
 

6405
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,750
then i learned that all his arguments
came from his reading of this

6406
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:09,760
came from his reading of this
 

6407
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,350
came from his reading of this
phenomenological and existential

6408
01:57:11,350 --> 01:57:11,360
phenomenological and existential
 

6409
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:13,750
phenomenological and existential
tradition and so i had to try to figure

6410
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:13,760
tradition and so i had to try to figure
 

6411
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,189
tradition and so i had to try to figure
out what those folks were saying and it

6412
01:57:15,189 --> 01:57:15,199
out what those folks were saying and it
 

6413
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:17,830
out what those folks were saying and it
was a long road let me tell you

6414
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:17,840
was a long road let me tell you
 

6415
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:19,750
was a long road let me tell you
it took me a long time but but it was

6416
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:19,760
it took me a long time but but it was
 

6417
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,189
it took me a long time but but it was
because of birth that i was able to do

6418
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:21,199
because of birth that i was able to do
 

6419
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:23,189

a bunch of stuff that we're studying
 

7029
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:58,310
a bunch of stuff that we're studying
with physics and astrophysics and stuff

7030
02:08:58,310 --> 02:08:58,320
with physics and astrophysics and stuff
 

7031
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:00,350
with physics and astrophysics and stuff
but but they used to be

7032
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:00,360
but but they used to be
 

7033
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,870
but but they used to be
awe-inspiring and we have to figure out

7034
02:09:02,870 --> 02:09:02,880
awe-inspiring and we have to figure out
 

7035
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:05,030
awe-inspiring and we have to figure out
how to get in that relation to them but

7036
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:05,040
how to get in that relation to them but
 

7037
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:06,870
how to get in that relation to them but
not by trying to give a unity to our

7038
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:06,880
not by trying to give a unity to our
 

7039
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,310
not by trying to give a unity to our
existence through

7040
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:08,320
existence through
 

7041
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,390
existence through
developing habits and practices that get

7042
02:09:10,390 --> 02:09:10,400
developing habits and practices that get
 

7043
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,069
developing habits and practices that get
written on our body

7044
02:09:12,069 --> 02:09:12,079
written on our body
 

7045
02:09:12,079 --> 02:09:14,910
written on our body
and so his is about the end of

7046
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:14,920
and so his is about the end of
 

7047
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:17,830
and so his is about the end of

um but there was there's there's this
 

7159
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:20,950
um but there was there's there's this
there was a question

7160
02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:20,960
there was a question
 

7161
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,030

with the condition with what we need to

7164
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:25,520
with the condition with what we need to
 

7165
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:27,910
with the condition with what we need to
do to achieve our salvation

7166
02:11:27,910 --> 02:11:27,920
do to achieve our salvation
 

7167
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:30,550
do to achieve our salvation
to live well to make our lives worth

7168

to live well to make our lives worth
 

7169
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:31,750
to live well to make our lives worth
living

7170
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:31,760
living
 

7171
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:33,750
living
and he clearly

7172
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:33,760
and he clearly
 

7173
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,030
and he clearly
in the end felt like he couldn't do that

7174
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:37,040
in the end felt like he couldn't do that
 

7175
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,950
in the end felt like he couldn't do that
so in addition to the physiological

7176
02:11:38,950 --> 02:11:38,960
so in addition to the physiological
 

7177
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:41,430
so in addition to the physiological
thing which probably most of it the

7178
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:41,440
thing which probably most of it the
 

7179
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:43,510
thing which probably most of it the
question for me was could you find in

7180
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:43,520
question for me was could you find in

his writing

7182
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:45,360
his writing
 

7183
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:46,709

what his
what he was identifying

7186
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:48,800
what he was identifying
 

7187
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:51,430
what he was identifying
as the thing we needed to be doing

7188
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:51,440
as the thing we needed to be doing
 

7189
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:53,270
as the thing we needed to be doing
that he nevertheless felt we couldn't be

7190
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:53,280
that he nevertheless felt we couldn't be
 

7191
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:54,470
that he nevertheless felt we couldn't be
doing

7192

doing
 

7193
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:57,030
doing
and he and he talks as if that's that's

7194
02:11:57,030 --> 02:11:57,040

the difficulty for him

7196
02:11:59,189 --> 02:11:59,199

7269
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:21,750
way to talk yourself out of it he says

02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:21,760
is to recognize the possibility that
 

7271
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:24,069
is to recognize the possibility that
maybe that wasn't an action directed at

7272
02:13:24,069 --> 02:13:24,079
maybe that wasn't an action directed at
 

7273
02:13:24,079 --> 02:13:24,950

02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:52,470
and i think there's something
interesting about that i think there's

02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:52,480
interesting about that i think there's
 

7301
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:54,790
interesting about that i think there's
something right about that

7302
02:13:54,790 --> 02:13:54,800
something right about that
 

7303
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,550
something right about that
at the same time

7304
02:13:56,550 --> 02:13:56,560
at the same time

i don't think he speaks as if
we can just spin out these stories and

7308
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:04,000
we can just spin out these stories and
 

7309
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,510
we can just spin out these stories and
whether they're true or not doesn't

7310
02:14:05,510 --> 02:14:05,520
whether they're true or not doesn't
 

7311
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:06,790
whether they're true or not doesn't
matter

7312
02:14:06,790 --> 02:14:06,800
matter
 

7313
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:09,189
matter
what matters is that they free us from

7314
02:14:09,189 --> 02:14:09,199
what matters is that they free us from
 

7315
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:11,750
what matters is that they free us from
this assumption yes and i think they

7316
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:11,760
this assumption yes and i think they
 

7317
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:13,350
this assumption yes and i think they
only free us from this assumption if

7318
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:13,360
only free us from this assumption if
 

7319
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:15,350
only free us from this assumption if
they're true

7320
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:15,360
they're true
 

7321
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:17,750
they're true
like sometimes the guy really did direct

7322
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:17,760
like sometimes the guy really did direct
 

7323
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:19,189
like sometimes the guy really did direct
it at you and that's part of the

7324
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:19,199
it at you and that's part of the
 

7325
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:21,030
it at you and that's part of the
situation and like you can't pretend

7326
02:14:21,030 --> 02:14:21,040
situation and like you can't pretend
 

7327
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:23,189
situation and like you can't pretend
that it's not part of the situation you

7328
02:14:23,189 --> 02:14:23,199
that it's not part of the situation you
 

7329
02:14:23,199 --> 02:14:24,310
that it's not part of the situation you
have to find the right way of dealing

7330
02:14:24,310 --> 02:14:24,320
have to find the right way of dealing
 

7331
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:25,750
have to find the right way of dealing
with that situation so you have to

7332
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:25,760
with that situation so you have to
 

7333
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:26,709
with that situation so you have to
listen

7334
02:14:26,709 --> 02:14:26,719
listen
 

7335
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:29,030
listen
to what's actually happening

7336
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:29,040
to what's actually happening
 

7337
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,870
to what's actually happening
and then you have to figure out how to

7338
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:30,880
and then you have to figure out how to
 

7339
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:33,589
and then you have to figure out how to
make it right and i think he's he thinks

7340
02:14:33,589 --> 02:14:33,599
make it right and i think he's he thinks
 

7341
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:35,510
make it right and i think he's he thinks
that we have too much freedom he thinks

7342
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:35,520
that we have too much freedom he thinks
 

7343
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,030
that we have too much freedom he thinks
that you don't have to listen to the

7344
02:14:37,030 --> 02:14:37,040
that you don't have to listen to the
 

7345
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:38,310
that you don't have to listen to the
situation you can just tell whatever

7346
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:38,320
situation you can just tell whatever
 

7347
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:39,510
situation you can just tell whatever

02:14:40,709 --> 02:14:40,719
about it
 

7351
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:43,669
about it
and i think that's actually too tough

7352
02:14:43,669 --> 02:14:43,679
and i think that's actually too tough
 

7353
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:45,510
and i think that's actually too tough
i don't think we have that kind of

7354
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:45,520
i don't think we have that kind of
 

7355
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:46,550
i don't think we have that kind of
freedom

7356
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:46,560
freedom
 

7357
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:48,550
freedom

incredibly moving letters when he's

that
really sort of drove him to distraction

7368
02:14:58,229 --> 02:14:58,239
really sort of drove him to distraction
 

7369
02:14:58,239 --> 02:15:00,470

with having a body like if you didn't

7532
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:57,280
with having a body like if you didn't

physical

7538
02:18:01,910 --> 02:18:01,920
physical
 

7539
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:04,950
physical
excitement and so on but uh but somehow

7540
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:04,960
excitement and so on but uh but somehow
 

7541
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:07,030
excitement and so on but uh but somehow
having a body is essentially a

7542
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:07,040
having a body is essentially a
 

7543
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:09,030
having a body is essentially a
limitation

7544
02:18:09,030 --> 02:18:09,040
limitation
 

7545
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:11,349
limitation
that when you watch someone who's got

7546
02:18:11,349 --> 02:18:11,359
that when you watch someone who's got
 

7547
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:13,669
that when you watch someone who's got
one and is extraordinary at the way they

7548
02:18:13,669 --> 02:18:13,679
one and is extraordinary at the way they
 

7549
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:14,709
one and is extraordinary at the way they
use it

7550
02:18:14,709 --> 02:18:14,719
use it
 

7551
02:18:14,719 --> 02:18:17,270
use it
you can recognize how that limitation

7552
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:17,280
you can recognize how that limitation
 

7553
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:20,230
you can recognize how that limitation
can be to some degree transcended

7554
02:18:20,230 --> 02:18:20,240
can be to some degree transcended
 

7555
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:22,230
can be to some degree transcended
and that that's what we can get when we

7556
02:18:22,230 --> 02:18:22,240
and that that's what we can get when we
 

7557
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:24,870
and that that's what we can get when we
watch federer or some other great

7558
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:24,880
watch federer or some other great
 

7559
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:27,349
watch federer or some other great
athlete sort of doing these things that

7560
02:18:27,349 --> 02:18:27,359
athlete sort of doing these things that
 

7561
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:29,589
athlete sort of doing these things that
transcend the limitations of their

7562
02:18:29,589 --> 02:18:29,599
transcend the limitations of their
 

7563
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:30,790
transcend the limitations of their
bodies

7564
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:30,800
bodies
 

7565
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:33,190
bodies
and that that's the kind of peak

7566
02:18:33,190 --> 02:18:33,200
and that that's the kind of peak
 

7567
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:36,230
and that that's the kind of peak
experience that we're capable of that

7568
02:18:36,230 --> 02:18:36,240
experience that we're capable of that
 

7569
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:38,150
experience that we're capable of that
could be a kind of salvation that's a

7570
02:18:38,150 --> 02:18:38,160
could be a kind of salvation that's a
 

7571
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:39,910
could be a kind of salvation that's a
very different story

7572
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:39,920
very different story
 

7573
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:42,629

and but actually
i think it's an unachievable goal to be

7706

that a lot of times when people are

7712
02:21:13,270 --> 02:21:13,280
that a lot of times when people are
 

7713
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:14,710
that a lot of times when people are
bored with something it's because they

7714
02:21:14,710 --> 02:21:14,720
bored with something it's because they
 

7715
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:16,389
bored with something it's because they
haven't tried hard enough

7716
02:21:16,389 --> 02:21:16,399
haven't tried hard enough
 

7717
02:21:16,399 --> 02:21:19,270
haven't tried hard enough
and i do think quite a lot of what

7718
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:19,280
and i do think quite a lot of what
 

7719
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:21,349
and i do think quite a lot of what
makes people bored with something is

7720
02:21:21,349 --> 02:21:21,359
makes people bored with something is
 

7721
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:22,710
makes people bored with something is
that they haven't paid attention well

7722
02:21:22,710 --> 02:21:22,720
that they haven't paid attention well
 

7723
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:23,750
that they haven't paid attention well
enough

7724
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:23,760
enough
 

7725
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:25,910
enough
and that they haven't listened as as you

7726
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:25,920
and that they haven't listened as as you
 

7727
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:27,030
and that they haven't listened as as you
were saying

7728
02:21:27,030 --> 02:21:27,040
were saying
 

7729
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:29,830
were saying
um so i i do think there's something to

7730
02:21:29,830 --> 02:21:29,840
um so i i do think there's something to
 

7731
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:32,230
um so i i do think there's something to
that i think that's a deep insight

7732
02:21:32,230 --> 02:21:32,240
that i think that's a deep insight
 

7733
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:33,590
that i think that's a deep insight
on the other hand

7734
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:33,600
on the other hand
 

7735
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:34,469
on the other hand
the

7736
02:21:34,469 --> 02:21:34,479
the
 

7737
02:21:34,479 --> 02:21:37,270
the
perfection of that insight is that

7738
02:21:37,270 --> 02:21:37,280
perfection of that insight is that
 

7739
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:38,790
perfection of that insight is that
nothing

7740
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:38,800
nothing
 

7741
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:42,150
nothing
is ever anything less than joyful

7742
02:21:42,150 --> 02:21:42,160
is ever anything less than joyful
 

7743
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:45,590
is ever anything less than joyful
and i actually think that dostoevsky and

7745
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:48,950
and i actually think that dostoevsky and
melville both agree but in very

7746
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:48,960
melville both agree but in very
 

7747
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:50,710
melville both agree but in very
different ways

7748
02:21:50,710 --> 02:21:50,720
different ways
 

7749
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:52,150
different ways
that

7750
02:21:52,150 --> 02:21:52,160
that
 

7751
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:54,790
that
life involves a wide range

7752
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:54,800
life involves a wide range
 

7753
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:56,710

of moods

7754
02:21:56,710 --> 02:21:56,720
of moods
 

7755
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:59,510
of moods
and that all of them are important

7756
02:21:59,510 --> 02:21:59,520
and that all of them are important
 

7757
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:02,309
and that all of them are important
it involves grief like i think

7758
02:22:02,309 --> 02:22:02,319

and
it's not in the first instance joyful

7766
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:09,520
it's not in the first instance joyful
 

7767
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:12,630

more intense
but it makes them more intense by

02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:20,160
but it makes them more intense by
 

7775
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:21,429
but it makes them more intense by

02:23:33,590 --> 02:23:33,600
and even when i'm down it's a way of
 

7837
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:34,870
and even when i'm down it's a way of
being up

7838
02:23:34,870 --> 02:23:34,880
being up
 

7839
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:37,190
being up
but it's really down

7840

it's just that it's a way of being up
 

7843

it's just that it's a way of being up

7844
02:23:40,710 --> 02:23:40,720
because it makes the ups even upper
 

7845

because it makes the ups even upper
well i guess then the perfectionism of

02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:43,040
well i guess then the perfectionism of

02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:46,550
well i guess then the perfectionism of
that can be destructive

7848
02:23:46,550 --> 02:23:46,560
that can be destructive
 

7849
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:49,510
that can be destructive
i mean i i tend to uh see for example

7850
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:49,520

8203
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:04,389

so

8204
02:30:04,389 --> 02:30:04,399
so
 

8205
02:30:04,399 --> 02:30:06,550
so
to make the argument

8206
02:30:06,550 --> 02:30:06,560
to make the argument
 

8207
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:09,910
to make the argument
you have to have in mind

8208
02:30:09,910 --> 02:30:09,920
you have to have in mind
 

8209
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:12,469
you have to have in mind
what counts as

8210
02:30:12,469 --> 02:30:12,479
what counts as
 

8211
02:30:12,479 --> 02:30:15,429
what counts as
art what counts as a creative artistic

8212
02:30:15,429 --> 02:30:15,439
art what counts as a creative artistic
 

8213
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:17,030
art what counts as a creative artistic
act

8214
02:30:17,030 --> 02:30:17,040
act
 

8215
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:19,030
act
i take it that

8216
02:30:19,030 --> 02:30:19,040
i take it that
 

8217
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,429
i take it that
just doing something new

8218
02:30:21,429 --> 02:30:21,439
just doing something new
 

8219
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:23,349
just doing something new
isn't sufficient

8220
02:30:23,349 --> 02:30:23,359
isn't sufficient
 

8221
02:30:23,359 --> 02:30:26,630
isn't sufficient
i mean we say that good art is original

8222
02:30:26,630 --> 02:30:26,640
i mean we say that good art is original
 

8223
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:28,630
i mean we say that good art is original
but not everything that's never been

8224
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:28,640
but not everything that's never been
 

8225
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:31,190
but not everything that's never been
done before is good art

8226
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:31,200
done before is good art
 

8227
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:33,429
done before is good art
so there has to be more than just doing

8228
02:30:33,429 --> 02:30:33,439
so there has to be more than just doing
 

8229
02:30:33,439 --> 02:30:34,469
so there has to be more than just doing
something

8230
02:30:34,469 --> 02:30:34,479
something
 

8231
02:30:34,479 --> 02:30:35,830
something
new

8232
02:30:35,830 --> 02:30:35,840
new
 

8233
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:37,270
new
it has to be

8234
02:30:37,270 --> 02:30:37,280
it has to be
 

8235
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:39,910
it has to be
somehow doing something new in a way

8236
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:39,920
somehow doing something new in a way
 

8237
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:42,309
somehow doing something new in a way
that speaks to

8238
02:30:42,309 --> 02:30:42,319
that speaks to
 

8239
02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:45,270
that speaks to
the audience or speaks to

8240
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:45,280
the audience or speaks to
 

8241
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:47,750
the audience or speaks to
some portion of the audience at least it

8242
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:47,760
some portion of the audience at least it
 

8243
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:50,070
some portion of the audience at least it
has to be doing something new

8244
02:30:50,070 --> 02:30:50,080
has to be doing something new
 

8245
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:51,990
has to be doing something new
in such a way

8246
02:30:51,990 --> 02:30:52,000
in such a way
 

8247
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:52,790
in such a way
that

8248
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:52,800
that
 

8249
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:56,550
that
some people who see or interact with it

8250
02:30:56,550 --> 02:30:56,560
some people who see or interact with it
 

8251
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:58,630
some people who see or interact with it
can see themselves anew

8252
02:30:58,630 --> 02:30:58,640
can see themselves anew
 

8253
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:02,389
can see themselves anew
in it so i think that art is inherently

8254
02:31:02,389 --> 02:31:02,399
in it so i think that art is inherently
 

8255
02:31:02,399 --> 02:31:05,110
in it so i think that art is inherently
a creative act it it i'm sorry

a creative act it it i'm sorry
 

8257
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:08,630
a creative act it it i'm sorry
a kind of um communicative act

8258
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:08,640
a kind of um communicative act
 

8259
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:11,190
a kind of um communicative act
that it it involves a relation with

8260

so
think about the conditions for that

8268
02:31:17,349 --> 02:31:17,359
think about the conditions for that
 

8269

but as as nietzsche says about his own
 

8307
02:31:57,439 --> 02:32:00,630
but as as nietzsche says about his own
stuff i mean we now can recognize that

stuff i mean we now can recognize that
 

8309
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:02,230

reached its time yet
and and now

8316
02:32:10,469 --> 02:32:10,479
and and now
 

8317
02:32:10,479 --> 02:32:12,870

music
so that's a deep communicative act it

8332
02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:29,760
so that's a deep communicative act it
 

8333
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:33,270
so that's a deep communicative act it
didn't perform its communication

8334
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:33,280
didn't perform its communication
 

8335
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,910
didn't perform its communication
in that opening moment

8336
02:32:35,910 --> 02:32:35,920
in that opening moment
 

8337
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:39,429
in that opening moment
but it did ultimately establish a new

but it did ultimately establish a new
 

8339
02:32:39,439 --> 02:32:41,270
but it did ultimately establish a new
understanding for all of us of what

02:32:41,270 --> 02:32:41,280
understanding for all of us of what
 

8341
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:42,950
understanding for all of us of what
counts as good art and that's the kind

8342
02:32:42,950 --> 02:32:42,960
counts as good art and that's the kind
 

8343
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:43,750
counts as good art and that's the kind
of

8344
02:32:43,750 --> 02:32:43,760
of
 

8345
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:46,309
of
deep communication that i think good art

8346
02:32:46,309 --> 02:32:46,319
deep communication that i think good art
 

8347
02:32:46,319 --> 02:32:48,070
deep communication that i think good art
can can do it can change our

8348
02:32:48,070 --> 02:32:48,080
can can do it can change our
 

8349
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:49,910
can can do it can change our
understanding

8350
02:32:49,910 --> 02:32:49,920
understanding
 

8351
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:50,830
understanding
of

8352
02:32:50,830 --> 02:32:50,840
of
 

8353
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:53,590
of
ourselves and of what a good

8354
02:32:53,590 --> 02:32:53,600
ourselves and of what a good
 

8355
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:55,750
ourselves and of what a good
manifestation of something of ourselves

8356
02:32:55,750 --> 02:32:55,760
manifestation of something of ourselves
 

8357
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:57,429
manifestation of something of ourselves
in a certain domain is

8358
02:32:57,429 --> 02:32:57,439
in a certain domain is
 

8359
02:32:57,439 --> 02:32:59,190
in a certain domain is
and he used the term

8360
02:32:59,190 --> 02:32:59,200
and he used the term
 

8361
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:01,429
and he used the term
socially embedded that art is

8362
02:33:01,429 --> 02:33:01,439
socially embedded that art is
 

8363
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:04,309
socially embedded that art is
fundamentally socially embedded yeah and

8364
02:33:04,309 --> 02:33:04,319
fundamentally socially embedded yeah and
 

8365
02:33:04,319 --> 02:33:07,349
fundamentally socially embedded yeah and
i really like that term because um

8366
02:33:07,349 --> 02:33:07,359
i really like that term because um
 

8367
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:09,270
i really like that term because um
i see like my love for artificial

8368
02:33:09,270 --> 02:33:09,280
i see like my love for artificial
 

8369
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:11,270
i see like my love for artificial
intelligence and the kind of system that

8370
02:33:11,270 --> 02:33:11,280
intelligence and the kind of system that
 

8371
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,590
intelligence and the kind of system that
we can bring to the world that could

8372
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:13,600
we can bring to the world that could
 

8373
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:16,389
we can bring to the world that could
uh make for an interesting and more

8374
02:33:16,389 --> 02:33:16,399
uh make for an interesting and more
 

8375
02:33:16,399 --> 02:33:18,870
uh make for an interesting and more
lively world and one that enriches human

8376
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:18,880
lively world and one that enriches human
 

8377
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:21,830
lively world and one that enriches human
beings is one where the ai systems are

8378
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:21,840
beings is one where the ai systems are
 

8379
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:25,270
beings is one where the ai systems are
deeply socially embedded good yeah so so

8380
02:33:25,270 --> 02:33:25,280
deeply socially embedded good yeah so so
 

8381
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:27,590
deeply socially embedded good yeah so so
that and that actually is in contrast to

8382
02:33:27,590 --> 02:33:27,600
that and that actually is in contrast to
 

8383
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:29,030
that and that actually is in contrast to
the way

8384
02:33:29,030 --> 02:33:29,040
the way
 

8385
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:30,630
the way
artificial intelligence have been talked

8386
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:30,640
artificial intelligence have been talked
 

8387
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:32,309
artificial intelligence have been talked
about throughout its history and

8388
02:33:32,309 --> 02:33:32,319
about throughout its history and
 

8389
02:33:32,319 --> 02:33:34,230
about throughout its history and
certainly now both on the robotic side

8390
02:33:34,230 --> 02:33:34,240
certainly now both on the robotic side
 

8391
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:35,910
certainly now both on the robotic side
and the ai side

8392
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:35,920
and the ai side
 

8393
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:38,070
and the ai side
it's especially on the uh the tech

8394
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:38,080
it's especially on the uh the tech
 

8395
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:39,750
it's especially on the uh the tech
sector with

8396
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:39,760
sector with
 

8397
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:42,309
sector with
the businesses around ai they kind of

8398
02:33:42,309 --> 02:33:42,319
the businesses around ai they kind of
 

8399
02:33:42,319 --> 02:33:44,630
the businesses around ai they kind of
want to create um

8400
02:33:44,630 --> 02:33:44,640
want to create um
 

8401
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:48,309
want to create um
systems that are like servants to humans

8402
02:33:48,309 --> 02:33:48,319
systems that are like servants to humans
 

8403
02:33:48,319 --> 02:33:50,870
systems that are like servants to humans
and then humans do all the beautiful

8404
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:50,880
and then humans do all the beautiful
 

8405
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:53,510
and then humans do all the beautiful
human messiness of

8406
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:53,520
human messiness of
 

8407
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:55,349
human messiness of
where art would be part

8408
02:33:55,349 --> 02:33:55,359
where art would be part
 

8409
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:57,110
where art would be part
i i think that

8410
02:33:57,110 --> 02:33:57,120
i i think that
 

8411
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:59,190
i i think that
there is no reason why you can't

8412
02:33:59,190 --> 02:33:59,200
there is no reason why you can't
 

8413
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:01,429
there is no reason why you can't
integrate ai systems

8414
02:34:01,429 --> 02:34:01,439
integrate ai systems
 

8415
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:03,750
integrate ai systems
in the way you integrate new humans to

8416
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:03,760
in the way you integrate new humans to
 

8417
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:06,070
in the way you integrate new humans to
the picture they're just the full

8418
02:34:06,070 --> 02:34:06,080
the picture they're just the full
 

8419
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:08,630
the picture they're just the full
diversity and the flaws all of that

8420
02:34:08,630 --> 02:34:08,640
diversity and the flaws all of that
 

8421
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:10,870
diversity and the flaws all of that
adds to the thing yeah

8422
02:34:10,870 --> 02:34:10,880
adds to the thing yeah
 

8423
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:14,070
adds to the thing yeah
like you know some people might say

8424
02:34:14,070 --> 02:34:14,080
like you know some people might say
 

8425
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:17,110
like you know some people might say
that alpha zero is this uh system from

8426
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:17,120
that alpha zero is this uh system from
 

8427
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:20,630
that alpha zero is this uh system from
deep mind that was able to achieve

8428
02:34:20,630 --> 02:34:20,640
deep mind that was able to achieve
 

8429
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:21,830
deep mind that was able to achieve
uh

8430
02:34:21,830 --> 02:34:21,840
uh
 

8431
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:23,429
uh
you know solve the game it beat the best

8432
02:34:23,429 --> 02:34:23,439
you know solve the game it beat the best
 

8433
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:25,670
you know solve the game it beat the best
people in the world at the game of go

8434
02:34:25,670 --> 02:34:25,680
people in the world at the game of go
 

8435
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:27,830
people in the world at the game of go
with no supervision from humans

8436
02:34:27,830 --> 02:34:27,840
with no supervision from humans
 

8437
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:29,750
with no supervision from humans
but more interestingly to me on the side

8438
02:34:29,750 --> 02:34:29,760
but more interestingly to me on the side
 

8439
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:32,550
but more interestingly to me on the side
of creativity it was able to surprise a

8440
02:34:32,550 --> 02:34:32,560
of creativity it was able to surprise a
 

8441
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:34,230
of creativity it was able to surprise a
lot of grand masters

8442
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:34,240
lot of grand masters
 

8443
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:36,389
lot of grand masters
with the kind of moves they came up with

8444
02:34:36,389 --> 02:34:36,399
with the kind of moves they came up with
 

8445
02:34:36,399 --> 02:34:39,030
with the kind of moves they came up with
now to me that's not

8446
02:34:39,030 --> 02:34:39,040
now to me that's not
 

8447
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:41,670
now to me that's not
the creativity the magic that's socially

8448
02:34:41,670 --> 02:34:41,680
the creativity the magic that's socially
 

8449
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:43,510
the creativity the magic that's socially
embedded that we're talking about that

8450
02:34:43,510 --> 02:34:43,520
embedded that we're talking about that
 

8451
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:45,990
embedded that we're talking about that
is merely um

8452
02:34:45,990 --> 02:34:46,000
is merely um
 

8453
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:49,190
is merely um
revealing the limitations of humans to

8454
02:34:49,190 --> 02:34:49,200
revealing the limitations of humans to
 

8455
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:50,630
revealing the limitations of humans to
discover

8456
02:34:50,630 --> 02:34:50,640
discover
 

8457
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:53,349
discover
it's it's like uh to solve a particular

8458
02:34:53,349 --> 02:34:53,359
it's it's like uh to solve a particular
 

8459
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:55,830
it's it's like uh to solve a particular
aspect of a math problem

8460
02:34:55,830 --> 02:34:55,840
aspect of a math problem
 

8461
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:59,270
aspect of a math problem
i think creativity is

8462
02:34:59,270 --> 02:34:59,280
i think creativity is
 

8463
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:01,510
i think creativity is
not just um

8464
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:01,520
not just um
 

8465
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:03,670
not just um
not just even socially embedded it's the

8466
02:35:03,670 --> 02:35:03,680
not just even socially embedded it's the
 

8467
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:05,830
not just even socially embedded it's the
way you're saying is it's part of the

8468
02:35:05,830 --> 02:35:05,840
way you're saying is it's part of the
 

8469
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:08,790
way you're saying is it's part of the
communicative act it's the interactive

8470
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:08,800
communicative act it's the interactive
 

8471
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:11,349
communicative act it's the interactive
it's the dance with the culture and so

8472
02:35:11,349 --> 02:35:11,359
it's the dance with the culture and so
 

8473
02:35:11,359 --> 02:35:15,110
it's the dance with the culture and so
it has to be like for alpha zero

8474
02:35:15,110 --> 02:35:15,120
it has to be like for alpha zero
 

8475
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:18,070
it has to be like for alpha zero
to be creative truly creative it would

8476
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:18,080
to be creative truly creative it would
 

8477
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:20,309
to be creative truly creative it would
have to be integrated in a way where it

8478
02:35:20,309 --> 02:35:20,319
have to be integrated in a way where it
 

8479
02:35:20,319 --> 02:35:22,150
have to be integrated in a way where it
has a twitter account

8480
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:22,160
has a twitter account
 

8481
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:25,190
has a twitter account
and it becomes aware

8482
02:35:25,190 --> 02:35:25,200
and it becomes aware
 

8483
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:27,110
and it becomes aware
of the impact it has on the other grand

8484
02:35:27,110 --> 02:35:27,120
of the impact it has on the other grand
 

8485
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:29,990
of the impact it has on the other grand
masters with the moves that's coming up

8486
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:30,000
masters with the moves that's coming up
 

8487
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,110
masters with the moves that's coming up
and

8488
02:35:31,110 --> 02:35:31,120
and
 

8489
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:32,309
and
one of the fascinating things about

8490
02:35:32,309 --> 02:35:32,319
one of the fascinating things about
 

8491
02:35:32,319 --> 02:35:34,309
one of the fascinating things about
alpha zero

8492
02:35:34,309 --> 02:35:34,319
alpha zero
 

8493
02:35:34,319 --> 02:35:36,950
alpha zero
which i just love so much

8494
02:35:36,950 --> 02:35:36,960
which i just love so much
 

8495
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:38,309
which i just love so much
is uh i don't know if you're familiar

8496
02:35:38,309 --> 02:35:38,319
is uh i don't know if you're familiar
 

8497
02:35:38,319 --> 02:35:41,830
is uh i don't know if you're familiar
with chess i am yeah okay so the

8498
02:35:41,830 --> 02:35:41,840
with chess i am yeah okay so the
 

8499
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:44,070
with chess i am yeah okay so the
it does certain things that most chess

8500
02:35:44,070 --> 02:35:44,080
it does certain things that most chess
 

8501
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:46,070
it does certain things that most chess
players even at the highest level

8502
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:46,080
players even at the highest level
 

8503
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:48,710
players even at the highest level
uh don't do which is it sacrifices

8504
02:35:48,710 --> 02:35:48,720
uh don't do which is it sacrifices
 

8505
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:51,110
uh don't do which is it sacrifices
pieces it gives pieces away and then

8506
02:35:51,110 --> 02:35:51,120
pieces it gives pieces away and then
 

8507
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:52,710
pieces it gives pieces away and then
waits like

8508
02:35:52,710 --> 02:35:52,720
waits like
 

8509
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:55,670
waits like
10 moves before it pays you back so it

8510
02:35:55,670 --> 02:35:55,680
10 moves before it pays you back so it
 

8511
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:58,870
10 moves before it pays you back so it
does to me that's beautiful that that's

8512
02:35:58,870 --> 02:35:58,880
does to me that's beautiful that that's
 

8513
02:35:58,880 --> 02:36:01,190
does to me that's beautiful that that's
crazy that's art if only alpha 0

8514
02:36:01,190 --> 02:36:01,200
crazy that's art if only alpha 0
 

8515
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:03,830
crazy that's art if only alpha 0
understood the artistry of that which is

8516
02:36:03,830 --> 02:36:03,840
understood the artistry of that which is
 

8517
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:04,710
understood the artistry of that which is
uh

8518
02:36:04,710 --> 02:36:04,720
uh
 

8519
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:05,990
uh
i'm going to mess with you

8520
02:36:05,990 --> 02:36:06,000
i'm going to mess with you
 

8521
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,550
i'm going to mess with you
psychologically because i'm going to do

8522
02:36:08,550 --> 02:36:08,560
psychologically because i'm going to do
 

8523
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:09,830
psychologically because i'm going to do
two things

8524
02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:09,840
two things
 

8525
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:11,349
two things
one make you

8526
02:36:11,349 --> 02:36:11,359
one make you
 

8527
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:13,510
one make you
feel overconfident that you're doing

8528
02:36:13,510 --> 02:36:13,520
feel overconfident that you're doing
 

8529
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:16,230
feel overconfident that you're doing
well but actually also once you realize

8530
02:36:16,230 --> 02:36:16,240
well but actually also once you realize
 

8531
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:18,150
well but actually also once you realize
you are playing alpha zero that is much

8532
02:36:18,150 --> 02:36:18,160
you are playing alpha zero that is much
 

8533
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:20,389
you are playing alpha zero that is much
better than you you're going to feel

8534
02:36:20,389 --> 02:36:20,399
better than you you're going to feel
 

8535
02:36:20,399 --> 02:36:22,630
better than you you're going to feel
really nervous about what's on the like

8536
02:36:22,630 --> 02:36:22,640
really nervous about what's on the like
 

8537
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:24,630
really nervous about what's on the like
is this is the calm before the storm and

8538
02:36:24,630 --> 02:36:24,640
is this is the calm before the storm and
 

8539
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:25,429
is this is the calm before the storm and
that's

8540
02:36:25,429 --> 02:36:25,439
that's
 

8541
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:27,990
that's
that creates a beautiful psychological

8542
02:36:27,990 --> 02:36:28,000
that creates a beautiful psychological
 

8543
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,389
that creates a beautiful psychological
masterpiece of this chess game if only

8544
02:36:30,389 --> 02:36:30,399
masterpiece of this chess game if only
 

8545
02:36:30,399 --> 02:36:31,830
masterpiece of this chess game if only
alpha zero is

8546
02:36:31,830 --> 02:36:31,840
alpha zero is
 

8547
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:32,790
alpha zero is
then

8548
02:36:32,790 --> 02:36:32,800
then
 

8549
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:34,870
then
messing with you additionally to that

8550
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:34,880
messing with you additionally to that
 

8551
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:37,190
messing with you additionally to that
like and be was cognizant of this doing

8552
02:36:37,190 --> 02:36:37,200
like and be was cognizant of this doing
 

8553
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:39,750
like and be was cognizant of this doing
that then it becomes art and then it's

8554
02:36:39,750 --> 02:36:39,760
that then it becomes art and then it's
 

8555
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:42,710
that then it becomes art and then it's
integrated into society in that way

8556
02:36:42,710 --> 02:36:42,720
integrated into society in that way
 

8557
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:44,309
integrated into society in that way
and i believe it doesn't have to

8558
02:36:44,309 --> 02:36:44,319
and i believe it doesn't have to
 

8559
02:36:44,319 --> 02:36:45,670
and i believe it doesn't have to
actually have

02:36:45,670 --> 02:36:45,680
actually have
 

8561
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:47,429
actually have
an understanding

8562
02:36:47,429 --> 02:36:47,439
an understanding
 

8563
02:36:47,439 --> 02:36:51,110
an understanding
of uh the world in the way that humans

8564
02:36:51,110 --> 02:36:51,120
of uh the world in the way that humans
 

8565
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:52,790
of uh the world in the way that humans
have it can have a different one it can

8566
02:36:52,790 --> 02:36:52,800
have it can have a different one it can
 

8567
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:55,910
have it can have a different one it can
be like a child is as clueless about so

8568
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:55,920
be like a child is as clueless about so
 

8569
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:58,389
be like a child is as clueless about so
many aspects of the world and it's okay

many aspects of the world and it's okay
 

8571
02:36:58,399 --> 02:37:00,790
many aspects of the world and it's okay
and that's part of the magic of it just

8572
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:00,800
and that's part of the magic of it just
 

8573
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:03,110
and that's part of the magic of it just
being flawed being

8574
02:37:03,110 --> 02:37:03,120
being flawed being
 

8575
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:04,710
being flawed being
lacking understanding all interesting

8576
02:37:04,710 --> 02:37:04,720
lacking understanding all interesting
 

8577
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:07,270
lacking understanding all interesting
kinds of ways but interacting and so to

8578
02:37:07,270 --> 02:37:07,280
kinds of ways but interacting and so to
 

8579
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:09,750
kinds of ways but interacting and so to
me it's it's possible to create art for

8580
02:37:09,750 --> 02:37:09,760
me it's it's possible to create art for
 

8581
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:11,349
me it's it's possible to create art for
ai but

8582
02:37:11,349 --> 02:37:11,359
ai but
 

8583
02:37:11,359 --> 02:37:13,830
ai but
exactly as you're saying in a

8584
02:37:13,830 --> 02:37:13,840
exactly as you're saying in a
 

8585
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:16,230
exactly as you're saying in a
deeply socially embedded way

8586
02:37:16,230 --> 02:37:16,240
deeply socially embedded way
 

8587
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:18,790
deeply socially embedded way
good well i think i i think we agree but

8588
02:37:18,790 --> 02:37:18,800
good well i think i i think we agree but
 

8589
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:21,030
good well i think i i think we agree but
let me just highlight the thing that

8590
02:37:21,030 --> 02:37:21,040
let me just highlight the thing that
 

8591
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:23,670
let me just highlight the thing that
makes me think that we agree yeah which

8592
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:23,680
makes me think that we agree yeah which
 

8593
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:26,710
makes me think that we agree yeah which
is that i think for people

8594
02:37:26,710 --> 02:37:26,720
is that i think for people
 

8595
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:28,309
is that i think for people
for community

8596
02:37:28,309 --> 02:37:28,319
for community
 

8597
02:37:28,319 --> 02:37:30,790
for community
to allow themselves

8598
02:37:30,790 --> 02:37:30,800
to allow themselves
 

8599
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:31,670
to allow themselves
to

8600
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:31,680
to
 

8601
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:33,750
to
recognize in

8602
02:37:33,750 --> 02:37:33,760
recognize in
 

8603
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:36,389
recognize in
a certain kind of creative act let's i'm

8604
02:37:36,389 --> 02:37:36,399
a certain kind of creative act let's i'm
 

8605
02:37:36,399 --> 02:37:38,070
a certain kind of creative act let's i'm
thinking of stravinsky here but we could

8606
02:37:38,070 --> 02:37:38,080
thinking of stravinsky here but we could
 

8607
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:40,150
thinking of stravinsky here but we could
think of a chess thing

8608
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:40,160
think of a chess thing
 

8609
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:41,750
think of a chess thing
to recognize in a certain kind of

8610
02:37:41,750 --> 02:37:41,760
to recognize in a certain kind of
 

8611
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,190
to recognize in a certain kind of
creative act

8612
02:37:43,190 --> 02:37:43,200
creative act
 

8613
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:46,870
creative act
a new and admirable worthy way of

8614
02:37:46,870 --> 02:37:46,880
a new and admirable worthy way of
 

8615
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,469
a new and admirable worthy way of
thinking about what's significant in the

8616
02:37:48,469 --> 02:37:48,479
thinking about what's significant in the
 

8617
02:37:48,479 --> 02:37:49,990
thinking about what's significant in the
situation

8618
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:50,000
situation
 

8619
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,469
situation
you have to believe

8620
02:37:52,469 --> 02:37:52,479
you have to believe
 

8621
02:37:52,479 --> 02:37:54,150
you have to believe
that it wasn't random

8622
02:37:54,150 --> 02:37:54,160
that it wasn't random
 

8623
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:57,190
that it wasn't random
you have to believe that stravinsky

8624
02:37:57,190 --> 02:37:57,200
you have to believe that stravinsky
 

8625
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:58,830
you have to believe that stravinsky
wrote that way

8626
02:37:58,830 --> 02:37:58,840
wrote that way
 

8627
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:02,389
wrote that way
because he was receptive to what needed

8628
02:38:02,389 --> 02:38:02,399
because he was receptive to what needed
 

8629
02:38:02,399 --> 02:38:04,550
because he was receptive to what needed
to be said now

8630
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:04,560
to be said now
 

8631
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:07,910
to be said now
and so you you said if only

8632
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:07,920
and so you you said if only
 

8633
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:09,510
and so you you said if only
alpha zero

8634
02:38:09,510 --> 02:38:09,520
alpha zero
 

8635
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:11,510
alpha zero
could do all this

8636
02:38:11,510 --> 02:38:11,520
could do all this
 

8637
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:14,309
could do all this
by virtue of recognizing that this was

8638
02:38:14,309 --> 02:38:14,319
by virtue of recognizing that this was
 

8639
02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:16,389
by virtue of recognizing that this was
the thing that needed to be done

8640
02:38:16,389 --> 02:38:16,399
the thing that needed to be done
 

8641
02:38:16,399 --> 02:38:18,389
the thing that needed to be done
then it would be socially embedded in

8642
02:38:18,389 --> 02:38:18,399
then it would be socially embedded in
 

8643
02:38:18,399 --> 02:38:20,950
then it would be socially embedded in
the right way and i think i agree with

8644
02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:20,960
the right way and i think i agree with
 

8645
02:38:20,960 --> 02:38:22,790
the right way and i think i agree with
that first of all

8646
02:38:22,790 --> 02:38:22,800
that first of all
 

8647
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:24,870
that first of all
it's possible to do in a constrained

8648
02:38:24,870 --> 02:38:24,880
it's possible to do in a constrained
 

8649
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:25,990
it's possible to do in a constrained
domain

8650
02:38:25,990 --> 02:38:26,000
domain
 

8651
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,950
domain
a game-playing domain go or chess

8652
02:38:28,950 --> 02:38:28,960
a game-playing domain go or chess
 

8653
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:30,870
a game-playing domain go or chess
goes more complicated than chess but but

8654
02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:30,880
goes more complicated than chess but but
 

8655
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:33,270
goes more complicated than chess but but
either one of them because there really

8656
02:38:33,270 --> 02:38:33,280
either one of them because there really
 

8657
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:35,910
either one of them because there really
are only a finite range of possibilities

8658
02:38:35,910 --> 02:38:35,920
are only a finite range of possibilities
 

8659
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:38,150
are only a finite range of possibilities
if you you know make the game end at a

8660
02:38:38,150 --> 02:38:38,160
if you you know make the game end at a
 

8661
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:39,990
if you you know make the game end at a
certain point there's

8662
02:38:39,990 --> 02:38:40,000
certain point there's
 

8663
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,270
certain point there's
there um

8664
02:38:41,270 --> 02:38:41,280
there um
 

8665
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:43,429
there um
it's a combinatorial problem in the end

8666
02:38:43,429 --> 02:38:43,439
it's a combinatorial problem in the end
 

8667
02:38:43,439 --> 02:38:45,990
it's a combinatorial problem in the end
now obviously

8668
02:38:45,990 --> 02:38:46,000
now obviously
 

8669
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,630
now obviously
alpha zero doesn't solve the problem in

8670
02:38:48,630 --> 02:38:48,640
alpha zero doesn't solve the problem in
 

8671
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:51,270
alpha zero doesn't solve the problem in
a combinatorial way that would be

8672
02:38:51,270 --> 02:38:51,280
a combinatorial way that would be
 

8673
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:53,110
a combinatorial way that would be
sort of take too much energy you

8674
02:38:53,110 --> 02:38:53,120
sort of take too much energy you
 

8675
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:55,429
sort of take too much energy you
couldn't do it it's too too

8676
02:38:55,429 --> 02:38:55,439
couldn't do it it's too too
 

8677
02:38:55,439 --> 02:38:58,309
couldn't do it it's too too
it sort of uh explodes the problem

8678
02:38:58,309 --> 02:38:58,319
it sort of uh explodes the problem
 

8679
02:38:58,319 --> 02:38:59,990
it sort of uh explodes the problem
um so it does it in this other way

8680
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:00,000
um so it does it in this other way
 

8681
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,190
um so it does it in this other way
that's interesting this pattern

8682
02:39:01,190 --> 02:39:01,200
that's interesting this pattern
 

8683
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:03,510
that's interesting this pattern
recognition way roughly

8684
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:03,520
recognition way roughly
 

8685
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:06,309
recognition way roughly
and and in that context it may well be

8686
02:39:06,309 --> 02:39:06,319
and and in that context it may well be
 

8687
02:39:06,319 --> 02:39:07,510
and and in that context it may well be
that it

8688
02:39:07,510 --> 02:39:07,520
that it
 

8689
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:09,990
that it
that it can see

8690
02:39:09,990 --> 02:39:10,000
that it can see
 

8691
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:11,990
that it can see
having had lots and lots of experience

8692
02:39:11,990 --> 02:39:12,000
having had lots and lots of experience
 

8693
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,469
having had lots and lots of experience
on in the training stuff against itself

8694
02:39:14,469 --> 02:39:14,479
on in the training stuff against itself
 

8695
02:39:14,479 --> 02:39:17,110
on in the training stuff against itself
or against another version of itself it

8696
02:39:17,110 --> 02:39:17,120
or against another version of itself it
 

8697
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:18,870
or against another version of itself it
can see that the sacrifice here is going

8698
02:39:18,870 --> 02:39:18,880
can see that the sacrifice here is going
 

8699
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:21,990
can see that the sacrifice here is going
to pay dividends down the road

8700
02:39:21,990 --> 02:39:22,000
to pay dividends down the road
 

8701
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:25,030
to pay dividends down the road
see i put that in in quotation marks

8702
02:39:25,030 --> 02:39:25,040
see i put that in in quotation marks
 

8703
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:28,309
see i put that in in quotation marks
that's to say uh it's got you know a

8704
02:39:28,309 --> 02:39:28,319
that's to say uh it's got you know a
 

8705
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:30,790
that's to say uh it's got you know a
high weight to this move here

8706
02:39:30,790 --> 02:39:30,800
high weight to this move here
 

8707
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:32,950
high weight to this move here
as a result of experience in the past

8708
02:39:32,950 --> 02:39:32,960
as a result of experience in the past
 

8709
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:34,630
as a result of experience in the past
where that move

8710
02:39:34,630 --> 02:39:34,640
where that move
 

8711
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:36,950
where that move
down the line led to this this

8712
02:39:36,950 --> 02:39:36,960
down the line led to this this
 

8713
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:38,950
down the line led to this this
improvement so

8714
02:39:38,950 --> 02:39:38,960
improvement so
 

8715
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:41,510
improvement so
so in that in that finite context i

8716
02:39:41,510 --> 02:39:41,520
so in that in that finite context i
 

8717
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:43,990
so in that in that finite context i
think you know the game players can

8718
02:39:43,990 --> 02:39:44,000
think you know the game players can
 

8719
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,550
think you know the game players can
trust it and they talk that way that

8720
02:39:46,550 --> 02:39:46,560
trust it and they talk that way that
 

8721
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:48,630
trust it and they talk that way that
it's got a kind of authority

8722
02:39:48,630 --> 02:39:48,640
it's got a kind of authority
 

8723
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:51,270
it's got a kind of authority
um they say i've read some people who

8724
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:51,280
um they say i've read some people who
 

8725
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:52,469
um they say i've read some people who
said about

8726
02:39:52,469 --> 02:39:52,479
said about
 

8727
02:39:52,479 --> 02:39:54,389
said about
alpha zero when i played go

8728
02:39:54,389 --> 02:39:54,399
alpha zero when i played go
 

8729
02:39:54,399 --> 02:39:56,710
alpha zero when i played go
uh it's like it's playing from the

8730
02:39:56,710 --> 02:39:56,720
uh it's like it's playing from the
 

8731
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:58,309
uh it's like it's playing from the
future

8732
02:39:58,309 --> 02:39:58,319
future
 

8733
02:39:58,319 --> 02:40:01,030
future
it's making these moves that are just

8734
02:40:01,030 --> 02:40:01,040
it's making these moves that are just
 

8735
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:01,990
it's making these moves that are just
out

8736
02:40:01,990 --> 02:40:02,000
out
 

8737
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:03,349
out
landish

8738
02:40:03,349 --> 02:40:03,359
landish
 

8739
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:05,990
landish
and there's a kind of brilliance to them

8740
02:40:05,990 --> 02:40:06,000
and there's a kind of brilliance to them
 

8741
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,830
and there's a kind of brilliance to them
that we can't really understand we'll be

8742
02:40:07,830 --> 02:40:07,840
that we can't really understand we'll be
 

8743
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:10,070
that we can't really understand we'll be
catching up to it forever i think in

8744
02:40:10,070 --> 02:40:10,080
catching up to it forever i think in
 

8745
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:13,429
catching up to it forever i think in
that context like it's mapped the domain

8746
02:40:13,429 --> 02:40:13,439
that context like it's mapped the domain
 

8747
02:40:13,439 --> 02:40:15,190
that context like it's mapped the domain
and the domain is mappable because it's

8748
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:15,200
and the domain is mappable because it's
 

8749
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:17,990
and the domain is mappable because it's
a combinatorial problem roughly

8750
02:40:17,990 --> 02:40:18,000
a combinatorial problem roughly
 

8751
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:22,230
a combinatorial problem roughly
but in something like music or art of a

8752
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:22,240
but in something like music or art of a
 

8753
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:23,429
but in something like music or art of a
of a

8754
02:40:23,429 --> 02:40:23,439
of a
 

8755
02:40:23,439 --> 02:40:26,309
of a
non-finite form

8756
02:40:26,309 --> 02:40:26,319
non-finite form
 

8757
02:40:26,319 --> 02:40:29,110
non-finite form
it feels to me like

8758
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:29,120
it feels to me like
 

8759
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:31,110
it feels to me like
i i it's a little harder for me to

8760
02:40:31,110 --> 02:40:31,120
i i it's a little harder for me to
 

8761
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:33,429
i i it's a little harder for me to
understand what the analog

8762
02:40:33,429 --> 02:40:33,439
understand what the analog
 

8763
02:40:33,439 --> 02:40:35,910
understand what the analog
of our trusting that stravinsky has

8764
02:40:35,910 --> 02:40:35,920
of our trusting that stravinsky has
 

8765
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:38,630
of our trusting that stravinsky has
recognized something about us

8766
02:40:38,630 --> 02:40:38,640
recognized something about us
 

8767
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:41,349
recognized something about us
that demands that he write this way that

8768
02:40:41,349 --> 02:40:41,359
that demands that he write this way that
 

8769
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:43,429
that demands that he write this way that
doesn't seem like a finite

8770
02:40:43,429 --> 02:40:43,439
doesn't seem like a finite
 

8771
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:45,590
doesn't seem like a finite
thing in quite the same way now now we

8772
02:40:45,590 --> 02:40:45,600
thing in quite the same way now now we
 

8773
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:47,910
thing in quite the same way now now we
could ask we could ask the system why

8774
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:47,920
could ask we could ask the system why
 

8775
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:50,389
could ask we could ask the system why
did you do it we could ask stravinsky

8776
02:40:50,389 --> 02:40:50,399
did you do it we could ask stravinsky
 

8777
02:40:50,399 --> 02:40:53,990
did you do it we could ask stravinsky
why did you do it and maybe it will have

8778
02:40:53,990 --> 02:40:54,000
why did you do it and maybe it will have
 

8779
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,190
why did you do it and maybe it will have
answers

8780
02:40:55,190 --> 02:40:55,200
answers
 

8781
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,790
answers
but then it's involved in a kind of

8782
02:40:56,790 --> 02:40:56,800
but then it's involved in a kind of
 

8783
02:40:56,800 --> 02:40:58,950
but then it's involved in a kind of
communicative act

8784
02:40:58,950 --> 02:40:58,960
communicative act
 

8785
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:02,150
communicative act
and i think lots of times artists will

8786
02:41:02,150 --> 02:41:02,160
and i think lots of times artists will
 

8787
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:04,790
and i think lots of times artists will
often say look i i can't communicate

8788
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:04,800
often say look i i can't communicate
 

8789
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:06,309
often say look i i can't communicate
better than what i've done in the piece

8790
02:41:06,309 --> 02:41:06,319
better than what i've done in the piece
 

8791
02:41:06,319 --> 02:41:08,550
better than what i've done in the piece
of work and that that is the statement

8792
02:41:08,550 --> 02:41:08,560
of work and that that is the statement
 

8793
02:41:08,560 --> 02:41:10,790
of work and that that is the statement
yeah yeah so the yeah we humans aren't

8794
02:41:10,790 --> 02:41:10,800
yeah yeah so the yeah we humans aren't
 

8795
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:13,190
yeah yeah so the yeah we humans aren't
able to answer the why either yeah

8796
02:41:13,190 --> 02:41:13,200
able to answer the why either yeah
 

8797
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:17,030
able to answer the why either yeah
but i do think the the question here is

8798
02:41:17,030 --> 02:41:17,040
but i do think the the question here is
 

8799
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:19,990
but i do think the the question here is
uh well first of all language is finite

8800
02:41:19,990 --> 02:41:20,000
uh well first of all language is finite
 

8801
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,630
uh well first of all language is finite
uh certainly when expressed to a tweet

8802
02:41:22,630 --> 02:41:22,640
uh certainly when expressed to a tweet
 

8803
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:25,429
uh certainly when expressed to a tweet
uh so it is also a combinatorial problem

8804
02:41:25,429 --> 02:41:25,439
uh so it is also a combinatorial problem
 

8805
02:41:25,439 --> 02:41:27,269
uh so it is also a combinatorial problem
the question is how much more difficult

8806
02:41:27,269 --> 02:41:27,279
the question is how much more difficult
 

8807
02:41:27,279 --> 02:41:29,190
the question is how much more difficult
it is than chess

8808
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:29,200
it is than chess
 

8809
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:30,950
it is than chess
and

8810
02:41:30,950 --> 02:41:30,960
and
 

8811
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:33,190
and
i think

8812
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:33,200
i think
 

8813
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:35,990
i think
i think all the same ways that we see

8814
02:41:35,990 --> 02:41:36,000
i think all the same ways that we see
 

8815
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:37,590
i think all the same ways that we see
the solutions to chess is deeply

8816
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:37,600
the solutions to chess is deeply
 

8817
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:39,429
the solutions to chess is deeply
surprising when it was first

8818
02:41:39,429 --> 02:41:39,439
surprising when it was first
 

8819
02:41:39,439 --> 02:41:43,429
surprising when it was first
addressed with ibm d blue and then with

8820
02:41:43,429 --> 02:41:43,439
addressed with ibm d blue and then with
 

8821
02:41:43,439 --> 02:41:46,550
addressed with ibm d blue and then with
alpha go and alpha go zero alpha zero

8822
02:41:46,550 --> 02:41:46,560
alpha go and alpha go zero alpha zero
 

8823
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:49,349
alpha go and alpha go zero alpha zero
i think in that same way language

8824
02:41:49,349 --> 02:41:49,359
i think in that same way language
 

8825
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:52,230
i think in that same way language
can be addressed and communication can

8826
02:41:52,230 --> 02:41:52,240
can be addressed and communication can
 

8827
02:41:52,240 --> 02:41:54,790
can be addressed and communication can
be addressed i don't see having done

8828
02:41:54,790 --> 02:41:54,800
be addressed i don't see having done
 

8829
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:56,630
be addressed i don't see having done
this podcast

8830
02:41:56,630 --> 02:41:56,640
this podcast
 

8831
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:59,590
this podcast
many reasons why everything i'm doing

8832
02:41:59,590 --> 02:41:59,600
many reasons why everything i'm doing
 

8833
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:01,349
many reasons why everything i'm doing
especially as a digital being on the

8834
02:42:01,349 --> 02:42:01,359
especially as a digital being on the
 

8835
02:42:01,359 --> 02:42:02,630
especially as a digital being on the
internet

8836
02:42:02,630 --> 02:42:02,640
internet
 

8837
02:42:02,640 --> 02:42:06,070
internet
can't be done by an ai system eventually

8838
02:42:06,070 --> 02:42:06,080
can't be done by an ai system eventually
 

8839
02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:09,590
can't be done by an ai system eventually
so like i think we're being very

8840
02:42:09,590 --> 02:42:09,600
so like i think we're being very
 

8841
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:11,349
so like i think we're being very
uh human-centric and thinking we're

8842
02:42:11,349 --> 02:42:11,359
uh human-centric and thinking we're
 

8843
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:12,950
uh human-centric and thinking we're
special i think one of the hardest

8844
02:42:12,950 --> 02:42:12,960
special i think one of the hardest
 

8845
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:16,070
special i think one of the hardest
things is the physical space

8846
02:42:16,070 --> 02:42:16,080
things is the physical space
 

8847
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:18,550
things is the physical space
actually operating like touch and the

8848
02:42:18,550 --> 02:42:18,560
actually operating like touch and the
 

8849
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:21,110
actually operating like touch and the
magic of body language and the music of

8850
02:42:21,110 --> 02:42:21,120
magic of body language and the music of
 

8851
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:23,190
magic of body language and the music of
all of that because it's so deeply

8852
02:42:23,190 --> 02:42:23,200
all of that because it's so deeply
 

8853
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:25,030
all of that because it's so deeply
integrated through the

8854
02:42:25,030 --> 02:42:25,040
integrated through the
 

8855
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:27,110
integrated through the
long evolutionary process of what it's

8856
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:27,120
long evolutionary process of what it's
 

8857
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:29,269
long evolutionary process of what it's
like to be on earth

8858
02:42:29,269 --> 02:42:29,279
like to be on earth
 

8859
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:30,389
like to be on earth
what is

8860
02:42:30,389 --> 02:42:30,399
what is
 

8861
02:42:30,399 --> 02:42:34,389
what is
fundamentally different and ai has

8862
02:42:34,389 --> 02:42:34,399
fundamentally different and ai has
 

8863
02:42:34,399 --> 02:42:37,830
fundamentally different and ai has
can catch up on is the way we apply our

8864
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:37,840
can catch up on is the way we apply our
 

8865
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:41,349
can catch up on is the way we apply our
evolutionary history on the way we act

8866
02:42:41,349 --> 02:42:41,359
evolutionary history on the way we act
 

8867
02:42:41,359 --> 02:42:43,030
evolutionary history on the way we act
on the internet and the way we act

8868
02:42:43,030 --> 02:42:43,040
on the internet and the way we act
 

8869
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:45,190
on the internet and the way we act
online and as more and more of the world

8870
02:42:45,190 --> 02:42:45,200
online and as more and more of the world
 

8871

online and as more and more of the world
becomes digital you're now operating in

8872
02:42:47,510 --> 02:42:47,520
becomes digital you're now operating in
 

8873
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:50,309
becomes digital you're now operating in
a space where ai

8874
02:42:50,309 --> 02:42:50,319
a space where ai
 

8875
02:42:50,319 --> 02:42:53,190
a space where ai
is is behind much less so

8876
02:42:53,190 --> 02:42:53,200
is is behind much less so
 

8877
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:55,910
is is behind much less so
like we're both starting at zero

8878
02:42:55,910 --> 02:42:55,920
like we're both starting at zero
 

8879
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:57,830
like we're both starting at zero
i think that's super interesting do you

8880
02:42:57,830 --> 02:42:57,840
i think that's super interesting do you
 

8881
02:42:57,840 --> 02:42:59,990
i think that's super interesting do you
do you know this do you know this author

02:42:59,990 --> 02:43:00,000
do you know this do you know this author
 

8883
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,910
do you know this do you know this author
brian christian is that someone you've

8884
02:43:01,910 --> 02:43:01,920
brian christian is that someone you've
 

8885
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:03,910
brian christian is that someone you've
ever heard of that sounds familiar he

8886
02:43:03,910 --> 02:43:03,920
ever heard of that sounds familiar he
 

8887
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:05,510
ever heard of that sounds familiar he
he's a guy

8888
02:43:05,510 --> 02:43:05,520
he's a guy
 

8889
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:07,990
he's a guy
who competed in the what is it called

8890
02:43:07,990 --> 02:43:08,000
who competed in the what is it called
 

8891
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,070
who competed in the what is it called
the loebner competition

8892
02:43:10,070 --> 02:43:10,080
the loebner competition
 

8893
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:12,150
the loebner competition
yeah the turing test thing

8894
02:43:12,150 --> 02:43:12,160
yeah the turing test thing
 

8895
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:12,950
yeah the turing test thing
so

8896
02:43:12,950 --> 02:43:12,960
so
 

8897
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:14,469
so
and i'll just tell you the story but i

8898
02:43:14,469 --> 02:43:14,479
and i'll just tell you the story but i
 

8899
02:43:14,479 --> 02:43:16,630
and i'll just tell you the story but i
think it's directly related to the last

8900
02:43:16,630 --> 02:43:16,640
think it's directly related to the last
 

8901
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:18,389
think it's directly related to the last
thing you said about where we're we're

8902
02:43:18,389 --> 02:43:18,399
thing you said about where we're we're
 

8903
02:43:18,399 --> 02:43:20,230
thing you said about where we're we're
starting in the same place

8904
02:43:20,230 --> 02:43:20,240
starting in the same place
 

8905
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:22,630
starting in the same place
uh he competed

8906
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:22,640
uh he competed
 

8907
02:43:22,640 --> 02:43:24,870
uh he competed
in this in this competition but not he

8908
02:43:24,870 --> 02:43:24,880
in this in this competition but not he
 

8909
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:27,349
in this in this competition but not he
didn't enter uh a program that was

8910
02:43:27,349 --> 02:43:27,359
didn't enter uh a program that was
 

8911
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:29,429
didn't enter uh a program that was
supposed to try to uh pass the turing

8912
02:43:29,429 --> 02:43:29,439
supposed to try to uh pass the turing
 

8913
02:43:29,439 --> 02:43:30,550
supposed to try to uh pass the turing
test

8914
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:30,560
test
 

8915
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:32,070
test
the turing test you know there's three

8916
02:43:32,070 --> 02:43:32,080
the turing test you know there's three
 

8917
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:33,510
the turing test you know there's three
people there's the judge there's the

8918
02:43:33,510 --> 02:43:33,520
people there's the judge there's the
 

8919
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:35,910
people there's the judge there's the
program and then there's there's a

8920
02:43:35,910 --> 02:43:35,920
program and then there's there's a
 

8921
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:38,230
program and then there's there's a
someone who's a human the way they do it

8922
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:38,240
someone who's a human the way they do it
 

8923
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:39,990
someone who's a human the way they do it
and the judge has got to figure out by

8924
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:40,000
and the judge has got to figure out by
 

8925
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,750
and the judge has got to figure out by
asking questions which is the computer

8926
02:43:41,750 --> 02:43:41,760
asking questions which is the computer
 

8927
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:44,230
asking questions which is the computer
and which is the human so little known

8928
02:43:44,230 --> 02:43:44,240
and which is the human so little known
 

8929
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:46,150
and which is the human so little known
fact there's two prizes in that

8930
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:46,160
fact there's two prizes in that
 

8931
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:48,230
fact there's two prizes in that
competition there's the most human

8932
02:43:48,230 --> 02:43:48,240
competition there's the most human
 

8933
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:49,670
competition there's the most human
computer prize

8934
02:43:49,670 --> 02:43:49,680
computer prize
 

8935
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:51,670
computer prize
that's the computer that wins the most

8936
02:43:51,670 --> 02:43:51,680
that's the computer that wins the most
 

8937
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:53,590
that's the computer that wins the most
and then there's the most human human

8938
02:43:53,590 --> 02:43:53,600
and then there's the most human human
 

8939
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:54,630
and then there's the most human human
rights

8940
02:43:54,630 --> 02:43:54,640
rights
 

8941
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:56,710
rights
and he competed for the most human human

8942
02:43:56,710 --> 02:43:56,720
and he competed for the most human human
 

8943
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:57,670
and he competed for the most human human
props

8944
02:43:57,670 --> 02:43:57,680
props
 

8945
02:43:57,680 --> 02:43:59,990
props
and he wanted he kept one winning it and

8946
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:00,000
and he wanted he kept one winning it and
 

8947
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,870
and he wanted he kept one winning it and
and so he he tried to think about

8948
02:44:02,870 --> 02:44:02,880
and so he he tried to think about
 

8949
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:05,269
and so he he tried to think about
what it is that um

8950
02:44:05,269 --> 02:44:05,279
what it is that um
 

8951
02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:07,750
what it is that um
you have to be able to do in order to

8952
02:44:07,750 --> 02:44:07,760
you have to be able to do in order to
 

8953
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:09,349
you have to be able to do in order to
convince judges that you're human

8954
02:44:09,349 --> 02:44:09,359
convince judges that you're human
 

8955
02:44:09,359 --> 02:44:10,790
convince judges that you're human
instead of a computer

8956
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:10,800
instead of a computer
 

8957
02:44:10,800 --> 02:44:12,870
instead of a computer
and that's an interesting question i

8958
02:44:12,870 --> 02:44:12,880
and that's an interesting question i
 

8959
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:13,670
and that's an interesting question i
think

8960
02:44:13,670 --> 02:44:13,680
think
 

8961
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:17,349
think
um and when he came to this my takeaway

8962
02:44:17,349 --> 02:44:17,359
um and when he came to this my takeaway
 

8963
02:44:17,359 --> 02:44:19,590
um and when he came to this my takeaway
from his version of this story

8964
02:44:19,590 --> 02:44:19,600
from his version of this story
 

8965
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:22,070
from his version of this story
is that it is true

8966
02:44:22,070 --> 02:44:22,080
is that it is true
 

8967
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:24,550
is that it is true
that computers are winning these

8968
02:44:24,550 --> 02:44:24,560
that computers are winning these
 

8969
02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:27,110
that computers are winning these
contests more and more

8970
02:44:27,110 --> 02:44:27,120
contests more and more
 

8971
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:29,750
contests more and more
you know as technology progresses but

8972
02:44:29,750 --> 02:44:29,760
you know as technology progresses but
 

8973
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:31,429
you know as technology progresses but
there's two possible explanations for

8974
02:44:31,429 --> 02:44:31,439
there's two possible explanations for
 

8975
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:32,469
there's two possible explanations for
that

8976
02:44:32,469 --> 02:44:32,479
that
 

8977
02:44:32,479 --> 02:44:34,070
that
one is that the computers are becoming

8978
02:44:34,070 --> 02:44:34,080
one is that the computers are becoming
 

8979
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:36,469
one is that the computers are becoming
more human

8980
02:44:36,469 --> 02:44:36,479
more human
 

8981
02:44:36,479 --> 02:44:38,150
more human
and the other is that the humans are

8982
02:44:38,150 --> 02:44:38,160
and the other is that the humans are
 

8983
02:44:38,160 --> 02:44:41,269
and the other is that the humans are
becoming more like computers

8984
02:44:41,269 --> 02:44:41,279
becoming more like computers
 

8985
02:44:41,279 --> 02:44:43,429
becoming more like computers
and he says actually

8986
02:44:43,429 --> 02:44:43,439
and he says actually
 

8987
02:44:43,439 --> 02:44:44,710
and he says actually
the more

8988
02:44:44,710 --> 02:44:44,720
the more
 

8989
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:48,070
the more
we live our lives in this world where in

8990
02:44:48,070 --> 02:44:48,080
we live our lives in this world where in
 

8991
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:50,469
we live our lives in this world where in
this sort of technological world

8992
02:44:50,469 --> 02:44:50,479
this sort of technological world
 

8993
02:44:50,479 --> 02:44:51,590
this sort of technological world
where

8994
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:51,600
where
 

8995
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:55,190
where
we have to moderate our behavior so that

8996
02:44:55,190 --> 02:44:55,200
we have to moderate our behavior so that
 

8997
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:56,630
we have to moderate our behavior so that
it's readable

8998
02:44:56,630 --> 02:44:56,640
it's readable
 

8999
02:44:56,640 --> 02:44:57,510
it's readable
by

9000
02:44:57,510 --> 02:44:57,520
by
 

9001
02:44:57,520 --> 02:45:00,550
by
something that's effectively you know a

9002
02:45:00,550 --> 02:45:00,560
something that's effectively you know a
 

9003
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:01,910
something that's effectively you know a
computer

9004
02:45:01,910 --> 02:45:01,920
computer
 

9005
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:05,030
computer
the more we become like that and he says

9006
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:05,040
the more we become like that and he says
 

9007
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:07,110
the more we become like that and he says
it happens even when you're

9008
02:45:07,110 --> 02:45:07,120
it happens even when you're
 

9009
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:09,269
it happens even when you're
uh not interacting with a computer he

9010
02:45:09,269 --> 02:45:09,279
uh not interacting with a computer he
 

9011
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:11,030
uh not interacting with a computer he
says have you ever been to the you know

9012
02:45:11,030 --> 02:45:11,040
says have you ever been to the you know
 

9013
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:12,790
says have you ever been to the you know
on the phone with the call

9014
02:45:12,790 --> 02:45:12,800
on the phone with the call
 

9015
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:14,469
on the phone with the call
you know center

9016
02:45:14,469 --> 02:45:14,479
you know center
 

9017
02:45:14,479 --> 02:45:16,230
you know center
and they're going through their script

9018
02:45:16,230 --> 02:45:16,240
and they're going through their script
 

9019
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:17,830
and they're going through their script
and that's what they've got to do

9020
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:17,840
and that's what they've got to do
 

9021
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:19,510
and that's what they've got to do
they've got to go through their script

9022
02:45:19,510 --> 02:45:19,520
they've got to go through their script
 

9023
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:21,429
they've got to go through their script
because that's how they keep their job

9024
02:45:21,429 --> 02:45:21,439
because that's how they keep their job
 

9025
02:45:21,439 --> 02:45:22,870
because that's how they keep their job
and they ask you this question you've

9026
02:45:22,870 --> 02:45:22,880
and they ask you this question you've
 

9027
02:45:22,880 --> 02:45:24,070
and they ask you this question you've
got to answer it

9028
02:45:24,070 --> 02:45:24,080
got to answer it
 

9029
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:26,070
got to answer it
and it and it's as if you're no longer

9030
02:45:26,070 --> 02:45:26,080
and it and it's as if you're no longer
 

9031
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:27,349
and it and it's as if you're no longer
interacting with a person even though

9032
02:45:27,349 --> 02:45:27,359
interacting with a person even though
 

9033
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:28,950
interacting with a person even though
it's a person

9034
02:45:28,950 --> 02:45:28,960
it's a person
 

9035
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:31,269
it's a person
because they've so given up everything

9036
02:45:31,269 --> 02:45:31,279
because they've so given up everything
 

9037
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:33,670
because they've so given up everything
that's involved normally with being able

9038
02:45:33,670 --> 02:45:33,680
that's involved normally with being able
 

9039
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:34,389
that's involved normally with being able
to

9040
02:45:34,389 --> 02:45:34,399
to
 

9041
02:45:34,399 --> 02:45:36,389
to
make judgments and decisions and act in

9042
02:45:36,389 --> 02:45:36,399
make judgments and decisions and act in
 

9043
02:45:36,399 --> 02:45:38,790
make judgments and decisions and act in
situations and take responsibility and

9044
02:45:38,790 --> 02:45:38,800
situations and take responsibility and
 

9045
02:45:38,800 --> 02:45:41,670
situations and take responsibility and
so i think that's that's the other side

9046
02:45:41,670 --> 02:45:41,680
so i think that's that's the other side
 

9047
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:45,510
so i think that's that's the other side
of it it it it is true that technology

9048
02:45:45,510 --> 02:45:45,520
of it it it it is true that technology
 

9049
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:48,790
of it it it it is true that technology
is amazing and can solve huge ranges of

9050
02:45:48,790 --> 02:45:48,800
is amazing and can solve huge ranges of
 

9051
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:49,830
is amazing and can solve huge ranges of
problems

9052
02:45:49,830 --> 02:45:49,840
problems
 

9053
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:52,710
problems
and and do fantastic things but it's

9054
02:45:52,710 --> 02:45:52,720
and and do fantastic things but it's
 

9055
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:54,150
and and do fantastic things but it's
also true

9056
02:45:54,150 --> 02:45:54,160
also true
 

9057
02:45:54,160 --> 02:45:56,070
also true
that we're changing ourselves in

9058
02:45:56,070 --> 02:45:56,080
that we're changing ourselves in
 

9059
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:58,630
that we're changing ourselves in
response to it and the one thing i'm

9060
02:45:58,630 --> 02:45:58,640
response to it and the one thing i'm
 

9061
02:45:58,640 --> 02:46:00,710
response to it and the one thing i'm
worried about is that we're changing

9062
02:46:00,710 --> 02:46:00,720
worried about is that we're changing
 

9063
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:04,230
worried about is that we're changing
ourselves in such a way that the

9064
02:46:04,230 --> 02:46:04,240
ourselves in such a way that the
 

9065
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:06,790
ourselves in such a way that the
norms for what we're aiming at are being

9066
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:06,800
norms for what we're aiming at are being
 

9067
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:08,389
norms for what we're aiming at are being
changed

9068
02:46:08,389 --> 02:46:08,399
changed
 

9069
02:46:08,399 --> 02:46:10,630
changed
to move in the direction of this sort of

9070
02:46:10,630 --> 02:46:10,640
to move in the direction of this sort of
 

9071
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:12,870
to move in the direction of this sort of
efficiently and up in an optimized way

9072
02:46:12,870 --> 02:46:12,880
efficiently and up in an optimized way
 

9073
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:14,389
efficiently and up in an optimized way
solving a problem

9074
02:46:14,389 --> 02:46:14,399
solving a problem
 

9075
02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:16,550
solving a problem
and move away from this other kind of

9076
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:16,560
and move away from this other kind of
 

9077
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:18,950
and move away from this other kind of
thing that we were calling alive and

9078
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:18,960
thing that we were calling alive and
 

9079
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:21,510
thing that we were calling alive and
aliveness or or significance

9080
02:46:21,510 --> 02:46:21,520
aliveness or or significance
 

9081
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:23,990
aliveness or or significance
and and so that's the that's the other

9082
02:46:23,990 --> 02:46:24,000
and and so that's the that's the other
 

9083
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,750
and and so that's the that's the other
side of the story and that's the worry

9084
02:46:25,750 --> 02:46:25,760
side of the story and that's the worry
 

9085
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:28,790
side of the story and that's the worry
but it's very possible that there is uh

9086
02:46:28,790 --> 02:46:28,800
but it's very possible that there is uh
 

9087
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:31,510
but it's very possible that there is uh
for you and i the ancient dinosaurs we

9088
02:46:31,510 --> 02:46:31,520
for you and i the ancient dinosaurs we
 

9089
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:33,910
for you and i the ancient dinosaurs we
may not see the aliveness

9090
02:46:33,910 --> 02:46:33,920
may not see the aliveness
 

9091
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:35,670
may not see the aliveness
in tiktok

9092
02:46:35,670 --> 02:46:35,680
in tiktok
 

9093
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:38,630
in tiktok
the aliveness in the digital space

9094
02:46:38,630 --> 02:46:38,640
the aliveness in the digital space
 

9095
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:41,190
the aliveness in the digital space
that you see it as us being dragged into

9096
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:41,200
that you see it as us being dragged into
 

9097
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:43,590
that you see it as us being dragged into
this over optimized world

9098
02:46:43,590 --> 02:46:43,600
this over optimized world
 

9099
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:45,269
this over optimized world
but that may be

9100
02:46:45,269 --> 02:46:45,279
but that may be
 

9101
02:46:45,279 --> 02:46:47,110
but that may be
uh this is

9102
02:46:47,110 --> 02:46:47,120
uh this is
 

9103
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:48,550
uh this is
in fact

9104
02:46:48,550 --> 02:46:48,560
in fact
 

9105
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:50,469
in fact
it is a world that opens up

9106
02:46:50,469 --> 02:46:50,479
it is a world that opens up
 

9107
02:46:50,479 --> 02:46:54,710
it is a world that opens up
opportunities to truly experience life

9108
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:54,720
opportunities to truly experience life
 

9109
02:46:54,720 --> 02:46:56,790
opportunities to truly experience life
and there's interesting to think about

9110
02:46:56,790 --> 02:46:56,800
and there's interesting to think about
 

9111
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:58,870
and there's interesting to think about
all the people growing up now

9112
02:46:58,870 --> 02:46:58,880
all the people growing up now
 

9113
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:01,030
all the people growing up now
who their early

9114
02:47:01,030 --> 02:47:01,040
who their early
 

9115
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:03,750
who their early
experience of life is always mediated

9116
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:03,760
experience of life is always mediated
 

9117
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:05,910
experience of life is always mediated
through a digital device not always but

9118
02:47:05,910 --> 02:47:05,920
through a digital device not always but
 

9119
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:07,429
through a digital device not always but
more and more often mediated through

9120
02:47:07,429 --> 02:47:07,439
more and more often mediated through
 

9121
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:10,630
more and more often mediated through
that device and how we're both evolving

9122
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:10,640
that device and how we're both evolving
 

9123
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:12,230
that device and how we're both evolving
the technology is evolving and the

9124
02:47:12,230 --> 02:47:12,240
the technology is evolving and the
 

9125
02:47:12,240 --> 02:47:14,710
the technology is evolving and the
humans are evolving to them maybe open a

9126
02:47:14,710 --> 02:47:14,720
humans are evolving to them maybe open a
 

9127
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:17,190
humans are evolving to them maybe open a
door to a whole world where the humans

9128
02:47:17,190 --> 02:47:17,200
door to a whole world where the humans
 

9129
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:20,469
door to a whole world where the humans
and the technology or ai systems are

9130
02:47:20,469 --> 02:47:20,479
and the technology or ai systems are
 

9131
02:47:20,479 --> 02:47:22,630
and the technology or ai systems are
interacting as equals

9132
02:47:22,630 --> 02:47:22,640
interacting as equals
 

9133
02:47:22,640 --> 02:47:24,070
interacting as equals
so now i'm going to agree with you you

9134
02:47:24,070 --> 02:47:24,080
so now i'm going to agree with you you
 

9135
02:47:24,080 --> 02:47:25,590
so now i'm going to agree with you you
might be surprised that i'm going to

9136
02:47:25,590 --> 02:47:25,600
might be surprised that i'm going to
 

9137
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:27,429
might be surprised that i'm going to
agree with you but i think that's

9138
02:47:27,429 --> 02:47:27,439
agree with you but i think that's
 

9139
02:47:27,439 --> 02:47:29,349
agree with you but i think that's
exactly right i i don't want to be the

9140
02:47:29,349 --> 02:47:29,359
exactly right i i don't want to be the
 

9141
02:47:29,359 --> 02:47:33,110
exactly right i i don't want to be the
person who's saying our job is to resist

9142
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:33,120
person who's saying our job is to resist
 

9143
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:34,950
person who's saying our job is to resist
all of this stuff that i don't want to

9144
02:47:34,950 --> 02:47:34,960

the point is to get in the right

9158
02:47:48,070 --> 02:47:48,080
the point is to get in the right
 

9159
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:50,309
the point is to get in the right
relation to that understanding of what

02:47:50,309 --> 02:47:50,319
relation to that understanding of what
 

9161
02:47:50,319 --> 02:47:51,429
relation to that understanding of what
we are

9165
02:47:54,319 --> 02:47:56,389
uh that allows us to find the joy in it
and that's i think that's a hard thing

9166
02:47:56,389 --> 02:47:56,399
and that's i think that's a hard thing
 

9167
02:47:56,399 --> 02:47:57,910
and that's i think that's a hard thing
to do it's hard to understand even what

9168
02:47:57,910 --> 02:47:57,920
to do it's hard to understand even what
 

9169
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:00,070
to do it's hard to understand even what
we're supposed to be doing when we do it

02:48:00,070 --> 02:48:00,080
we're supposed to be doing when we do it

push people to get in the relation to it

02:50:29,830 --> 02:50:29,840
existence
 

9305
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:34,150
existence
and also the real significance of it

9306
02:50:34,150 --> 02:50:34,160
and also the real significance of it
 

9307
02:50:34,160 --> 02:50:36,710
and also the real significance of it
and that sounds like it that sounds like

9308
02:50:36,710 --> 02:50:36,720
and that sounds like it that sounds like
 

9309
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:38,870
and that sounds like it that sounds like
a contradiction like how could it really

9310
02:50:38,870 --> 02:50:38,880
a contradiction like how could it really
 

9311
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:40,550
a contradiction like how could it really
be significant and not be based on

9312
02:50:40,550 --> 02:50:40,560
be significant and not be based on
 

9313
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:41,990
be significant and not be based on
anything

9314
02:50:41,990 --> 02:50:42,000
anything
 

9315
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:43,429
anything
but i think that's the contradiction

9316
02:50:43,429 --> 02:50:43,439
but i think that's the contradiction
 

9317
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:45,910
but i think that's the contradiction
that somehow characterizes us and i

9318
02:50:45,910 --> 02:50:45,920
that somehow characterizes us and i
 

9319
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:46,950
that somehow characterizes us and i
think that

9320
02:50:46,950 --> 02:50:46,960
think that
 

9321
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:49,190
think that
we're the being that sort of has to hold

9322
02:50:49,190 --> 02:50:49,200
we're the being that sort of has to hold
 

9323

we're the being that sort of has to hold

that weird mystery before us and live
in the light of it that's the thing that

9327
02:50:56,399 --> 02:50:59,670
in the light of it that's the thing that
i think is really at our core and so how

9328
02:50:59,670 --> 02:50:59,680
i think is really at our core and so how
 

9329
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:03,030
i think is really at our core and so how
do we do that i will say this one thing

9330
02:51:03,030 --> 02:51:03,040
do we do that i will say this one thing
 

9331

do we do that i will say this one thing
