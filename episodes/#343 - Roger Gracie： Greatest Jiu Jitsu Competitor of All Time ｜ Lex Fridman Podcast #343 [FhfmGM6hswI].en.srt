205
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,990
example of it it's
you know there's a lot of times in the

save as much energy as I can so I can
 

253
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,790

fully you know be focused 100 in the

and that's instinctual like uh

258
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:03,500
and that's instinctual like uh
 

259
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,870
and that's instinctual like uh
minimizing the amount of moves you're

260

not like
 

263
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,170

explicitly thinking should I do this or
 

265
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,230
explicitly thinking should I do this or

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
it's not like you have to move the
 

317
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,050
it's not like you have to move the
spirit of life it's it's the move itself

318
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,060
spirit of life it's it's the move itself
 

319
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,969
spirit of life it's it's the move itself
at that precise moment it doesn't have

320
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:13,979
at that precise moment it doesn't have
 

321
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,850
at that precise moment it doesn't have
to be super fast because your opponent's

322
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:16,860
to be super fast because your opponent's
 

323
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,350
to be super fast because your opponent's
not moving so perfect you know so it's

324
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:18,360
not moving so perfect you know so it's
 

325
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,749
not moving so perfect you know so it's
it's a combination of moving between you

326
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:20,759
it's a combination of moving between you
 

327
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,570
it's a combination of moving between you
and him I mean the same thing happens in

328
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:23,580
and him I mean the same thing happens in
 

329
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,189
and him I mean the same thing happens in
in Judo and the movement can be really

330
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
in Judo and the movement can be really
 

331
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,670
in Judo and the movement can be really
small yeah it's just Jude is a is a bit

332
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:28,680
small yeah it's just Jude is a is a bit
 

333
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,710
small yeah it's just Jude is a is a bit
more explosiveness you know she's the

334
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
more explosiveness you know she's the
 

335
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,350
more explosiveness you know she's the
moves are slightly faster so it did no

336
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
moves are slightly faster so it did no
 

337
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,270
moves are slightly faster so it did no
it does require a bit more explosiveness

338
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
it does require a bit more explosiveness
 

339
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,629
it does require a bit more explosiveness
in Judo but even just the right timing

340
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
in Judo but even just the right timing
 

341
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,730
in Judo but even just the right timing
for an off balance yeah

342
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:40,740
for an off balance yeah
 

343
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,890
for an off balance yeah
it's still a little tough yeah yeah it's

344
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:42,900
it's still a little tough yeah yeah it's
 

345
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,930
it's still a little tough yeah yeah it's
not that they're you know moving the

not that they're you know moving the
speed is not going to count that much

348
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:46,500
speed is not going to count that much
 

349
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,890
speed is not going to count that much
yeah it's the timing that you initiate

350
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:48,900
yeah it's the timing that you initiate
 

351
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,809
yeah it's the timing that you initiate
that move you see that with foot sweeps

is that one Split Second
 

385
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,089
is that one Split Second
that's it do you get that in Jiu Jitsu

386
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:29,099
that's it do you get that in Jiu Jitsu
 

387
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,249
that's it do you get that in Jiu Jitsu
at all because Judo has

388
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:31,259
at all because Judo has
 

389
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,290
at all because Judo has
because of the explosiveness because of

390
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,300
because of the explosiveness because of
 

391
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,270
because of the explosiveness because of
the point scoring system that

392
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
the point scoring system that
 

393
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,330
the point scoring system that
incentivizes these giant throws

394
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,340
incentivizes these giant throws
 

395
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,129
incentivizes these giant throws
um has these moments where everything

396
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:40,139
um has these moments where everything
 

397
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,930
um has these moments where everything
just turns on a single moment do you

398
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:41,940
just turns on a single moment do you
 

399
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,370
just turns on a single moment do you
have that in Jiu Jitsu too not really

400
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:43,380
have that in Jiu Jitsu too not really
 

401
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,070
have that in Jiu Jitsu too not really
because Dennis points is you get like

402
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
because Dennis points is you get like
 

403
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,710
because Dennis points is you get like
you know two points so he's

404
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
you know two points so he's
 

405
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,350
you know two points so he's
because I think regarding the submission

406
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
because I think regarding the submission
 

407
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,589
because I think regarding the submission
it's not just one precise movement that

408
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:54,599
it's not just one precise movement that
 

409
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,770
it's not just one precise movement that
changed everything I think Judo is the

410
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:57,780
changed everything I think Judo is the
 

411
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,749
changed everything I think Judo is the
takedown that counts as a submission

412
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
takedown that counts as a submission
 

413
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,089
takedown that counts as a submission
like keep on fight over Jujitsu don't

414
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:02,099
like keep on fight over Jujitsu don't
 

415
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,110
like keep on fight over Jujitsu don't
have that

416
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
have that
 

417
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,930
have that
so you will you will score points but I

418
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:05,940
so you will you will score points but I
 

419
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,510
so you will you will score points but I
think in terms of submission you need to

420
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:08,520
think in terms of submission you need to
 

421
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,050
think in terms of submission you need to
get to uh in a dominant position first

422
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,060
get to uh in a dominant position first
 

423
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,809
get to uh in a dominant position first
and then the submission will come slowly

424
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:14,819
and then the submission will come slowly
 

425
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,850
and then the submission will come slowly
it's a process yeah

426
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:16,860
it's a process yeah
 

427
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,309
it's a process yeah
okay let's go back to that guy with his

428
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:19,319
okay let's go back to that guy with his

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,170
okay let's go back to that guy with his
mind so actually in the weeks leading up

430

get confidence is through data
like that you have proven yourself

474
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:15,899
like that you have proven yourself
 

475
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,389

effective
 

477
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,850
effective
uh in previous situations but with

478
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:19,860
uh in previous situations but with
 

479
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,410
uh in previous situations but with
buchacha

480
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:21,420
buchacha
 

481
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,990
buchacha
you don't you don't have much data it

482
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
you don't you don't have much data it
 

483
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,610
you don't you don't have much data it
was a very the first time you faced them

484
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:25,620
was a very the first time you faced them
 

485
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,050
was a very the first time you faced them
was a very tough

486
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,060
was a very tough
 

487
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,490
was a very tough
that was also one of the greatest

488
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:28,500
that was also one of the greatest
 

489
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,610
that was also one of the greatest
matches of all time it was very tough so

490
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:31,620
matches of all time it was very tough so
 

491
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,590
matches of all time it was very tough so
doesn't that creep in like that doubt

492
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
doesn't that creep in like that doubt
 

493
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,490
doesn't that creep in like that doubt
because you know you don't have enough

494
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,500
because you know you don't have enough
 

495
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,790
because you know you don't have enough
data to be confident based on

496
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:37,800
data to be confident based on
 

497
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,170
data to be confident based on
uh

498
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,180
uh
 

499
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,530
uh
yeah I mean

500
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:42,540

because it's it's like being
 

633
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,050
because it's it's like being
really tired it's the same thing it's

634
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,060
really tired it's the same thing it's
 

635
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,850
really tired it's the same thing it's
like a lot of people crack because they

636
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:13,860
like a lot of people crack because they
 

637
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,650
like a lot of people crack because they
just feel they cannot give in more

638
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:15,660
just feel they cannot give in more
 

639
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,750
just feel they cannot give in more
there's not having nothing more to give

640
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
there's not having nothing more to give
 

641
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,930
there's not having nothing more to give
so they just like give up it's too hard

go to sleep your resistant drops so this

686
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,360
go to sleep your resistant drops so this
 

687
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,629
go to sleep your resistant drops so this
everybody has a has a limit of

688
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
everybody has a has a limit of
 

689
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,910
everybody has a has a limit of
resistance until they you know to resist

690
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:22,920
resistance until they you know to resist
 

691
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,730
resistance until they you know to resist
a choke before you pass out the moment

692
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:25,740
a choke before you pass out the moment
 

693
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,970
a choke before you pass out the moment
that you you you go to sleep that

694
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:28,980
that you you you go to sleep that
 

695
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,370
that you you you go to sleep that
resistance will dropped that's why I've

696
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:31,380
resistance will dropped that's why I've
 

697
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,690
resistance will dropped that's why I've
never heard anyone say yeah that's

698
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:32,700
never heard anyone say yeah that's
 

699
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,790
never heard anyone say yeah that's
awesome so that's true so tap this so

700
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
awesome so that's true so tap this so
 

701
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,170
awesome so that's true so tap this so
that's the reason because people usually

702
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:36,180
that's the reason because people usually
 

703
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,569
that's the reason because people usually
say it's no you can somebody is the same

704
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:38,579
say it's no you can somebody is the same
 

705
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:39,889
say it's no you can somebody is the same
or you're getting knocked out you get

706
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:39,899
or you're getting knocked out you get
 

707
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,449
or you're getting knocked out you get
knocked out the first time your

708
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:41,459
knocked out the first time your
 

709
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,670
knocked out the first time your
resistant dropped your drug weak gets

710
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
resistant dropped your drug weak gets
 

711
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,949
resistant dropped your drug weak gets
weaker so just for the record I've never

712
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:45,959
weaker so just for the record I've never
 

713
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,650
weaker so just for the record I've never
gone to sleep again

714
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:47,660
gone to sleep again
 

715
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,210
gone to sleep again
which uh means my resistance is high

716
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:50,220
which uh means my resistance is high
 

717
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,190
which uh means my resistance is high
right I don't know it must be oh your

718
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,200
right I don't know it must be oh your
 

719
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,769
right I don't know it must be oh your
defense is pretty good I I don't know

720
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:54,779
defense is pretty good I I don't know
 

721
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,410
defense is pretty good I I don't know
about that no no I would

722
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:57,420
about that no no I would
 

723
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,090
about that no no I would
um because it doesn't make sense to me

724
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,100
um because it doesn't make sense to me
 

725
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,710
um because it doesn't make sense to me
or maybe

726
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
or maybe
 

727
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,710
or maybe
in my case I think my understanding of

728
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:03,720
in my case I think my understanding of
 

729
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,710
in my case I think my understanding of
when I'm screwed is pretty good yeah

730
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
when I'm screwed is pretty good yeah
 

731
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,750
when I'm screwed is pretty good yeah
like there's no you're not in trouble

732
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:08,760
like there's no you're not in trouble
 

733
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,870
like there's no you're not in trouble
yeah one of the things I regret the most

734
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:11,880
yeah one of the things I regret the most
 

735
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,170
yeah one of the things I regret the most
about my Jiu Jitsu journey is not having

736
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:15,180
about my Jiu Jitsu journey is not having
 

737
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,110
about my Jiu Jitsu journey is not having
given enough time to um

738
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,120
given enough time to um
 

739
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,050
given enough time to um
being in really bad positions like the

740
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,060
being in really bad positions like the
 

741
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,569
being in really bad positions like the
better I got I think the less I started

742
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:23,579
better I got I think the less I started
 

743
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,769
better I got I think the less I started
being in bad positions

744
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:26,779

 

745
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,210

that's like the that is how you train

746
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,220
that's like the that is how you train
 

747
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,810
that's like the that is how you train
yeah because you should just Spa When

748
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:32,820
yeah because you should just Spa When
 

749
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,389
yeah because you should just Spa When
You Spa like it's difficult to to be in

750
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:35,399
You Spa like it's difficult to to be in
 

751
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,090
You Spa like it's difficult to to be in
bad positions a lot and you train with

752
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,100
bad positions a lot and you train with
 

753
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,189
bad positions a lot and you train with
better people but I mean let's say five

754
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:40,199
better people but I mean let's say five
 

755
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,470
better people but I mean let's say five
six minute rolls how long you're going

756
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
six minute rolls how long you're going
 

757
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,090
six minute rolls how long you're going
to be in a really bad position not long

758
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,100
to be in a really bad position not long
 

759
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,590
to be in a really bad position not long
right so you don't really have time to

760
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
right so you don't really have time to
 

761
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,730
right so you don't really have time to
develop

762
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:46,740
develop
 

763
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,790
develop
that's why people they don't

764
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:49,800
that's why people they don't
 

765
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,829
that's why people they don't
you know they don't train be in bad

766
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
you know they don't train be in bad
 

767
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,810
you know they don't train be in bad
positions because you have to stop there

768
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:53,820
positions because you have to stop there
 

769
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,090
positions because you have to stop there
over and over again

770
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,100
over and over again
 

771
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,310
over and over again
to be used to it yeah or put yourself

772
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
to be used to it yeah or put yourself
 

773
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,230
to be used to it yeah or put yourself
there I just didn't have that mindset I

774
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
there I just didn't have that mindset I
 

775
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,629
there I just didn't have that mindset I
think I think you start I mean part of

776
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
think I think you start I mean part of
 

777
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,310
think I think you start I mean part of
the fun of jiu jitsu's as you get better

778
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
the fun of jiu jitsu's as you get better
 

779
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,050
the fun of jiu jitsu's as you get better
and better you have certain people you

780
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,060
and better you have certain people you
 

781
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,670
and better you have certain people you
go with you have these puzzles that

782
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
go with you have these puzzles that
 

783
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,930
go with you have these puzzles that
you've figured out that you're playing

784
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:08,940
you've figured out that you're playing
 

785
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,870
you've figured out that you're playing
very specific details you're working out

786
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:11,880

train
 

897
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,669
train
a lot bad position like my defense is

898
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:34,679
a lot bad position like my defense is
 

899
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,430

00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:34,679
and over again so that when I if I get
 

949
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,770
and over again so that when I if I get
there in a fighting situation I will

950
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:36,780
there in a fighting situation I will
 

951
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,510
there in a fighting situation I will
know how to get out at least I'll have a

952
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:38,520
know how to get out at least I'll have a
 

953
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,970
know how to get out at least I'll have a
direction you know I would know this is

954
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:40,980
direction you know I would know this is
 

955
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,409
direction you know I would know this is
my way up

956
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:42,419
my way up
 

957
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,169
my way up
do you practice both escaping the bad

958
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:45,179
do you practice both escaping the bad
 

959
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,010
do you practice both escaping the bad
position and the transition

960
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:49,020
position and the transition
 

961
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,130
position and the transition
into the bad position avoiding it

962
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,140
into the bad position avoiding it
 

963
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,630
into the bad position avoiding it
because that's how it happens you know

964
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:53,640
because that's how it happens you know
 

965
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,029
because that's how it happens you know
Jiu Jitsu you start in a neutral

966
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:56,039
Jiu Jitsu you start in a neutral
 

967
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,169
Jiu Jitsu you start in a neutral
position

968
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:57,179
position
 

969
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,270
position
now the transition then it then becomes

970
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
now the transition then it then becomes
 

971
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,730
now the transition then it then becomes
the fight itself you see it's being

972
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:01,740
the fight itself you see it's being
 

973
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,529
the fight itself you see it's being
there is the most important is when

974
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:03,539
there is the most important is when
 

975
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:04,549
there is the most important is when
you're there

976
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
you're there
 

977
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,890
you're there
then you have to know how to get out

978
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:06,900
then you have to know how to get out
 

979
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,549
then you have to know how to get out
that's your weakness how I either

980
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:09,559
that's your weakness how I either
 

981
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,390
that's your weakness how I either
stopping the person getting that

982
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:11,400
stopping the person getting that
 

983
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,590
stopping the person getting that
something different they're two

984
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:12,600
something different they're two
 

985
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,049
something different they're two
different things it's you you either you

986
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:15,059
different things it's you you either you
 

987
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,730
different things it's you you either you
practice one or the other

988
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:16,740
practice one or the other
 

989
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,190
practice one or the other
so but both are important I guess but

990
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
so but both are important I guess but
 

991
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,350
so but both are important I guess but
the the stopping the person is easier to

992
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
the the stopping the person is easier to
 

993
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,850
the the stopping the person is easier to
practice because that comes naturally in

994
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:22,860
practice because that comes naturally in
 

995
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,430
practice because that comes naturally in
training yeah what was uh the actual

996
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
training yeah what was uh the actual
 

997
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,990
training yeah what was uh the actual
process like what was your biggest

998
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,000
process like what was your biggest
 

999
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,590
process like what was your biggest
weakness throughout your like you just

1000
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
weakness throughout your like you just
 

1001
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,150
weakness throughout your like you just
remembering what was annoying to you to

1002
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
remembering what was annoying to you to
 

1003
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,730
remembering what was annoying to you to
figure out uh I mean outside control is

1004
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:34,740
figure out uh I mean outside control is
 

1005
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,010
figure out uh I mean outside control is
always is the bottom of second bottom

1006
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,020
always is the bottom of second bottom
 

1007
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,930
always is the bottom of second bottom
it's regardless how much you you

1008
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:38,940
it's regardless how much you you
 

1009
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,390
it's regardless how much you you
practice it's not that very easy you'll

1010
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,400
practice it's not that very easy you'll
 

1011
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,650
practice it's not that very easy you'll
never be easy

1012
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:42,660
never be easy
 

1013
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,470
never be easy
but it's so annoying it makes no sense

1014
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:45,480
but it's so annoying it makes no sense
 

1015
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,570
but it's so annoying it makes no sense

1021
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,690
guy regardless of who is not going to be
to escape so some situations are just

1022
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:53,700
to escape so some situations are just
 

1023
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,090
to escape so some situations are just
hard it must be the sorry to interrupt

1024
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,100
hard it must be the sorry to interrupt
 

1025
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,110
hard it must be the sorry to interrupt
I'm interrupting hydrogracies but

Jiu Jitsu competitor
 

1035
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,630
Jiu Jitsu competitor
probably side control might be one of

1036
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:11,640
probably side control might be one of
 

1037
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,490
probably side control might be one of
the hardest positions is that the

1038
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:13,500
the hardest positions is that the
 

1039
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,230
the hardest positions is that the
hardest position to escape is one of

1040
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,240
hardest position to escape is one of
 

1041
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,669
hardest position to escape is one of
them if the person doesn't want to

1042
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:16,679
them if the person doesn't want to
 

1043
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,370
them if the person doesn't want to
progress It's concerned about it yeah

1044
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:19,380
progress It's concerned about it yeah
 

1045
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,650
progress It's concerned about it yeah
like the best pinners in the world I

1046
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:21,660
like the best pinners in the world I
 

1047
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,330
like the best pinners in the world I
mean partially because I've Just Seen

1048
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:23,340
mean partially because I've Just Seen
 

1049
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,490
mean partially because I've Just Seen
Judo people that know how to pin yeah

1050
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:25,500
Judo people that know how to pin yeah
 

1051
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,250
Judo people that know how to pin yeah
they scrape this I control is a

1052
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:28,260
they scrape this I control is a
 

1053
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,409
they scrape this I control is a
nightmare it's a nightmare doesn't

1054
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:30,419
nightmare it's a nightmare doesn't
 

1055
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,049
nightmare it's a nightmare doesn't
matter how much you practice yeah it's a

1056
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:33,059
matter how much you practice yeah it's a
 

1057
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,010
matter how much you practice yeah it's a
nightmare

1058
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:34,020
nightmare
 

1059
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,490
nightmare
and it's also just frustrating uh I

1060
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:37,500
and it's also just frustrating uh I
 

1061
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,110
and it's also just frustrating uh I
think I guess it is also frustrating

1062
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
think I guess it is also frustrating
 

1063
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,549
think I guess it is also frustrating
because a lot of people in that position

1064
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
because a lot of people in that position
 

1065
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,950
because a lot of people in that position
will be about maintaining control not

1066
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:42,960
will be about maintaining control not
 

1067
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,590
will be about maintaining control not
progressing yeah and usually people in

1068
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
progressing yeah and usually people in
 

1069
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,690
progressing yeah and usually people in
their mouth and back control are usually

1070
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:47,700
their mouth and back control are usually
 

1071
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,090
their mouth and back control are usually
trying to progress towards a submission

1072
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,100
trying to progress towards a submission
 

1073
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,330
trying to progress towards a submission
which opens up opportunities for escape

1074
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:53,340
which opens up opportunities for escape
 

1075
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,610
which opens up opportunities for escape
so what's the actual process

1076
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:55,620
so what's the actual process
 

1077
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,169
so what's the actual process
of

1078
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:57,179
of
 

1079
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,970
of
just time and time again putting

1080
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:58,980
just time and time again putting
 

1081
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,770
just time and time again putting
yourself inside a bottom side control

1082
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:00,780
yourself inside a bottom side control
 

1083
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,350
yourself inside a bottom side control
yeah over and over again starting that

1084
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
yeah over and over again starting that
 

1085
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,350
yeah over and over again starting that
escape back Escape get back

1086
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,360
escape back Escape get back
 

1087
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,230
escape back Escape get back
if you mount you get back any situation

1088
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,240
if you mount you get back any situation
 

1089
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,150
if you mount you get back any situation
outside that stop start again stop start

1090
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,160
outside that stop start again stop start
 

1091
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,930
outside that stop start again stop start
again

1092
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:11,940
again
 

1093
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,990
again
and it has to be I'll say five minutes

1094
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,000
and it has to be I'll say five minutes
 

1095
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,210
and it has to be I'll say five minutes
because it's the repetition that will

1096
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,220
because it's the repetition that will
 

1097
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,770
because it's the repetition that will
teach you you know if you train like

1098
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:18,780
teach you you know if you train like
 

1099
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,210
teach you you know if you train like
three minutes on top

1100
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:20,220
three minutes on top
 

1101
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,909
three minutes on top
you have time to you know one thing and

1102
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:22,919
you have time to you know one thing and
 

1103
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,370
you have time to you know one thing and
then time up is the right position there

1104
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:25,380
then time up is the right position there
 

1105
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,110
then time up is the right position there
over and over again you know when you

1106
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
over and over again you know when you
 

1107
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,970
over and over again you know when you
try to say move over and over again then

1108
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:28,980
try to say move over and over again then
 

1109
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,850
try to say move over and over again then
you see what can go wrong

1110
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:31,860
you see what can go wrong
 

1111
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,890
you see what can go wrong
and is that understanding the details of

1112
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:33,900
and is that understanding the details of
 

1113
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,330
and is that understanding the details of
the movement are actually doing the

1114
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:35,340
the movement are actually doing the
 

1115
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,029
the movement are actually doing the
movement and feeling it it's it's both

1116
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:38,039
movement and feeling it it's it's both
 

1117
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,230
movement and feeling it it's it's both
first you have to understand the

1118
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,240
first you have to understand the
 

1119
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,890
first you have to understand the
movement and then practice

1120
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:41,900
movement and then practice
 

1121
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,169
movement and then practice
but

1122
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:44,179
but
 

1123
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,210
but
most important thing is defense

1124
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:47,220
most important thing is defense
 

1125
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,669
most important thing is defense
Escape coming second

1126
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
Escape coming second
 

1127
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,950

because if you know he's attacking you
 

1129
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,750
because if you know he's attacking you
the one thing is if he's not trying to

the one thing is if he's not trying to
 

1131

let's say if a person is very good has a
very good attack

1136
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
very good attack
 

1137
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,250
very good attack
the first thing is defense

1138
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:01,260
the first thing is defense
 

1139
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,710
the first thing is defense
not just Cape you can expose yourself to

1140
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:03,720
not just Cape you can expose yourself to
 

1141
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,590
not just Cape you can expose yourself to
a even worse position because that is is

1142
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:06,600
a even worse position because that is is
 

1143
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,930
a even worse position because that is is
very risky when you're trying to escape

you'll always expose yourself to a worse
 

1147
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,990
you'll always expose yourself to a worse
position

1148
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
position
 

1149
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,570

1393
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,149
always comfortable being borrowed top I
prefer to be on top because

1394
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
prefer to be on top because
 

1395
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,250
prefer to be on top because
being in the bottom the personal topic

1396
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:19,260
being in the bottom the personal topic
 

1397
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,870
being in the bottom the personal topic
takes the pace of the fight because he's

1398
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880

on top over you so I always prefer to be

1400
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:23,700
on top over you so I always prefer to be
 

1401
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,669
on top over you so I always prefer to be
on top because I can dictate the pace I

1402
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
on top because I can dictate the pace I
 

1403
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,590
on top because I can dictate the pace I
can Implement my own pace

1404
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:27,600
can Implement my own pace
 

1405
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,690
can Implement my own pace
and being the bottom they can Slow Me

1406
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:29,700
and being the bottom they can Slow Me
 

1407
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,590
and being the bottom they can Slow Me
Down

1408
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:30,600
Down
 

1409
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,610
Down
so it's harder so if I can choose I will

1410
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:34,620
so it's harder so if I can choose I will
 

1411
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,930
so it's harder so if I can choose I will
always be on top

1412

always be on top
 

1413
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,289
always be on top
but I think by then I was like it's

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:39,299
but I think by then I was like it's
 

1415
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,510
but I think by then I was like it's
you know five minutes hit it I'm like

his Hispanic

1738
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:18,780
his Hispanic
 

1739
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,030
his Hispanic
because

1740
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,040
because
 

1741
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,430
because
he did a move that he completely opened

1742
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:22,440
he did a move that he completely opened
 

1743
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,310
he did a move that he completely opened
himself up like I'm holding his left arm

1744
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:25,320
himself up like I'm holding his left arm
 

1745
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,710
himself up like I'm holding his left arm
so by holding the arm

1746
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:27,720
so by holding the arm
 

1747
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,290
so by holding the arm
his that prevents him from defending the

1748
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:30,300
his that prevents him from defending the
 

1749
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,329
his that prevents him from defending the
hook on that side because his arm is

1750
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:32,339
hook on that side because his arm is
 

1751
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,790
hook on that side because his arm is
being hauled across so their arm cannot

1752
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:34,800
being hauled across so their arm cannot
 

1753
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,369
being hauled across so their arm cannot
block the hook and

1754
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:37,379
block the hook and
 

1755
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,070

over yeah because I'm already under his
 

2097
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,530
over yeah because I'm already under his
like the first hand got under the chin

2098
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:15,540
like the first hand got under the chin

2102
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:19,619
level yeah of course otherwise he turns
 

2103
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,650
level yeah of course otherwise he turns
and he's out that's the control of the

2104
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:21,660
and he's out that's the control of the
 

2105
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,089
and he's out that's the control of the
Turning versus the tightening of the

2106
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:23,099
Turning versus the tightening of the
 

2107
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:26,270
Turning versus the tightening of the
choke yeah he does both it helps tighten

2108

2121
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,650
I just felt it's getting tighter tighter
tighter tighter because he wasn't super

tighter tighter because he wasn't super
 

2123
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,329
tighter tighter because he wasn't super
tight from the beginning he wasn't like

2124
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:50,339
tight from the beginning he wasn't like
 

2125
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:53,270
tight from the beginning he wasn't like
the perfect joke so we're still I mean I

2126
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
the perfect joke so we're still I mean I
 

2127
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,530
the perfect joke so we're still I mean I
knew it was like it's very close to the

2128
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:54,540
knew it was like it's very close to the
 

2129
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,510
knew it was like it's very close to the
end but you know he was I still need the

2130
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:56,520
end but you know he was I still need the
 

2131
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,190
end but you know he was I still need the
just that was still the risk of maybe

2132
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:58,200
just that was still the risk of maybe
 

2133
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,290
just that was still the risk of maybe
escaping is it possible for his head to

2134
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:00,300
escaping is it possible for his head to
 

2135
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,650
escaping is it possible for his head to
slip up yeah is it possible yes but I'm

somebody on Reddit ask ask him about the
Cross grip he used to sweep followed

2152
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:23,579
Cross grip he used to sweep followed
 

2153
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,849
Cross grip he used to sweep followed
with the genius grips which when

2154
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:25,859
with the genius grips which when
 

2155
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:27,470
with the genius grips which when
buchesha was inverted did you use a

2156
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:27,480
buchesha was inverted did you use a
 

2157
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,450
buchesha was inverted did you use a
cross curve when you sweep did you I

2158
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:29,460
cross curve when you sweep did you I
 

2159

2187
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,349
that knee between so it's a must that's
when I start developing the attack you

what I'm doing but I think you've said
that you wanted to

3026
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:17,160
that you wanted to
 

3027

that you wanted to
and maybe you thought you could be the

3028
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:19,319
and maybe you thought you could be the
 

3029
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:21,349
and maybe you thought you could be the
greatest of all time

3030
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:21,359
greatest of all time
 

3031
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,589
greatest of all time
like at the very beginning like when you

3032
00:59:24,589 --> 00:59:24,599
like at the very beginning like when you
 

3033
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:25,809
like at the very beginning like when you
sucked yeah

yeah not not the greatest of all time

3036
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
yeah not not the greatest of all time
 

3037
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:29,750
yeah not not the greatest of all time
because

3038
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:29,760
because
 

3039
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,670
because
and I never really thought about that

3040
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
and I never really thought about that
 

3041
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,770
and I never really thought about that
but I thought I'm gonna be the best in

3042
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:33,780
but I thought I'm gonna be the best in
 

3043
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,470
but I thought I'm gonna be the best in
the world when I saw it when I saw okay

3044
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:36,480
the world when I saw it when I saw okay
 

3045
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,230
the world when I saw it when I saw okay
so what is that uh

3046
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:39,240
so what is that uh
 

3047
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,770
so what is that uh
what is that like that's self-belief is

3048
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:42,780
what is that like that's self-belief is
 

3049
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,630
what is that like that's self-belief is
there a component to that self-belief

3050
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:44,640
there a component to that self-belief
 

3051
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,390
there a component to that self-belief
being a prerequisite it's difficult to

3052
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:47,400
being a prerequisite it's difficult to
 

3053
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,270
being a prerequisite it's difficult to
say because that was a decision I think

3054
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:50,280
say because that was a decision I think
 

3055
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,589
say because that was a decision I think
like why did I believe that could be I I

3056
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:54,599

00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,970
can't tell you that because I don't know
but you think you decided I decided to I

3060
00:59:58,970 --> 00:59:58,980
but you think you decided I decided to I
 

3061

01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:13,620
something that you learned first day
 

3587
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:14,990
something that you learned first day
first week

3588
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,000
first week
 

3589
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,090
first week
so I can't teach you it makes no

3590
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:17,100
so I can't teach you it makes no
 

3591
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:17,930
so I can't teach you it makes no
difference

3592
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:17,940
difference
 

3593
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:21,590
difference
you you know the theory but until you've

3594
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,600
you you know the theory but until you've
 

3595
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,209
you you know the theory but until you've
applied it and you help you of course

3596
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:23,219
applied it and you help you of course
 

3597
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,950
applied it and you help you of course
the more details you learn you know the

3598
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:24,960
the more details you learn you know the
 

3599
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,470
the more details you learn you know the
the more tools you have to practice but

3600
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:27,480
the more tools you have to practice but
 

3601
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,890
the more tools you have to practice but
it's still very complex because it's not

3602
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:30,900
it's still very complex because it's not
 

3603
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,750
it's still very complex because it's not
about the move itself it's about how can

3604
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:32,760
about the move itself it's about how can
 

3605
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,090
about the move itself it's about how can
you control the movement of the other

3606
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:35,100
you control the movement of the other
 

3607
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,169
you control the movement of the other
person

3608
01:10:36,169 --> 01:10:36,179
person
 

3609
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:38,330
person
he's resisting you're blocking you

3610
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:38,340
he's resisting you're blocking you
 

3611
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,770
he's resisting you're blocking you
cannot predict what he would do and he's

3612
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:39,780
cannot predict what he would do and he's
 

3613
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,750
cannot predict what he would do and he's
doing a whole bunch of moves to to block

3614
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:41,760
doing a whole bunch of moves to to block
 

3615
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,209
doing a whole bunch of moves to to block
you every single move you do a step of

3616
01:10:44,209 --> 01:10:44,219
you every single move you do a step of
 

3617
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:47,390
you every single move you do a step of
the way because it's a is is a

3618
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:47,400
the way because it's a is is a
 

3619
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,310
the way because it's a is is a
progression of move from beginning to

3620
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:49,320
progression of move from beginning to
 

3621
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,830
progression of move from beginning to
end till I apply the joke it's a

3622
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840
end till I apply the joke it's a
 

3623
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,649
end till I apply the joke it's a
progression of moving there's not one

3624
01:10:54,649 --> 01:10:54,659
progression of moving there's not one
 

3625
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:56,090
progression of moving there's not one
way to get that there's many ways

3626
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:56,100
way to get that there's many ways
 

3627
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,370
way to get that there's many ways
because how many ways can you blocked

3628
01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:58,380
because how many ways can you blocked
 

3629
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,410
because how many ways can you blocked
you can put your arm in every single

3630
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:00,420
you can put your arm in every single
 

3631
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,030
you can put your arm in every single
angle we have both arms you can Bridge

3632
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:02,040
angle we have both arms you can Bridge
 

3633
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,910
angle we have both arms you can Bridge
so it's dealing with all that that is

3634
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:04,920
so it's dealing with all that that is
 

3635
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:08,270
so it's dealing with all that that is
the yeah that is the complex complexity

3636
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:08,280
the yeah that is the complex complexity
 

3637
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,729
the yeah that is the complex complexity
of the position but that goes for

3638
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:10,739
of the position but that goes for
 

3639
01:11:10,739 --> 01:11:13,970
of the position but that goes for
everything like every single move

3640
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:13,980
everything like every single move
 

3641
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,729
everything like every single move
my strong moves I would say it took me

3642
01:11:16,729 --> 01:11:16,739
my strong moves I would say it took me
 

3643
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:21,050
my strong moves I would say it took me
years developing them years so it's and

3644
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:21,060
years developing them years so it's and
 

3645
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,850
years developing them years so it's and
you're going to tell me that's basic so

3646
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:22,860
you're going to tell me that's basic so
 

3647
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,890
you're going to tell me that's basic so
go try and do it what the other person

3648
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:24,900
go try and do it what the other person
 

3649
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,750
go try and do it what the other person
is defending that's the thing because

3650
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:26,760
is defending that's the thing because
 

3651
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,390
is defending that's the thing because
most of the things that I do

3652
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:29,400
most of the things that I do
 

3653
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,910
most of the things that I do
have been doing them for years and I

3654
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:31,920
have been doing them for years and I
 

3655
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,669
have been doing them for years and I
they know that I'm gonna do and I can

3656
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:34,679
they know that I'm gonna do and I can
 

3657
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:35,510
they know that I'm gonna do and I can
still

3658
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520
still
 

3659
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,370
still
get it most the times

3660
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:37,380
get it most the times
 

3661
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,070
get it most the times
that's the hardest is when they know

3662
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:40,080
that's the hardest is when they know
 

3663
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,050
that's the hardest is when they know
what's coming and you can still do it

3664
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:42,060
what's coming and you can still do it
 

3665
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,530
what's coming and you can still do it
and he said that the way you're able to

3666
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:45,540
and he said that the way you're able to
 

3667
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,810
and he said that the way you're able to
do that you just have to do it right

3668
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:47,820
do that you just have to do it right
 

3669
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,610
do that you just have to do it right
yeah

3670
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:49,620
yeah
 

3671
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,250
yeah
what do you learn by doing

3672
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:52,260
what do you learn by doing
 

3673
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,770
what do you learn by doing
all the steps along the way and just for

3674
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:54,780
all the steps along the way and just for
 

3675
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,510
all the steps along the way and just for
people who don't know cross-color choke

3676
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:56,520
people who don't know cross-color choke
 

3677
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,490
people who don't know cross-color choke
from the mount

3678
01:11:58,490 --> 01:11:58,500
from the mount
 

3679
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,890
from the mount
so Jiu Jitsu starts in a neutral place

3680
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:00,900
so Jiu Jitsu starts in a neutral place
 

3681
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,390
so Jiu Jitsu starts in a neutral place
there's people on their feet and then

3682
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:02,400
there's people on their feet and then
 

3683
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,550
there's people on their feet and then
you either then you get to the ground

3684
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:04,560
you either then you get to the ground
 

3685
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,350
you either then you get to the ground
somehow and then there's the person on

3686
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:06,360
somehow and then there's the person on
 

3687
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,330
somehow and then there's the person on
top and on bottom and then there's a

3688
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:08,340
top and on bottom and then there's a
 

3689
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:09,890
top and on bottom and then there's a
guard with the legs between the two

3690
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:09,900
guard with the legs between the two
 

3691
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,330
guard with the legs between the two
people and then you can get past the

3692
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:11,340
people and then you can get past the
 

3693
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,330
people and then you can get past the
guard as you get past the guard and you

3694
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:14,340
guard as you get past the guard and you
 

3695
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,209
guard as you get past the guard and you
uh into side control and so on you get

3696
01:12:17,209 --> 01:12:17,219
uh into side control and so on you get
 

3697
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:18,830
uh into side control and so on you get
more and more and more dominant

3698
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:18,840
more and more and more dominant
 

3699
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,530
more and more and more dominant
positions and so Mount is considered to

3700
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:21,540
positions and so Mount is considered to
 

3701
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,910
positions and so Mount is considered to
be one of the most dominant positions

3702
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:22,920
be one of the most dominant positions
 

3703
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,590
be one of the most dominant positions
it's when you're

3704
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:24,600
it's when you're
 

3705
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,870
it's when you're
past their legs sitting on top of their

3706
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:26,880
past their legs sitting on top of their
 

3707
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,390
past their legs sitting on top of their
stomach

3708
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,400
stomach
 

3709
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,890
stomach
putting pressure on them and cross

3710
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:30,900
putting pressure on them and cross
 

3711
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,770
putting pressure on them and cross
collar choke is using their jacket to uh

3712
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:33,780
collar choke is using their jacket to uh
 

3713
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:37,310
collar choke is using their jacket to uh
how would you explain that to children I

3714
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:37,320
how would you explain that to children I
 

3715
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,169
how would you explain that to children I
put my both hands on your collars and

3716
01:12:39,169 --> 01:12:39,179
put my both hands on your collars and
 

3717
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:43,310
put my both hands on your collars and
when I squeeze you you press your neck

3718
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:43,320
when I squeeze you you press your neck
 

3719
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,110
when I squeeze you you press your neck
so it blocks the venue you go to sleep

3720
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
so it blocks the venue you go to sleep
 

3721
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,209
so it blocks the venue you go to sleep
so it's a you you choke people with your

3722
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:47,219
so it's a you you choke people with your
 

3723
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:49,010
so it's a you you choke people with your
hands in the wrist you put them you know

3724
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:49,020
hands in the wrist you put them you know
 

3725
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,810
hands in the wrist you put them you know
you grab the collar so you get the

3726
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:50,820
you grab the collar so you get the
 

3727
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,729
you grab the collar so you get the
wrists around people's neck can you

3728
01:12:52,729 --> 01:12:52,739
wrists around people's neck can you
 

3729
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:54,950
wrists around people's neck can you
squeeze yeah the discovery of that is

3730
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:54,960
squeeze yeah the discovery of that is
 

3731
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,390
squeeze yeah the discovery of that is
fascinating I mean because it's it's

3732
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
fascinating I mean because it's it's
 

3733
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,090
fascinating I mean because it's it's
interesting it's like um

3734
01:12:59,090 --> 01:12:59,100
interesting it's like um
 

3735
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,709
interesting it's like um
you know you can imagine there's all

3736
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:00,719
you know you can imagine there's all
 

3737
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,209
you know you can imagine there's all
kinds of ways to choke

3738
01:13:02,209 --> 01:13:02,219
kinds of ways to choke
 

3739
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:03,890
kinds of ways to choke
a human being

3740
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:03,900
a human being
 

3741
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,770
a human being
what animals do with their like mouth

3742
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:06,780
what animals do with their like mouth
 

3743
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,689
what animals do with their like mouth
right they put like their jaws around

3744
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:08,699
right they put like their jaws around
 

3745
01:13:08,699 --> 01:13:10,070
right they put like their jaws around
the

3746
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,080
the
 

3747
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,390
the
and the fact that you can kind of

3748
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:11,400
and the fact that you can kind of
 

3749
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,550
and the fact that you can kind of
discover this methodology of the right

3750
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:13,560
discover this methodology of the right
 

3751
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,050
discover this methodology of the right
kind of positioning and then it becomes

3752
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:15,060
kind of positioning and then it becomes
 

3753
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,970
kind of positioning and then it becomes
an art form like

3754
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:16,980
an art form like
 

3755
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,750
an art form like
of why this why not this right or why

3756
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:20,760
of why this why not this right or why
 

3757
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,149
of why this why not this right or why
not this or something like to figure out

3758
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:23,159
not this or something like to figure out
 

3759
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:25,790
not this or something like to figure out
we practice that would come easy over

3760
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:25,800
we practice that would come easy over
 

3761
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,770
we practice that would come easy over
time you figure out what works and what

3762
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:27,780
time you figure out what works and what
 

3763
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,010
time you figure out what works and what
not on you and then and then more

3764
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:30,020
not on you and then and then more
 

3765
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,970
not on you and then and then more
further and further details and

3766
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:31,980
further and further details and
 

3767
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:35,149
further and further details and
subtleties start to emerge anyway on

3768
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:35,159
subtleties start to emerge anyway on
 

3769
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:37,550
subtleties start to emerge anyway on
that process of beating of being able to

3770
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:37,560
that process of beating of being able to
 

3771
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,930
that process of beating of being able to
beat some of the best people in the

3772
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:38,940
beat some of the best people in the
 

3773
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:41,390
beat some of the best people in the
world and the thing they know is coming

3774
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:41,400
world and the thing they know is coming
 

3775
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,910
world and the thing they know is coming
what is what's the difference between

3776
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:43,920
what is what's the difference between
 

3777
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,070
what is what's the difference between
the white belt doing that and hydrogracy

3778
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:46,080
the white belt doing that and hydrogracy
 

3779
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,689
the white belt doing that and hydrogracy
doing that the thing that's so hard to

3780
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:47,699
doing that the thing that's so hard to
 

3781
01:13:47,699 --> 01:13:49,669
doing that the thing that's so hard to
explain what do you think you're picking

3782
01:13:49,669 --> 01:13:49,679
explain what do you think you're picking
 

3783
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,550
explain what do you think you're picking
up is it some tiny tiny details of

3784
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
up is it some tiny tiny details of
 

3785
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,729
up is it some tiny tiny details of
muscle movements it is it's many tiny

3786
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:55,739
muscle movements it is it's many tiny
 

3787
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,470
muscle movements it is it's many tiny
details because

3788
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:57,480
details because
 

3789
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,410
details because
is is the whole movement itself is the

3790
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:00,420
is is the whole movement itself is the
 

3791
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,669
is is the whole movement itself is the
perception

3792
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:01,679
perception
 

3793
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,610
perception
from beginning to end like every step of

3794
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:04,620
from beginning to end like every step of
 

3795
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,770
from beginning to end like every step of
the movement it's important and precise

3796
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:06,780
the movement it's important and precise
 

3797
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,590
the movement it's important and precise
so it's you know you miss once one

3798
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:09,600
so it's you know you miss once one
 

3799
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,870
so it's you know you miss once one
detail on the way you collapse

3800
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:11,880
detail on the way you collapse
 

3801
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,310
detail on the way you collapse
so I'm going to start with the black

3802
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:13,320
so I'm going to start with the black
 

3803
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,470
so I'm going to start with the black
belt the black belt has no control over

3804
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:15,480
belt the black belt has no control over
 

3805
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,149
belt the black belt has no control over
their whole movement he's thinking

3806
01:14:17,149 --> 01:14:17,159
their whole movement he's thinking
 

3807
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:19,370
their whole movement he's thinking
beginning and then

3808
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:19,380
beginning and then
 

3809
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,530
beginning and then
so he goes straight to you know straight

3810
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:21,540
so he goes straight to you know straight
 

3811
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,330
so he goes straight to you know straight
to your neck regardless he cannot read

3812
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:23,340
to your neck regardless he cannot read
 

3813
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:26,930
to your neck regardless he cannot read
the other person if his you know if it's

3814
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:26,940
the other person if his you know if it's
 

3815
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,729
the other person if his you know if it's
time to let go of the time to go for a

3816
01:14:28,729 --> 01:14:28,739
time to let go of the time to go for a
 

3817
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:30,950
time to let go of the time to go for a
neck should I be pushing here before I

3818
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
neck should I be pushing here before I
 

3819
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,530
neck should I be pushing here before I
get my hand in you know is is this the

3820
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:33,540
get my hand in you know is is this the
 

3821
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,510
get my hand in you know is is this the
right time to go deep or should I deal

3822
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:35,520
right time to go deep or should I deal
 

3823
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,189
right time to go deep or should I deal
with this first before the second hand

3824
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:37,199
with this first before the second hand
 

3825
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,689
with this first before the second hand
that's at the beginning says that that

3826
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:38,699
that's at the beginning says that that
 

3827
01:14:38,699 --> 01:14:40,370
that's at the beginning says that that
the white belt yeah at the very

3828
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:40,380
the white belt yeah at the very
 

3829
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,470
the white belt yeah at the very
beginning of the journey yeah the white

3830
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
beginning of the journey yeah the white
 

3831
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,810
beginning of the journey yeah the white
Bell to just think finish yeah

3832
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:46,820

 

3833
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,550

and then as you get progressed you see

3834
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:49,560
and then as you get progressed you see
 

3835
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,430
and then as you get progressed you see
that there's like this giant tree of

3836
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:52,440
that there's like this giant tree of
 

3837
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,010
that there's like this giant tree of
possibilities that you're almost feeling

3838
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:55,020
possibilities that you're almost feeling
 

3839
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,229
possibilities that you're almost feeling
your way down I mean would you be able

3840
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:57,239
your way down I mean would you be able
 

3841
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,830
your way down I mean would you be able
to teach

3842
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840

 

3843
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,270

do you even know what you're doing

3844
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:02,280
do you even know what you're doing
 

3845
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,610
do you even know what you're doing
by the details okay

3846
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:04,620
by the details okay
 

3847
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,229
by the details okay
but it's hard to convert into words

3848
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:06,239
but it's hard to convert into words
 

3849
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:09,830
but it's hard to convert into words
probably uh no it's possible then you

3850
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,840
probably uh no it's possible then you
 

3851
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,149
probably uh no it's possible then you
don't know what you're doing okay uh

3852
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:14,159

 

3853
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,189

so what is what what is the most

3854
01:15:16,189 --> 01:15:16,199
so what is what what is the most
 

3855
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:19,310
so what is what what is the most
important details

3856
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:19,320
important details
 

3857
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,770
important details
they could say maybe positioning of the

3858
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:21,780
they could say maybe positioning of the
 

3859
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,290
they could say maybe positioning of the
hand the gripping is it the positioning

3860
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:24,300
hand the gripping is it the positioning
 

3861
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,270
hand the gripping is it the positioning
of your body the posture is there some

3862
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:26,280
of your body the posture is there some
 

3863
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,790
of your body the posture is there some
interesting like insights It's a

3864
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:28,800
interesting like insights It's a
 

3865
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,470
interesting like insights It's a
combination because first you have to

3866
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:30,480
combination because first you have to
 

3867
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,330
combination because first you have to
put your body in a very strong position

3868
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:32,340
put your body in a very strong position
 

3869
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,250
put your body in a very strong position
that you don't require your hands to

3870
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:34,260
that you don't require your hands to
 

3871
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:35,810
that you don't require your hands to
hold them out

3872
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:35,820
hold them out
 

3873
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,490
hold them out
so the choke is that that's first

3874
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:37,500
so the choke is that that's first
 

3875
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,750
so the choke is that that's first
because

3876
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:38,760
because
 

3877
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,030
because
I cannot use I cannot use my hands on

3878
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,040
I cannot use I cannot use my hands on
 

3879
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,729
I cannot use I cannot use my hands on
the floor to stop you escaping yeah so

3880
01:15:43,729 --> 01:15:43,739
the floor to stop you escaping yeah so
 

3881
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,189
the floor to stop you escaping yeah so
if I had to my body has to handle that

3882
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:46,199
if I had to my body has to handle that
 

3883
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:49,250
if I had to my body has to handle that
the way I position myself I have to do

3884
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:49,260
the way I position myself I have to do
 

3885
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,350
the way I position myself I have to do
it in a way that don't require my hands

3886
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
it in a way that don't require my hands
 

3887
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,229
it in a way that don't require my hands
for balance okay why is the model such a

3888
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:54,239
for balance okay why is the model such a
 

3889
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,910
for balance okay why is the model such a
dominant position it doesn't make any

3890
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:55,920
dominant position it doesn't make any
 

3891
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,770
dominant position it doesn't make any
sense right like you're just sitting on

3892
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:57,780
sense right like you're just sitting on
 

3893
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,450
sense right like you're just sitting on
top of the stomach of a person it makes

3894
01:15:59,450 --> 01:15:59,460
top of the stomach of a person it makes
 

3895
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,090
top of the stomach of a person it makes
all sense if you think what's forget

3896
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:02,100
all sense if you think what's forget
 

3897
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,010
all sense if you think what's forget
forget fighting forget Jiu Jitsu like

3898

um
 

4239
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,350
um
it seems like a more difficult

4240
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:33,360
it seems like a more difficult
 

4241
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,270
it seems like a more difficult
skill to learn

4242
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:35,280
skill to learn
 

4243
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,669
skill to learn
to apply a huge amount of pressure and

4244
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:37,679
to apply a huge amount of pressure and
 

4245
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,950
to apply a huge amount of pressure and
weight from Mount you don't have some

4246

weight from Mount you don't have some
 

4247
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,870
weight from Mount you don't have some
slight pressure and weight from mouth or

4248
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:41,880
slight pressure and weight from mouth or
 

4249
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,350
slight pressure and weight from mouth or
not apply pressure but be heavy right

01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,149
interesting details along the way that
are tough to get to figure out

4324
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:08,159
are tough to get to figure out
 

4325

moment they put your hand in the
person's collar now you have to be very

4346
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:31,679
person's collar now you have to be very

01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,790
careful the distribution of the weight
yeah and how you you know how high you

4352
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:37,800
yeah and how you you know how high you
 

4353
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,130
yeah and how you you know how high you
sit you know how tall you you your upper

4355
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,310
sit you know how tall you you your upper
body goes and then the biggest challenge

4356
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:43,320
body goes and then the biggest challenge
 

4357
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,649
body goes and then the biggest challenge
comes as you try the second hand that's

focused on that second hand
 

4399
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:38,209
focused on that second hand
it's a big challenge it's hard very hard

4400
01:25:38,209 --> 01:25:38,219
it's a big challenge it's hard very hard
 

4401
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:40,790
it's a big challenge it's hard very hard
is there an art to getting the first

4402
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:40,800
is there an art to getting the first
 

4403
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,270
is there an art to getting the first
hand into a place where you it's less of

4404
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:44,280
hand into a place where you it's less of
 

4405
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,790
hand into a place where you it's less of
an art because it's easier I'll say most

4406
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
an art because it's easier I'll say most
 

4407
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,030
an art because it's easier I'll say most
times I get my first hand in is when you

4408
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:50,040
times I get my first hand in is when you
 

4409
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,709
times I get my first hand in is when you
you try some move you're trying to

4410
01:25:51,709 --> 01:25:51,719
you try some move you're trying to
 

4411
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:54,350
you try some move you're trying to
escape you're pushing I get with the

4412
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:54,360
escape you're pushing I get with the
 

4413
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,110
escape you're pushing I get with the
first handing as an opportunity and it's

4414
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:57,120
first handing as an opportunity and it's
 

4415
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,090
first handing as an opportunity and it's
gonna sit there for a while

4416
01:25:59,090 --> 01:25:59,100
gonna sit there for a while
 

4417
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,910
gonna sit there for a while
and now and I go as deep as I can so the

4418
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:01,920
and now and I go as deep as I can so the
 

4419
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,830
and now and I go as deep as I can so the
first hand because the second hand is

4420
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:03,840
first hand because the second hand is
 

4421
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,350
first hand because the second hand is
the hardest I have to compensate the

4422
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:06,360
the hardest I have to compensate the
 

4423
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,570
the hardest I have to compensate the
first thing to be as deep as I can right

4424
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:08,580
first thing to be as deep as I can right
 

4425
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:11,750
first thing to be as deep as I can right
if I cannot get the first hand in deep I

4426
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:11,760
if I cannot get the first hand in deep I
 

4427
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,189
if I cannot get the first hand in deep I
won't try the second

4428
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:13,199
won't try the second
 

4429
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,709
won't try the second
I need that first hand deep then I go

4430
01:26:15,709 --> 01:26:15,719
I need that first hand deep then I go
 

4431
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:17,030
I need that first hand deep then I go
for this and it's deep in it everything

4432
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:17,040
for this and it's deep in it everything
 

4433
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,090
for this and it's deep in it everything
is like super like tight super tight the

4434
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:20,100
is like super like tight super tight the
 

4435
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,530
is like super like tight super tight the
first hand has to be super tight

4436
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:21,540
first hand has to be super tight
 

4437
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:24,050
first hand has to be super tight
otherwise the chance of failing is very

4438
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:24,060
otherwise the chance of failing is very
 

4439
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,870
otherwise the chance of failing is very
big okay does the opponent usually feel

4440
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:26,880
big okay does the opponent usually feel
 

4441
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,310
big okay does the opponent usually feel
like they're screwed at that point also

4442
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:28,320
like they're screwed at that point also
 

4443
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,010
like they're screwed at that point also
no as you put in the first hand and the

4444
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:31,020
no as you put in the first hand and the
 

4445
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,490
no as you put in the first hand and the
moment that I position myself just prior

4446
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:34,500
moment that I position myself just prior
 

4447
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,950
moment that I position myself just prior
to attempt the second hand I think the

4448
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:36,960
to attempt the second hand I think the
 

4449
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,470
to attempt the second hand I think the
way I my body is positioned the way I'm

4450
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:39,480
way I my body is positioned the way I'm
 

4451
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,050
way I my body is positioned the way I'm
I'm collapsing with my weight and the

4452
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:42,060
I'm collapsing with my weight and the
 

4453
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,390
I'm collapsing with my weight and the
field is like it's I'm in a

4454
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:44,400
field is like it's I'm in a
 

4455
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,430
field is like it's I'm in a
this is terrible yeah how long did it

4456
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:46,440
this is terrible yeah how long did it
 

4457
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,050
this is terrible yeah how long did it
take you to figure out how to reposition

4458
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:48,060
take you to figure out how to reposition
 

4459
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:50,510
take you to figure out how to reposition
your weight once the first hand is in

4460
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:50,520
your weight once the first hand is in
 

4461
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,090
your weight once the first hand is in
very quickly because door get reached

4462
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:53,100
very quickly because door get reached
 

4463
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:53,750
very quickly because door get reached
out

4464
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:53,760
out
 

4465
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,729
out
okay so that there's a good feedback

4466
01:26:55,729 --> 01:26:55,739
okay so that there's a good feedback
 

4467
01:26:55,739 --> 01:26:58,310
okay so that there's a good feedback
loop yeah because one mistake you out

4468
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:58,320
loop yeah because one mistake you out
 

4469
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:02,870
loop yeah because one mistake you out
like one off positioning you out but you

4470
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:02,880
like one off positioning you out but you
 

4471
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:03,950
like one off positioning you out but you
still have to do that against the best

4472
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:03,960
still have to do that against the best
 

4473
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,110
still have to do that against the best
people in the world yeah where is the

4474
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:06,120
people in the world yeah where is the
 

4475
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,110
people in the world yeah where is the
way out for most people like if you were

4476
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:09,120
way out for most people like if you were
 

4477
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,390
way out for most people like if you were
in Mount against pusheshire or some of

4478
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:11,400
in Mount against pusheshire or some of
 

4479
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,689
in Mount against pusheshire or some of
the best defenses in the world uh

4480
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:14,699
the best defenses in the world uh
 

4481
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:18,050
the best defenses in the world uh
the way out is to I mean obviously is to

4482
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:18,060
the way out is to I mean obviously is to
 

4483
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,209
the way out is to I mean obviously is to
defend themselves and you know prevent

4484
01:27:20,209 --> 01:27:20,219
defend themselves and you know prevent
 

4485
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:23,930
defend themselves and you know prevent
the first hand to get deep and I'll say

4486
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:23,940
the first hand to get deep and I'll say
 

4487
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,250
the first hand to get deep and I'll say
the best

4488
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:25,260
the best
 

4489
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:28,490
the best
thing that they could do is try to

4490
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:28,500
thing that they could do is try to
 

4491
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:32,030
thing that they could do is try to
change my positioning on the mount in a

4492
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:32,040
change my positioning on the mount in a
 

4493
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,530
change my positioning on the mount in a
way that you know pushed me to a very

4494
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:33,540
way that you know pushed me to a very
 

4495
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:36,110
way that you know pushed me to a very
low amount you know try to just to to to

4496
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:36,120
low amount you know try to just to to to
 

4497
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,270
low amount you know try to just to to to
to change the way I'm dominating you not

4498
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:38,280
to change the way I'm dominating you not
 

4499
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,010

mount pretty much are you always is it
 

4503
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:44,510
mount pretty much are you always is it
as slow is it a fast thing to go from

4504
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:44,520
as slow is it a fast thing to go from
 

4505
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,570
as slow is it a fast thing to go from
low to low a high mode slow very slow

4506
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:47,580
low to low a high mode slow very slow

but how do you get them how do you get
 

4521
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:07,610
but how do you get them how do you get
your legs into the elbows as long as

4522
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:07,620
your legs into the elbows as long as
 

4523
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:08,510
your legs into the elbows as long as
this

4524
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:08,520
this
 

4525
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,550
this
you know it has to come under the tip of

4526
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:10,560
you know it has to come under the tip of
 

4527
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,290
you know it has to come under the tip of
your elbow because now the legs will

4528
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:12,300
your elbow because now the legs will
 

4529
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,970

4535
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,110
no they're in your elbow cannot get
inside my leg right because that because

4536
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
inside my leg right because that because
 

4537
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,689
inside my leg right because that because
that means I'm in a very low amount

4538
01:28:23,689 --> 01:28:23,699
that means I'm in a very low amount
 

4539
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:25,669
that means I'm in a very low amount
and then I cannot attack because I

4540
01:28:25,669 --> 01:28:25,679
and then I cannot attack because I
 

4541
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,470
and then I cannot attack because I
cannot ignore that because the mode that

4542
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:27,480
cannot ignore that because the mode that
 

4543
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,330
cannot ignore that because the mode that
I attack that will

4544
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:29,340
I attack that will
 

4545
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:31,010
I attack that will
you will stop pushing my leg to push me

doing the simple thing

4630
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:06,900
doing the simple thing
 

4631
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,750
doing the simple thing
that's not so simple but it kind of

4632
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:08,760
that's not so simple but it kind of
 

4633
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,790
that's not so simple but it kind of
looks simple of the over and over and

4634
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:10,800
looks simple of the over and over and
 

4635
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,290
looks simple of the over and over and
over and over and over and presumably

4636
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:12,300
over and over and over and presumably
 

4637
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,510
over and over and over and presumably
getting much better and simple it

4638
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:14,520
getting much better and simple it
 

4639
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,070
getting much better and simple it
becomes very simple but you're picking

4640
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,080
becomes very simple but you're picking
 

4641
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,450
becomes very simple but you're picking
up details probably along the way

4642
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:17,460
up details probably along the way
 

4643
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,189
up details probably along the way
there's wisdom along the way

4644
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:19,199
there's wisdom along the way
 

4645
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:23,270
there's wisdom along the way
what is that is that um

4646
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:23,280

 

4647
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,189

there's like lessons that you just kind

4648
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:25,199
there's like lessons that you just kind
 

4649
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:28,010
there's like lessons that you just kind
of accumulate over time like one

4650
01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:28,020
of accumulate over time like one
 

4651
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,050
of accumulate over time like one
training sessions you'll see

4652
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,060
training sessions you'll see
 

4653
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,610
training sessions you'll see
maybe

4654
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:31,620
maybe
 

4655
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:32,629
maybe
um

4656
01:30:32,629 --> 01:30:32,639
um
 

4657
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,390
um
like the positioning

4658
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:35,400
like the positioning
 

4659
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,310
like the positioning
of the thumb like this detailed

4660
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:37,320
of the thumb like this detailed
 

4661
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,810
of the thumb like this detailed
positioning of the thumb or something

4662
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:38,820
positioning of the thumb or something
 

4663
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,450
positioning of the thumb or something
like this and then you like okay if you

4664
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:41,460
like this and then you like okay if you
 

4665
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,770
like this and then you like okay if you
like load that in

4666
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:42,780
like load that in
 

4667
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:44,750
like load that in
that that would be very basic because

4668
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:44,760
that that would be very basic because
 

4669
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,550
that that would be very basic because
there is not that many different ways

4670
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:46,560
there is not that many different ways
 

4671
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:50,870
there is not that many different ways
maybe one two I just do one any other is

4672
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:50,880

questions it's you the mount is a super

4914
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:26,340
questions it's you the mount is a super
 

4915
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,970
questions it's you the mount is a super
controlling position it's not just

4916
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:28,980
controlling position it's not just
 

4917
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:30,470
controlling position it's not just
because

4918
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:30,480
because
 

4919
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,149
because
cross color choking the amount the

4920
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159
cross color choking the amount the
 

4921
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,649
cross color choking the amount the
moment they put both hands on my neck

4922
01:35:33,649 --> 01:35:33,659
moment they put both hands on my neck
 

4923
01:35:33,659 --> 01:35:35,510
moment they put both hands on my neck
you know you have to your arms need to

4924
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:35,520
you know you have to your arms need to
 

4925
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,430
you know you have to your arms need to
be very close to your body to attack so

4926
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:37,440
be very close to your body to attack so
 

4927
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,070
be very close to your body to attack so
that means there's very little space

4928
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:40,080
that means there's very little space
 

4929
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,610
that means there's very little space
between us so that means there's very

4930
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:43,620
between us so that means there's very
 

4931
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:46,250
between us so that means there's very
little escape space for you to work on

4932
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:46,260
little escape space for you to work on
 

4933
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:48,229
little escape space for you to work on
your escape and the moment that you

4934
01:35:48,229 --> 01:35:48,239
your escape and the moment that you
 

4935
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:50,750
your escape and the moment that you
cannot Bridge let's suppose I have you

4936
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:50,760
cannot Bridge let's suppose I have you
 

4937
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,189
cannot Bridge let's suppose I have you
know the person has a good Mouse so he

4938
01:35:52,189 --> 01:35:52,199
know the person has a good Mouse so he
 

4939
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:54,350
know the person has a good Mouse so he
cannot Bridge him off what else you

4940
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:54,360
cannot Bridge him off what else you
 

4941
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:57,229
cannot Bridge him off what else you
don't have space to try to work on your

4942
01:35:57,229 --> 01:35:57,239
don't have space to try to work on your
 

4943
01:35:57,239 --> 01:36:00,770
don't have space to try to work on your
defense being in the back I have all the

4944
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:00,780
defense being in the back I have all the
 

4945
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:02,510
defense being in the back I have all the
space around me to work on my difference

4946
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:02,520
space around me to work on my difference
 

4947
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,149
space around me to work on my difference
in my arms I have the mobility to bring

4948
01:36:05,149 --> 01:36:05,159
in my arms I have the mobility to bring
 

4949
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:06,229
in my arms I have the mobility to bring
them anywhere

4950
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:06,239
them anywhere
 

4951
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:10,790
them anywhere
so I because of that it gives you me a

4952
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:10,800
so I because of that it gives you me a
 

4953
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,290
so I because of that it gives you me a
much better chance

4954
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:12,300
much better chance
 

4955
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:15,950
much better chance
and yeah you cannot I can move my body

4956
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:15,960
and yeah you cannot I can move my body
 

4957
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:19,189
and yeah you cannot I can move my body
you feel my you feel my back you you

4958
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:19,199
you feel my you feel my back you you
 

4959
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:20,689
you feel my you feel my back you you
cannot pin me

4960
01:36:20,689 --> 01:36:20,699
cannot pin me
 

4961
01:36:20,699 --> 01:36:22,370
cannot pin me
you know my I cannot take you off my

4962
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:22,380
you know my I cannot take you off my
 

4963
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:25,010
you know my I cannot take you off my
back first I need to defend the choke

4964
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:25,020
back first I need to defend the choke
 

4965
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:27,830
back first I need to defend the choke
but you have no control over my body so

4966
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:27,840
but you have no control over my body so
 

4967
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,270
but you have no control over my body so
that means there's still a lot of

4968
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:29,280
that means there's still a lot of
 

4969
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,629
that means there's still a lot of
movement that I can try to use to escape

4970
01:36:32,629 --> 01:36:32,639
movement that I can try to use to escape
 

4971
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:35,030
movement that I can try to use to escape
in the mount there's no movement I'm

4972
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,040
in the mount there's no movement I'm
 

4973
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,610
in the mount there's no movement I'm
pinned down I cannot move and I have no

4974
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:37,620
pinned down I cannot move and I have no
 

4975
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:40,729
pinned down I cannot move and I have no
space between us to escape well the

4976
01:36:40,729 --> 01:36:40,739
space between us to escape well the
 

4977
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:43,189
space between us to escape well the
argument against that this is great is

4978
01:36:43,189 --> 01:36:43,199
argument against that this is great is
 

4979
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:46,850
argument against that this is great is
that on the bottom of Mount I the uh I

4980
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:46,860
that on the bottom of Mount I the uh I
 

4981
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:49,010
that on the bottom of Mount I the uh I
do have my hands between

4982
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:49,020
do have my hands between
 

4983
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,629
do have my hands between
so you're saying they're pinned there's

4984
01:36:50,629 --> 01:36:50,639
so you're saying they're pinned there's
 

4985

that's one explanation uh but for people
 

5221
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:39,410
that's one explanation uh but for people
it is interesting that uh of course this

5222
01:41:39,410 --> 01:41:39,420
it is interesting that uh of course this
 

5223
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:40,850
it is interesting that uh of course this
doesn't capture but this captures a lot

5224
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:40,860
doesn't capture but this captures a lot
 

5225
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,410
doesn't capture but this captures a lot
of your major matches

5226
01:41:42,410 --> 01:41:42,420
of your major matches
 

5227
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:44,810
of your major matches
and we should say that you've submitted

5228
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:44,820
and we should say that you've submitted
 

5229
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,970
and we should say that you've submitted
most of your opponents so you rarely win

5230
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:46,980
most of your opponents so you rarely win
 

5231
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:50,450
most of your opponents so you rarely win
on points usually wins submissions

5232
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:50,460
on points usually wins submissions
 

5233
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:52,729
on points usually wins submissions

times I use against people is is that
 

5255
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:24,229
times I use against people is is that
is the attack that as soon as I get to

5256
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:24,239
is the attack that as soon as I get to
 

5257
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:26,209
is the attack that as soon as I get to
the Mount when they're trying to escape

5258
01:42:26,209 --> 01:42:26,219
the Mount when they're trying to escape
 

5259
01:42:26,219 --> 01:42:29,330
the Mount when they're trying to escape
the open up and I get them it has to be

5260
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:29,340
the open up and I get them it has to be
 

5261
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:30,850
the open up and I get them it has to be
at that initial

5262
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:30,860
at that initial
 

5263
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:33,169
at that initial
timing so it's not a thing you use to

5264
01:42:33,169 --> 01:42:33,179
timing so it's not a thing you use to
 

5265
01:42:33,179 --> 01:42:35,090
timing so it's not a thing you use to
like bother them in order to create

5266
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:35,100
like bother them in order to create
 

5267
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:37,430
like bother them in order to create
either I get it right right away or I

5268
01:42:37,430 --> 01:42:37,440
either I get it right right away or I
 

5269
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,250
either I get it right right away or I
don't bother trying much because you

5270
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:40,260
don't bother trying much because you
 

5271
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,530
don't bother trying much because you
need to keep one hand behind the head

5272
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:42,540
need to keep one hand behind the head
 

5273
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:45,709
need to keep one hand behind the head
and that um you're naturally on that

5274
01:42:45,709 --> 01:42:45,719
and that um you're naturally on that
 

5275
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:47,689
and that um you're naturally on that
position as soon as you're Mount most of

5276
01:42:47,689 --> 01:42:47,699
position as soon as you're Mount most of
 

5277
01:42:47,699 --> 01:42:50,209
position as soon as you're Mount most of
the times and the moment that you mount

5278
01:42:50,209 --> 01:42:50,219
the times and the moment that you mount
 

5279
01:42:50,219 --> 01:42:51,950
the times and the moment that you mount
someone no one accepted they go mount it

someone no one accepted they go mount it
 

5281
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,990
someone no one accepted they go mount it
they're gonna expose to get out so hold

5282
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:54,000
they're gonna expose to get out so hold
 

5283
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,590
they're gonna expose to get out so hold
in the head it gives you a better way

5284
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:56,600
in the head it gives you a better way
 

5285
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:59,810
in the head it gives you a better way
way to dominate them initially you know

5286
01:42:59,810 --> 01:42:59,820
way to dominate them initially you know
 

5287
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:02,209
way to dominate them initially you know
to deal with that explosiveness on the

5288
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:02,219
to deal with that explosiveness on the
 

5289
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:04,609
to deal with that explosiveness on the
big on the initial in the beginning

5290
01:43:04,609 --> 01:43:04,619
big on the initial in the beginning
 

5291
01:43:04,619 --> 01:43:06,530
big on the initial in the beginning
and then but then we have to let go to

5292
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:06,540
and then but then we have to let go to
 

5293
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,870
and then but then we have to let go to

which is mostly I'm not sure I'm not
 

5353
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,729
which is mostly I'm not sure I'm not
sure it was

01:44:22,729 --> 01:44:22,739
sure it was
 

5355
01:44:22,739 --> 01:44:25,370

5389
01:45:07,139 --> 01:45:09,410
long I think he doesn't get credit as
much as he deserves because he pushed

5390
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:09,420
much as he deserves because he pushed
 

5391

it's extremely difficult MMA is not I

5634
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:04,440
it's extremely difficult MMA is not I
 

5635

5642
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:15,960
your space I mean you can slow down but
 

5643
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,570

conditioning faster it's explosiveness

5652
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:30,540
conditioning faster it's explosiveness
 

5653
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,810
conditioning faster it's explosiveness
it's much harder is it possible in the

keeps moving something is hard to
 

5675
01:50:55,619 --> 01:50:58,510
keeps moving something is hard to
control that pace

5676
01:50:58,510 --> 01:50:58,520
control that pace
 

5677
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:01,609
control that pace
you can you don't if you play defense

5680
01:51:04,189 --> 01:51:04,199
you you save more energy than if you try
 

5681
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:06,709
you you save more energy than if you try
to beat aggressor and respond and even

5682
01:51:06,709 --> 01:51:06,719
to beat aggressor and respond and even
 

5683
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:08,090

get into the coins is very difficult

5684
01:51:08,090 --> 01:51:08,100
get into the coins is very difficult
 

5685
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:10,550
get into the coins is very difficult
yeah you have no way to hold yourself

5686
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:10,560
yeah you have no way to hold yourself
 

5687
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:11,510
yeah you have no way to hold yourself
there

5688
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:11,520
there
 

5689
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,010
there
so that was the biggest challenge for me

5690
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:13,020
so that was the biggest challenge for me
 

5691
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:15,830
so that was the biggest challenge for me
in MMA is the speed because I'm a very

5692
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:15,840
in MMA is the speed because I'm a very
 

5693
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,530
in MMA is the speed because I'm a very
slow start fighter if you look at my

5694
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:18,540
slow start fighter if you look at my
 

5695
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:20,990
slow start fighter if you look at my
matches I start very slow because if I

5696
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:21,000
matches I start very slow because if I
 

5697
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,250
matches I start very slow because if I
go hard you know I fatigue faster so for

5698
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:25,260
go hard you know I fatigue faster so for
 

5699
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,470
go hard you know I fatigue faster so for
me that was the hardest part

5700
01:51:27,470 --> 01:51:27,480
me that was the hardest part
 

5701
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:30,050
me that was the hardest part
of is to start fast

5702
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:30,060

there's barely no open guard
 

5767
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:48,229
there's barely no open guard
in MMA very little

5768
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:48,239
in MMA very little
 

5769
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:50,450
in MMA very little
because the open guard there's a

5770
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:50,460
because the open guard there's a
 

5771
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:51,950
because the open guard there's a
distance between you and him yeah

5772
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:51,960
distance between you and him yeah
 

5773
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,689
distance between you and him yeah
there's a distance you how you you

5774
01:52:53,689 --> 01:52:53,699
there's a distance you how you you
 

5775
01:52:53,699 --> 01:52:55,790
there's a distance you how you you
cannot control it's much harder to

5776
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:55,800
cannot control it's much harder to
 

5777
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:59,030
cannot control it's much harder to
control that punch coming and I have to

5778
01:52:59,030 --> 01:52:59,040
control that punch coming and I have to
 

5779
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:02,270
control that punch coming and I have to
position myself a way to block that and

5780
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:02,280
position myself a way to block that and
 

5781
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:04,010
position myself a way to block that and
it limited my attacks my options of

5782
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:04,020
it limited my attacks my options of
 

5783
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:05,930
it limited my attacks my options of
attacks is there a reason

5784
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:05,940
attacks is there a reason
 

5785
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:07,910
attacks is there a reason
correct me if I'm wrong but I don't

5786
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:07,920
correct me if I'm wrong but I don't
 

5787
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,609
correct me if I'm wrong but I don't
think you do open guard much in Jiu

5788
01:53:10,609 --> 01:53:10,619
think you do open guard much in Jiu
 

5789
01:53:10,619 --> 01:53:12,229
think you do open guard much in Jiu
Jitsu and nogi

5790
01:53:12,229 --> 01:53:12,239
Jitsu and nogi
 

5791
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:14,149
Jitsu and nogi
is there a reason for that

5792
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:14,159
is there a reason for that
 

5793
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:18,169
is there a reason for that
it's harder with the explosive uh

5794
01:53:18,169 --> 01:53:18,179
it's harder with the explosive uh
 

5795
01:53:18,179 --> 01:53:19,850
it's harder with the explosive uh
explosion of person

5796
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:19,860
explosion of person
 

5797
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:21,470
explosion of person
because it's you know when they're

5798
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:21,480
because it's you know when they're
 

5799
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:23,570
because it's you know when they're
moving fast then you have to try to slow

5800
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:23,580
moving fast then you have to try to slow
 

5801
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:25,430
moving fast then you have to try to slow
them down so you like guards that allow

5802
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:25,440
them down so you like guards that allow
 

5803
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,770
them down so you like guards that allow
you to control the person

5804
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:27,780
you to control the person
 

5805
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:31,070
you to control the person
and closed guard is the ultimate control

5806
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:31,080
and closed guard is the ultimate control
 

5807
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,990
and closed guard is the ultimate control
oh no it's not ultimate control but

5808
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:33,000
oh no it's not ultimate control but
 

5809
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,090
oh no it's not ultimate control but
close guy puts in a position that I'm

5810
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:35,100
close guy puts in a position that I'm
 

5811
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,129
close guy puts in a position that I'm
attacking and you're defending you

5812
01:53:37,129 --> 01:53:37,139
attacking and you're defending you
 

5813
01:53:37,139 --> 01:53:39,970

01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:44,340
two attacks but it's like
 

5819

5924
01:55:48,770 --> 01:55:48,780
some point I would have to do MMA
 

5925
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:51,470
some point I would have to do MMA
there's almost like that's the path of a

5926
01:55:51,470 --> 01:55:51,480
there's almost like that's the path of a
 

5927
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,870
there's almost like that's the path of a
Gracie you know you when you're ready

5928
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:53,880
Gracie you know you when you're ready
 

5929
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,910
Gracie you know you when you're ready
you go to MMA

5930
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:55,920
you go to MMA
 

5931
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:59,270
you go to MMA
so there was a like a Duty versus a love

5932
01:55:59,270 --> 01:55:59,280
so there was a like a Duty versus a love
 

5933
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,310
so there was a like a Duty versus a love
yeah that was that was not a choice that

5934
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:01,320
yeah that was that was not a choice that
 

5935
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,870
yeah that was that was not a choice that
was like I have to

5936
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:02,880
was like I have to
 

5937
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:05,629
was like I have to
that's just the the life I took he will

5938
01:56:05,629 --> 01:56:05,639
that's just the the life I took he will
 

5939
01:56:05,639 --> 01:56:07,729
that's just the the life I took he will
lead that way

5940
01:56:07,729 --> 01:56:07,739
lead that way
 

5941
01:56:07,739 --> 01:56:10,609
lead that way
are you proud of that stuff you know go

5942
01:56:10,609 --> 01:56:10,619
are you proud of that stuff you know go
 

5943
01:56:10,619 --> 01:56:12,770
are you proud of that stuff you know go
against the natural love and towards

5944
01:56:12,770 --> 01:56:12,780
against the natural love and towards
 

5945
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,629
against the natural love and towards
more Duty

5946
01:56:14,629 --> 01:56:14,639
more Duty
 

5947
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,850
more Duty
I think

5948
01:56:16,850 --> 01:56:16,860
I think
 

5949
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:20,390
I think
I don't regret it because if I hadn't

5950
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:20,400
I don't regret it because if I hadn't
 

5951
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,669
I don't regret it because if I hadn't
done it I would feel there was something

5952
01:56:22,669 --> 01:56:22,679
done it I would feel there was something
 

5953
01:56:22,679 --> 01:56:26,030
done it I would feel there was something
missing yeah so I don't regret doing I

5954
01:56:26,030 --> 01:56:26,040
missing yeah so I don't regret doing I
 

5955
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:29,590
missing yeah so I don't regret doing I
would regret not doing

5956
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:29,600
would regret not doing
 

5957
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:32,870
would regret not doing
the the tricky thing is the choice to go

5958
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:32,880
the the tricky thing is the choice to go
 

5959
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,490
the the tricky thing is the choice to go
to MMA

5960
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:34,500
to MMA
 

5961
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,290
to MMA

fascinating
case study it still doesn't make sense

5970

01:57:27,229 --> 01:57:27,239
in terms of nogi who do you think is the
 

6007
01:57:27,239 --> 01:57:28,910
in terms of nogi who do you think is the
best no-gi competitor of all time

6008
01:57:28,910 --> 01:57:28,920
best no-gi competitor of all time
 

6009
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:31,550
best no-gi competitor of all time
there's no question you know this Gordon

6010
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:31,560
there's no question you know this Gordon
 

6011
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,109
there's no question you know this Gordon
is

6012
01:57:33,109 --> 01:57:33,119
is
 

6013
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:34,729
is
I mean it's

6014
01:57:34,729 --> 01:57:34,739
I mean it's
 

6015
01:57:34,739 --> 01:57:37,010
I mean it's
I don't think it's right to say the best

6016
01:57:37,010 --> 01:57:37,020
I don't think it's right to say the best
 

6017
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:38,390
I don't think it's right to say the best
comparative of all time because he's

6018
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:38,400
comparative of all time because he's
 

6019
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,070
comparative of all time because he's
still very young I think that's

6020
01:57:40,070 --> 01:57:40,080
still very young I think that's
 

6021
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:41,750
still very young I think that's
something that he came back in the end

6022
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:41,760
something that he came back in the end
 

6023
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:44,089
something that he came back in the end
of when the person you don't want him to

6024
01:57:44,089 --> 01:57:44,099
of when the person you don't want him to
 

6025
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:45,830
of when the person you don't want him to
get lazy you know what I'm saying I mean

6026
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:45,840
get lazy you know what I'm saying I mean
 

6027
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,750
get lazy you know what I'm saying I mean
but you cannot praise someone in the

6028
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:47,760
but you cannot praise someone in the
 

6029
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,910
but you cannot praise someone in the
middle of his career you know so it's

6030
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:49,920
middle of his career you know so it's
 

6031
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,550
middle of his career you know so it's
you cannot call him the best ever he's

6032
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
you cannot call him the best ever he's
 

6033
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,570
you cannot call him the best ever he's
26 or 27. so it's I mean he's he's great

6034
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:56,580
26 or 27. so it's I mean he's he's great
 

6035
01:57:56,580 --> 01:58:00,470
26 or 27. so it's I mean he's he's great
he's very good he's ahead of all of

6036
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:00,480
he's very good he's ahead of all of
 

6037
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,890
he's very good he's ahead of all of
other competitors I think

6038
01:58:02,890 --> 01:58:02,900
other competitors I think
 

6039
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:06,530
other competitors I think
and I mean he's having an amazing career

6040
01:58:06,530 --> 01:58:06,540
and I mean he's having an amazing career
 

6041
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:08,689
and I mean he's having an amazing career
you know he's doing amazingly well

6042
01:58:08,689 --> 01:58:08,699
you know he's doing amazingly well
 

6043
01:58:08,699 --> 01:58:10,970
you know he's doing amazingly well
so I mean when he's when he finished

6044
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:10,980
so I mean when he's when he finished
 

6045
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:12,950
so I mean when he's when he finished
when he finally retired

6046
01:58:12,950 --> 01:58:12,960
when he finally retired
 

6047
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,930
when he finally retired
then you can I go like

6048
01:58:14,930 --> 01:58:14,940
then you can I go like
 

6049
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:17,870
then you can I go like
you know what there's wisdom in that

6050
01:58:17,870 --> 01:58:17,880
you know what there's wisdom in that
 

6051
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:20,149
you know what there's wisdom in that
it matters how you finish right of

6052
01:58:20,149 --> 01:58:20,159
it matters how you finish right of
 

6053
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:23,390
it matters how you finish right of
course it's very interesting

6054
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:23,400
course it's very interesting
 

6055
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:27,229
course it's very interesting
I think that nogi is relatively new

6056
01:58:27,229 --> 01:58:27,239
I think that nogi is relatively new
 

6057
01:58:27,239 --> 01:58:29,930
I think that nogi is relatively new
that Noki seen that was not there wasn't

6058
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:29,940
that Noki seen that was not there wasn't
 

6059
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:31,250
that Noki seen that was not there wasn't
a scene before

6060
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:31,260
a scene before
 

6061
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:34,070
a scene before
I think you started now on his

6062
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:34,080
I think you started now on his
 

6063
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,229
I think you started now on his
generation you know his time because

6064
01:58:36,229 --> 01:58:36,239
generation you know his time because
 

6065
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:37,310
generation you know his time because
before

6066
01:58:37,310 --> 01:58:37,320
before
 

6067
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:39,589
before
like when I was competing you know he

6068
01:58:39,589 --> 01:58:39,599
like when I was competing you know he
 

6069
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:42,410
like when I was competing you know he
was just ADCC there's nothing else

6070
01:58:42,410 --> 01:58:42,420
was just ADCC there's nothing else
 

6071
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:44,689
was just ADCC there's nothing else
every two years and my first was only in

6072
01:58:44,689 --> 01:58:44,699
every two years and my first was only in
 

6073
01:58:44,699 --> 01:58:46,370
every two years and my first was only in
the Emirates you know you should have

6074
01:58:46,370 --> 01:58:46,380
the Emirates you know you should have
 

6075
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:48,589
the Emirates you know you should have
you had to go there to compete

6076
01:58:48,589 --> 01:58:48,599
you had to go there to compete
 

6077
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:50,330
you had to go there to compete
so there was not even a scene there was

6078
01:58:50,330 --> 01:58:50,340
so there was not even a scene there was
 

6079
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:53,149
so there was not even a scene there was

your opponent so he can't push create
distance he can push away but somehow it

6160

yep makes it more difficult to yeah kind
 

6165
02:00:39,239 --> 02:00:41,810
yep makes it more difficult to yeah kind
of trap your legs you'd see your back

6166

are you like scientifically

6170
02:00:46,490 --> 02:00:46,500
are you like scientifically
 

6171
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:49,070
are you like scientifically
curious about these new developments do

6172
02:00:49,070 --> 02:00:49,080
curious about these new developments do
 

6173
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,589
curious about these new developments do
you think do you do you have answers in

6174
02:00:51,589 --> 02:00:51,599
you think do you do you have answers in
 

6175
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:53,689
you think do you do you have answers in
your head to them

6176
02:00:53,689 --> 02:00:53,699
your head to them
 

6177
02:00:53,699 --> 02:00:56,149
your head to them
most

6178
02:00:56,149 --> 02:00:56,159
most
 

6179

because you know obviously you just was
 

6205
02:01:24,179 --> 02:01:27,770
because you know obviously you just was
not really been you know unlike like

best position to be it's it's okay to go

6322
02:03:52,189 --> 02:03:52,199
best position to be it's it's okay to go
 

6323

go so that's why it's not in a real
situation it's not seen as a good thing

good thing because when you reflect that
 

6335
02:04:04,739 --> 02:04:07,790
good thing because when you reflect that
to a real situation it's not going to go

6336
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:07,800
to a real situation it's not going to go
 

6337
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:08,810
to a real situation it's not going to go
down well

6338
02:04:08,810 --> 02:04:08,820
down well
 

6339
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:11,990

submission of which win but the sad side

6356
02:04:26,930 --> 02:04:26,940
submission of which win but the sad side
 

6357
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:28,850
submission of which win but the sad side
effect of that is it was completely

6358
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:28,860
effect of that is it was completely
 

6359
02:04:28,860 --> 02:04:31,810
effect of that is it was completely
underdeveloped because of that

6360
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:31,820
underdeveloped because of that
 

6361

02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:10,430
Bear versus Shark question but you know
there is

6392
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:10,440
there is
 

6393
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,390
there is
um

6394
02:05:11,390 --> 02:05:11,400
um
 

6395
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:13,850
um
in a street self-defense situation it's

6396
02:05:13,850 --> 02:05:13,860
in a street self-defense situation it's
 

6397
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:15,830
in a street self-defense situation it's
possible to imagine where foot locks

6398
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:15,840
possible to imagine where foot locks
 

6399
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,870
possible to imagine where foot locks
would be effective for a highly but I

6400
02:05:17,870 --> 02:05:17,880
would be effective for a highly but I
 

6401
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:20,570
would be effective for a highly but I
guess if you invest 10 000 hours it's

6402
02:05:20,570 --> 02:05:20,580
guess if you invest 10 000 hours it's
 

6403
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:24,770
guess if you invest 10 000 hours it's
better to invest it in chokes yeah to

6404
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:24,780
better to invest it in chokes yeah to
 

6405
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:26,450
better to invest it in chokes yeah to
dominate you if I'm you know if I were

6406
02:05:26,450 --> 02:05:26,460
dominate you if I'm you know if I were
 

6407
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:27,530
dominate you if I'm you know if I were
fighting

6408
02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:27,540
fighting
 

6409
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:29,510
fighting
it's way better for me to be on your

6410
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:29,520
it's way better for me to be on your
 

6411
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,669
it's way better for me to be on your
side control on the mount where I can

6412
02:05:31,669 --> 02:05:31,679
side control on the mount where I can
 

6413
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:34,189
side control on the mount where I can
pin you'll be completely safe then to

6414
02:05:34,189 --> 02:05:34,199
pin you'll be completely safe then to
 

6415
02:05:34,199 --> 02:05:35,629
pin you'll be completely safe then to
stay inside your legs trying to attack

6416
02:05:35,629 --> 02:05:35,639
stay inside your legs trying to attack
 

6417
02:05:35,639 --> 02:05:36,709
stay inside your legs trying to attack
your foot

6418
02:05:36,709 --> 02:05:36,719
your foot
 

6419
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:39,050
your foot
but people would argue that there's a

6420
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:39,060
but people would argue that there's a
 

6421
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:40,550
but people would argue that there's a
lot of very dominant controlling

6422
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:40,560
lot of very dominant controlling
 

6423
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:42,709
lot of very dominant controlling
positions in the whole football game

6424
02:05:42,709 --> 02:05:42,719
positions in the whole football game
 

6425
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:44,870
positions in the whole football game
right it is but it can go bad very

6426
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:44,880
right it is but it can go bad very
 

6427
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:48,229
right it is but it can go bad very
quickly yeah just no it I mean this

6428
02:05:48,229 --> 02:05:48,239
quickly yeah just no it I mean this
 

6429
02:05:48,239 --> 02:05:49,790
quickly yeah just no it I mean this
there's some great ways to control

6430
02:05:49,790 --> 02:05:49,800
there's some great ways to control
 

6431
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:52,490
there's some great ways to control
someone that he cannot Escape but it can

6432
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:52,500
someone that he cannot Escape but it can
 

6433
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:56,750
someone that he cannot Escape but it can
go bad very quickly that's the thing

6434
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:56,760
go bad very quickly that's the thing
 

6435
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:59,209
go bad very quickly that's the thing
well even back control can go bad very

6436
02:05:59,209 --> 02:05:59,219
well even back control can go bad very
 

6437
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:00,830
well even back control can go bad very
quickly on the street

6438
02:06:00,830 --> 02:06:00,840
quickly on the street
 

6439
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:03,589
quickly on the street
so Mount I don't know is mount a really

6440
02:06:03,589 --> 02:06:03,599
so Mount I don't know is mount a really
 

6441
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:05,450
so Mount I don't know is mount a really
good position but then then there's no

6442
02:06:05,450 --> 02:06:05,460
good position but then then there's no
 

6443
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:07,390
good position but then then there's no
good position then

6444
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:07,400
good position then
 

6445
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:10,850
good position then
there's no every every position there's

6446
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:10,860
there's no every every position there's
 

6447
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:12,470
there's no every every position there's
a risk okay

6448
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:12,480
a risk okay
 

6449
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,450
a risk okay
attacking the foot is a way higher risk

6450
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:14,460
attacking the foot is a way higher risk
 

6451
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:18,050
attacking the foot is a way higher risk
than side control mount back

6452
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:18,060
than side control mount back
 

6453
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:20,330
than side control mount back
as I'm saying the back is not the best

6454
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:20,340
as I'm saying the back is not the best
 

6455
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:23,570
as I'm saying the back is not the best
way to pin someone unless you underneath

6456
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:23,580
way to pin someone unless you underneath
 

6457
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:25,370
way to pin someone unless you underneath
me

6458
02:06:25,370 --> 02:06:25,380
me
 

6459
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:28,669
me
because I if you try to rotate I can

6460
02:06:28,669 --> 02:06:28,679
because I if you try to rotate I can
 

6461
02:06:28,679 --> 02:06:31,010
because I if you try to rotate I can
sacrifice the back and just allow you

6462
02:06:31,010 --> 02:06:31,020
sacrifice the back and just allow you
 

6463
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:33,790
sacrifice the back and just allow you
push be in the mouth okay there you go

6464
02:06:33,790 --> 02:06:33,800
push be in the mouth okay there you go
 

6465
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:37,310
push be in the mouth okay there you go
would you prefer Mount or back Mount or

6466
02:06:37,310 --> 02:06:37,320
would you prefer Mount or back Mount or
 

6467
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:40,370
would you prefer Mount or back Mount or

important how he trains
 

6517
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:44,629
important how he trains
and when I I kind of already knew but

6518
02:07:44,629 --> 02:07:44,639
and when I I kind of already knew but
 

6519
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:47,750
and when I I kind of already knew but
when I heard John podcast with you the

preparation the training for the ADCC
and that kind of gave me a very strong

6526
02:07:54,970 --> 02:07:54,980
and that kind of gave me a very strong
 

6527
02:07:54,980 --> 02:07:57,950
and that kind of gave me a very strong
idea how they've been training all these

6528
02:07:57,950 --> 02:07:57,960
idea how they've been training all these
 

6529
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:58,790
idea how they've been training all these
years

02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:26,340
can actually just get him you control
 

6709
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:28,070

him essentially by sending interesting

6710
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:28,080
him essentially by sending interesting
 

6711
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:30,609
him essentially by sending interesting
videos and you could just see his mind

6712
02:11:30,609 --> 02:11:30,619
videos and you could just see his mind
 

6713
02:11:30,619 --> 02:11:33,470
videos and you could just see his mind
he's gonna do research on that because I

6714
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:33,480
he's gonna do research on that because I
 

6715
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:35,030
he's gonna do research on that because I
kept sending him videos of bears because

6716
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:35,040
kept sending him videos of bears because
 

6717
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,649
kept sending him videos of bears because
he claimed

02:11:36,649 --> 02:11:36,659
he claimed
 

6719
02:11:36,659 --> 02:11:41,810
he claimed
that a lion would beat a bear because

6720
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:41,820

6723
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:48,229

so the bear is much bigger much stronger

6724
02:11:48,229 --> 02:11:48,239
so the bear is much bigger much stronger
 

6725
02:11:48,239 --> 02:11:51,890
so the bear is much bigger much stronger
but his take is that the Bears don't

6726
02:11:51,890 --> 02:11:51,900
but his take is that the Bears don't
 

6727
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:53,510
but his take is that the Bears don't
have experience of fighting to the death

6728
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:53,520
have experience of fighting to the death

of pushing and the the the fur is so
 

6793
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,890
of pushing and the the the fur is so
thick so the cloth doesn't really damage

6794
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:06,900
thick so the cloth doesn't really damage
 

6795
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:08,089
thick so the cloth doesn't really damage
much

6918
02:15:41,149 --> 02:15:41,159
have you ever explored this it says so
 

6919
02:15:41,159 --> 02:15:43,790
have you ever explored this it says so
as the best choker in the world have you

6920
02:15:43,790 --> 02:15:43,800
as the best choker in the world have you
 

6921
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:46,149
as the best choker in the world have you
ever explored the use because like

6922
02:15:46,149 --> 02:15:46,159
ever explored the use because like

to me is a pretty shitty uh way to choke
 

6927
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:56,149
to me is a pretty shitty uh way to choke
somebody like intuitively it thinks like

6928
02:15:56,149 --> 02:15:56,159
somebody like intuitively it thinks like
 

6929
02:15:56,159 --> 02:15:57,669
somebody like intuitively it thinks like
it's a good way but it can slide around

6930
02:15:57,669 --> 02:15:57,679
it's a good way but it can slide around
 

6931
02:15:57,679 --> 02:16:00,589
it's a good way but it can slide around
it's it feels like if it feels like

6932
02:16:00,589 --> 02:16:00,599
it's it feels like if it feels like
 

6933
02:16:00,599 --> 02:16:03,050
it's it feels like if it feels like
there's no uh there's no way to really

6934
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:03,060
there's no uh there's no way to really
 

6935
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:06,169
there's no uh there's no way to really
pin you would need to right so you use

6936
02:16:06,169 --> 02:16:06,179
pin you would need to right so you use
 

6937
02:16:06,179 --> 02:16:07,609
pin you would need to right so you use
it the way you use a belt yeah

6938
02:16:07,609 --> 02:16:07,619
it the way you use a belt yeah
 

6939
02:16:07,619 --> 02:16:10,669
it the way you use a belt yeah
essentially yeah but then I would guess

6940
02:16:10,669 --> 02:16:10,679
essentially yeah but then I would guess
 

6941
02:16:10,679 --> 02:16:12,169
essentially yeah but then I would guess
so yeah

6942
02:16:12,169 --> 02:16:12,179
so yeah
 

6943
02:16:12,179 --> 02:16:14,569
so yeah
I don't I don't think it's and I think

6944
02:16:14,569 --> 02:16:14,579
I don't I don't think it's and I think
 

6945
02:16:14,579 --> 02:16:17,089
I don't I don't think it's and I think
if it gives you it actually has the

6946
02:16:17,089 --> 02:16:17,099
if it gives you it actually has the
 

6947
02:16:17,099 --> 02:16:19,550
if it gives you it actually has the
reverse effect which it gives you the

6948
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:19,560
reverse effect which it gives you the
 

6949
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:21,350
reverse effect which it gives you the
the false sense of confidence that you

6950
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,360
the false sense of confidence that you
 

6951
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:22,490
the false sense of confidence that you
can use it

6952
02:16:22,490 --> 02:16:22,500
can use it
 

6953
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:24,589
can use it
and instead it'll just distract you so

6954
02:16:24,589 --> 02:16:24,599
and instead it'll just distract you so
 

6955
02:16:24,599 --> 02:16:26,149
and instead it'll just distract you so
you think is a stronger way than the

6956
02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:26,159
you think is a stronger way than the
 

6957
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:27,410
you think is a stronger way than the
call

6958
02:16:27,410 --> 02:16:27,420
call
 

6959
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:29,470
call
or just a strong way yeah

6960
02:16:29,470 --> 02:16:29,480
or just a strong way yeah
 

6961
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:32,150
or just a strong way yeah
yeah I don't see how

6962
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:32,160
yeah I don't see how
 

6963
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:34,549
yeah I don't see how

maybe just like in a street fight
scenario right like um but by the time

6966
02:16:37,070 --> 02:16:37,080
scenario right like um but by the time

them
 

6979
02:16:51,059 --> 02:16:53,770
them
which is an interesting point to like um

6980
02:16:53,770 --> 02:16:53,780
which is an interesting point to like um

tested it it's a okay for that
perspective of unbalancing of balancing

6990
02:17:04,549 --> 02:17:04,559
perspective of unbalancing of balancing
 

6991
02:17:04,559 --> 02:17:05,450

a period of years the competition you
won't really know I think like that's

7014

lot of damage it's very interesting so
 

7043
02:18:00,899 --> 02:18:02,450
lot of damage it's very interesting so
when we're saying something that you

7044
02:18:02,450 --> 02:18:02,460
when we're saying something that you
 

7045
02:18:02,460 --> 02:18:04,549
when we're saying something that you
develop over the years of practice over

7046
02:18:04,549 --> 02:18:04,559
develop over the years of practice over
 

7047
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:07,669
develop over the years of practice over
and over again going back to deficience

7048
02:18:07,669 --> 02:18:07,679
and over again going back to deficience
 

7049
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:10,910
and over again going back to deficience
of the amount of back by experience of

7050
02:18:10,910 --> 02:18:10,920
of the amount of back by experience of
 

7051
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,650
of the amount of back by experience of
attacking people

7052
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:12,660
attacking people
 

7053
02:18:12,660 --> 02:18:15,950
attacking people
they people always had a much higher

7054
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:15,960
they people always had a much higher
 

7055
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:18,830
they people always had a much higher
chance of escaping from the back then

7056
02:18:18,830 --> 02:18:18,840
chance of escaping from the back then
 

7057
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:20,709
chance of escaping from the back then
from my mouth

7058
02:18:20,709 --> 02:18:20,719
from my mouth
 

7059

so some purple Bells they practice this
 

7301
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:08,570
so some purple Bells they practice this
you know the the amount way more than

7302
02:23:08,570 --> 02:23:08,580
you know the the amount way more than
 

7303
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:10,969
you know the the amount way more than
that black belt did so the naturally the

7304
02:23:10,969 --> 02:23:10,979
that black belt did so the naturally the
 

7305
02:23:10,979 --> 02:23:12,650
that black belt did so the naturally the
difference is better so they they get to

7306
02:23:12,650 --> 02:23:12,660
difference is better so they they get to
 

7307
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:14,570
difference is better so they they get to
experience the defensive position much

7308
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:14,580
experience the defensive position much
 

7309
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:16,429
experience the defensive position much
much more and especially training with

much more and especially training with
 

7311
02:23:16,439 --> 02:23:18,469
much more and especially training with
you they get really good at defending

7312

you they get really good at defending
 

7313
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:20,630
you they get really good at defending
yeah and then over and over again you

7314
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:20,640
yeah and then over and over again you
 

7315
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:21,950
yeah and then over and over again you
attack them with the same thing over and

7316
02:23:21,950 --> 02:23:21,960
attack them with the same thing over and
 

7317
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:23,210
attack them with the same thing over and
over again and didn't know what's coming

7318
02:23:23,210 --> 02:23:23,220
over again and didn't know what's coming
 

7319
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:25,309
over again and didn't know what's coming
they will block they will develop a

7320
02:23:25,309 --> 02:23:25,319
they will block they will develop a
 

7321
02:23:25,319 --> 02:23:28,670
they will block they will develop a
defense over that yeah way better than

7322
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:28,680
defense over that yeah way better than
 

7323
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:31,370
defense over that yeah way better than
most other high-level blackboards so

7324
02:23:31,370 --> 02:23:31,380
most other high-level blackboards so
 

7325
02:23:31,380 --> 02:23:33,230
most other high-level blackboards so
both put yourself into really bad

7326
02:23:33,230 --> 02:23:33,240
both put yourself into really bad
 

7327
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:35,630
both put yourself into really bad
positions with lower ranks and just keep

7328
02:23:35,630 --> 02:23:35,640
positions with lower ranks and just keep
 

7329

over
 

7333
02:23:38,819 --> 02:23:40,130
over
yeah

up from a lot of other disciplines like

7506
02:27:06,410 --> 02:27:06,420
up from a lot of other disciplines like
 

7507
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:07,670
up from a lot of other disciplines like
for me I think that came from just

7508
02:27:07,670 --> 02:27:07,680
for me I think that came from just

learning piano piano at a young age this

7510
02:27:09,770 --> 02:27:09,780
learning piano piano at a young age this
 

7511
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:13,730
learning piano piano at a young age this
for um I think any Mobility thing to

7512
02:27:13,730 --> 02:27:13,740
for um I think any Mobility thing to
 

7513
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:15,950
for um I think any Mobility thing to
learn how to move efficiently you have

7514
02:27:15,950 --> 02:27:15,960
learn how to move efficiently you have
 

7515
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:17,990
learn how to move efficiently you have
to know how to relax it's just the fact

7516
02:27:17,990 --> 02:27:18,000
to know how to relax it's just the fact
 

7517
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,990
to know how to relax it's just the fact
that you can like the body can be tense

7518
02:27:20,990 --> 02:27:21,000
that you can like the body can be tense
 

7519
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,090
that you can like the body can be tense
so it could be relaxed just knowing that

7520
02:27:23,090 --> 02:27:23,100
so it could be relaxed just knowing that
 

7521
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:25,910
so it could be relaxed just knowing that
fact now imagine you showed the stints

7522
02:27:25,910 --> 02:27:25,920
fact now imagine you showed the stints

has to be real life I guess some of that
 

7527
02:27:30,420 --> 02:27:32,929
has to be real life I guess some of that
is mind too but just knowing that and

7528
02:27:32,929 --> 02:27:32,939
is mind too but just knowing that and
 

7529
02:27:32,939 --> 02:27:35,210
is mind too but just knowing that and
being self-aware and you but see like

02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:38,050
even me
um

7534
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:38,060

beginner you're going to tense up no
 

7541
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:46,849
beginner you're going to tense up no
matter and like it actually takes a

mean that's massively that's why

7546
02:27:50,690 --> 02:27:50,700
mean that's massively that's why

learning things as an adult is much

7548
02:27:53,030 --> 02:27:53,040
learning things as an adult is much
 

7549
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:55,010
learning things as an adult is much
harder than as a child like it's very

7550

02:27:57,530 --> 02:27:57,540
hard and as an adult
 

7553
02:27:57,540 --> 02:27:59,330
hard and as an adult
it's like to get to the highest level

7554
02:27:59,330 --> 02:27:59,340
it's like to get to the highest level
 

7555
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:01,190
it's like to get to the highest level
it's not possible

7556
02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:01,200

uh I never learned the close guard
 

7611
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:04,969
uh I never learned the close guard
well

7612
02:29:04,969 --> 02:29:04,979
well
 

7613
02:29:04,979 --> 02:29:07,610
well
it just never connected with me you

7614
02:29:07,610 --> 02:29:07,620
it just never connected with me you
 

7615
02:29:07,620 --> 02:29:08,929
it just never connected with me you
could say it's body mechanics whatever

7616
02:29:08,929 --> 02:29:08,939
could say it's body mechanics whatever
 

7617
02:29:08,939 --> 02:29:11,030
could say it's body mechanics whatever
it doesn't matter the point is it's just

never connected with it uh you know the
 

7623
02:29:14,819 --> 02:29:17,150
never connected with it uh you know the
way I Justified it to myself is I felt

7624
02:29:17,150 --> 02:29:17,160
way I Justified it to myself is I felt
 

7625
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:18,770
way I Justified it to myself is I felt
like when you're bad you're using the

7626
02:29:18,770 --> 02:29:18,780
like when you're bad you're using the
 

7627
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:20,270
like when you're bad you're using the

close guard just like you could use the
 

7629
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:22,849
close guard just like you could use the
half guard to stall so I was really

7630
02:29:22,849 --> 02:29:22,859
half guard to stall so I was really
 

7631
02:29:22,859 --> 02:29:24,469
half guard to stall so I was really
drawn to the butterfly guard as a

7632
02:29:24,469 --> 02:29:24,479
drawn to the butterfly guard as a
 

7633
02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:27,170
drawn to the butterfly guard as a
beginner because I thought that I have

7634
02:29:27,170 --> 02:29:27,180
beginner because I thought that I have
 

7635
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:30,410
beginner because I thought that I have
or open guard in general uh there's I

7636
02:29:30,410 --> 02:29:30,420
or open guard in general uh there's I
 

7637
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:32,210
or open guard in general uh there's I
have no options to stall so I'm going to

7638
02:29:32,210 --> 02:29:32,220
have no options to stall so I'm going to
 

7639
02:29:32,220 --> 02:29:34,670
have no options to stall so I'm going to
learn my thinking was let me do the

7640
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:34,680
learn my thinking was let me do the
 

7641
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:37,670
learn my thinking was let me do the
guard that enforces me to learn and then

7642
02:29:37,670 --> 02:29:37,680
guard that enforces me to learn and then
 

7643
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:38,929
guard that enforces me to learn and then
I fell in love with the butterfly garden

7644
02:29:38,929 --> 02:29:38,939
I fell in love with the butterfly garden
 

7645
02:29:38,939 --> 02:29:41,870
I fell in love with the butterfly garden
open guard and so on and I never I never

7646
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:41,880
open guard and so on and I never I never

going to be in trouble not to know the
 

7773
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:03,710
going to be in trouble not to know the
close guard you're just gonna go

7774
02:32:03,710 --> 02:32:03,720
close guard you're just gonna go
 

7775
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:05,090
close guard you're just gonna go
straight for open guard I mean that

7776
02:32:05,090 --> 02:32:05,100
straight for open guard I mean that
 

7777
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:06,950
straight for open guard I mean that
that's not a problem the main limitation

7778
02:32:06,950 --> 02:32:06,960
that's not a problem the main limitation
 

7779
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:08,570
that's not a problem the main limitation
is if you don't do a close guard a lot

7780
02:32:08,570 --> 02:32:08,580
is if you don't do a close guard a lot
 

7781
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:12,349
is if you don't do a close guard a lot
that you don't quite

7782
02:32:12,349 --> 02:32:12,359
that you don't quite
 

7783
02:32:12,359 --> 02:32:14,870
that you don't quite
you don't get a full complete picture of

7784
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:14,880
you don't get a full complete picture of
 

7785
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:16,550
you don't get a full complete picture of
understanding how to attack close guard

7786
02:32:16,550 --> 02:32:16,560
understanding how to attack close guard
 

7787
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:18,170
understanding how to attack close guard
when somebody puts you into a close

7788
02:32:18,170 --> 02:32:18,180
when somebody puts you into a close
 

7789
02:32:18,180 --> 02:32:20,270
when somebody puts you into a close
guard when you're on top so it's nice to

7790
02:32:20,270 --> 02:32:20,280
guard when you're on top so it's nice to
 

7791
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:21,590
guard when you're on top so it's nice to
know both sides if it's just understand

7792
02:32:21,590 --> 02:32:21,600
know both sides if it's just understand
 

7793
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:24,889
know both sides if it's just understand
yeah but you can have a pretty good

7794
02:32:24,889 --> 02:32:24,899
yeah but you can have a pretty good
 

7795
02:32:24,899 --> 02:32:26,809
yeah but you can have a pretty good
understanding of how to defend from the

7796
02:32:26,809 --> 02:32:26,819
understanding of how to defend from the
 

7797
02:32:26,819 --> 02:32:29,210
understanding of how to defend from the
top and not having any bottom I mean

7798
02:32:29,210 --> 02:32:29,220
top and not having any bottom I mean
 

7799
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:30,770
top and not having any bottom I mean
some of it is also just like the length

7800
02:32:30,770 --> 02:32:30,780
some of it is also just like the length
 

7801
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:32,929
some of it is also just like the length
of legs and just the the geometry of

7802
02:32:32,929 --> 02:32:32,939
of legs and just the the geometry of
 

7803
02:32:32,939 --> 02:32:34,190
of legs and just the the geometry of
your body

7804
02:32:34,190 --> 02:32:34,200
your body

uh Nick I'm sure Marcelo Garcia is a

7806
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:36,720
uh Nick I'm sure Marcelo Garcia is a
 

7807
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:38,270
uh Nick I'm sure Marcelo Garcia is a
good close guard but I don't I've never

7808
02:32:38,270 --> 02:32:38,280
good close guard but I don't I've never
 

7809
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:40,490
good close guard but I don't I've never
seen that that's exactly that's the

7810
02:32:40,490 --> 02:32:40,500
seen that that's exactly that's the
 

7811
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:42,849
seen that that's exactly that's the
point

7812
02:32:42,849 --> 02:32:42,859

 

7813
02:32:42,859 --> 02:32:46,969

in theory Theory you can imagine it but

7814
02:32:46,969 --> 02:32:46,979
in theory Theory you can imagine it but
 

7815
02:32:46,979 --> 02:32:48,410
in theory Theory you can imagine it but
like for a hobbyist I think it's

7816
02:32:48,410 --> 02:32:48,420
like for a hobbyist I think it's
 

7817
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:50,809
like for a hobbyist I think it's
interesting to think of that like

7818
02:32:50,809 --> 02:32:50,819
interesting to think of that like
 

7819
02:32:50,819 --> 02:32:55,130
interesting to think of that like
is it possible to

7820
02:32:55,130 --> 02:32:55,140

 

7821
02:32:55,140 --> 02:32:58,309

is it possible to focus on a small set

7822
02:32:58,309 --> 02:32:58,319
is it possible to focus on a small set
 

7823
02:32:58,319 --> 02:33:00,950
is it possible to focus on a small set
of techniques that help you to develop

7824
02:33:00,950 --> 02:33:00,960
of techniques that help you to develop
 

7825
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:03,710
of techniques that help you to develop
of course still into a good job yeah of

7852
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:35,280
brainwash yeah good I I felt it's too
 

7853
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:37,309
brainwash yeah good I I felt it's too
easy to stall

7854
02:33:37,309 --> 02:33:37,319
easy to stall
 

7855

uh versus attack

7856
02:33:39,650 --> 02:33:39,660
uh versus attack
 

7857
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:42,349
uh versus attack
that that was my main concern is like I

7858

that that was my main concern is like I
 

7859

that that was my main concern is like I
want to be forced in every way to

want to be forced in every way to
 

7861
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:47,450
want to be forced in every way to
um to always be attacking to always be

02:33:52,969 --> 02:33:52,979
I got really good I've seen it happen
 

7867
02:33:52,979 --> 02:33:55,370
I got really good I've seen it happen
with half guard too it's like when

7868
02:33:55,370 --> 02:33:55,380
with half guard too it's like when
 

7869
02:33:55,380 --> 02:33:56,929
with half guard too it's like when
people get really good at half guard it

7870
02:33:56,929 --> 02:33:56,939
people get really good at half guard it
 

7871
02:33:56,939 --> 02:33:59,210
people get really good at half guard it
just feels stully if you just look at

7872
02:33:59,210 --> 02:33:59,220
just feels stully if you just look at
 

7873
02:33:59,220 --> 02:34:02,030
just feels stully if you just look at
this at the matches and so on it's you

7874
02:34:02,030 --> 02:34:02,040
this at the matches and so on it's you
 

7875
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:03,830
this at the matches and so on it's you
just slow things down to a thing that's

7876
02:34:03,830 --> 02:34:03,840
just slow things down to a thing that's
 

7877
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:05,090
just slow things down to a thing that's
not

7878
02:34:05,090 --> 02:34:05,100
not
 

7879
02:34:05,100 --> 02:34:07,309
not
you don't get reps on learning you don't

7880
02:34:07,309 --> 02:34:07,319
you don't get reps on learning you don't
 

7881
02:34:07,319 --> 02:34:11,210
you don't get reps on learning you don't
get action in interesting ways so that

7882
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:11,220
get action in interesting ways so that
 

7883
02:34:11,220 --> 02:34:13,429
get action in interesting ways so that
was my worry that I'll get old and fat

7884
02:34:13,429 --> 02:34:13,439
was my worry that I'll get old and fat
 

7885
02:34:13,439 --> 02:34:16,690
was my worry that I'll get old and fat
and just sit in close guard all day

7886
02:34:16,690 --> 02:34:16,700
and just sit in close guard all day
 

7887
02:34:16,700 --> 02:34:19,309
and just sit in close guard all day
holding on to the white belts trying to

holding on to the white belts trying to
 

7889
02:34:19,319 --> 02:34:21,050
holding on to the white belts trying to
kill me because it's also I mean that's

7890
02:34:21,050 --> 02:34:21,060
kill me because it's also I mean that's
 

7891
02:34:21,060 --> 02:34:22,550
kill me because it's also I mean that's
the other thing for hobbyists and for

7892
02:34:22,550 --> 02:34:22,560
the other thing for hobbyists and for
 

7893
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:23,630
the other thing for hobbyists and for
everyone

7894
02:34:23,630 --> 02:34:23,640
everyone
 

7895
02:34:23,640 --> 02:34:27,590
everyone
is to like when you first start I think

7896
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:27,600
is to like when you first start I think
 

7897
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:29,690
is to like when you first start I think
you have to relax

7898
02:34:29,690 --> 02:34:29,700
you have to relax
 

7899
02:34:29,700 --> 02:34:31,550
you have to relax
in the face of the fact that you're just

7900
02:34:31,550 --> 02:34:31,560
in the face of the fact that you're just
 

7901
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:33,770
in the face of the fact that you're just
getting your ass kicked non-stop yeah

7902
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:33,780
getting your ass kicked non-stop yeah
 

7903
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:35,510
getting your ass kicked non-stop yeah
that can also be really tough on the ego

7904
02:34:35,510 --> 02:34:35,520
that can also be really tough on the ego
 

7905
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:37,190
that can also be really tough on the ego
I think the probably the right way to

7906
02:34:37,190 --> 02:34:37,200
I think the probably the right way to
 

7907
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:39,410
I think the probably the right way to
see that is you're growing as a person

7908
02:34:39,410 --> 02:34:39,420
see that is you're growing as a person
 

7909
02:34:39,420 --> 02:34:42,830
see that is you're growing as a person
you see that clearly when they are like

7910
02:34:42,830 --> 02:34:42,840
you see that clearly when they are like
 

7911
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:44,630
you see that clearly when they are like
in a bad position let's say side mount

like no it's a out and go until I have

7928
02:35:03,830 --> 02:35:03,840
like no it's a out and go until I have
 

7929

what's the role of drilling

7936
02:35:13,990 --> 02:35:14,000
what's the role of drilling
 

7937
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,090
what's the role of drilling
did you do you like drilling I do not

7938
02:35:17,090 --> 02:35:17,100
did you do you like drilling I do not
 

7939
02:35:17,100 --> 02:35:19,910
did you do you like drilling I do not
like drilling but I'll tell you why

7940
02:35:19,910 --> 02:35:19,920
like drilling but I'll tell you why
 

7941
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:23,170
like drilling but I'll tell you why
I think

7942
02:35:23,170 --> 02:35:23,180

 

7943
02:35:23,180 --> 02:35:26,889

fighting its mechanic right so it's it's

7944
02:35:26,889 --> 02:35:26,899
fighting its mechanic right so it's it's
 

7945
02:35:26,899 --> 02:35:30,050
fighting its mechanic right so it's it's
very important to drill a move until you

7946
02:35:30,050 --> 02:35:30,060
very important to drill a move until you
 

7947
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:31,790
very important to drill a move until you
learn the mechanic of course it's

7948
02:35:31,790 --> 02:35:31,800
learn the mechanic of course it's
 

7949
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:34,370
learn the mechanic of course it's
important if someone want to teach you

7950
02:35:34,370 --> 02:35:34,380
important if someone want to teach you
 

7951

you want to practice that movement until
 

7955
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:39,590
you want to practice that movement until
you learn the mechanic of it but the

7956
02:35:39,590 --> 02:35:39,600
you learn the mechanic of it but the
 

7957
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:41,389
you learn the mechanic of it but the
guy's not resisting so it's easy to

7958
02:35:41,389 --> 02:35:41,399
guy's not resisting so it's easy to
 

7959
02:35:41,399 --> 02:35:43,370
guy's not resisting so it's easy to
apply it right

7960
02:35:43,370 --> 02:35:43,380
apply it right
 

7961
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:46,550
apply it right
so you apply as many times as you have

7962
02:35:46,550 --> 02:35:46,560
so you apply as many times as you have
 

7963
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:48,950
so you apply as many times as you have
to until you know the mechanic of the

7964
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:48,960
to until you know the mechanic of the
 

7965
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:50,750
to until you know the mechanic of the
moves until you can apply the mechanics

7966
02:35:50,750 --> 02:35:50,760
moves until you can apply the mechanics
 

7967
02:35:50,760 --> 02:35:53,030
moves until you can apply the mechanics
the moment that you know how to apply it

7968
02:35:53,030 --> 02:35:53,040
the moment that you know how to apply it
 

7969
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:55,250
the moment that you know how to apply it
there's no more pointing drilling now

7970
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:55,260
there's no more pointing drilling now
 

7971
02:35:55,260 --> 02:35:57,469
there's no more pointing drilling now
you have to practice now we have to

7972
02:35:57,469 --> 02:35:57,479
you have to practice now we have to
 

7973
02:35:57,479 --> 02:35:59,870
you have to practice now we have to
practice with resistance of course

7974
02:35:59,870 --> 02:35:59,880
practice with resistance of course
 

7975
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:01,550
practice with resistance of course
you're not going to practice with the

7976
02:36:01,550 --> 02:36:01,560
you're not going to practice with the
 

7977
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:03,590
you're not going to practice with the
guy fully resisting the guys better than

7978
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:03,600
guy fully resisting the guys better than
 

7979
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:04,730
guy fully resisting the guys better than
you because he's not going to give you a

7980
02:36:04,730 --> 02:36:04,740
you because he's not going to give you a
 

7981
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:06,469
you because he's not going to give you a
chance to practice that move but you

7982
02:36:06,469 --> 02:36:06,479
chance to practice that move but you
 

7983
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:08,809
chance to practice that move but you
have to practice with resistance so

7984
02:36:08,809 --> 02:36:08,819
have to practice with resistance so
 

7985
02:36:08,819 --> 02:36:11,030
have to practice with resistance so
where does drilling comes

7986
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:11,040
where does drilling comes
 

7987
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:14,809
where does drilling comes
on that is most of people you know they

7988
02:36:14,809 --> 02:36:14,819
on that is most of people you know they
 

7989
02:36:14,819 --> 02:36:16,849
on that is most of people you know they
they flow drill and everything nothing

7990
02:36:16,849 --> 02:36:16,859
they flow drill and everything nothing
 

7991
02:36:16,859 --> 02:36:19,730
they flow drill and everything nothing
whatever you do you condition in your

7992
02:36:19,730 --> 02:36:19,740
whatever you do you condition in your
 

7993
02:36:19,740 --> 02:36:21,530
whatever you do you condition in your
body to do something

7994
02:36:21,530 --> 02:36:21,540
body to do something
 

7995
02:36:21,540 --> 02:36:23,510
body to do something
is there you know you do you repeat the

7996
02:36:23,510 --> 02:36:23,520
is there you know you do you repeat the
 

7997
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:25,190
is there you know you do you repeat the
same move over over and over again your

7998
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:25,200
same move over over and over again your
 

7999
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:26,690
same move over over and over again your
body's conditioning to apply that

8000
02:36:26,690 --> 02:36:26,700
body's conditioning to apply that
 

8001
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:28,730
body's conditioning to apply that
movement or the technique

8002
02:36:28,730 --> 02:36:28,740
movement or the technique
 

8003
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:31,130
movement or the technique
drilling is not realistic because the

8004
02:36:31,130 --> 02:36:31,140
drilling is not realistic because the
 

8005
02:36:31,140 --> 02:36:33,290
drilling is not realistic because the
other person is not resisting you know

8006
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:33,300
other person is not resisting you know
 

8007
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:35,450
other person is not resisting you know
the flow movement or whatever after you

8008
02:36:35,450 --> 02:36:35,460
the flow movement or whatever after you
 

8009
02:36:35,460 --> 02:36:37,969
the flow movement or whatever after you
go beyond when you already know that the

8010
02:36:37,969 --> 02:36:37,979
go beyond when you already know that the
 

8011
02:36:37,979 --> 02:36:39,590
go beyond when you already know that the
the mechanics

8012
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:39,600
the mechanics
 

8013
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:42,230
the mechanics
the drilling with no resistance is not

8014
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:42,240
the drilling with no resistance is not
 

8015
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:44,030
the drilling with no resistance is not
going to teach you anything because you

8016
02:36:44,030 --> 02:36:44,040
going to teach you anything because you
 

8017
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:46,130
going to teach you anything because you
will never know if how to apply the

8018
02:36:46,130 --> 02:36:46,140
will never know if how to apply the
 

8019
02:36:46,140 --> 02:36:48,050
will never know if how to apply the
movement with resistance so it's

8020
02:36:48,050 --> 02:36:48,060
movement with resistance so it's
 

8021
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:50,690
movement with resistance so it's
pointless to carry on drilling after you

8022
02:36:50,690 --> 02:36:50,700
pointless to carry on drilling after you
 

8023
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:53,690
pointless to carry on drilling after you
learn the mechanics yeah see but you're

8024
02:36:53,690 --> 02:36:53,700
learn the mechanics yeah see but you're
 

8025
02:36:53,700 --> 02:36:56,150
learn the mechanics yeah see but you're
making it sound easy to learn the

8026
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:56,160
making it sound easy to learn the
 

8027
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:58,670
making it sound easy to learn the
mechanics I would argue

8028
02:36:58,670 --> 02:36:58,680
mechanics I would argue
 

8029
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:01,030
mechanics I would argue
you can drill as many times I'm not

8030
02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:01,040
you can drill as many times I'm not
 

8031
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:04,190
you can drill as many times I'm not
limiting how much you drill yes you

8032
02:37:04,190 --> 02:37:04,200
limiting how much you drill yes you
 

8033
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:06,770
limiting how much you drill yes you
drill as much as long as you had to

8034
02:37:06,770 --> 02:37:06,780
drill as much as long as you had to
 

8035
02:37:06,780 --> 02:37:08,750
drill as much as long as you had to
I mean it doesn't matter how long the

8036
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:08,760
I mean it doesn't matter how long the
 

8037
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:10,490
I mean it doesn't matter how long the
benefit of drilling and I'm just playing

8038
02:37:10,490 --> 02:37:10,500
benefit of drilling and I'm just playing
 

8039
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:12,889
benefit of drilling and I'm just playing
Devil's Advocate with you the benefit of

8040
02:37:12,889 --> 02:37:12,899
Devil's Advocate with you the benefit of
 

8041
02:37:12,899 --> 02:37:14,870
Devil's Advocate with you the benefit of
drilling is that you can more

8042
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:14,880
drilling is that you can more
 

8043
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,670
drilling is that you can more
efficiently get a higher number of reps

8044
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:16,680
efficiently get a higher number of reps
 

8045
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:17,929
efficiently get a higher number of reps
in

8046
02:37:17,929 --> 02:37:17,939
in
 

8047
02:37:17,939 --> 02:37:19,910
in
so

8048
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:19,920
so
 

8049
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:21,550
so
what are you gonna gain with those reps

8050
02:37:21,550 --> 02:37:21,560
what are you gonna gain with those reps
 

8051
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:23,330
what are you gonna gain with those reps
understanding the mechanics of the

8052
02:37:23,330 --> 02:37:23,340
understanding the mechanics of the
 

8053
02:37:23,340 --> 02:37:25,730
understanding the mechanics of the
movement and what I would like to argue

8054
02:37:25,730 --> 02:37:25,740
movement and what I would like to argue
 

8055
02:37:25,740 --> 02:37:27,469
movement and what I would like to argue
is you don't necessarily need the

8056
02:37:27,469 --> 02:37:27,479
is you don't necessarily need the
 

8057
02:37:27,479 --> 02:37:28,849
is you don't necessarily need the
resistance to deeply understand the

8058
02:37:28,849 --> 02:37:28,859
resistance to deeply understand the
 

8059
02:37:28,859 --> 02:37:32,950
resistance to deeply understand the
mechanics of something now

8060
02:37:32,950 --> 02:37:32,960

 

8061
02:37:32,960 --> 02:37:35,150

there's some moves

8062
02:37:35,150 --> 02:37:35,160
there's some moves
 

8063
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:38,750
there's some moves
like I bet you you could drill your way

8064
02:37:38,750 --> 02:37:38,760
like I bet you you could drill your way
 

8065
02:37:38,760 --> 02:37:41,870
like I bet you you could drill your way
to an incredible mount

8066
02:37:41,870 --> 02:37:41,880
to an incredible mount
 

8067
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:44,870
to an incredible mount
like mile is a good example of that you

8068
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:44,880
like mile is a good example of that you
 

8069
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:47,030
like mile is a good example of that you
don't really need a result

8070
02:37:47,030 --> 02:37:47,040
don't really need a result
 

8071
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:49,250
don't really need a result
I can imagine a world in which the

8072
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:49,260
I can imagine a world in which the
 

8073
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:51,830
I can imagine a world in which the
resisting opponent is not essential for

8074
02:37:51,830 --> 02:37:51,840
resisting opponent is not essential for
 

8075
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:54,410
resisting opponent is not essential for
developing some of the very fine details

8076
02:37:54,410 --> 02:37:54,420
developing some of the very fine details
 

8077
02:37:54,420 --> 02:37:57,110
developing some of the very fine details
of the mechanics which one I don't know

8078
02:37:57,110 --> 02:37:57,120
of the mechanics which one I don't know
 

8079
02:37:57,120 --> 02:38:00,469
of the mechanics which one I don't know
any what you say amount yes

8080
02:38:00,469 --> 02:38:00,479
any what you say amount yes
 

8081
02:38:00,479 --> 02:38:03,830
any what you say amount yes
why what are you gonna achieve by resist

8082
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:03,840
why what are you gonna achieve by resist
 

8083
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:06,170
why what are you gonna achieve by resist
by drilling with no resistance after you

8084
02:38:06,170 --> 02:38:06,180
by drilling with no resistance after you
 

8085
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:08,690
by drilling with no resistance after you
learn the mechanics what I'm trying to

8086
02:38:08,690 --> 02:38:08,700
learn the mechanics what I'm trying to
 

8087
02:38:08,700 --> 02:38:10,190
learn the mechanics what I'm trying to
tell you the learning the mechanics

8088
02:38:10,190 --> 02:38:10,200
tell you the learning the mechanics
 

8089
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:11,630
tell you the learning the mechanics
isn't a thing where you get a

8090
02:38:11,630 --> 02:38:11,640
isn't a thing where you get a
 

8091
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:13,309
isn't a thing where you get a
certificate and you're done you're going

8092
02:38:13,309 --> 02:38:13,319
certificate and you're done you're going
 

8093
02:38:13,319 --> 02:38:15,770
certificate and you're done you're going
to learn the fine details of the way you

8094
02:38:15,770 --> 02:38:15,780
to learn the fine details of the way you
 

8095
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:17,690
to learn the fine details of the way you
redistribute your weight you're going to

8096
02:38:17,690 --> 02:38:17,700
redistribute your weight you're going to
 

8097
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:19,370
redistribute your weight you're going to
learn how to move your I don't

8098
02:38:19,370 --> 02:38:19,380
learn how to move your I don't
 

8099
02:38:19,380 --> 02:38:21,950
learn how to move your I don't
understand like inside a dead body what

8100
02:38:21,950 --> 02:38:21,960
understand like inside a dead body what
 

8101
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:24,050
understand like inside a dead body what
yeah like everything you do is a slow

8102
02:38:24,050 --> 02:38:24,060
yeah like everything you do is a slow
 

8103
02:38:24,060 --> 02:38:26,290
yeah like everything you do is a slow
process and timing

8104
02:38:26,290 --> 02:38:26,300
process and timing
 

8105
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:29,570
process and timing
you have to understand moving okay it's

8106
02:38:29,570 --> 02:38:29,580
you have to understand moving okay it's
 

8107
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:32,150
you have to understand moving okay it's
the guys resistant like he's not I'm not

8108
02:38:32,150 --> 02:38:32,160
the guys resistant like he's not I'm not
 

8109
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:34,490
the guys resistant like he's not I'm not
gonna grab you and apply the movement I

8110
02:38:34,490 --> 02:38:34,500
gonna grab you and apply the movement I
 

8111
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:36,830
gonna grab you and apply the movement I
need to grab you and feel when is the

8112
02:38:36,830 --> 02:38:36,840
need to grab you and feel when is the
 

8113
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:38,150
need to grab you and feel when is the
right time to do

8114
02:38:38,150 --> 02:38:38,160
right time to do
 

8115
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:40,610
right time to do
like that that it only comes when you

8116
02:38:40,610 --> 02:38:40,620
like that that it only comes when you
 

8117
02:38:40,620 --> 02:38:42,650
like that that it only comes when you
with movement if you're not fully

8118
02:38:42,650 --> 02:38:42,660
with movement if you're not fully
 

8119
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:44,210
with movement if you're not fully
resistant

8120
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:44,220
resistant
 

8121
02:38:44,220 --> 02:38:45,950
resistant
how would I know

8122
02:38:45,950 --> 02:38:45,960
how would I know
 

8123
02:38:45,960 --> 02:38:49,250
how would I know
you could infer through it it's like a

8124
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:49,260
you could infer through it it's like a
 

8125
02:38:49,260 --> 02:38:54,550
you could infer through it it's like a
with no movement with no resistance

8126
02:38:54,550 --> 02:38:54,560

 

8127
02:38:54,560 --> 02:38:57,110

okay okay let's say you've been drilling

8128
02:38:57,110 --> 02:38:57,120
okay okay let's say you've been drilling
 

8129
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:58,550
okay okay let's say you've been drilling
for a week yeah

8130
02:38:58,550 --> 02:38:58,560
for a week yeah
 

8131
02:38:58,560 --> 02:39:01,070
for a week yeah
five hours a day you should be an expert

8132
02:39:01,070 --> 02:39:01,080
five hours a day you should be an expert
 

8133
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:02,929
five hours a day you should be an expert
with the mechanics

8134
02:39:02,929 --> 02:39:02,939
with the mechanics
 

8135
02:39:02,939 --> 02:39:04,490
with the mechanics
but now

8136
02:39:04,490 --> 02:39:04,500
but now
 

8137
02:39:04,500 --> 02:39:06,110
but now
how are you going to carry on with

8138
02:39:06,110 --> 02:39:06,120
how are you going to carry on with
 

8139
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:07,429
how are you going to carry on with
really

8140
02:39:07,429 --> 02:39:07,439
really
 

8141
02:39:07,439 --> 02:39:09,950
really
no resistance no you have exactly yes

8142
02:39:09,950 --> 02:39:09,960
no resistance no you have exactly yes
 

8143
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:12,590
no resistance no you have exactly yes
after that week drilling five times five

8144
02:39:12,590 --> 02:39:12,600
after that week drilling five times five
 

8145
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:15,469
after that week drilling five times five
hours a day the the arm lock you still

8146
02:39:15,469 --> 02:39:15,479
hours a day the the arm lock you still
 

8147
02:39:15,479 --> 02:39:17,450
hours a day the the arm lock you still
have no clue how to apply the arm lock

8148
02:39:17,450 --> 02:39:17,460
have no clue how to apply the arm lock
 

8149
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:20,030
have no clue how to apply the arm lock
against a resistant opponent no clue

8150
02:39:20,030 --> 02:39:20,040
against a resistant opponent no clue
 

8151
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:21,770
against a resistant opponent no clue
zero yeah so you don't know the movement

8152
02:39:21,770 --> 02:39:21,780
zero yeah so you don't know the movement
 

8153
02:39:21,780 --> 02:39:25,250
zero yeah so you don't know the movement
you know the mechanic which is you know

8154
02:39:25,250 --> 02:39:25,260
you know the mechanic which is you know
 

8155
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:27,170
you know the mechanic which is you know
it's like how long you have to drill and

8156
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:27,180
it's like how long you have to drill and
 

8157
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:29,630
it's like how long you have to drill and
how that doesn't matter it's the various

8158
02:39:29,630 --> 02:39:29,640
how that doesn't matter it's the various
 

8159
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:31,490
how that doesn't matter it's the various
of the person you can do for a month

8160
02:39:31,490 --> 02:39:31,500
of the person you can do for a month
 

8161
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:34,309
of the person you can do for a month
after that month is over you should

8162
02:39:34,309 --> 02:39:34,319
after that month is over you should
 

8163
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:36,650
after that month is over you should
understand how the mechanic works you

8164
02:39:36,650 --> 02:39:36,660
understand how the mechanic works you
 

8165
02:39:36,660 --> 02:39:38,150
understand how the mechanic works you
still have no clue how to apply the

8166
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:38,160
still have no clue how to apply the
 

8167
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:39,830
still have no clue how to apply the
movement against a resistant opponent

8168
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:39,840
movement against a resistant opponent
 

8169
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:42,889
movement against a resistant opponent
you will never ever know how until you

8170
02:39:42,889 --> 02:39:42,899
you will never ever know how until you
 

8171
02:39:42,899 --> 02:39:44,690
you will never ever know how until you
apply with a fully resistant opponent

8172
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:44,700
apply with a fully resistant opponent
 

8173
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:47,630
apply with a fully resistant opponent
yeah that's the the only way to know

8174
02:39:47,630 --> 02:39:47,640
yeah that's the the only way to know
 

8175
02:39:47,640 --> 02:39:50,750
yeah that's the the only way to know
to to really learn the movement yes well

8176
02:39:50,750 --> 02:39:50,760
to to really learn the movement yes well
 

8177
02:39:50,760 --> 02:39:54,469
to to really learn the movement yes well
put but the question is can you have a

8178
02:39:54,469 --> 02:39:54,479
put but the question is can you have a
 

8179
02:39:54,479 --> 02:39:55,790
put but the question is can you have a
small percentage of time when you go

8180
02:39:55,790 --> 02:39:55,800
small percentage of time when you go
 

8181
02:39:55,800 --> 02:39:57,650
small percentage of time when you go
against the resisting opponent to get

8182
02:39:57,650 --> 02:39:57,660
against the resisting opponent to get
 

8183
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:59,270
against the resisting opponent to get
the wisdom and the Insight of what it

8184
02:39:59,270 --> 02:39:59,280
the wisdom and the Insight of what it
 

8185
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,190
the wisdom and the Insight of what it
takes to perform that movement and you

8186
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:01,200
takes to perform that movement and you
 

8187
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:03,170
takes to perform that movement and you
spend the large percentage of other time

8188
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:03,180
spend the large percentage of other time
 

8189
02:40:03,180 --> 02:40:06,290
spend the large percentage of other time
just practicing the mechanics of it so

8190
02:40:06,290 --> 02:40:06,300
just practicing the mechanics of it so
 

8191
02:40:06,300 --> 02:40:08,990
just practicing the mechanics of it so
like uh

8192
02:40:08,990 --> 02:40:09,000

 

8193
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,450

do you need to as you get better and

8194
02:40:11,450 --> 02:40:11,460
do you need to as you get better and
 

8195
02:40:11,460 --> 02:40:13,910
do you need to as you get better and
better at technique to basically drift

8196
02:40:13,910 --> 02:40:13,920
better at technique to basically drift
 

8197
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:15,830
better at technique to basically drift
away completely from Drilling and more

8198
02:40:15,830 --> 02:40:15,840
away completely from Drilling and more
 

8199
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:19,550
away completely from Drilling and more
into the the sparring I I'd like to I

8200
02:40:19,550 --> 02:40:19,560
into the the sparring I I'd like to I
 

8201
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:21,710
into the the sparring I I'd like to I
just you're like really no I don't like

8202
02:40:21,710 --> 02:40:21,720
just you're like really no I don't like
 

8203
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:23,690
just you're like really no I don't like
drilling I see I well yes I like

8204
02:40:23,690 --> 02:40:23,700
drilling I see I well yes I like
 

8205
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:25,910
drilling I see I well yes I like
drilling I would say uh but I just see

8206
02:40:25,910 --> 02:40:25,920
drilling I would say uh but I just see
 

8207
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:27,650
drilling I would say uh but I just see
it always bothered me in the Jiu Jitsu

8208
02:40:27,650 --> 02:40:27,660
it always bothered me in the Jiu Jitsu
 

8209
02:40:27,660 --> 02:40:30,230
it always bothered me in the Jiu Jitsu
Community how a few people really saw

8210
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:30,240
Community how a few people really saw
 

8211
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:31,670
Community how a few people really saw
the value of drawing I see no wrestling

8212
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:31,680
the value of drawing I see no wrestling
 

8213
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:33,530
the value of drawing I see no wrestling
especially in the in the Russian style

8214
02:40:33,530 --> 02:40:33,540
especially in the in the Russian style
 

8215
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:35,630
especially in the in the Russian style
of wrestling like the value of drilling

8216
02:40:35,630 --> 02:40:35,640
of wrestling like the value of drilling
 

8217
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:38,030
of wrestling like the value of drilling
I don't necessarily mean that it's like

8218
02:40:38,030 --> 02:40:38,040
I don't necessarily mean that it's like
 

8219
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:39,770
I don't necessarily mean that it's like
a dead body or like a dummy or something

8220
02:40:39,770 --> 02:40:39,780
a dead body or like a dummy or something
 

8221
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:42,110
a dead body or like a dummy or something
like that but just getting the Reps in

8222
02:40:42,110 --> 02:40:42,120
like that but just getting the Reps in
 

8223
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:44,389
like that but just getting the Reps in
really focusing on the high amount of

8224
02:40:44,389 --> 02:40:44,399
really focusing on the high amount of
 

8225
02:40:44,399 --> 02:40:45,550
really focusing on the high amount of
reps

8226
02:40:45,550 --> 02:40:45,560
reps
 

8227
02:40:45,560 --> 02:40:49,730
reps
agreed in wrestling in Judo I agree that

8228
02:40:49,730 --> 02:40:49,740
agreed in wrestling in Judo I agree that
 

8229
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:51,469
agreed in wrestling in Judo I agree that
drilling is very important initial drill

8230
02:40:51,469 --> 02:40:51,479
drilling is very important initial drill
 

8231
02:40:51,479 --> 02:40:53,510
drilling is very important initial drill
a thousand times each move yeah Judo is

8232
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:53,520
a thousand times each move yeah Judo is
 

8233
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:54,830
a thousand times each move yeah Judo is
a really big one for that too it is

8234
02:40:54,830 --> 02:40:54,840
a really big one for that too it is
 

8235
02:40:54,840 --> 02:40:56,270
a really big one for that too it is
because

8236
02:40:56,270 --> 02:40:56,280
because
 

8237
02:40:56,280 --> 02:41:00,230
because
is is is the movement the the timing you

8238
02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:00,240
is is is the movement the the timing you
 

8239
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:02,210
is is is the movement the the timing you
know is the Precision of the movement

8240
02:41:02,210 --> 02:41:02,220
know is the Precision of the movement
 

8241
02:41:02,220 --> 02:41:05,030
know is the Precision of the movement
yeah it has to be perfectly because this

8242
02:41:05,030 --> 02:41:05,040
yeah it has to be perfectly because this
 

8243
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:07,490
yeah it has to be perfectly because this
one movement then is you you learn about

8244
02:41:07,490 --> 02:41:07,500
one movement then is you you learn about
 

8245
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:09,230
one movement then is you you learn about
the timing of the movement when you're

8246
02:41:09,230 --> 02:41:09,240
the timing of the movement when you're
 

8247
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:11,090
the timing of the movement when you're
fighting but doing fighting you only

8248
02:41:11,090 --> 02:41:11,100
fighting but doing fighting you only
 

8249
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:13,550
fighting but doing fighting you only
need to know the time because your body

8250
02:41:13,550 --> 02:41:13,560
need to know the time because your body
 

8251
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:15,469
need to know the time because your body
movement is exactly the same when you

8252
02:41:15,469 --> 02:41:15,479
movement is exactly the same when you
 

8253
02:41:15,479 --> 02:41:17,570
movement is exactly the same when you
drill that's really well put yeah the

8254
02:41:17,570 --> 02:41:17,580
drill that's really well put yeah the
 

8255
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:19,309
drill that's really well put yeah the
mechanics is much more important there

8256
02:41:19,309 --> 02:41:19,319
mechanics is much more important there
 

8257
02:41:19,319 --> 02:41:21,050
mechanics is much more important there
yeah but it's completely different for

8258
02:41:21,050 --> 02:41:21,060
yeah but it's completely different for
 

8259
02:41:21,060 --> 02:41:23,809
yeah but it's completely different for
jiu jitsu because let's say from Jujutsu

8260
02:41:23,809 --> 02:41:23,819
jiu jitsu because let's say from Jujutsu
 

8261
02:41:23,819 --> 02:41:26,870
jiu jitsu because let's say from Jujutsu
like the arm lock for example we use

8262
02:41:26,870 --> 02:41:26,880
like the arm lock for example we use
 

8263
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:28,370
like the arm lock for example we use
that as an example let's see from the

8264
02:41:28,370 --> 02:41:28,380
that as an example let's see from the
 

8265
02:41:28,380 --> 02:41:30,950
that as an example let's see from the
closed card even my closed card before I

8266
02:41:30,950 --> 02:41:30,960
closed card even my closed card before I
 

8267
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:32,750
closed card even my closed card before I
go for the arm lock I need to have set

8268
02:41:32,750 --> 02:41:32,760
go for the arm lock I need to have set
 

8269
02:41:32,760 --> 02:41:34,849
go for the arm lock I need to have set
of grips let's see I have your call in

8270
02:41:34,849 --> 02:41:34,859
of grips let's see I have your call in
 

8271
02:41:34,859 --> 02:41:37,610

fire in their eyes and not for the money

8842
02:52:51,530 --> 02:52:51,540
fire in their eyes and not for the money
 

8843
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:53,030
fire in their eyes and not for the money
obviously but to do something really

8844
02:52:53,030 --> 02:52:53,040
obviously but to do something really
 

8845
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:55,790
obviously but to do something really
impactful and I think that fire is

8846
02:52:55,790 --> 02:52:55,800
impactful and I think that fire is
 

8847
02:52:55,800 --> 02:52:58,610
impactful and I think that fire is
extinguished Often by teachers and and

8848
02:52:58,610 --> 02:52:58,620
extinguished Often by teachers and and
 

8849
02:52:58,620 --> 02:53:01,849
extinguished Often by teachers and and
uh parents because I think the logic

8850
02:53:01,849 --> 02:53:01,859
uh parents because I think the logic
 

8851
02:53:01,859 --> 02:53:03,650
uh parents because I think the logic
that parents have

8852
02:53:03,650 --> 02:53:03,660
that parents have
 

8853
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:06,590
that parents have
and teachers they look at a kid

8854
02:53:06,590 --> 02:53:06,600
and teachers they look at a kid
 

8855
02:53:06,600 --> 02:53:09,769
and teachers they look at a kid
and they don't on the surface level they

8856
02:53:09,769 --> 02:53:09,779
and they don't on the surface level they
 

8857
02:53:09,779 --> 02:53:11,450
and they don't on the surface level they
don't see greatness

8858
02:53:11,450 --> 02:53:11,460
don't see greatness
 

8859
02:53:11,460 --> 02:53:14,809
don't see greatness
right they just see kind of mediocrity

8860
02:53:14,809 --> 02:53:14,819
right they just see kind of mediocrity
 

8861
02:53:14,819 --> 02:53:17,570
right they just see kind of mediocrity
and so to them it's like no right the

8862
02:53:17,570 --> 02:53:17,580
and so to them it's like no right the
 

8863
02:53:17,580 --> 02:53:19,250
and so to them it's like no right the
world is more complicated than that in

8864
02:53:19,250 --> 02:53:19,260
world is more complicated than that in
 

8865
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:21,710
world is more complicated than that in
order to get great you have to like like

8866
02:53:21,710 --> 02:53:21,720
order to get great you have to like like
 

8867
02:53:21,720 --> 02:53:24,290
order to get great you have to like like

8869
02:53:24,300 --> 02:53:26,570
