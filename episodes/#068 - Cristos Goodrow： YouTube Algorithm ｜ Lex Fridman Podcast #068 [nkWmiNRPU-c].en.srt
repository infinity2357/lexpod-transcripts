their hours watching YouTube I mean I
 

221
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,320
their hours watching YouTube I mean I
think about the fact that YouTube has

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,330
think about the fact that YouTube has
 

223
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,820
think about the fact that YouTube has
been really great for my kids for

been really great for my kids for
 

225

been really great for my kids for
instance my oldest daughter you know

226
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:39,900
instance my oldest daughter you know
 

227
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,660
instance my oldest daughter you know
she's been watching YouTube for several

228
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:41,670
she's been watching YouTube for several
 

229
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,080
she's been watching YouTube for several
years she watches Tyler Oakley and the

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,090
years she watches Tyler Oakley and the
 

231
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,240
years she watches Tyler Oakley and the
vlogbrothers and I know that it's had a

232
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,250
vlogbrothers and I know that it's had a
 

233
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,910
vlogbrothers and I know that it's had a
very profound and positive impact on her

234
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:49,920
very profound and positive impact on her
 

235
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,070
very profound and positive impact on her
character and my younger daughter she's

a ballerina and her teachers tell her

238
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,210
a ballerina and her teachers tell her
 

239
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,560
a ballerina and her teachers tell her
that YouTube is a huge advantage for her

240
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,570
that YouTube is a huge advantage for her
 

241
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,380
that YouTube is a huge advantage for her
because she can practice a routine and

242
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,390
because she can practice a routine and
 

243
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,620
because she can practice a routine and
watch like professional dancers do that

244
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:03,630
watch like professional dancers do that
 

245
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,570
watch like professional dancers do that
same routine and stop it and back it up

246
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:05,580
same routine and stop it and back it up
 

247
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,500
same routine and stop it and back it up
and rewind and all that stuff right so

248
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:08,510
and rewind and all that stuff right so
 

249
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,030
and rewind and all that stuff right so
it's been really good for them and then

250
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,040
it's been really good for them and then
 

251
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,070
it's been really good for them and then
even my son is a sophomore in college he

252
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,080
even my son is a sophomore in college he
 

253
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,600
even my son is a sophomore in college he
he got through his linear algebra class

254
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:17,610
he got through his linear algebra class
 

255
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,130
he got through his linear algebra class
because of a channel called three blue

256
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:19,140
because of a channel called three blue
 

257
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,760
because of a channel called three blue
one brown which you know helps you

258
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:22,770
one brown which you know helps you
 

259
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,890
one brown which you know helps you
understand linear algebra but in a way

260
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:24,900
understand linear algebra but in a way
 

261
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,140
understand linear algebra but in a way
that would be very hard for anyone to do

262
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,150
that would be very hard for anyone to do
 

263
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,260
that would be very hard for anyone to do
on a whiteboard or a chalkboard and so I

264
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,270
on a whiteboard or a chalkboard and so I
 

265
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,980
on a whiteboard or a chalkboard and so I
think that those experiences from my

266
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:33,990
think that those experiences from my
 

267
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,840
think that those experiences from my
point of view were very good and and so

268
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:35,850
point of view were very good and and so
 

269
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,730
point of view were very good and and so
I can imagine really good trajectories

270
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:37,740
I can imagine really good trajectories
 

271
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,860
I can imagine really good trajectories
through YouTube yes have you looked at

272
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:39,870
through YouTube yes have you looked at
 

273
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,110
through YouTube yes have you looked at
do you think of broadly about that

274
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,120
do you think of broadly about that
 

275
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,240
do you think of broadly about that
trajectory over a period cuz YouTube was

276
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,250
trajectory over a period cuz YouTube was
 

277
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,880
trajectory over a period cuz YouTube was
growing up now so over a period of years

278
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:46,890
growing up now so over a period of years
 

279
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,660
growing up now so over a period of years
you just kind of gave a few anecdotal

280
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:50,670
you just kind of gave a few anecdotal
 

281
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,390
you just kind of gave a few anecdotal
examples but you know I used to watch

282
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:53,400
examples but you know I used to watch
 

283
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,040
examples but you know I used to watch
certain shows on YouTube I don't anymore

284
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,050
certain shows on YouTube I don't anymore
 

285
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,680
certain shows on YouTube I don't anymore
I've moved on to other shows and

286
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,690
I've moved on to other shows and
 

287
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,840
I've moved on to other shows and
ultimately you want people to from

288
00:05:59,840 --> 00:05:59,850
ultimately you want people to from
 

289
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,700
ultimately you want people to from
YouTube's perspective to stay on YouTube

290
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,710
YouTube's perspective to stay on YouTube
 

291
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,940
YouTube's perspective to stay on YouTube
to grow as human beings on YouTube so

292
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:04,950
to grow as human beings on YouTube so
 

293
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,130
to grow as human beings on YouTube so
you have to think not just what makes

294
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,140
you have to think not just what makes
 

295
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,330
you have to think not just what makes
them engage today or this month but also

296
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,340
them engage today or this month but also
 

297
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,610
them engage today or this month but also
over a period of years absolutely that's

298
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:13,620
over a period of years absolutely that's
 

299
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,290
over a period of years absolutely that's
right I mean if YouTube is going to

300
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,300
right I mean if YouTube is going to
 

301
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,280
right I mean if YouTube is going to
continue to enrich people's lives then

302
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,290
continue to enrich people's lives then
 

303
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,810
continue to enrich people's lives then
you know then it has to grow with them

304
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:20,820
you know then it has to grow with them
 

305
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,830
you know then it has to grow with them
and and people's interests change over

306
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:24,840
and and people's interests change over
 

307
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,400
and and people's interests change over
time and so I think we've we've been

308
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:28,410
time and so I think we've we've been
 

309
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,070
time and so I think we've we've been
working on this problem and I'll just

310
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,080
working on this problem and I'll just
 

311
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,590
working on this problem and I'll just
say it broadly is like how to introduce

312
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
say it broadly is like how to introduce
 

313
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,250
say it broadly is like how to introduce
diversity and introduce people who are

314
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,260
diversity and introduce people who are
 

315
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,960
diversity and introduce people who are
watching one thing to something else

316
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:38,970
watching one thing to something else
 

317
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,950
watching one thing to something else
they might like

318
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:39,960
they might like
 

319
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,749
they might like
we've been working on that problem all

320
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
we've been working on that problem all
 

321
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,320
we've been working on that problem all
the eight years I've been at YouTube

322
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,330
the eight years I've been at YouTube
 

323
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,439
the eight years I've been at YouTube
it's a hard problem because I mean of

324
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:48,449
it's a hard problem because I mean of
 

325
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,600
it's a hard problem because I mean of
course it's trivial to introduce

326
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:50,610
course it's trivial to introduce
 

327
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,870
course it's trivial to introduce
diversity that doesn't help a random

328
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880
diversity that doesn't help a random
 

329
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,939
diversity that doesn't help a random
video I could just randomly select a

330
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:55,949
video I could just randomly select a
 

331
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,999
video I could just randomly select a
video from the billions that we have

332
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:58,009
video from the billions that we have
 

333
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,409
video from the billions that we have
it's likely not to even be in your

334
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:00,419
it's likely not to even be in your
 

335
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,370
it's likely not to even be in your
language so haha the likelihood that you

336
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,380
language so haha the likelihood that you
 

337
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,870
language so haha the likelihood that you
would watch it and develop a new

338
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:05,880
would watch it and develop a new
 

339
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,610
would watch it and develop a new
interest is very very low and so what

340
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:10,620
interest is very very low and so what
 

341
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,260
interest is very very low and so what
you want to do when you're trying to

342
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,270
you want to do when you're trying to
 

343
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,670
you want to do when you're trying to
increase diversity is find something

344
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
increase diversity is find something
 

345
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,629
increase diversity is find something
that is not too similar to the things

346
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:17,639
that is not too similar to the things
 

347
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,360
that is not too similar to the things
that you've watched but also something

348
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,370
that you've watched but also something
 

349
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,300
that you've watched but also something
that you might be likely to watch and

350
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,310
that you might be likely to watch and
 

351
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,939
that you might be likely to watch and
that balance finding that spot between

352
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:25,949
that balance finding that spot between
 

353
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,830
that balance finding that spot between
those two things is quite challenging so

354
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
those two things is quite challenging so
 

355
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,870
those two things is quite challenging so
the diversity of content diversity of

356
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
the diversity of content diversity of
 

357
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,779
the diversity of content diversity of
ideas it's uh it's a really difficult

358
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:35,789
ideas it's uh it's a really difficult
 

359
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,310
ideas it's uh it's a really difficult
it's the thing like that's almost

360
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,320
it's the thing like that's almost
 

361
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,980
it's the thing like that's almost
impossible to define alright like what's

362
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:39,990
impossible to define alright like what's
 

363
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,070
impossible to define alright like what's
different so how do you think about that

364
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,080
different so how do you think about that
 

365
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,120
different so how do you think about that
so two examples is a I'm a huge fan of

366
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,130
so two examples is a I'm a huge fan of
 

367
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,420
so two examples is a I'm a huge fan of
three blue one Brown say and then one

368
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:50,430
three blue one Brown say and then one
 

369
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,879
three blue one Brown say and then one
diversity I wasn't even aware of a

370
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:52,889
diversity I wasn't even aware of a
 

371
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,279
diversity I wasn't even aware of a
channel called veritasium width which is

372
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:55,289
channel called veritasium width which is
 

373
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,620
channel called veritasium width which is
a great science physics whatever channel

374
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:57,630
a great science physics whatever channel
 

375
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,409
a great science physics whatever channel
so one version of diversity is showing

376
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:00,419
so one version of diversity is showing
 

377
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,290
so one version of diversity is showing
me Derek's veritasium channel which I

378
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,300
me Derek's veritasium channel which I
 

379
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,120
me Derek's veritasium channel which I
was really excited to discover actually

380
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,130
was really excited to discover actually
 

381
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,310
was really excited to discover actually
now watch a lot of his videos okay so

382
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,320
now watch a lot of his videos okay so
 

383
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,490
now watch a lot of his videos okay so
you're a person who's watching some math

384
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,500
you're a person who's watching some math
 

385
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,860
you're a person who's watching some math
channels and you might be interested in

386
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:12,870
channels and you might be interested in
 

387
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,350
channels and you might be interested in
some other science or math channels so

388
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
some other science or math channels so
 

389
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
some other science or math channels so
like you mentioned the first kind of

390
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:16,889
like you mentioned the first kind of
 

391
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:20,240
like you mentioned the first kind of
diversity is just show you some some

392
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,250
diversity is just show you some some
 

393
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,680
diversity is just show you some some
things from other channels that are

394
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:21,690
things from other channels that are
 

395
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,850
things from other channels that are
related but not just you know not all

396
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:25,860
related but not just you know not all
 

397
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,640
related but not just you know not all
the three blue one Brown Channel throw

398
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:28,650
the three blue one Brown Channel throw
 

399
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,560
the three blue one Brown Channel throw
in a couple others so so that's the

400
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,570
in a couple others so so that's the
 

401
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,480
in a couple others so so that's the
maybe the first kind of diversity that

402
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,490
maybe the first kind of diversity that
 

403
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,860
maybe the first kind of diversity that
we started with many many years ago

404
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:35,870
we started with many many years ago
 

405
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,329
we started with many many years ago
taking a bigger leap is is about I mean

406
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:41,339
taking a bigger leap is is about I mean
 

407
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,760
taking a bigger leap is is about I mean
the mechanisms we do we use for that is

408
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:43,770
the mechanisms we do we use for that is
 

409
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,610
the mechanisms we do we use for that is
is we basically cluster videos and

410
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:46,620
is we basically cluster videos and
 

411
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,769
is we basically cluster videos and
channels together mostly videos we do

412
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:48,779
channels together mostly videos we do
 

413
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,449
channels together mostly videos we do
every almost everything at the video

414
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:50,459
every almost everything at the video
 

415
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,400
every almost everything at the video
level and so we'll we'll make some kind

416
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,410
level and so we'll we'll make some kind
 

417
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,600
level and so we'll we'll make some kind
of a cluster

418
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,610
of a cluster
 

419
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,680
of a cluster
some embedding process and then and then

420
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:57,690
some embedding process and then and then
 

421
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,810
some embedding process and then and then
measure you know what is the likelihood

422
00:08:59,810 --> 00:08:59,820
measure you know what is the likelihood
 

423
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,050
measure you know what is the likelihood
that a that users who watch one cluster

424
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,060
that a that users who watch one cluster
 

425
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,450
that a that users who watch one cluster
might also watch another cluster that's

426
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:05,460
might also watch another cluster that's
 

427
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,360
might also watch another cluster that's
very distinct so we may come to find

428
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,370
very distinct so we may come to find
 

429
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,630
very distinct so we may come to find
that that people who watch science

430
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:11,640
that that people who watch science
 

431
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,550
that that people who watch science
videos also like jazz this is possible

432
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
videos also like jazz this is possible
 

433
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,280
videos also like jazz this is possible
right and so and so because of that

434
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,290
right and so and so because of that
 

435
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,480
right and so and so because of that
relationship that we've identified

436
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,490
relationship that we've identified
 

437
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,760
relationship that we've identified
through the through the embeddings and

438
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:25,770
through the through the embeddings and
 

439
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,230
through the through the embeddings and
then the measurement of the people who

440
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,240
then the measurement of the people who
 

441
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,630
then the measurement of the people who
watch both we might recommend a jazz

442
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:29,640
watch both we might recommend a jazz
 

443
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,180
watch both we might recommend a jazz
video once in a while so there's this

444
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,190
video once in a while so there's this
 

445
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,040
video once in a while so there's this
clustering the embedding space of jazz

446
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,050
clustering the embedding space of jazz
 

447
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,580
clustering the embedding space of jazz
videos and science videos and so you

448
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:37,590
videos and science videos and so you
 

449
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,110
videos and science videos and so you
kind of try to look at aggregate

450
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
kind of try to look at aggregate
 

451
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,710
kind of try to look at aggregate
statistics where if a lot of people that

452
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
statistics where if a lot of people that
 

453
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,920
statistics where if a lot of people that
jump from science cluster to the jazz

454
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:45,930
jump from science cluster to the jazz
 

455
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,850
jump from science cluster to the jazz
cluster tend to remain as engaged or

456
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:49,860
cluster tend to remain as engaged or
 

457
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,730
cluster tend to remain as engaged or
become more engaged then that's that

458
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:52,740
become more engaged then that's that
 

459
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,520
become more engaged then that's that
means those two are they should hop back

460
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:55,530
means those two are they should hop back
 

461
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,530
means those two are they should hop back
and forth and they'll be happy right

462
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:57,540
and forth and they'll be happy right
 

463
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,870
and forth and they'll be happy right
there's a higher likelihood that a

464
00:09:59,870 --> 00:09:59,880
there's a higher likelihood that a
 

465
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,300
there's a higher likelihood that a
person from who's watching science would

466
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,310
person from who's watching science would
 

467
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,580
person from who's watching science would
like jazz then the person watching

468
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:04,590
like jazz then the person watching
 

469
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,710
like jazz then the person watching
science would like I don't know backyard

470
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
science would like I don't know backyard
 

471
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,810
science would like I don't know backyard
railroads or something else right and so

472
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:08,820
railroads or something else right and so
 

473
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,180
railroads or something else right and so
we can try to measure these likelihoods

474
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,190
we can try to measure these likelihoods
 

475
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,510
we can try to measure these likelihoods
and use that to make the best

476
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:14,520
and use that to make the best
 

477
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,020
and use that to make the best
recommendation we can so okay so we'll

478
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,030
recommendation we can so okay so we'll
 

479
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,280
recommendation we can so okay so we'll
talk about the machine learning of that

480
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,290

much of it
 

805
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,389
much of it
can be solved with pure machine learning

00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:23,659
experience has demonstrated that you
 

829
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:27,519
experience has demonstrated that you
need both of those things algorithms I

830
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:27,529
need both of those things algorithms I
 

831
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:29,139
need both of those things algorithms I
mean you're familiar with machine

learning algorithm and the thing they
 

835
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,210

need most is data and the data is
 

837
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,860
need most is data and the data is
generated by humans and so for instance

838
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:37,870
generated by humans and so for instance
 

839
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,690
generated by humans and so for instance
when we're building a system to try to

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,159
when we're building a system to try to
figure out which are the videos that are

violations well the first thing we need

846
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
violations well the first thing we need
 

847
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,500
violations well the first thing we need
to do is get human beings to make

848
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,510
to do is get human beings to make
 

849
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,840
to do is get human beings to make
decisions about which which of those

850
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:55,850
decisions about which which of those
 

851
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,110
decisions about which which of those
videos are in which category and then we

852
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
videos are in which category and then we
 

853
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,230
videos are in which category and then we
use that data and and basically you know

854
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
use that data and and basically you know
 

855
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,330
use that data and and basically you know
take that information that's that's

856
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:04,340
take that information that's that's
 

857
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,250
take that information that's that's
determined and governed by humans and

858
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,260
determined and governed by humans and
 

859
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,810
determined and governed by humans and
and extrapolated or apply it to the

860
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:10,820
and extrapolated or apply it to the
 

861
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,930
and extrapolated or apply it to the
entire set of billions of YouTube videos

862
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:13,940
entire set of billions of YouTube videos
 

863
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,440
entire set of billions of YouTube videos
and we couldn't we we couldn't get to

864
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,450
and we couldn't we we couldn't get to
 

865
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,720
and we couldn't we we couldn't get to
all the videos on YouTube well without

866
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:19,730
all the videos on YouTube well without
 

867
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,000
all the videos on YouTube well without
the humans and we we couldn't use the

868
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,010
the humans and we we couldn't use the
 

869
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,500
the humans and we we couldn't use the
humans to get to all the videos of

870
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:23,510
humans to get to all the videos of
 

871
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,279
humans to get to all the videos of
YouTube so there's no world in which you

872
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:27,289
YouTube so there's no world in which you
 

873
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:28,899
YouTube so there's no world in which you
have only one or the other of these

874
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:28,909
have only one or the other of these
 

875
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:33,720
have only one or the other of these
things and just as you said a lot of it

876
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:33,730
things and just as you said a lot of it
 

877
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,950
things and just as you said a lot of it
comes down to people at YouTube spending

878
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
comes down to people at YouTube spending
 

879
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,680
comes down to people at YouTube spending
a lot of time trying to figure out what

880
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:41,690
a lot of time trying to figure out what
 

881
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,919
a lot of time trying to figure out what
are the right policies you know what are

882
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:44,929
are the right policies you know what are
 

883
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:47,019
are the right policies you know what are
the outcomes based on those policies are

884
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,029
the outcomes based on those policies are
 

885
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:48,629
the outcomes based on those policies are
they the kinds of things we want to see

886
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:48,639
they the kinds of things we want to see
 

887
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:53,049
they the kinds of things we want to see
and then once we kind of get a get an

888
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:53,059
and then once we kind of get a get an
 

889
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,909
and then once we kind of get a get an
agreement or or build some consensus

890
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:54,919
agreement or or build some consensus
 

891
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,039
agreement or or build some consensus
around around what the policies are well

892
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,049
around around what the policies are well
 

893
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:58,529
around around what the policies are well
then we've got to find a way to

894
00:19:58,529 --> 00:19:58,539
then we've got to find a way to
 

895
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:01,240
then we've got to find a way to
implement those policies across all of

896
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,250
implement those policies across all of
 

897
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,600
implement those policies across all of
YouTube and that's where both the human

898
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:04,610
YouTube and that's where both the human
 

899
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,090
YouTube and that's where both the human
beings we call them evaluators or

900
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:07,100
beings we call them evaluators or
 

901
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,790
beings we call them evaluators or
reviewers come into play to help us with

902
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:09,800
reviewers come into play to help us with
 

903
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,980
reviewers come into play to help us with
that and then and then once we get a lot

904
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:11,990
that and then and then once we get a lot
 

905
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,300
that and then and then once we get a lot
of training data from them

906
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,310
of training data from them
 

907
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,130
of training data from them
then we apply the machine learning

908
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,140
then we apply the machine learning
 

909
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,680
then we apply the machine learning
techniques to take it even further do

910
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:17,690
techniques to take it even further do
 

911
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,370
techniques to take it even further do
you have a sense that these human beings

912
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:20,380
you have a sense that these human beings
 

913
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,430
you have a sense that these human beings
have a bias in some kind of direction

914
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
have a bias in some kind of direction
 

915
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,310
have a bias in some kind of direction
sort of I mean that's the interesting

916
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,320
sort of I mean that's the interesting
 

917
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,500
sort of I mean that's the interesting

a lot of annotation and we rarely ask

922
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:34,510
a lot of annotation and we rarely ask
 

923
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:40,120
a lot of annotation and we rarely ask
what bias do the annotators have you

924
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,130
what bias do the annotators have you
 

925
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,400
what bias do the annotators have you
know the it even in the sense that

926
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,410
know the it even in the sense that
 

927
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,520
know the it even in the sense that
they're better than they're better

00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:25,910
that human input well we take steps to
 

959
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,230
that human input well we take steps to
try to overcome these kinds of biases or

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,240
try to overcome these kinds of biases or
 

961
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,640
try to overcome these kinds of biases or
biases that we think would be

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:30,650
biases that we think would be
 

963
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,870
biases that we think would be
problematic so for instance like we

964
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
problematic so for instance like we
 

965
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,270
problematic so for instance like we
asked people to have a bias towards

966
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
asked people to have a bias towards
 

967
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,010
asked people to have a bias towards
scientific consensus that's something

that we we instruct them to do we ask

that we we instruct them to do we ask
 

971
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,660

them to have a bias towards
 

973
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,710

there's many techniques for doing this

00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:57,590
there's many techniques for doing this
 

983
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,430
there's many techniques for doing this
one of them is you send the same thing

one of them is you send the same thing
 

985
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,750
one of them is you send the same thing
to be reviewed to many people and so you

986
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:04,760
to be reviewed to many people and so you
 

987
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,610
to be reviewed to many people and so you
know that's one technique another is

988
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:06,620
know that's one technique another is
 

989
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,080
know that's one technique another is
that you make sure that the people that

990
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,090
that you make sure that the people that
 

991
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,280
that you make sure that the people that
are doing these sorts of tasks are from

1011
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,640

something again we've been working on
 

1101
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,280
something again we've been working on
for many years and probably the first

1103
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,530

the first real attempt to do that

00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:52,540
the first real attempt to do that
 

1105
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,240
the first real attempt to do that
well was to use collaborative filtering

1106
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,250
well was to use collaborative filtering
 

1107
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,710
well was to use collaborative filtering
so you can't describe what collaborative

1108
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
so you can't describe what collaborative
 

1109
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,800
so you can't describe what collaborative
filtering is sure it's just basically

1110
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:01,810
filtering is sure it's just basically
 

1111
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,250
filtering is sure it's just basically
what we do is we observe which videos

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,340
what we do is we observe which videos
get watched close together by the same

1114
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:08,350
get watched close together by the same
 

1115
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,590
get watched close together by the same
person and if you observe that and if

1116
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
person and if you observe that and if
 

1117
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
person and if you observe that and if
you can imagine creating a graph where

1118
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:15,850
you can imagine creating a graph where
 

1119
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,090
you can imagine creating a graph where
the videos that get watched close

1120
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:18,100
the videos that get watched close
 

1121
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,400
the videos that get watched close
together by the most people are sort of

1122
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,410
together by the most people are sort of
 

1123
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,110
together by the most people are sort of
very close to one another in this graph

1124
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,120
very close to one another in this graph
 

1125
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,210
very close to one another in this graph
and videos that don't frequently get

1126
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:24,220
and videos that don't frequently get
 

1127
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,100
and videos that don't frequently get
watch close too close together by the

1128
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,110
watch close too close together by the
 

1129
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,380
watch close too close together by the
same person or the same people are far

1130
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,390
same person or the same people are far
 

1131
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,700
same person or the same people are far
apart then you end up with this graph

1132
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:32,710
apart then you end up with this graph
 

1133
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,070
apart then you end up with this graph
that we call the related graph that

1134
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,080
that we call the related graph that
 

1135
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,380
that we call the related graph that
basically represents videos that are

1136
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:37,390
basically represents videos that are
 

1137
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,390
basically represents videos that are
very similar or related in some way and

1138
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:41,400
very similar or related in some way and
 

1139
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,810
very similar or related in some way and
what's amazing about that is that it

1140
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:45,820
what's amazing about that is that it
 

1141
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,000
what's amazing about that is that it
puts all the videos that are in the same

1142
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,010
puts all the videos that are in the same
 

1143
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,400
puts all the videos that are in the same
language together for instance and we

1144
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,410
language together for instance and we
 

1145
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,970
language together for instance and we
didn't even have to think about language

1146
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:52,980
didn't even have to think about language
 

1147
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,830
didn't even have to think about language
just does it yeah I didn't it puts all

1148
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
just does it yeah I didn't it puts all
 

1149
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,450
just does it yeah I didn't it puts all
the videos that are about sports

1150
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:57,460
the videos that are about sports
 

1151
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,280
the videos that are about sports
together and it puts most of the music

1152
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,290
together and it puts most of the music
 

1153
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,960
together and it puts most of the music
videos together and it puts all of these

1154
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:00,970
videos together and it puts all of these
 

1155
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,080
videos together and it puts all of these
sorts of videos together just because

1156
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,090
sorts of videos together just because
 

1157
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,900
sorts of videos together just because
that's sort of the way the people using

1158
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:06,910
that's sort of the way the people using
 

1159
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,140
that's sort of the way the people using
YouTube behave so that already cleans up

1160
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,150
YouTube behave so that already cleans up
 

1161
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,040
YouTube behave so that already cleans up
a lot of the problem it takes care of

1162
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,050
a lot of the problem it takes care of
 

1163
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,860
a lot of the problem it takes care of
the lowest hanging fruit which happens

1164
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:16,870
the lowest hanging fruit which happens
 

1165
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,260
the lowest hanging fruit which happens
to be a huge one of just managing these

1166
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,270
to be a huge one of just managing these
 

1167
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,690
to be a huge one of just managing these
millions of videos that's right I

1168
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:21,700
millions of videos that's right I
 

1169
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,270
millions of videos that's right I
remember a few years ago I was talking

1170
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,280
remember a few years ago I was talking
 

1171
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,440
remember a few years ago I was talking
to someone who was trying to propose

1172
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:28,450
to someone who was trying to propose
 

1173
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,070
to someone who was trying to propose
that we do a research project concerning

1174
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
that we do a research project concerning
 

1175
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,320
that we do a research project concerning
people who who are bilingual and this

1176
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,330
people who who are bilingual and this
 

1177
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,480
people who who are bilingual and this
person

1178
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,490
person
 

1179
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,150
person
was making this proposal based on the

1180
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:41,160
was making this proposal based on the
 

1181
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,180
was making this proposal based on the
idea that YouTube could not possibly be

1182
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,190
idea that YouTube could not possibly be
 

1183
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,020
idea that YouTube could not possibly be
good at recommending videos well to

1184
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,030
good at recommending videos well to
 

1185
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,820
good at recommending videos well to
people who are bilingual and so she was

1186
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:52,830
people who are bilingual and so she was
 

1187
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,370
people who are bilingual and so she was
telling me about this and I said well

problem do you think we have on YouTube
with the recommendations and so she said

1194
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,510
with the recommendations and so she said
 

1195
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,180
with the recommendations and so she said
well I'm a researcher in in the US and

1196
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,190
well I'm a researcher in in the US and
 

1197
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,280
well I'm a researcher in in the US and
and when I'm looking for academic topics

1198
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,290
and when I'm looking for academic topics
 

1199
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,650
and when I'm looking for academic topics
I want to look I want to see them in

1200
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:09,660
I want to look I want to see them in
 

1201
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,600
I want to look I want to see them in
English and so she searched for one

1202
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:11,610
English and so she searched for one
 

1203
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,010
English and so she searched for one
found a video and then looked at the

1204
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,020
found a video and then looked at the
 

1205
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,170
found a video and then looked at the
watch next suggestions and they were all

1206
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:15,180
watch next suggestions and they were all
 

1207

YouTube must think that I speak only
English and so she said now I'm actually

1212

videos that are in Turkish and so she

1220
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,050
videos that are in Turkish and so she
 

1221
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,780
videos that are in Turkish and so she
searched for a video about making the

1222
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:32,790
searched for a video about making the

was in Turkish and the watch next
recommendations were in Turkish and she

1228
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:38,570
recommendations were in Turkish and she
 

1229
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,760
recommendations were in Turkish and she
just couldn't believe how this was

1230
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:40,770
just couldn't believe how this was
 

1231
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,850
just couldn't believe how this was
possible and how is it that you know

1232
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:43,860
possible and how is it that you know
 

1233
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,890
possible and how is it that you know
that I speak both these two languages

1234
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:45,900
that I speak both these two languages
 

1235
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,450
that I speak both these two languages
and put all the videos together and it's

1236
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:47,460
and put all the videos together and it's
 

1237
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,630
and put all the videos together and it's
just as a route come of this related

1238
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:50,640
just as a route come of this related
 

1239
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,890
just as a route come of this related
graph that's created through

1240
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:51,900
graph that's created through
 

1241
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,160
graph that's created through
collaborative filtering so for me one of

1242
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,170
collaborative filtering so for me one of
 

1243
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,420
collaborative filtering so for me one of
my huge interest is just human

1244
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:56,430
my huge interest is just human
 

1245
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,660
my huge interest is just human
psychology right and and that's such a

1246
00:27:59,660 --> 00:27:59,670
psychology right and and that's such a
 

1247
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,330
psychology right and and that's such a
powerful platform on which to utilize

1248
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:02,340
powerful platform on which to utilize
 

1249
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,880
powerful platform on which to utilize
human psychology to discover what people

1250
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:04,890
human psychology to discover what people
 

1251
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,400

1257
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,390
you know I've Google search has ability
to look at your own history and I've

think anyone's ever summarized that I
 

1269
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,390
think anyone's ever summarized that I
personally would love that a summary of

1270
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:32,400
personally would love that a summary of
 

1271
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,390
personally would love that a summary of
who I am as a person on the Internet to

1272
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:35,400
who I am as a person on the Internet to
 

1273
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,120
who I am as a person on the Internet to
me because I think it reveals I I think

1274
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,130
me because I think it reveals I I think
 

1275
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,170
me because I think it reveals I I think
it puts a mirror to me or to others you

1276
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,180
it puts a mirror to me or to others you
 

1277
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,120
it puts a mirror to me or to others you
know that's actually quite revealing and

1278
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,130
know that's actually quite revealing and
 

1279
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,110
know that's actually quite revealing and
interesting you know just maybe in the

1280
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,120
interesting you know just maybe in the
 

1281
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,960
interesting you know just maybe in the
number of it's a joke but not really is

1282
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:50,970
number of it's a joke but not really is
 

1283
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,500
number of it's a joke but not really is
the

1284
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:51,510
the
 

1285
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,720
the
of cat videos I've watched videos of

1286
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:53,730
of cat videos I've watched videos of
 

1287
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,060
of cat videos I've watched videos of
people falling you know stuff that's

1288
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,070
people falling you know stuff that's
 

1289
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,750
people falling you know stuff that's
absurd that kind of stuff it's really

1290
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
absurd that kind of stuff it's really
 

1291
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,190
absurd that kind of stuff it's really
interesting and of course it's really

1292
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,200
interesting and of course it's really
 

1293
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,370
interesting and of course it's really
good for the machine learning aspect to

1294
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:03,380
good for the machine learning aspect to
 

1295
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,860
good for the machine learning aspect to
to show to figure out what to show next

1296
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:06,870
to show to figure out what to show next
 

1297
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,860
to show to figure out what to show next
but it's interesting hey have you just

1298
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:09,870
but it's interesting hey have you just
 

1299
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,960
but it's interesting hey have you just
as a tangent played around with the idea

1300
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:11,970
as a tangent played around with the idea
 

1301
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:17,030
as a tangent played around with the idea
of giving a map to people sort of as

1302
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,040
of giving a map to people sort of as
 

1303
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,640
of giving a map to people sort of as
opposed to just using this information

1304
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:18,650
opposed to just using this information
 

1305
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,430
opposed to just using this information
to show us next showing them here are

1306
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:22,440
to show us next showing them here are
 

1307
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,590
to show us next showing them here are
the clusters you've loved over the years

1308
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:24,600
the clusters you've loved over the years
 

1309
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,380

kind of thing well we do provide the

1310
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,390
kind of thing well we do provide the
 

1311
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,700
kind of thing well we do provide the
history of all the videos that you've

1312
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:28,710
history of all the videos that you've
 

1313
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,920
history of all the videos that you've
watched yes so you can definitely search

1314
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:30,930
watched yes so you can definitely search
 

1315
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,480
watched yes so you can definitely search
through that and look through it and

1316
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,490
through that and look through it and
 

1317
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,770
through that and look through it and
search through it to see what it is that

1318
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:33,780
search through it to see what it is that
 

1319
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,170
search through it to see what it is that
you've been watching on YouTube we have

1320
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:36,180
you've been watching on YouTube we have
 

1321
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:42,080
you've been watching on YouTube we have
actually in various times experimented

1322
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,090
actually in various times experimented
 

1323
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,360
actually in various times experimented
with this sort of cluster idea finding

1324
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,370
with this sort of cluster idea finding
 

1325
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,590
with this sort of cluster idea finding
ways to demonstrate or show people what

1326
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:48,600
ways to demonstrate or show people what
 

1327
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,180
ways to demonstrate or show people what
topics they've been interested in or

1328
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,190
topics they've been interested in or
 

1329
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,920
topics they've been interested in or
what what clusters they've watched from

1330
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:51,930
what what clusters they've watched from
 

1331
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,320
what what clusters they've watched from
it's interesting that you bring this up

1332
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,330
it's interesting that you bring this up
 

1333
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,700
it's interesting that you bring this up
because in some sense the way the

1334
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:58,710
because in some sense the way the
 

1335
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,920
because in some sense the way the
recommendation system of YouTube sees a

1336
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:00,930
recommendation system of YouTube sees a
 

1337
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,700
recommendation system of YouTube sees a
user is exactly as the history of all

1338
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:04,710
user is exactly as the history of all
 

1339
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,900
user is exactly as the history of all
the videos they've watched on YouTube

1340
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:05,910
the videos they've watched on YouTube
 

1341
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:11,750
the videos they've watched on YouTube
and so you can think of yourself or any

1342
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:11,760
and so you can think of yourself or any
 

1343
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,190
and so you can think of yourself or any
user on YouTube as kind of like a DNA

1344
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,200
user on YouTube as kind of like a DNA
 

1345
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,360
user on YouTube as kind of like a DNA
strand of all your videos right that

1346
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,370
strand of all your videos right that
 

1347
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,180
strand of all your videos right that
sort of represents you you can also

1348
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,190
sort of represents you you can also
 

1349
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,890
sort of represents you you can also
think of it as maybe a vector in the

1350
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:24,900
think of it as maybe a vector in the
 

1351
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,250
think of it as maybe a vector in the
space of all the videos on YouTube and

1352
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:27,260
space of all the videos on YouTube and
 

1353
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,440
space of all the videos on YouTube and
so you know now once you think of it as

1354
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,450
so you know now once you think of it as
 

1355
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,930
so you know now once you think of it as
a vector in the space of all the videos

1356
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:32,940
a vector in the space of all the videos
 

1357
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,310
a vector in the space of all the videos
on YouTube then you can start to say

1358
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,320
on YouTube then you can start to say
 

1359
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,500
on YouTube then you can start to say
okay well you know which videos which

1360
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:36,510
okay well you know which videos which
 

1361
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,130
okay well you know which videos which
which other vectors are close to me and

1362
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:39,140
which other vectors are close to me and
 

1363
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,280
which other vectors are close to me and
to my vector and and that's one of the

1364
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,290
to my vector and and that's one of the
 

1365
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,870
to my vector and and that's one of the
ways that we generate some diverse

1366
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
ways that we generate some diverse
 

1367
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,400
ways that we generate some diverse
recommendations is because you're like

1368
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:46,410
recommendations is because you're like
 

1369
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,430
recommendations is because you're like
okay well you know these these people

1370
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
okay well you know these these people
 

1371
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,290
okay well you know these these people
seem to be closed with respect to the

1372
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:51,300
seem to be closed with respect to the
 

1373
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,850
seem to be closed with respect to the
videos they've watched on YouTube but

1374
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:52,860
videos they've watched on YouTube but
 

1375
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,610
videos they've watched on YouTube but
you know here's a topic or a video that

1376
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:55,620
you know here's a topic or a video that
 

1377

one of them has watched and enjoyed but

1378
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:57,750
one of them has watched and enjoyed but
 

1379
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,170
one of them has watched and enjoyed but
the other one hasn't that could be an

1380
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:00,180
the other one hasn't that could be an
 

1381
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,120
the other one hasn't that could be an
opportunity to make a good

1382
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,130
opportunity to make a good
 

1383
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,830
opportunity to make a good
recommendation I gotta tell you I mean I

measure of quality is it just something
 

1423
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,690
measure of quality is it just something
yeah how do you know that something is

1424
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:54,700
yeah how do you know that something is
 

1425
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,879
yeah how do you know that something is
good well I mean I think it depends

1426
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:56,889
good well I mean I think it depends
 

1427
00:31:56,889 --> 00:31:59,759
good well I mean I think it depends
initially on what sort of video we're

1428
00:31:59,759 --> 00:31:59,769
initially on what sort of video we're
 

1429
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:03,149
initially on what sort of video we're
talking about so in the realm of let's

1430
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:03,159
talking about so in the realm of let's
 

1431
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:06,269
talking about so in the realm of let's
say you mentioned politics and news in

1432
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:06,279
say you mentioned politics and news in
 

1433
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:11,999
say you mentioned politics and news in
that realm you know quality news or

1434
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:12,009
that realm you know quality news or
 

1435
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:15,389
that realm you know quality news or
quality journalism relies on having a

1436
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:15,399
quality journalism relies on having a
 

1437
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:18,989
quality journalism relies on having a
journalism department right like you you

1438
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:18,999
journalism department right like you you
 

1439
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,759
journalism department right like you you
have to have actual journalists and

1440
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:20,769
have to have actual journalists and
 

1441
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:23,359
have to have actual journalists and
fact-checkers and people like that and

1442
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:23,369
fact-checkers and people like that and
 

1443
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:27,090
fact-checkers and people like that and
so in that situation and in others maybe

1444
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:27,100
so in that situation and in others maybe
 

1445
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,869
so in that situation and in others maybe
science or in medicine quality has a lot

1446
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:30,879
science or in medicine quality has a lot
 

1447
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:32,879
science or in medicine quality has a lot
to do with the authoritative nough sand

1448
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:32,889
to do with the authoritative nough sand
 

1449
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:34,950
to do with the authoritative nough sand
the credibility and the expertise of the

1450
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:34,960
the credibility and the expertise of the
 

1451
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,889
the credibility and the expertise of the
people who make the video now if you're

1452
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:37,899
people who make the video now if you're
 

1453
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:38,909
people who make the video now if you're
thinking about the other end of the

1454
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:38,919
thinking about the other end of the
 

1455
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,879
thinking about the other end of the
spectrum you know what is the highest

1456
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:41,889
spectrum you know what is the highest
 

1457
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:44,310
spectrum you know what is the highest
quality prank video for what is the

1458
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
quality prank video for what is the
 

1459
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,399
quality prank video for what is the
highest quality minecraft video yeah

1460
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:47,409
highest quality minecraft video yeah
 

1461
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:50,879
highest quality minecraft video yeah
right that might be the one that people

1462
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:50,889
right that might be the one that people
 

1463
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:53,430
right that might be the one that people
enjoy watching the most and watch to the

1464
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,440
enjoy watching the most and watch to the
 

1465
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,350
enjoy watching the most and watch to the
end or it might be the one that when we

1466
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:58,360
end or it might be the one that when we
 

1467
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,690
end or it might be the one that when we
ask people the next day after they

1468
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:00,700
ask people the next day after they
 

1469
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,600
ask people the next day after they
watched it were they satisfied with it

1470
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:03,610
watched it were they satisfied with it
 

1471
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,109
watched it were they satisfied with it
and so we in in especially in the realm

1472
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:07,119
and so we in in especially in the realm
 

1473
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,379
and so we in in especially in the realm
of entertainment have been trying to get

1474
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:10,389
of entertainment have been trying to get
 

1475
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:13,769
of entertainment have been trying to get
at better and better measures of quality

1476
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:13,779
at better and better measures of quality
 

1477
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:17,600
at better and better measures of quality
or satisfaction or enrichment

1478
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:17,610
or satisfaction or enrichment
 

1479
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,880
or satisfaction or enrichment
since I came to YouTube and we started

1480
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:19,890
since I came to YouTube and we started
 

1481
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,220
since I came to YouTube and we started
with well you know the first

1482
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,230
with well you know the first
 

1483
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,080
with well you know the first
approximation is the one that gets more

1484
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,090
approximation is the one that gets more
 

1485
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:28,640
approximation is the one that gets more
views but but you know we both know that

1486
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:28,650
views but but you know we both know that
 

1487
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,700
views but but you know we both know that
things can get a lot of views and not

1488
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:31,710
things can get a lot of views and not
 

1489
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,220
things can get a lot of views and not
really be that high quality especially

1490
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,230
really be that high quality especially
 

1491
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,810
really be that high quality especially
if people are clicking on something and

1492
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:35,820
if people are clicking on something and
 

1493
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,270
if people are clicking on something and
then immediately realizing that it's not

1494
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,280
then immediately realizing that it's not
 

1495
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,210
then immediately realizing that it's not
that great and abandoning it and that's

1496
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,220
that great and abandoning it and that's
 

1497
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,120
that great and abandoning it and that's
why we move from views to thinking about

1498
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,130
why we move from views to thinking about
 

1499
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,980
why we move from views to thinking about
the amount of time people spend watching

1500
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:45,990
the amount of time people spend watching
 

1501
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,130
the amount of time people spend watching
it what the premise that like you know

1502
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:49,140
it what the premise that like you know
 

1503
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,370
it what the premise that like you know
in some sense the time that someone

1504
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:51,380
in some sense the time that someone
 

1505
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,980
in some sense the time that someone
spends watching a video is related to

1506
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:54,990
spends watching a video is related to
 

1507
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,140
spends watching a video is related to
the value that they get from that video

1508
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,150
the value that they get from that video
 

1509
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,390
the value that they get from that video
it may not be perfectly related but it

1510
00:33:59,390 --> 00:33:59,400
it may not be perfectly related but it
 

1511
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,640
it may not be perfectly related but it
has something to say about how much

1512
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:01,650
has something to say about how much
 

1513
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,850
has something to say about how much
value they get but even that's not good

1514
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:04,860
value they get but even that's not good
 

1515
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,120
value they get but even that's not good
enough

1516
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,130
enough
 

1517
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,320
enough
right because I myself have spent time

1518
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,330
right because I myself have spent time
 

1519
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,490
right because I myself have spent time
clicking through channels on television

1520
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:10,500
clicking through channels on television
 

1521
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,730
clicking through channels on television
late at night and ended up watching

1522
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:12,740
late at night and ended up watching
 

1523
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,440
late at night and ended up watching
under siege - for some reason I don't

1524
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,450
under siege - for some reason I don't
 

1525
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,630
under siege - for some reason I don't
know and if you were to ask me the next

1526
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:17,640
know and if you were to ask me the next
 

1527
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,310
know and if you were to ask me the next
day are you glad that you watched that

1528
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:19,320
day are you glad that you watched that
 

1529
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,240
day are you glad that you watched that
show on TV last night I'd say yeah I

1530
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:23,250
show on TV last night I'd say yeah I
 

1531
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,950
show on TV last night I'd say yeah I
wish I would have gone to bed or read a

1532
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:24,960
wish I would have gone to bed or read a
 

1533
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,640
wish I would have gone to bed or read a
book or almost anything else really and

1534
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:28,650
book or almost anything else really and
 

1535
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,690
book or almost anything else really and
so that's why some people got the idea a

1536
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:32,700
so that's why some people got the idea a
 

1537
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,400
so that's why some people got the idea a
few years ago to try to serve at users

1538
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,410
few years ago to try to serve at users
 

1539
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:39,380
few years ago to try to serve at users
afterwards and so so we get feedback

1540
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:39,390
afterwards and so so we get feedback
 

1541
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,630
afterwards and so so we get feedback
data from those surveys and then use

1542
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:41,640
data from those surveys and then use
 

1543
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,000
data from those surveys and then use
that in the machine learning system to

1544
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,010
that in the machine learning system to
 

1545
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,410
that in the machine learning system to
try to not just predict what you're

1546
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:45,420
try to not just predict what you're
 

1547
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,780
try to not just predict what you're
gonna click on right now what you might

1548
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:47,790
gonna click on right now what you might
 

1549
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,030
gonna click on right now what you might
watch for a while but what when we ask

1550
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,040
watch for a while but what when we ask
 

1551
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,460
watch for a while but what when we ask
you tomorrow you'll give four or five

1552
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:52,470
you tomorrow you'll give four or five
 

1553
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:57,050
you tomorrow you'll give four or five
stars - so just to summarize what are

1554
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,060
stars - so just to summarize what are
 

1555
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,340
stars - so just to summarize what are
the signals from a machine learning

1556
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:58,350
the signals from a machine learning
 

1557
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,290
the signals from a machine learning
perspective the user can provide he

1558
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:00,300
perspective the user can provide he
 

1559
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,730
perspective the user can provide he
mentions just clicking on the video

1560
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:01,740
mentions just clicking on the video
 

1561
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,060
mentions just clicking on the video
views the time watch maybe the relative

1562
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,070
views the time watch maybe the relative
 

1563
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,020
views the time watch maybe the relative
time watched the clicking like and

1564
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,030
time watched the clicking like and
 

1565
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,990
time watched the clicking like and
dislike on the video maybe commenting on

1566
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,000
dislike on the video maybe commenting on
 

1567
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,780
dislike on the video maybe commenting on
the video and those things all of those

1568
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:14,790
the video and those things all of those
 

1569
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,580
the video and those things all of those
things and then though the one I wasn't

1570
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:16,590
things and then though the one I wasn't
 

1571
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,100
things and then though the one I wasn't
actually quite aware of even though I

1572
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,110
actually quite aware of even though I
 

1573
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,190
actually quite aware of even though I
might have engaged in it is a survey

1574
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,200
might have engaged in it is a survey
 

1575
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,260
might have engaged in it is a survey
afterwards which is a brilliant idea is

1576
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,270
afterwards which is a brilliant idea is
 

1577
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,530
afterwards which is a brilliant idea is
there other signals all right I mean

1578
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:27,540
there other signals all right I mean
 

1579
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,240
there other signals all right I mean
that's already a really rich space of

1580
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,250
that's already a really rich space of
 

1581
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,870
that's already a really rich space of
signals to learn from is

1582
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:30,880
signals to learn from is
 

1583
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,019
signals to learn from is
something else well you mentioned

1584

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
the years we've learned that people have
 

1615
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,190
the years we've learned that people have
a wide range of attitudes about what it

means to subscribe we would ask some
users who didn't subscribe very much why

1620
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,000
users who didn't subscribe very much why
 

1621

then we've asked other people who
 

1639

actually want to click on their videos

1670
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:22,329
actually want to click on their videos
 

1671
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:24,180
actually want to click on their videos
when they're releasing it I just love

1672
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,190
when they're releasing it I just love
 

1673
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,529
when they're releasing it I just love
what they're doing and it's maybe

1674
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:25,539
what they're doing and it's maybe
 

1675
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:28,470
what they're doing and it's maybe
outside of my interest area and so on

1676
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
outside of my interest area and so on
 

1677
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,390
outside of my interest area and so on
which is probably the wrong way to use

1678
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
which is probably the wrong way to use
 

1679
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,279
which is probably the wrong way to use
the subscribe button but I just want to

1680
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:32,289
the subscribe button but I just want to
 

1681
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:35,700
the subscribe button but I just want to
say congrats this is a great work well

1682
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:35,710
say congrats this is a great work well
 

1683
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,440
say congrats this is a great work well
so you have to deal with all the space

1684
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,450
so you have to deal with all the space
 

1685
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,029
so you have to deal with all the space
of people that see the subscribe button

1686
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:39,039
of people that see the subscribe button
 

1687
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,710
of people that see the subscribe button
it's totally different that's right and

1688
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
it's totally different that's right and
 

1689
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,099
it's totally different that's right and
so you know we we can't just close our

1690
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:44,109
so you know we we can't just close our
 

1691
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:44,700
so you know we we can't just close our
eyes and say

1692
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:44,710
eyes and say
 

1693
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,650
eyes and say
sorry you're using it wrong you know and

1694
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:46,660
sorry you're using it wrong you know and
 

1695
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,930
sorry you're using it wrong you know and
we're not gonna pay attention to what

1696
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:48,940
we're not gonna pay attention to what
 

1697
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,120
we're not gonna pay attention to what
you've done we need to embrace all the

1698
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,130
you've done we need to embrace all the
 

1699
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,890
you've done we need to embrace all the
ways in which all the different people

1700
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:52,900
ways in which all the different people
 

1701
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,079
ways in which all the different people
in the world use the subscribe button or

1702
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:55,089
in the world use the subscribe button or
 

1703
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:58,200
in the world use the subscribe button or
the like in the dislike button so in

1704
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,210
the like in the dislike button so in
 

1705
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,010
the like in the dislike button so in
terms of signals of machine learning

1706
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,020
terms of signals of machine learning
 

1707
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,020
terms of signals of machine learning
using for the search and for the

1708
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,030
using for the search and for the
 

1709
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,920
using for the search and for the

recommendation
 

1711
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,200
recommendation
you've mentioned title so like metadata

1712
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,210
you've mentioned title so like metadata
 

1713
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,730
you've mentioned title so like metadata
like text data that people provide

1714
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:08,740
like text data that people provide
 

1715
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,620
like text data that people provide
description and title and maybe keywords

1716
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:12,630
description and title and maybe keywords
 

1717
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,230
description and title and maybe keywords
so maybe you can speak to the value of

1718
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,240
so maybe you can speak to the value of
 

1719
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,960
so maybe you can speak to the value of
those things in search and also this

1720
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:18,970
those things in search and also this
 

1721
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,750
those things in search and also this
incredible fascinating area of the

1722
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
incredible fascinating area of the
 

1723
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,820
incredible fascinating area of the
content itself so the video content

1724
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:23,830
content itself so the video content
 

1725
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,170
content itself so the video content
itself trying to understand what's

1726
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,180
itself trying to understand what's
 

1727
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,000
itself trying to understand what's
happening in the video so YouTube would

1728
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,010
happening in the video so YouTube would
 

1729
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,890
happening in the video so YouTube would
release a dataset that you know the in

1730
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:28,900
release a dataset that you know the in
 

1731
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,940
release a dataset that you know the in
the machine learning and computer vision

1732
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:29,950
the machine learning and computer vision
 

1733
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,300

your hope for the future of being able
to analyze the content of the video

1742
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,080
to analyze the content of the video
 

1743
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,950
to analyze the content of the video
itself well we have been working on that

1744
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:43,960
itself well we have been working on that
 

1745
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,589
itself well we have been working on that
also since I came to YouTube analyzing

1746
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:46,599
also since I came to YouTube analyzing
 

1747
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,240
also since I came to YouTube analyzing
the content analyzing the content while

the content analyzing the content while
 

1749
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,560
the content analyzing the content while
video right

1750
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:49,570
video right
 

1751
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:54,089
video right
and what I can tell you is that our

1752
00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:54,099
and what I can tell you is that our
 

1753
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,579
and what I can tell you is that our
ability to do it well is still somewhat

1754
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:56,589
ability to do it well is still somewhat
 

1755
00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:01,230
ability to do it well is still somewhat
crude we can we can tell if it's a music

1756
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:01,240
crude we can we can tell if it's a music
 

1757
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,530
crude we can we can tell if it's a music
video

1758
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:01,540
video
 

1759
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,740
video
we can tell if it's a sports video we

1760
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:04,750
we can tell if it's a sports video we
 

1761
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,420
we can tell if it's a sports video we
can probably tell you that people are

1762
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:06,430
can probably tell you that people are
 

1763
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,440
can probably tell you that people are
playing soccer we probably can't tell

1764
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:10,450
playing soccer we probably can't tell
 

1765
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,740
playing soccer we probably can't tell
whether it's Manchester United or my

1766
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:13,750
whether it's Manchester United or my
 

1767
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,230
whether it's Manchester United or my
daughter's soccer team so these things

1768
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,240
daughter's soccer team so these things
 

1769
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,079
daughter's soccer team so these things
are kind of difficult and and using them

1770
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:19,089
are kind of difficult and and using them
 

1771
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:21,480
are kind of difficult and and using them
we can use them in some ways so for

1772
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:21,490
we can use them in some ways so for
 

1773
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,310
we can use them in some ways so for
instance we use that kind of information

1774
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:23,320
instance we use that kind of information
 

1775
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,849
instance we use that kind of information
to understand and inform these clusters

1776
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:26,859
to understand and inform these clusters
 

1777
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:30,960
to understand and inform these clusters
that I talked about and also maybe to

1778
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:30,970
that I talked about and also maybe to
 

1779
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,450
that I talked about and also maybe to
add some words like soccer for instance

1780
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:33,460
add some words like soccer for instance
 

1781
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,339
add some words like soccer for instance
to the video if if it doesn't occur in

is is please help us out with the title
in the description for instance we were

1792
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:49,480
in the description for instance we were
 

1793
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,490
in the description for instance we were
a a few years ago having a live stream

1794
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:53,500
a a few years ago having a live stream

and it was a very important competition
 

1803
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,720
and it was a very important competition
but if you typed World of Warcraft in

1804
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:03,730
but if you typed World of Warcraft in
 

1805
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,280
but if you typed World of Warcraft in
search you wouldn't find it

1806
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,290
search you wouldn't find it
 

1807
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,900
search you wouldn't find it
well the Warcraft wasn't in the title

1808
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:06,910
well the Warcraft wasn't in the title
 

1809

World of Warcraft wasn't in the title it
 

1811
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,520
World of Warcraft wasn't in the title it
was match four seven eight you know a

1812
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:11,530
was match four seven eight you know a
 

1813

wasn't the title yes like come on give

1816
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,390
wasn't the title yes like come on give
 

1817

me being literal being literal on the
 

1819
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,610
me being literal being literal on the
Internet is actually very uncool

1820
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:20,620
Internet is actually very uncool
 

1821
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,060
Internet is actually very uncool
which is the problem oh is that right

1822
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,070
which is the problem oh is that right
 

1823
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,760
which is the problem oh is that right
well I mean in some sense well some of

1824
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:26,770
well I mean in some sense well some of
 

1825
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,140
well I mean in some sense well some of
the greatest videos I mean there's a

1826
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,150
the greatest videos I mean there's a
 

1827
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,510
the greatest videos I mean there's a
humor to just being indirect being witty

1828
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:30,520
humor to just being indirect being witty
 

1829
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,350
humor to just being indirect being witty
and so on and actually being you know

1830
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:34,360
and so on and actually being you know
 

1831
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,970
and so on and actually being you know
machine learning algorithms want you to

1832
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:35,980
machine learning algorithms want you to
 

1833
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,820
machine learning algorithms want you to
be you know literal right usually want

1834
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:38,830
be you know literal right usually want
 

1835
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,370
be you know literal right usually want
to say what's in the thing be very very

1836
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:41,380
to say what's in the thing be very very
 

1837
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,790
to say what's in the thing be very very
simple and in in some sense that gets

1838
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:44,800
simple and in in some sense that gets
 

1839
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,560
simple and in in some sense that gets
away from wit and humor so you have to

1840
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:46,570
away from wit and humor so you have to
 

1841
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,200
away from wit and humor so you have to
play with both right so but you're

1842
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,210
play with both right so but you're
 

1843
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,470
play with both right so but you're
saying that for now sort of the content

1844
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:52,480
saying that for now sort of the content
 

1845
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,580
saying that for now sort of the content
of the title the content of the

1846
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:53,590
of the title the content of the
 

1847
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,550
of the title the content of the
description the actual text is is one of

1848
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:56,560
description the actual text is is one of
 

1849
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,150
description the actual text is is one of
the best ways to uh for the for the

1850
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
the best ways to uh for the for the
 

1851
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,860
the best ways to uh for the for the
algorithm to find your video and put

1852
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:01,870
algorithm to find your video and put
 

1853
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,270
algorithm to find your video and put
them in the right cluster that's right

1854
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:03,280
them in the right cluster that's right
 

1855
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,760
them in the right cluster that's right
and and I would go further and say that

1856
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:05,770
and and I would go further and say that
 

1857
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,940
and and I would go further and say that
if you want people human beings to

1858
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:08,950
if you want people human beings to
 

1859
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,730
if you want people human beings to
select your video in search then it

1860
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:11,740
select your video in search then it
 

1861
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,620
select your video in search then it
helps to have let's say World of

1862
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:13,630
helps to have let's say World of
 

1863
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,770
helps to have let's say World of
Warcraft in the title because why would

1864
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:16,780
Warcraft in the title because why would
 

1865
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,150
Warcraft in the title because why would
a person's you know if they're looking

1866
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,160
a person's you know if they're looking
 

1867
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,800
a person's you know if they're looking
at a bunch they type World of Warcraft

1868
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:19,810
at a bunch they type World of Warcraft
 

1869
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,420
at a bunch they type World of Warcraft
and they have a bunch of videos all of

1870
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:21,430
and they have a bunch of videos all of
 

1871
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,460
and they have a bunch of videos all of
whom say World of Warcraft except the

1872
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:23,470
whom say World of Warcraft except the
 

1873
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,560
whom say World of Warcraft except the
one that you uploaded well even the

1874
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:25,570
one that you uploaded well even the
 

1875
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,270
one that you uploaded well even the
person is gonna think well maybe this

1876
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,280
person is gonna think well maybe this
 

1877
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,040
person is gonna think well maybe this
isn't some house search made a mistake

1878
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,050
isn't some house search made a mistake
 

1879
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,450
isn't some house search made a mistake
this isn't really about World of

1880
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:30,460
this isn't really about World of
 

1881
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,420
this isn't really about World of
Warcraft so it's important not just for

1882
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,430
Warcraft so it's important not just for
 

1883
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,680
Warcraft so it's important not just for
the machine learning systems but also

1884
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:34,690
the machine learning systems but also
 

1885
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,110
the machine learning systems but also
for the people who might be looking for

1886
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,120
for the people who might be looking for
 

1887
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,990
for the people who might be looking for
this sort of thing they get a clue that

1888
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,000
this sort of thing they get a clue that
 

1889
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,510
this sort of thing they get a clue that
it's what they're looking for by seeing

1890
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:42,520
it's what they're looking for by seeing
 

1891
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,270
it's what they're looking for by seeing
that same thing prominently in the title

1892
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,280
that same thing prominently in the title
 

1893
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,310
that same thing prominently in the title
of the video okay let me push back on

1894
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:47,320
of the video okay let me push back on
 

1895
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,810
of the video okay let me push back on
that so I think from the algorithmic

1896
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:48,820
that so I think from the algorithmic
 

1897
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,060
that so I think from the algorithmic
perspective yes but if they typed in

1898
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,070
perspective yes but if they typed in
 

1899
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:54,330
perspective yes but if they typed in
World of Warcraft and saw a video that

1900
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:54,340
World of Warcraft and saw a video that
 

1901
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,990
World of Warcraft and saw a video that
with the title simply winning and and

1902
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,000
with the title simply winning and and
 

1903
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,520
with the title simply winning and and
and the thumbnail has like a sad orc or

1904
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:02,530
and the thumbnail has like a sad orc or
 

1905
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,000
and the thumbnail has like a sad orc or
something I don't know right like I

1906
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,010
something I don't know right like I
 

1907
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:09,870
something I don't know right like I
think that's much it's Iraq it gets your

1908
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:09,880
think that's much it's Iraq it gets your
 

1909
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,720
think that's much it's Iraq it gets your
curiosity up

1910
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:11,730
curiosity up
 

1911
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,430
curiosity up
and then if they could trust that the

1912
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,440
and then if they could trust that the
 

1913
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,230
and then if they could trust that the
algorithm was smart enough to figure out

1914
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:15,240
algorithm was smart enough to figure out
 

1915
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,060
algorithm was smart enough to figure out
somehow that this is indeed a World of

1916
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,070
somehow that this is indeed a World of
 

1917
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,070
somehow that this is indeed a World of
Warcraft video that would have created

1918
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,080
Warcraft video that would have created
 

1919
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,380
Warcraft video that would have created
the most beautiful experience I think in

1920
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:21,390
the most beautiful experience I think in
 

1921
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,210
the most beautiful experience I think in
terms of just the wit and the humor and

1922
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:23,220
terms of just the wit and the humor and
 

1923
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,250
terms of just the wit and the humor and
the curiosity that we human beings

1924
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:25,260
the curiosity that we human beings
 

1925
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,710
the curiosity that we human beings
actually have but you're saying I mean

1926
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
actually have but you're saying I mean
 

1927
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,420
actually have but you're saying I mean
realistically speaking is really hard

1928
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:29,430
realistically speaking is really hard
 

1929
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,370
realistically speaking is really hard
for the algorithm to figure out that the

1930
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,380
for the algorithm to figure out that the
 

1931
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,980
for the algorithm to figure out that the
content of that video will be a world of

1932
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:33,990
content of that video will be a world of
 

1933
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,420
content of that video will be a world of
warcraft and you have to accept that

1934
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:35,430
warcraft and you have to accept that
 

1935
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,740
warcraft and you have to accept that
some people are gonna skip it

1936
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:36,750
some people are gonna skip it
 

1937
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,090
some people are gonna skip it
yeah right I mean and so you're right

1938
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:40,100
yeah right I mean and so you're right
 

1939
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,130
yeah right I mean and so you're right
the people who don't skip it and select

1940
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:43,140
the people who don't skip it and select
 

1941
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,790
the people who don't skip it and select
it are gonna be delighted yeah but other

1942
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:46,800
it are gonna be delighted yeah but other
 

1943
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,710
it are gonna be delighted yeah but other
people say might say but yeah this is

1944
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,720
people say might say but yeah this is
 

1945
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,750
people say might say but yeah this is
not what I was looking for and making

1946
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:50,760
not what I was looking for and making
 

1947
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,700
not what I was looking for and making
stuff discoverable I think is what

1948
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:52,710
stuff discoverable I think is what
 

1949
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,660
stuff discoverable I think is what
you're really working on and hoping so

1950
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:56,670
you're really working on and hoping so
 

1951
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,820
you're really working on and hoping so
yeah so from your perspective to put

1952
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:58,830
yeah so from your perspective to put
 

1953
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,920
yeah so from your perspective to put
stuff in the description and remember

1954
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:00,930
stuff in the description and remember
 

1955
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,230
stuff in the description and remember
the collaborative filtering part of the

1956
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:03,240
the collaborative filtering part of the
 

1957
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,920
the collaborative filtering part of the
system it starts by the same user

1958
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:06,930
system it starts by the same user
 

1959
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,490
system it starts by the same user
watching videos together right so the

1960
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:10,500
watching videos together right so the
 

1961
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,870
watching videos together right so the
way that they're probably going to do

1962
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:11,880
way that they're probably going to do
 

1963
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,300
way that they're probably going to do
that is by searching for them that's a

1964
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:14,310
that is by searching for them that's a
 

1965
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,859
that is by searching for them that's a
fascinating aspect it's like ant

1966
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:15,869
fascinating aspect it's like ant
 

1967
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:17,980
fascinating aspect it's like ant
colonies that's how they find stuff is

1968
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:17,990
colonies that's how they find stuff is
 

1969
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:22,190
colonies that's how they find stuff is
so I mean you would agree for

1970
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:22,200
so I mean you would agree for
 

1971
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,220
so I mean you would agree for
collaborative filtering in general is

1972
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:24,230
collaborative filtering in general is
 

1973
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,330
collaborative filtering in general is
one curious ant

1974
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:26,340
one curious ant
 

1975
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,450
one curious ant
one curious user essential sort of just

1976
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:29,460
one curious user essential sort of just
 

1977
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,550
one curious user essential sort of just
a person who is more willing to click on

1978
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:31,560
a person who is more willing to click on
 

1979
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,800
a person who is more willing to click on
random videos and sort of explore these

1980
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:33,810
random videos and sort of explore these
 

1981
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,070
random videos and sort of explore these
cluster spaces in your sense how many

1982
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:37,080
cluster spaces in your sense how many
 

1983
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,870
cluster spaces in your sense how many
people are just like watching the same

1984
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:38,880
people are just like watching the same
 

1985
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,190
people are just like watching the same
thing over and over and over and over

1986
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,200
thing over and over and over and over
 

1987
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,320
thing over and over and over and over
and how many are just like the explorers

1988
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,330
and how many are just like the explorers
 

1989
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,240
and how many are just like the explorers
I just kind of like click on stuff and

1990
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,250
I just kind of like click on stuff and
 

1991
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,510
I just kind of like click on stuff and
then help help the other ant and the

1992
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
then help help the other ant and the
 

1993
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,150
then help help the other ant and the
ants colony discover the cool stuff do

1994
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
ants colony discover the cool stuff do
 

1995
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,560
ants colony discover the cool stuff do
you have a sense of that or no I really

1996
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:51,570
you have a sense of that or no I really
 

1997
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,570
you have a sense of that or no I really
don't think I have a sense me OK

1998
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:53,580
don't think I have a sense me OK
 

1999
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,090
don't think I have a sense me OK
relative sizes of those groups but I but

2000
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,100
relative sizes of those groups but I but
 

2001
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,280
relative sizes of those groups but I but
I would say that you know people come to

2002
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:58,290
I would say that you know people come to
 

2003
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,660
I would say that you know people come to
YouTube with some certain amount of

YouTube with some certain amount of
 

2005

YouTube with some certain amount of
intent and as long as they to the extent

to which they they try to satisfy that
 

2009
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,990
to which they they try to satisfy that
intent that certainly helps our systems

2010
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:09,000
intent that certainly helps our systems
 

2011
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,750
intent that certainly helps our systems
right because our systems rely on on

00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760
right because our systems rely on on
 

2013
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,540
right because our systems rely on on
kind of a faithful amount of behavior

2014
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:14,550
kind of a faithful amount of behavior
 

2015
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,020
kind of a faithful amount of behavior
the right like and there are people who

2016
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:18,030
the right like and there are people who
 

2017
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,490
the right like and there are people who
try to trick us right there are people

2018
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:19,500
try to trick us right there are people
 

2019
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,030
try to trick us right there are people
and machines that try to associate

2020
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
and machines that try to associate
 

2021
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,009
and machines that try to associate
videos together that

2022
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:25,019
videos together that
 

2023
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:26,749
videos together that
really don't belong together but they're

2024
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:26,759
really don't belong together but they're
 

2025
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:28,429
really don't belong together but they're
trying to get that Association made

2026
00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:28,439
trying to get that Association made
 

2027
00:44:28,439 --> 00:44:31,639
trying to get that Association made
because it's profitable for them and so

2028
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:31,649
because it's profitable for them and so
 

2029
00:44:31,649 --> 00:44:34,189
because it's profitable for them and so
we have to always be resilient to that

2030
00:44:34,189 --> 00:44:34,199
we have to always be resilient to that
 

2031
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:37,809
we have to always be resilient to that
sort of attempt at gaming the system so

2032
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:37,819
sort of attempt at gaming the system so
 

2033
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:39,979
sort of attempt at gaming the system so
speaking to that there's a lot of people

2034
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:39,989
speaking to that there's a lot of people
 

2035
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:42,019
speaking to that there's a lot of people
that in a positive way perhaps I don't

2036
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:42,029
that in a positive way perhaps I don't
 

2037
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:44,329
that in a positive way perhaps I don't
know I I don't like it but I like to

2038
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:44,339
know I I don't like it but I like to
 

2039
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,579
know I I don't like it but I like to
gain want to try to gain the system to

00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:46,589
gain want to try to gain the system to
 

2041
00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:47,569
gain want to try to gain the system to
get more attention and everybody

2042
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:47,579
get more attention and everybody
 

2043
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,299
get more attention and everybody

the door to manipulate the algorithm or
 

2083
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:41,989
the door to manipulate the algorithm or

play with the algorithmic game the
 

2085

algorithm I think that that you can look
 

2087
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:46,519
algorithm I think that that you can look
at it as an attempt to game the

at it as an attempt to game the

algorithm but even if you were to take
 

2091
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:52,279
algorithm but even if you were to take
the algorithm out of it and just say ok

other hand I have other more pop science
 

2125
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:34,519
other hand I have other more pop science
type books and they all have very

2126
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,529
type books and they all have very
 

2127
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:36,519
type books and they all have very
interesting covers right and they have

2128
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:36,529
interesting covers right and they have
 

2129

titles and things like that I mean I

2132
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:40,490
titles and things like that I mean I
 

2133
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,950
titles and things like that I mean I
wouldn't say that they're clickbait II

2134
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:41,960
wouldn't say that they're clickbait II
 

2135
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,790
wouldn't say that they're clickbait II
because they are indeed good books and I

2136
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:45,800
because they are indeed good books and I
 

2137
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,870
because they are indeed good books and I
don't think that they cross any line but

2138
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:48,880
don't think that they cross any line but
 

2139
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,430
don't think that they cross any line but
but you know the that's just a decision

2140
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:51,440
but you know the that's just a decision
 

2141
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,560
but you know the that's just a decision
you have to make right like the people

2142
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:53,570
you have to make right like the people
 

2143
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,290
you have to make right like the people
who who write classical recursion theory

2144

and and you know I don't think there's
 

2159
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,300
and and you know I don't think there's
anything really wrong with that we do we

anything really wrong with that we do we

00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,750
anything really wrong with that we do we
do take steps to make sure that there is

do take steps to make sure that there is
 

2163
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,510
do take steps to make sure that there is
a line that you don't cross and if you

2164
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:25,520
a line that you don't cross and if you
 

2165
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,099
a line that you don't cross and if you
go too far maybe your thumbnails

00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:27,109
go too far maybe your thumbnails
 

2167
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:31,120
go too far maybe your thumbnails
especially racy or or you know it's all

00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:33,740
cats with too many exclamation points we
 

2171
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:40,000
cats with too many exclamation points we
observe that users are kind of you know

2172
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,010
observe that users are kind of you know
 

2173
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,680
observe that users are kind of you know
sometimes offended by that and so so for

2174
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:44,690
sometimes offended by that and so so for
 

2175
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,570
sometimes offended by that and so so for
the users who were offended by that we

2176
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:46,580
the users who were offended by that we
 

2177
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,970
the users who were offended by that we
will then depress or suppress those

2178
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:48,980
will then depress or suppress those
 

2179
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,240
will then depress or suppress those
videos and which reminds me that there's

2180
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,250
videos and which reminds me that there's
 

2181
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,099
videos and which reminds me that there's
also another signal where users can say

2182
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:54,109
also another signal where users can say

00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,550
just just jump out at music I don't
wanna I don't want this and it feels

2198
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:12,560
wanna I don't want this and it feels
 

2199
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,160
wanna I don't want this and it feels
really good to clean that out to be like

2200
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,170
really good to clean that out to be like
 

2201
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,650
really good to clean that out to be like
I don't that's not that's not for me I

2202
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:17,660
I don't that's not that's not for me I
 

2203
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,630
I don't that's not that's not for me I
don't know I think that might have been

2204
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:19,640
don't know I think that might have been
 

2205
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,190
don't know I think that might have been
recently added by this that's also a

2206
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:21,200
recently added by this that's also a
 

2207
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,349
recently added by this that's also a
really strong signal yes absolutely

2208
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:23,359
really strong signal yes absolutely
 

2209
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,609
really strong signal yes absolutely
right we don't want to make a

2210
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:24,619
right we don't want to make a
 

2211
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:28,480
right we don't want to make a
recommendation that people are unhappy

2212
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:28,490
recommendation that people are unhappy
 

2213
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,550
recommendation that people are unhappy
with and that makes me that particular

2214
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:30,560
with and that makes me that particular
 

2215
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,380
with and that makes me that particular
one makes me feel good as a user in

2216
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:32,390
one makes me feel good as a user in
 

2217
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,750
one makes me feel good as a user in
general and as a machine learning person

2218
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:34,760
general and as a machine learning person
 

2219
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,400
general and as a machine learning person
because I feel like I'm helping the

2220
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:36,410
because I feel like I'm helping the
 

2221
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,859
because I feel like I'm helping the
algorithm my interaction I need you

2222
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:38,869
algorithm my interaction I need you
 

2223
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:40,570
algorithm my interaction I need you
don't always feel like I'm helping the

2224
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:40,580
don't always feel like I'm helping the
 

2225
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,220
don't always feel like I'm helping the
algorithm like I'm not reminded of that

2226
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:42,230
algorithm like I'm not reminded of that
 

2227
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,390
algorithm like I'm not reminded of that
fact

2228
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:43,400
fact
 

2229
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,839
fact
like for example Tesla and Otto Pollan

2230
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:46,849
like for example Tesla and Otto Pollan
 

2231
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:49,540
like for example Tesla and Otto Pollan
you know on musk create a feeling for

2232
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:49,550
you know on musk create a feeling for
 

2233
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,160
you know on musk create a feeling for
their customers for people their own

2234
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,170
their customers for people their own
 

2235
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,010
their customers for people their own
test is that there

2236
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:52,020
test is that there
 

2237
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,110
test is that there
helping the algorithm of testify like

2238
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:54,120
helping the algorithm of testify like
 

2239
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,790
helping the algorithm of testify like
they're all like a really proud they're

2240
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:55,800
they're all like a really proud they're
 

2241
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,620
they're all like a really proud they're
helping nicely learn I think YouTube

2242
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:57,630
helping nicely learn I think YouTube
 

2243
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,020
helping nicely learn I think YouTube
doesn't always remind people that you're

2244
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:00,030
doesn't always remind people that you're
 

2245
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,480
doesn't always remind people that you're
helping the algorithm get smarter and

2246
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:02,490
helping the algorithm get smarter and
 

2247
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,270
helping the algorithm get smarter and
for me I love that idea like we're all

2248
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
for me I love that idea like we're all
 

2249
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,310
for me I love that idea like we're all
collaboratively like Wikipedia gives

2250
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:07,320
collaboratively like Wikipedia gives
 

2251

collaboratively like Wikipedia gives
that sense they were all together

2252
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:08,840
that sense they were all together
 

2253
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,240
that sense they were all together
creating a beautiful thing

YouTube is uh doesn't always remind me

2256
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:13,770
YouTube is uh doesn't always remind me
 

2257
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,320
YouTube is uh doesn't always remind me
of that it's uh

2258
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:15,330
of that it's uh
 

2259
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,270
of that it's uh
this conversation is Right any of that

2260
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:17,280
this conversation is Right any of that
 

2261
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,460
this conversation is Right any of that
but well that's a good tip we should

2262
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:19,470
but well that's a good tip we should
 

2263
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,500
but well that's a good tip we should
keep that fact in mind when we design

2264
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:21,510
keep that fact in mind when we design
 

2265
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,420
keep that fact in mind when we design
these features well I I'm not sure I I

2266
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:23,430
these features well I I'm not sure I I
 

2267
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,950
these features well I I'm not sure I I
really thought about it that way but

2268
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:24,960
really thought about it that way but
 

2269
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,980
really thought about it that way but
that's a very interesting perspective

2270
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:26,990
that's a very interesting perspective
 

2271
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,000
that's a very interesting perspective
it's an interesting question of

2272
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,010
it's an interesting question of
 

2273
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:33,710
it's an interesting question of
personalization that I feel like when I

2274
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:33,720
personalization that I feel like when I
 

2275
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,930
personalization that I feel like when I
click like on a video I'm just improving

2276
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:35,940
click like on a video I'm just improving
 

2277
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:41,030
click like on a video I'm just improving
my experience it would be great it would

2278
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
my experience it would be great it would
 

2279
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,680
my experience it would be great it would
make me personally people are different

2280
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:42,690
make me personally people are different
 

2281
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,750
make me personally people are different
but make me feel great if I was helping

2282
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:44,760
but make me feel great if I was helping
 

2283
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,060
but make me feel great if I was helping
also the YouTube algorithm broadly say

2284
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:47,070
also the YouTube algorithm broadly say
 

2285
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,710
also the YouTube algorithm broadly say
something you know saying like there's a

2286
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:48,720
something you know saying like there's a
 

2287
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,690
something you know saying like there's a
that I don't know if that's human nature

2288
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:50,700
that I don't know if that's human nature
 

2289
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,500
that I don't know if that's human nature
we you want the products you love and I

2290
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:54,510
we you want the products you love and I
 

2291
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,660
we you want the products you love and I
certainly love YouTube like you want to

2292
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:56,670
certainly love YouTube like you want to
 

2293
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,730
certainly love YouTube like you want to
help it get smarter and smarter smarter

2294
00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:58,740
help it get smarter and smarter smarter
 

2295
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,680
help it get smarter and smarter smarter
because there's some kind of coupling

2296
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:00,690
because there's some kind of coupling
 

2297
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,250
because there's some kind of coupling
between our lives together being better

2298
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:04,260
between our lives together being better
 

2299
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,290
between our lives together being better
if if YouTube was better than I will my

2300
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:06,300
if if YouTube was better than I will my
 

2301
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,670
if if YouTube was better than I will my
life will be better and that's that kind

2302
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,680
life will be better and that's that kind
 

2303
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,320
life will be better and that's that kind
of reasoning I'm not sure what that is

2304
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:09,330
of reasoning I'm not sure what that is
 

2305
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,610
of reasoning I'm not sure what that is
and I'm not sure how many people share

2306
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:10,620
and I'm not sure how many people share
 

2307
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,070
and I'm not sure how many people share
that feeling it could be just a machine

2308
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:13,080
that feeling it could be just a machine
 

2309
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,560
that feeling it could be just a machine
learning feeling but at that point how

2310
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,570
learning feeling but at that point how
 

2311
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:19,160
learning feeling but at that point how
much personalization is there in terms

2312
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:19,170
much personalization is there in terms
 

2313
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:23,120
much personalization is there in terms
of next video recommendations so is it

2314
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:23,130
of next video recommendations so is it
 

2315
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,620
of next video recommendations so is it
kind of all really boiling down to a

2316
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:26,630
kind of all really boiling down to a
 

2317
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,270
kind of all really boiling down to a
clustering like you find in ears

2318
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:29,280
clustering like you find in ears
 

2319
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,150
clustering like you find in ears
clusters to me and so on and that kind

2320
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,160
clusters to me and so on and that kind
 

2321
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,460
clusters to me and so on and that kind
of thing or how much is person s to me

2322
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:34,470
of thing or how much is person s to me
 

2323
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:37,400
of thing or how much is person s to me
the individual completely it's very very

2324
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:37,410
the individual completely it's very very
 

2325
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,930
the individual completely it's very very
personalized so your experience will be

2326
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:41,940
personalized so your experience will be
 

2327
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,490
personalized so your experience will be
quite a bit different from anybody

2328
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:43,500
quite a bit different from anybody
 

2329
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,430
quite a bit different from anybody
else's who's watching that same video at

2330
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:46,440
else's who's watching that same video at
 

2331
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,210
else's who's watching that same video at
least when they're logged in and the

2332
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:50,220
least when they're logged in and the
 

2333
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,370
least when they're logged in and the
reason is is that we found that that

2334
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:52,380
reason is is that we found that that
 

2335
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,820
reason is is that we found that that
users often want two different kinds of

2336
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:55,830
users often want two different kinds of
 

2337
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,250
users often want two different kinds of
things when they're watching a video

2338
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:57,260
things when they're watching a video
 

2339
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,200
things when they're watching a video
sometimes they want to keep watching

2340
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,210
sometimes they want to keep watching
 

2341
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:03,380
sometimes they want to keep watching
more on that topic or more in that genre

2342
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:03,390
more on that topic or more in that genre
 

2343
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,410
more on that topic or more in that genre
and other times they just

2344
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:06,420
and other times they just
 

2345
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,970
and other times they just
are done and they're ready to move on to

2346
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:07,980
are done and they're ready to move on to
 

2347
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,160
are done and they're ready to move on to
something else and so the question is

2348
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,170
something else and so the question is
 

2349
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:14,720
something else and so the question is
well what is this something else and one

2350
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:14,730
well what is this something else and one
 

2351
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,190
well what is this something else and one
of the first things one can imagine is

2352
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:16,200
of the first things one can imagine is
 

2353
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,070
of the first things one can imagine is
well maybe something else is the latest

2354
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:19,080
well maybe something else is the latest
 

2355
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,630
well maybe something else is the latest
video from some channel to which you've

2356
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
video from some channel to which you've
 

2357
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,450
video from some channel to which you've
subscribed and that's gonna be very

2358
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:23,460
subscribed and that's gonna be very
 

2359
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,760
subscribed and that's gonna be very
different from for you than it is for me

2360
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:25,770
different from for you than it is for me
 

2361
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,820
different from for you than it is for me
right and and even if it's not something

2362
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:28,830
right and and even if it's not something
 

2363
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,140
right and and even if it's not something
that you subscribe to it's something

2364
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,150
that you subscribe to it's something
 

2365
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,700
that you subscribe to it's something
that you watch a lot and again that'll

2366
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:31,710
that you watch a lot and again that'll
 

2367
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,650
that you watch a lot and again that'll
be very different on a person-by-person

2368
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:33,660
be very different on a person-by-person
 

2369
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:40,130
be very different on a person-by-person
basis and so even the watch next as well

2370
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:40,140
basis and so even the watch next as well
 

2371
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,540
basis and so even the watch next as well
as the homepage of course is quite

2372
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:41,550
as the homepage of course is quite
 

2373
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,710
as the homepage of course is quite
personalized so what we met some of the

2374
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:45,720
personalized so what we met some of the
 

2375
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,360
personalized so what we met some of the
signals but what a success look like

2376
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:47,370
signals but what a success look like
 

2377
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,430
signals but what a success look like
what a success look like in terms of the

2378
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:49,440
what a success look like in terms of the
 

2379
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,620
what a success look like in terms of the
algorithm creating a great long-term

2380
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:51,630
algorithm creating a great long-term
 

2381
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:54,620
algorithm creating a great long-term
experience for a user or put another way

2382
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:54,630
experience for a user or put another way
 

2383
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:57,950
experience for a user or put another way
if you look at the videos I've watched

2384
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:57,960
if you look at the videos I've watched
 

2385
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,890
if you look at the videos I've watched
this month how do you know the algorithm

2386
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:00,900
this month how do you know the algorithm
 

2387
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,910
this month how do you know the algorithm
succeeded for me I think first of all if

2388
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:04,920
succeeded for me I think first of all if
 

2389
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,280
succeeded for me I think first of all if
you come back and watch more YouTube

2390
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:07,290
you come back and watch more YouTube
 

2391
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,380
you come back and watch more YouTube
then that's one indication that you've

2392
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:09,390
then that's one indication that you've
 

2393
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:11,420
then that's one indication that you've
found some value from it so just the

2394
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:11,430
found some value from it so just the
 

2395
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,310
found some value from it so just the
number of hours is a powerful indicator

2396
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:13,320
number of hours is a powerful indicator
 

2397
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,380
number of hours is a powerful indicator
well I mean not the hours themselves but

2398
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:17,390
well I mean not the hours themselves but
 

2399
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:21,190
well I mean not the hours themselves but
the fact that you return on another day

2400
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:21,200
the fact that you return on another day
 

2401
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,530
the fact that you return on another day
so that's probably the most simple

2402
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:24,540
so that's probably the most simple
 

2403
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,140
so that's probably the most simple
indicator people don't come back to

2404
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,150
indicator people don't come back to
 

2405
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,790
indicator people don't come back to
things that they don't find value in

2406
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:28,800
things that they don't find value in
 

2407
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,290
things that they don't find value in
right there's a lot of other things that

2408
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:30,300
right there's a lot of other things that
 

2409
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,800
right there's a lot of other things that
they could do but like I said I mean

2410
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:33,810
they could do but like I said I mean
 

2411
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,870
they could do but like I said I mean
ideally we would like everybody to feel

2412
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:35,880
ideally we would like everybody to feel
 

2413
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,510
ideally we would like everybody to feel
that YouTube enriches their lives and

2414
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:38,520
that YouTube enriches their lives and
 

2415
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,370
that YouTube enriches their lives and
that every video they watched is the

2416
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:40,380
that every video they watched is the
 

2417
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,740
that every video they watched is the
best one they've ever watched since

2418
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:42,750
best one they've ever watched since
 

2419
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,050
best one they've ever watched since
they've started watching YouTube and so

2420
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:45,060
they've started watching YouTube and so
 

2421
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,860
they've started watching YouTube and so
that's why we survey them and ask them

2422
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:48,870
that's why we survey them and ask them
 

2423
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:53,150
that's why we survey them and ask them
like is this one to five stars and so

2424
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:53,160
like is this one to five stars and so
 

2425
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,660
like is this one to five stars and so
our version of success is every time

2426
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:56,670
our version of success is every time
 

2427
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,220
our version of success is every time
someone takes that survey they say it's

2428
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,230
someone takes that survey they say it's
 

2429
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,610
someone takes that survey they say it's
five stars and if we ask them is this

2430
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:01,620
five stars and if we ask them is this
 

2431
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:03,140
five stars and if we ask them is this
the best video you've ever seen on

2432
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,150
the best video you've ever seen on
 

2433
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,630
the best video you've ever seen on
YouTube they say yes every single time

2434
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:05,640
YouTube they say yes every single time
 

2435
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,510
YouTube they say yes every single time
so it's hard to imagine that we would

2436
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:08,520
so it's hard to imagine that we would
 

2437
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,740
so it's hard to imagine that we would
actually achieve that maybe

2438
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:09,750
actually achieve that maybe
 

2439
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,220
actually achieve that maybe
asymptotically we would get there but

2440
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,230
asymptotically we would get there but
 

2441
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,050
asymptotically we would get there but
but that would be what we think success

2442
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:15,060
but that would be what we think success
 

2443
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,220
but that would be what we think success
is it's funny have recently said some

2444
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:19,230
is it's funny have recently said some
 

2445
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:19,559
is it's funny have recently said some
way

2446
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:19,569
way
 

2447
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:22,620
way
I don't know maybe tweeted but that Ray

2448
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:22,630
I don't know maybe tweeted but that Ray
 

2449
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:26,219
I don't know maybe tweeted but that Ray
Dalio has this video on the economic

2450
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:26,229
Dalio has this video on the economic
 

2451
00:53:26,229 --> 00:53:27,839
Dalio has this video on the economic
machine I forget what it's called but

2452
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:27,849
machine I forget what it's called but
 

2453
00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:29,699
machine I forget what it's called but
it's a 30-minute video and I said it's

2454
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:29,709
it's a 30-minute video and I said it's
 

2455
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:31,289
it's a 30-minute video and I said it's
the the greatest video I've ever watched

2456
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:31,299
the the greatest video I've ever watched
 

2457
00:53:31,299 --> 00:53:33,839
the the greatest video I've ever watched
on YouTube it's it's like I watched the

2458
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:33,849
on YouTube it's it's like I watched the
 

2459
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:36,059
on YouTube it's it's like I watched the
whole thing and my mind was blown is a

2460
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:36,069
whole thing and my mind was blown is a
 

2461
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:38,880
whole thing and my mind was blown is a
very crisp clean description of how the

2462
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:38,890
very crisp clean description of how the
 

2463
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,680
very crisp clean description of how the
at least the American economic system

2464
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:40,690
at least the American economic system
 

2465
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:41,009
at least the American economic system
works

2466
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:41,019
works

it's a beautiful video and I was just I

wanted to click on something to say this
 

2471
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:48,209
wanted to click on something to say this
is the best thing this is the best thing

00:53:48,219 --> 00:53:50,219
is the best thing this is the best thing
ever please let me I can't believe I

2474
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:50,229
ever please let me I can't believe I
 

2475
00:53:50,229 --> 00:53:53,039
ever please let me I can't believe I
discovered it I mean the the views and

2476
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:53,049
discovered it I mean the the views and
 

2477
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:56,309
discovered it I mean the the views and
the likes reflect its quality but I was

2478
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
the likes reflect its quality but I was
 

2479
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,809
the likes reflect its quality but I was
almost upset that I haven't found it

2480
00:53:57,809 --> 00:53:57,819
almost upset that I haven't found it
 

2481
00:53:57,819 --> 00:53:59,430
almost upset that I haven't found it
earlier and wanted to find other things

2482
00:53:59,430 --> 00:53:59,440
earlier and wanted to find other things
 

2483
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,130
earlier and wanted to find other things
like it I don't think I've ever felt

2484
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:02,140
like it I don't think I've ever felt
 

2485
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,410
like it I don't think I've ever felt
that this is the best video ever and

2486
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:04,420
that this is the best video ever and
 

2487
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,459
that this is the best video ever and
that was that and to me the ultimate

2488
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:07,469
that was that and to me the ultimate
 

2489
00:54:07,469 --> 00:54:10,079
that was that and to me the ultimate
utopia the best experiences were every

2490
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:10,089
utopia the best experiences were every
 

2491
00:54:10,089 --> 00:54:12,299
utopia the best experiences were every
single video where I don't see any of

2492
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:12,309
single video where I don't see any of
 

2493
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:14,160
single video where I don't see any of
the videos I regret in every single

2494
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,170
the videos I regret in every single
 

2495
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,799
the videos I regret in every single
video I watch is one that actually helps

2496
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:16,809
video I watch is one that actually helps
 

2497
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:20,160
video I watch is one that actually helps
me grow helps me enjoy life be happy and

2498
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,170
me grow helps me enjoy life be happy and
 

2499
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:26,189
me grow helps me enjoy life be happy and
so on well so that's that's that's a

2500
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:26,199
so on well so that's that's that's a
 

2501
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:29,219
so on well so that's that's that's a
heck of uh the thought that's one of the

2502
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:29,229
heck of uh the thought that's one of the
 

2503

2507
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,709
machine learning tasks so when you look
at a society as opposed to any

2508
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:34,719
at a society as opposed to any
 

2509
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:35,819
at a society as opposed to any
individual user

2510
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:35,829

you know openness has had an impact on
society already there's a lot of what do

2530

society already there's a lot of what do
 

2531
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,699
society already there's a lot of what do
you mean by openness well the fact that

2532
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:07,709
you mean by openness well the fact that
 

2533
00:55:07,709 --> 00:55:12,599
you mean by openness well the fact that
unlike other mediums there's not someone

2534
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:12,609
unlike other mediums there's not someone
 

2535
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,870
unlike other mediums there's not someone
sitting at YouTube who decides before

2536
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:15,880
sitting at YouTube who decides before
 

2537
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,430
sitting at YouTube who decides before
you can upload your video whether it's

2538
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:17,440
you can upload your video whether it's
 

2539
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,469
you can upload your video whether it's
worth having you uploaded

2540
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:19,479
worth having you uploaded
 

2541
00:55:19,479 --> 00:55:21,959
worth having you uploaded
or worth anybody seeing it really right

2542
00:55:21,959 --> 00:55:21,969
or worth anybody seeing it really right
 

2543
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:25,979
or worth anybody seeing it really right
and so you know there are some creators

2544
00:55:25,979 --> 00:55:25,989
and so you know there are some creators
 

2545
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,339
and so you know there are some creators
who say like I I wouldn't have this

2546
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:29,349
who say like I I wouldn't have this
 

2547
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:31,890
who say like I I wouldn't have this
opportunity to

2548
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:31,900
opportunity to
 

2549
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,849
opportunity to
to reach an audience Tyler Oakley often

2550
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:35,859
to reach an audience Tyler Oakley often
 

2551
00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:37,380
to reach an audience Tyler Oakley often
said that you know he wouldn't have had

2552
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:37,390
said that you know he wouldn't have had
 

2553
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,120
said that you know he wouldn't have had
this opportunity to reach this audience

2554
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:39,130
this opportunity to reach this audience
 

2555
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:44,190
this opportunity to reach this audience
if it weren't for YouTube and and so I

2556
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:44,200
if it weren't for YouTube and and so I
 

2557
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,890
if it weren't for YouTube and and so I
think that's one way in which YouTube

2558
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:46,900
think that's one way in which YouTube
 

2559
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,940
think that's one way in which YouTube
has changed Society I know that there

2560
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:50,950
has changed Society I know that there
 

2561
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,970
has changed Society I know that there
are people that I work with from outside

2562
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:53,980
are people that I work with from outside
 

2563
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,549
are people that I work with from outside
the United States especially from places

2564
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
the United States especially from places
 

2565
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,680
the United States especially from places
where literacy is low and they think

2566
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:01,690
where literacy is low and they think
 

2567
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,630
where literacy is low and they think
that YouTube can help in those places

2568
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:03,640
that YouTube can help in those places
 

2569
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,789
that YouTube can help in those places
because you don't need to be able to

2570
00:56:05,789 --> 00:56:05,799
because you don't need to be able to
 

2571
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:07,650
because you don't need to be able to
read and write in order to learn

2572
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:07,660
read and write in order to learn
 

2573
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,670
read and write in order to learn
something important for your life maybe

2574
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:10,680
something important for your life maybe
 

2575
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,890
something important for your life maybe
you know how to do some job or how to

2576
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:13,900
you know how to do some job or how to
 

2577
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,499
you know how to do some job or how to
fix something and so that's another way

2578
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:16,509
fix something and so that's another way
 

2579
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:19,440
fix something and so that's another way
in which I think YouTube is possibly

2580
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:19,450
in which I think YouTube is possibly
 

2581
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,589
in which I think YouTube is possibly
changing society so I've worked at

2582
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:22,599
changing society so I've worked at
 

2583
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:24,900
changing society so I've worked at
YouTube for eight almost nine years now

2584
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:24,910

2586
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:28,930
and it's fun because I meet people and
 

2587
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,170
and it's fun because I meet people and
you know you tell them where they where

2588
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,180

that they found on YouTube and that they

2616
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:05,319
that they found on YouTube and that they
 

2617
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:10,019
that they found on YouTube and that they
just loved yeah and so that has made me

2618

just loved yeah and so that has made me
 

2619
00:57:10,029 --> 00:57:13,799

realize that YouTube is really about the

2620
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:13,809
realize that YouTube is really about the
 

2621
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:18,150
realize that YouTube is really about the
video and connecting the people with the

2622
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:18,160
video and connecting the people with the
 

2623
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,910
video and connecting the people with the
videos and then everything else kind of

2624
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:20,920
videos and then everything else kind of
 

2625
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,029
videos and then everything else kind of
gets out of the way so beyond the video

2626
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:24,039
gets out of the way so beyond the video
 

2627
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:25,319
gets out of the way so beyond the video
it's an interesting because you kind of

2628
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:25,329
it's an interesting because you kind of
 

2629
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:29,400
it's an interesting because you kind of
mentioned creator what about the

2630
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:29,410
mentioned creator what about the
 

2631
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:30,779
mentioned creator what about the
connection with just the individual

2632
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:30,789
connection with just the individual
 

2633
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:34,039
connection with just the individual
creators as opposed to just individual

2634
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:34,049

brought up creator versus video the
reason why creator channel is so

2682
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:31,450
reason why creator channel is so
 

2683
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:35,910
reason why creator channel is so
important is because if we have a hope

I think this connection between fans and

2716
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:21,070
I think this connection between fans and
 

2717
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:25,140
I think this connection between fans and
creators so important for both because

2718
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:25,150
creators so important for both because
 

2719
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:29,220
creators so important for both because

and interesting question in general and

2726
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:38,290
and interesting question in general and
 

2727
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:41,160
and interesting question in general and
again a topic that you or nobody has an

2733
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,870
of you know it gives us highs and gives
us lows in the sense that so creators

2734
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:51,880
us lows in the sense that so creators
 

2735
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,480
us lows in the sense that so creators
often speak about having sort of burn

2736
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:54,490
often speak about having sort of burn
 

2737
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,200

2739
00:59:58,210 --> 00:59:58,530
burn out and having psychological ups
and

2740
00:59:58,530 --> 00:59:58,540
and
 

2741
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,540
and
and challenges mentally in terms of

2742
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:00,550
and challenges mentally in terms of
 

2743
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,790
and challenges mentally in terms of
continuing the creation process there's

2744
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:02,800
continuing the creation process there's
 

2745
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,830
continuing the creation process there's
a momentum there's a huge excited

2746
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:04,840
a momentum there's a huge excited
 

2747
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,630
a momentum there's a huge excited
audience that makes everybody feel that

2748
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
audience that makes everybody feel that
 

2749
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,420
audience that makes everybody feel that
makes creators feel great and I think

2751
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,430
makes creators feel great and I think
it's more than just financial

2752
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440
it's more than just financial
 

2753
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,730
it's more than just financial
I think it's literally just they love

2754
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:14,740
I think it's literally just they love
 

2755
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,740
I think it's literally just they love
that sense of community it's part of the

2756
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:16,750
that sense of community it's part of the
 

2757
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,870
that sense of community it's part of the
reason I upload to YouTube I don't care

2758
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:18,880
reason I upload to YouTube I don't care
 

2759
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,060
reason I upload to YouTube I don't care
about money never well what I care about

2760
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:21,070
about money never well what I care about
 

2761
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,640
about money never well what I care about
is the community but some people feel

2762
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:23,650
is the community but some people feel
 

2763
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:26,610
is the community but some people feel
like this momentum and even when there's

2764
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:26,620
like this momentum and even when there's
 

2765
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,820
like this momentum and even when there's
times in their life when they don't feel

2766
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:28,830
times in their life when they don't feel
 

2767

2770
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:33,210
like creating so how do you think about
 

2771
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:36,660
like creating so how do you think about
burnout this mental exhaustion that some

2772
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:36,670
burnout this mental exhaustion that some
 

2773
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,640
burnout this mental exhaustion that some
YouTube creators go through that's

2774
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:38,650
YouTube creators go through that's
 

2775
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:40,710
YouTube creators go through that's
something we have an answer for is that

2776
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:40,720
something we have an answer for is that
 

2777
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,330
something we have an answer for is that
something how do we even think about

2778
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:42,340
something how do we even think about
 

2779
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,890
something how do we even think about
that well the first thing is we want to

2780
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:43,900
that well the first thing is we want to
 

2781
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,680
that well the first thing is we want to
make sure that the YouTube systems are

2782
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:46,690
make sure that the YouTube systems are
 

2783
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:49,170
make sure that the YouTube systems are
not contributing to this sense right and

2784
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:49,180
not contributing to this sense right and
 

2785
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,100
not contributing to this sense right and
so we've done a fair amount of research

2786
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:52,110
so we've done a fair amount of research
 

2787
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:56,490
so we've done a fair amount of research
to demonstrate that you can absolutely

2788
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:56,500
to demonstrate that you can absolutely
 

2789
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,280
to demonstrate that you can absolutely
take a break if you are a creator and

2790
01:00:59,280 --> 01:00:59,290
take a break if you are a creator and
 

2791
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,860
take a break if you are a creator and
you've been uploading a lot we have just

2792
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:01,870
you've been uploading a lot we have just
 

2793
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,960
you've been uploading a lot we have just
as many examples of people who took a

2794
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:03,970
as many examples of people who took a
 

2795
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,840
as many examples of people who took a
break and came back more popular than

2796
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:06,850
break and came back more popular than
 

2797
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,940
break and came back more popular than
they were before as we have examples of

2798
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:08,950
they were before as we have examples of
 

2799
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:09,870
they were before as we have examples of
going the other way

2800
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:09,880
going the other way
 

2801
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,280
going the other way
yeah can we pause on that for a second

2802
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:11,290
yeah can we pause on that for a second
 

2803
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:12,960
yeah can we pause on that for a second
so the feeling that people have I think

2804
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:12,970
so the feeling that people have I think
 

2805
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:17,220
so the feeling that people have I think
is if I take a break everybody well the

2806
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:17,230
is if I take a break everybody well the
 

2807
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:20,730
is if I take a break everybody well the
party will leave right so if you can

2808
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:20,740
party will leave right so if you can
 

2809
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,410
party will leave right so if you can
just linger on that so in your sense

2810
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:22,420
just linger on that so in your sense
 

2811
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:25,200
just linger on that so in your sense
that taking a break is okay yes taking a

2812
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:25,210
that taking a break is okay yes taking a
 

2813
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:28,380
that taking a break is okay yes taking a
break is absolutely okay and the reason

2814
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:28,390
break is absolutely okay and the reason
 

2815
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:31,890
break is absolutely okay and the reason
I say that is because we have we can

2816
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:31,900
I say that is because we have we can
 

2817
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,520
I say that is because we have we can
observe many examples of being of

2818
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:34,530
observe many examples of being of
 

2819
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:38,250
observe many examples of being of
creators coming back very strong and

2820
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:38,260
creators coming back very strong and
 

2821
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,500
creators coming back very strong and
even stronger after they have taken some

2822
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:40,510
even stronger after they have taken some
 

2823
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,900
even stronger after they have taken some
sort of break and so I just want to

2824
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:42,910
sort of break and so I just want to
 

2825
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:47,150
sort of break and so I just want to
dispel the myth that this somehow

2826
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:47,160
dispel the myth that this somehow
 

2827
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,610
dispel the myth that this somehow
necessarily means that your channel is

2828
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:50,620
necessarily means that your channel is
 

2829
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:53,790
necessarily means that your channel is
gonna go down or lose views that is not

2830
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:53,800
gonna go down or lose views that is not
 

2831
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,940
gonna go down or lose views that is not
the case we know for sure that this is

2832
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:56,950
the case we know for sure that this is
 

2833
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:00,510
the case we know for sure that this is
not a necessary outcome and so we we

2834
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:00,520
not a necessary outcome and so we we
 

2835
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,250
not a necessary outcome and so we we
want to encourage people to make sure

2836
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:02,260
want to encourage people to make sure
 

2837
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,960
want to encourage people to make sure
that they take care of themselves that

2838
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:03,970
that they take care of themselves that
 

2839
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,540
that they take care of themselves that
is job one right you you have to look

2840
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:06,550
is job one right you you have to look
 

2841
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:08,630
is job one right you you have to look
after yourself and your mental health

2842
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:08,640
after yourself and your mental health
 

2843
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,900
after yourself and your mental health
and you know I think that

2844
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:11,910
and you know I think that
 

2845
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:15,400
and you know I think that
it probably in some of these cases

2846
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:15,410
it probably in some of these cases
 

2847
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:19,190
it probably in some of these cases
contributes to better videos once they

2848
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,200
contributes to better videos once they
 

2849
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,900
contributes to better videos once they
come back right because a lot of people

2850
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:20,910
come back right because a lot of people
 

2851
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,299
come back right because a lot of people
I mean I know myself if I'm burn out on

2852
01:02:23,299 --> 01:02:23,309
I mean I know myself if I'm burn out on
 

2853
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:24,950
I mean I know myself if I'm burn out on
something that I'm probably not doing my

2854
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
something that I'm probably not doing my
 

2855
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,079
something that I'm probably not doing my
best work even though I can keep working

2856
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:27,089
best work even though I can keep working
 

2857
01:02:27,089 --> 01:02:32,240
best work even though I can keep working
until I pass out and so I think that the

2858
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:32,250
until I pass out and so I think that the
 

2859
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:35,960
until I pass out and so I think that the
the taking a break may even improve the

2860
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:35,970
the taking a break may even improve the
 

2861
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,680
the taking a break may even improve the
creative ideas that someone has okay I

2862
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:39,690
creative ideas that someone has okay I
 

2863
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,210
creative ideas that someone has okay I
think it's a really important thing to

2864
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:41,220
think it's a really important thing to
 

2865
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,520
think it's a really important thing to
sort of to dispel I think it applies to

2866
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:43,530
sort of to dispel I think it applies to
 

2867
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,460
sort of to dispel I think it applies to
all of social media like literally I've

2868
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:46,470
all of social media like literally I've
 

2869
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,260
all of social media like literally I've
taken a break for a day every once in a

2870
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:48,270
taken a break for a day every once in a
 

2871
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:52,970
taken a break for a day every once in a
while sorry sorry that sounds like a

2872
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:52,980
while sorry sorry that sounds like a
 

2873
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,809
while sorry sorry that sounds like a
short time but even like sorry email

2874
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:56,819
short time but even like sorry email
 

2875
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:58,579
short time but even like sorry email
just taking a break from email or only

2876
01:02:58,579 --> 01:02:58,589
just taking a break from email or only
 

2877
01:02:58,589 --> 01:03:01,220
just taking a break from email or only
checking email once a day especially

2878
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:01,230
checking email once a day especially
 

2879
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,329
checking email once a day especially
when you're going through something

2880
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:02,339
when you're going through something
 

2881
01:03:02,339 --> 01:03:03,920
when you're going through something
psychologically in your personal life or

2882
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:03,930
psychologically in your personal life or
 

2883
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:06,470
psychologically in your personal life or
so on or really not sleeping much

2884
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
so on or really not sleeping much
 

2885
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,960
so on or really not sleeping much
because it work deadlines it can refresh

2886
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:08,970
because it work deadlines it can refresh

2889
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,500
you in a way that's that's profound and
so the same applies there when you came

2890
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:12,510
so the same applies there when you came
 

2891
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:15,470
so the same applies there when you came
back right it's there and it looks

2892
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:15,480
back right it's there and it looks
 

2893
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,089
back right it's there and it looks
different actually when you come back

2894
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:17,099
different actually when you come back
 

2895
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:19,819

everything the world looks better so
 

2899
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:24,410
everything the world looks better so
it's important to take a break when you

like well we don't usually think about
it as the algorithm because it's a bunch

it as the algorithm because it's a bunch

01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:36,489
YouTube algorithm from outside of
YouTube is actually a you know a bunch

2954
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:36,499
YouTube is actually a you know a bunch
 

2955
01:04:36,499 --> 01:04:38,709
YouTube is actually a you know a bunch
of code and machine learning systems and

2956
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:38,719
of code and machine learning systems and
 

2957
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:41,890
of code and machine learning systems and
heuristics but that's married with the

2958
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:41,900
heuristics but that's married with the
 

2959
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,809
heuristics but that's married with the
behavior of all the people who come to

2960
01:04:43,809 --> 01:04:43,819
behavior of all the people who come to
 

2961
01:04:43,819 --> 01:04:45,640
behavior of all the people who come to
YouTube every day so the people part of

2962
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:45,650
YouTube every day so the people part of
 

2963
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:47,739
YouTube every day so the people part of
the code Accession exactly right like if

2964
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:47,749
the code Accession exactly right like if
 

2965
01:04:47,749 --> 01:04:49,329
the code Accession exactly right like if
there were no people who came to youtube

2966
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:49,339
there were no people who came to youtube
 

2967
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:51,069
there were no people who came to youtube
tomorrow then there the algorithm

2968
01:04:51,069 --> 01:04:51,079
tomorrow then there the algorithm
 

2969
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:52,959
tomorrow then there the algorithm
wouldn't work anymore right so that's a

2970
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:52,969
wouldn't work anymore right so that's a
 

2971
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:55,660
wouldn't work anymore right so that's a
critical part of the algorithm and so

2972
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:55,670
critical part of the algorithm and so
 

2973
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:56,979
critical part of the algorithm and so
when people talk about well the

2974
01:04:56,979 --> 01:04:56,989
when people talk about well the
 

2975
01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:58,630
when people talk about well the
algorithm does this the algorithm does

2976
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:58,640
algorithm does this the algorithm does
 

2977
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,999
algorithm does this the algorithm does
that it's sometimes hard to understand

2978
01:05:00,999 --> 01:05:01,009
that it's sometimes hard to understand
 

2979
01:05:01,009 --> 01:05:03,099
that it's sometimes hard to understand
well you know it could be the the

2980
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:03,109
well you know it could be the the
 

2981
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:05,289
well you know it could be the the
viewers are doing that and the algorithm

2982
01:05:05,289 --> 01:05:05,299
viewers are doing that and the algorithm
 

2983
01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:07,839
viewers are doing that and the algorithm
is mostly just keeping track of what the

2984
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:07,849
is mostly just keeping track of what the
 

2985
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:10,719
is mostly just keeping track of what the
viewers do and then reacting to those

2986
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:10,729
viewers do and then reacting to those
 

2987
01:05:10,729 --> 01:05:14,739
viewers do and then reacting to those
things in in sort of more fine-grained

2988
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:14,749
things in in sort of more fine-grained
 

2989
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:16,900
things in in sort of more fine-grained
situations and I and I think that this

2990
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:16,910
situations and I and I think that this
 

2991
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:20,019
situations and I and I think that this
is the way that the recommendation

2992
01:05:20,019 --> 01:05:20,029
is the way that the recommendation
 

2993
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:21,609
is the way that the recommendation
system and the search system and and

2994
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:21,619
system and the search system and and
 

2995
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:23,890
system and the search system and and
probably many machine learning systems

2996
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:23,900
probably many machine learning systems
 

2997
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,979
probably many machine learning systems
evolve is you know you start trying to

2998
01:05:26,979 --> 01:05:26,989
evolve is you know you start trying to
 

2999
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,959
evolve is you know you start trying to
solve a problem and the first way to

3000
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:28,969
solve a problem and the first way to
 

3001
01:05:28,969 --> 01:05:32,049
solve a problem and the first way to
solve a problem is often with a simple

3002
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:32,059
solve a problem is often with a simple
 

3003
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:34,930
solve a problem is often with a simple
heuristic right and and you know you

3004
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:34,940
heuristic right and and you know you
 

3005
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:36,069
heuristic right and and you know you
want to say what are the videos we're

3006
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:36,079
want to say what are the videos we're
 

3007
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,199
want to say what are the videos we're
gonna recommend well how about the most

3008
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:38,209
gonna recommend well how about the most
 

3009
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:40,809
gonna recommend well how about the most
popular ones weighted that's where you

3010
01:05:40,809 --> 01:05:40,819
popular ones weighted that's where you
 

3011
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:45,999
popular ones weighted that's where you
start and and over time you collect some

3012
01:05:45,999 --> 01:05:46,009
start and and over time you collect some
 

3013
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:48,279
start and and over time you collect some
data and you refine your situations so

3014
01:05:48,279 --> 01:05:48,289
data and you refine your situations so
 

3015
01:05:48,289 --> 01:05:50,049
data and you refine your situations so
that you're making less heuristics and

3016
01:05:50,049 --> 01:05:50,059
that you're making less heuristics and
 

3017
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:52,390
that you're making less heuristics and
you're you're building a system that can

3018
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:52,400
you're you're building a system that can
 

3019
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,519
you're you're building a system that can
actually learn what to do in different

3020
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:54,529
actually learn what to do in different
 

3021
01:05:54,529 --> 01:05:57,459
actually learn what to do in different
situations based on some observations of

3022
01:05:57,459 --> 01:05:57,469
situations based on some observations of
 

3023
01:05:57,469 --> 01:06:00,910
situations based on some observations of
those situations in the past and and you

3024
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:00,920
those situations in the past and and you
 

3025
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,559
those situations in the past and and you
keep chipping away at these heuristics

3026
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:02,569
keep chipping away at these heuristics
 

3027
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:06,370
keep chipping away at these heuristics
over time and so I think that just like

3028
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:06,380
over time and so I think that just like
 

3029
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,410
over time and so I think that just like
with diversity you know I think the

3030
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:08,420
with diversity you know I think the
 

3031
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,349
with diversity you know I think the
first diversity measure we took was okay

3032
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:11,359
first diversity measure we took was okay
 

3033
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,930
first diversity measure we took was okay
not more than three videos in a row from

3034
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:13,940
not more than three videos in a row from
 

3035
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,789
not more than three videos in a row from
the same Channel right it's a pretty

3036
01:06:15,789 --> 01:06:15,799
the same Channel right it's a pretty
 

3037
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:18,279
the same Channel right it's a pretty
simple heuristic to encourage diversity

3038
01:06:18,279 --> 01:06:18,289
simple heuristic to encourage diversity
 

3039
01:06:18,289 --> 01:06:21,519
simple heuristic to encourage diversity
it worked right you needs to see four or

3040
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:21,529
it worked right you needs to see four or
 

3041
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:23,589
it worked right you needs to see four or
five six videos in a row from the same

3042
01:06:23,589 --> 01:06:23,599
five six videos in a row from the same
 

3043
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,519
five six videos in a row from the same
Channel and over time we try to chip

3044
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:27,529
Channel and over time we try to chip
 

3045
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:29,170
Channel and over time we try to chip
away at that it and make it more

3046
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:29,180
away at that it and make it more
 

3047
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:32,549
away at that it and make it more
fine-grain and basically have it

3048
01:06:32,549 --> 01:06:32,559
fine-grain and basically have it
 

3049
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,309
fine-grain and basically have it
remove the heuristics in favor of

3050
01:06:35,309 --> 01:06:35,319
remove the heuristics in favor of
 

3051
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:37,940
remove the heuristics in favor of
something that can react to

3052
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:37,950
something that can react to
 

3053
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:41,390
something that can react to
individuals and individual situations so

3054
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:41,400
individuals and individual situations so
 

3055
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,870
individuals and individual situations so
how do you you mentioned you know we we

3056
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:44,880
how do you you mentioned you know we we
 

3057
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,880
how do you you mentioned you know we we
know that something worked how do you

3058
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:46,890
know that something worked how do you
 

3059
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:49,340
know that something worked how do you
get a sense when decisions of a kind of

3060
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:49,350
get a sense when decisions of a kind of
 

3061
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:52,100
get a sense when decisions of a kind of
a be testing that this idea was a good

3062
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:52,110
a be testing that this idea was a good
 

3063
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:55,310
a be testing that this idea was a good
one this was not so good what's how do

3064
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:55,320
one this was not so good what's how do
 

3065
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,330
one this was not so good what's how do
you measure that

3066
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:56,340
you measure that
 

3067
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,480
you measure that
and across which time scale across how

3068
01:06:59,480 --> 01:06:59,490
and across which time scale across how
 

3069
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:01,430
and across which time scale across how
many users that kind of that kind of

3070
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,440
many users that kind of that kind of
 

3071
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,530
many users that kind of that kind of
thing well you mentioned that a B

3072
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:03,540
thing well you mentioned that a B
 

3073
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,860
thing well you mentioned that a B
experiments and so just about every

3074
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:06,870
experiments and so just about every
 

3075
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:10,130
experiments and so just about every
single change we make to YouTube we do

3076
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:10,140
single change we make to YouTube we do
 

3077
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,100
single change we make to YouTube we do
it only after we've run a a B experiment

3078
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:13,110
it only after we've run a a B experiment
 

3079
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:16,850
it only after we've run a a B experiment
and so in those experiments which run

3080
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:16,860
and so in those experiments which run
 

3081
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:22,840
and so in those experiments which run
from one week to months we measure

3082
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:22,850
from one week to months we measure
 

3083
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:25,750
from one week to months we measure
hundreds literally hundreds of different

3084
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:25,760
hundreds literally hundreds of different
 

3085
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,060
hundreds literally hundreds of different
variables and and measure changes with

3086
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:29,070
variables and and measure changes with
 

3087
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,590
variables and and measure changes with
confidence intervals in all of them

3088
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:30,600
confidence intervals in all of them
 

3089
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,240
confidence intervals in all of them
because we really are trying to get a

3090
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:32,250
because we really are trying to get a
 

3091
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:36,200
because we really are trying to get a
sense for ultimately does this improve

3092
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:36,210
sense for ultimately does this improve
 

3093
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,510
sense for ultimately does this improve
the experience for viewers that's the

3094
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:38,520
the experience for viewers that's the
 

3095
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,700
the experience for viewers that's the
question we're trying to answer and an

3096
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:40,710
question we're trying to answer and an
 

3097
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:43,670
question we're trying to answer and an
experiment is one way because we can see

3098
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:43,680
experiment is one way because we can see
 

3099
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,320
experiment is one way because we can see
certain things go up and down so for

3100
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:45,330
certain things go up and down so for
 

3101
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,260
certain things go up and down so for
instance if we noticed in the experiment

3102
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:48,270
instance if we noticed in the experiment
 

3103
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:51,380
instance if we noticed in the experiment
people are dismissing videos less

3104
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:51,390
people are dismissing videos less
 

3105
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:55,790
people are dismissing videos less
frequently or they're saying that

3106
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:55,800
frequently or they're saying that
 

3107
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,230
frequently or they're saying that
they're more satisfied they're giving

3108
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:57,240
they're more satisfied they're giving
 

3109
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,060
they're more satisfied they're giving
more videos five stars after they watch

3110
01:07:59,060 --> 01:07:59,070
more videos five stars after they watch
 

3111
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:01,190
more videos five stars after they watch
them then those would be indications of

3112
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:01,200
them then those would be indications of
 

3113
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,490
them then those would be indications of
that the experiment is successful that

3114
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:04,500
that the experiment is successful that
 

3115
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,270
that the experiment is successful that
it's improving the situation for viewers

3116
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:07,280
it's improving the situation for viewers
 

3117
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,260
it's improving the situation for viewers
but we can also look at other things

3118
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:09,270
but we can also look at other things
 

3119
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:12,650
but we can also look at other things
like we might do user studies where we

3120
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:12,660
like we might do user studies where we
 

3121
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,840
like we might do user studies where we
invite some people in and ask them like

3122
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:14,850
invite some people in and ask them like
 

3123
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:16,250
invite some people in and ask them like
what do you think about this what do you

3124
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:16,260
what do you think about this what do you
 

3125
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,420
what do you think about this what do you
think about that how do you feel about

3126
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:17,430
think about that how do you feel about
 

3127
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:21,170
think about that how do you feel about
this and other various kinds of user

3128
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:21,180
this and other various kinds of user
 

3129
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,870
this and other various kinds of user
research but ultimately before we launch

3130
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:23,880
research but ultimately before we launch
 

3131
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,130
research but ultimately before we launch
something we're gonna want to run an

3132
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:25,140
something we're gonna want to run an
 

3133
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,830
something we're gonna want to run an
experiment so we get a sense for what

3134
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:27,840
experiment so we get a sense for what
 

3135
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,870
experiment so we get a sense for what
the impact is going to be not just to

3136
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:29,880
the impact is going to be not just to
 

3137
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,330
the impact is going to be not just to
the viewers but also to the different

3138
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:32,340
the viewers but also to the different
 

3139
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:37,130
the viewers but also to the different
channels and all of them an absurd

3140
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:37,140
channels and all of them an absurd
 

3141
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,230
channels and all of them an absurd
question nobody know what actually is

3142
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:39,240
question nobody know what actually is
 

3143
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,820
question nobody know what actually is
interesting maybe there's an answer but

3144
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:40,830
interesting maybe there's an answer but
 

3145
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,460
interesting maybe there's an answer but
if I want to make a viral video

3146
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:43,470
if I want to make a viral video
 

3147
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:46,730
if I want to make a viral video
how do I do it I don't know how you make

3148
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:46,740
how do I do it I don't know how you make
 

3149
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,020
how do I do it I don't know how you make
a viral video I

3150
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:48,030
a viral video I
 

3151
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:51,410
a viral video I
I know that we have in the past tried to

3152
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:51,420
I know that we have in the past tried to
 

3153
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,379
I know that we have in the past tried to
figure out if we could detect when a

3154
01:08:54,379 --> 01:08:54,389
figure out if we could detect when a
 

3155
01:08:54,389 --> 01:08:56,840
figure out if we could detect when a
video video was going to go viral you

3156
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:56,850
video video was going to go viral you
 

3157
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:59,870
video video was going to go viral you
know and those were you take the first

3158
01:08:59,870 --> 01:08:59,880
know and those were you take the first
 

3159
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,669
know and those were you take the first
and second derivatives of the view count

3160
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:01,679
and second derivatives of the view count
 

3161
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,660
and second derivatives of the view count
and maybe use that to do some prediction

3162
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:05,670
and maybe use that to do some prediction
 

3163
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:09,200
and maybe use that to do some prediction
but but I can't say we ever got very

3164
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:09,210
but but I can't say we ever got very
 

3165
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:10,340
but but I can't say we ever got very
good at that

3166
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:10,350
good at that
 

3167
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:12,320
good at that
oftentimes we look at where the traffic

3168
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:12,330
oftentimes we look at where the traffic
 

3169
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:14,479
oftentimes we look at where the traffic
was coming from you know if it's if it's

3170
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:14,489
was coming from you know if it's if it's
 

3171
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:16,519
was coming from you know if it's if it's
a lot of the viewership is coming from

3172
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:16,529
a lot of the viewership is coming from
 

3173
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:20,059
a lot of the viewership is coming from
something like Twitter then then maybe

3174
01:09:20,059 --> 01:09:20,069
something like Twitter then then maybe
 

3175
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:22,579
something like Twitter then then maybe
it has a higher chance of becoming viral

3176
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:22,589
it has a higher chance of becoming viral
 

3177
01:09:22,589 --> 01:09:24,109
it has a higher chance of becoming viral
than maybe if then if it were coming

3178
01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:24,119
than maybe if then if it were coming
 

3179
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:27,320
than maybe if then if it were coming
from search or something but that was

3180
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:27,330
from search or something but that was
 

3181
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,539
from search or something but that was
just trying to detect a video that might

3182
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:29,549
just trying to detect a video that might
 

3183
01:09:29,549 --> 01:09:32,120
just trying to detect a video that might
be viral how to make one like I have no

3184
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:32,130
be viral how to make one like I have no
 

3185
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,340
be viral how to make one like I have no
idea so yeah you get your kids to

3186
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:34,350
idea so yeah you get your kids to
 

3187
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,289
idea so yeah you get your kids to
interrupt you while you're on the news

3188
01:09:36,289 --> 01:09:36,299
interrupt you while you're on the news
 

3189
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:39,620
interrupt you while you're on the news
on the news absolutely as but after the

3190
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:39,630
on the news absolutely as but after the
 

3191
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,499
on the news absolutely as but after the
fact on a one individual video so the

3192
01:09:42,499 --> 01:09:42,509
fact on a one individual video so the
 

3193
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:44,390
fact on a one individual video so the
head of time predicting is a really hard

3194
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:44,400
head of time predicting is a really hard
 

3195
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,260
head of time predicting is a really hard
task but after the video went viral in

3196
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:48,270
task but after the video went viral in
 

3197
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:51,800
task but after the video went viral in
analysis can you sometimes understand

3198
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:51,810
analysis can you sometimes understand
 

3199
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:54,500
analysis can you sometimes understand
why I went viral from the perspective of

3200
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:54,510
why I went viral from the perspective of
 

3201
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:57,140
why I went viral from the perspective of
YouTube broadly first I was even

3202
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:57,150
YouTube broadly first I was even
 

3203
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:58,280
YouTube broadly first I was even
interesting for YouTube that a

3204
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:58,290
interesting for YouTube that a
 

3205
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:01,790
interesting for YouTube that a
particular videos viral or is does that

01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:01,800
particular videos viral or is does that
 

3207
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,010
particular videos viral or is does that
not matter for the individual for the

3208
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:04,020
not matter for the individual for the
 

3209
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,379
not matter for the individual for the
experience of people well I think people

3210
01:10:06,379 --> 01:10:06,389
experience of people well I think people
 

3211
01:10:06,389 --> 01:10:08,990
experience of people well I think people
expect that if a video video is going

3212
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:09,000
expect that if a video video is going
 

3213
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,390
expect that if a video video is going
viral and it's something they would be

3214
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:11,400
viral and it's something they would be
 

3215
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,790
viral and it's something they would be
interested in then I wouldn't I think

3216
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:13,800
interested in then I wouldn't I think
 

3217
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,649
interested in then I wouldn't I think
they would expect YouTube to recommend

3218
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:15,659
they would expect YouTube to recommend
 

3219
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:17,660
they would expect YouTube to recommend
it to them right um so someone's going

it to them right um so someone's going
 

3221
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,350
it to them right um so someone's going
viral it's good to just let the wave

3222
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:20,360
viral it's good to just let the wave
 

3223
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,959
viral it's good to just let the wave
ride the wave of its violence well I

3224
01:10:23,959 --> 01:10:23,969
ride the wave of its violence well I
 

3225
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,070
ride the wave of its violence well I
mean we want to meet people's

million black balls on this reservoir
 

3245
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,280
million black balls on this reservoir
and in a matter of I don't know how long

3246
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:52,290
and in a matter of I don't know how long
 

3247

this something you can analyze and

3252
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:00,030
this something you can analyze and
 

3253
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:03,379

and you won't particularly
 

3257
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,790
and you won't particularly
like it I mean we can surely see where

like it I mean we can surely see where
 

3259
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,000
like it I mean we can surely see where
it was recommended where it was found

3260

01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:39,580
nerd in the would like just and why is
 

3283

nerd in the would like just and why is
this being recommended to me so I close

3284
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:41,320
this being recommended to me so I close
 

3285
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,570
this being recommended to me so I close
down and watch the whole thing it was

3286
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:42,580
down and watch the whole thing it was
 

3287

awesome but and a lot of people had that
experience like why was I recommend this

3290
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:47,380
experience like why was I recommend this
 

3291
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,260
experience like why was I recommend this
but they all of course watched it and

3292
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:49,270
but they all of course watched it and
 

3293
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:51,870
but they all of course watched it and
enjoyed it which is what's your sense of

3294
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:51,880
enjoyed it which is what's your sense of
 

3295
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,510
enjoyed it which is what's your sense of
this just wave of recommendation and

3296
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:54,520
this just wave of recommendation and
 

3297
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,310
this just wave of recommendation and
that comes with this viral video that

3298
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
that comes with this viral video that
 

3299
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,860
that comes with this viral video that
ultimately people get enjoy after they

3300
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:58,870
ultimately people get enjoy after they
 

3301
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:01,410
ultimately people get enjoy after they
click on it well I think it's the system

3302
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:01,420
click on it well I think it's the system
 

3303
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,660
click on it well I think it's the system
you know basically doing what anybody

3304
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:03,670
you know basically doing what anybody
 

3305
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:05,430
you know basically doing what anybody
who's recommending something would do

3306
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,440
who's recommending something would do
 

3307
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,010
who's recommending something would do
which is you show it to some people and

3308
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:08,020
which is you show it to some people and
 

3309
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,900
which is you show it to some people and
if they like it you say okay well can I

3310
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:09,910
if they like it you say okay well can I
 

3311
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:11,190
if they like it you say okay well can I
find some more people who are a little

3312
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:11,200
find some more people who are a little
 

3313
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,710
find some more people who are a little
bit like them okay I'm gonna try it with

3314
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:13,720
bit like them okay I'm gonna try it with
 

3315
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,690
bit like them okay I'm gonna try it with
them oh they like it too let me expand

3316
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:15,700
them oh they like it too let me expand
 

3317
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,100
them oh they like it too let me expand
the circle some more find some more

3318
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:17,110
the circle some more find some more
 

3319
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:17,460
the circle some more find some more
people

3320
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:17,470
people
 

3321
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:19,440
people
oh it turns out they like it too so can

3322
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:19,450
oh it turns out they like it too so can
 

3323
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:21,090
oh it turns out they like it too so can
you just keep going until you get some

3324
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:21,100
you just keep going until you get some
 

3325
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,130
you just keep going until you get some
feedback that says no now you've gone

3326
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:23,140
feedback that says no now you've gone
 

3327
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,570
feedback that says no now you've gone
too far these people don't like it

3328
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:24,580
too far these people don't like it
 

3329
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:25,020
too far these people don't like it
anymore

3330
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:25,030
anymore
 

3331
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:27,750
anymore
and so I think that's basically what

3332
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:27,760
and so I think that's basically what
 

3333
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,480
and so I think that's basically what
happened now

3334
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:29,490
happened now
 

3335
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:31,950
happened now
you asked me about how to make a video

3336
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:31,960
you asked me about how to make a video
 

3337
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,550
you asked me about how to make a video
go viral or make a viral video I don't

3338
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:35,560
go viral or make a viral video I don't
 

3339
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,880
go viral or make a viral video I don't
think that if you or I decided to make a

3340
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:38,890
think that if you or I decided to make a
 

3341
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,370
think that if you or I decided to make a
video about 96 million balls that it

3342
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:41,380
video about 96 million balls that it
 

3343
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,410
video about 96 million balls that it
would also go viral it's possible that

3344
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:43,420
would also go viral it's possible that
 

3345
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:47,010
would also go viral it's possible that
Derek made like um the canonical video

3346
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:47,020
Derek made like um the canonical video
 

3347
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:50,580
Derek made like um the canonical video
about those black balls yeah lake and so

3348
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:50,590
about those black balls yeah lake and so
 

3349
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:53,190
about those black balls yeah lake and so
he did actually right and and so I don't

3350
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:53,200
he did actually right and and so I don't
 

3351
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,130
he did actually right and and so I don't
know whether or not just following along

3352
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:56,140
know whether or not just following along
 

3353
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:00,150
know whether or not just following along
is the secret yeah but it's fascinating

3354
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:00,160
is the secret yeah but it's fascinating
 

3355
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,830
is the secret yeah but it's fascinating
I mean just like you said the algorithm

3356
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:01,840
I mean just like you said the algorithm
 

3357
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,170
I mean just like you said the algorithm
sort of expanding that circle and then

3358
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:04,180
sort of expanding that circle and then
 

3359
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,400
sort of expanding that circle and then
figuring out that more and more people

3360
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:05,410
figuring out that more and more people
 

3361
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:08,820
figuring out that more and more people
did enjoy and that sort of phase shift

3362
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:08,830
did enjoy and that sort of phase shift
 

3363
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:11,100
did enjoy and that sort of phase shift
of just a huge number of people enjoying

3364
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:11,110
of just a huge number of people enjoying
 

3365
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:13,590
of just a huge number of people enjoying
in the algorithm quickly automatically I

3366
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:13,600
in the algorithm quickly automatically I
 

3367
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,620
in the algorithm quickly automatically I
assume figuring that out that's a I

3368
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:16,630
assume figuring that out that's a I
 

3369
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:17,370
assume figuring that out that's a I
don't know

3370
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:17,380
don't know
 

3371
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,050
don't know
the dynamics in psychology that is a

3372
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:19,060
the dynamics in psychology that is a
 

3373
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,810
the dynamics in psychology that is a
beautiful thing and so what do you think

3374
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:21,820
beautiful thing and so what do you think
 

3375
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:24,629
beautiful thing and so what do you think
about the idea of of clipping like and

3376
01:13:24,629 --> 01:13:24,639
about the idea of of clipping like and
 

3377
01:13:24,639 --> 01:13:27,540
about the idea of of clipping like and
too many people annoyed me into doing it

3378
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:27,550
too many people annoyed me into doing it
 

3379
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:30,060
too many people annoyed me into doing it
which is they were requesting it I said

3380
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:30,070
which is they were requesting it I said
 

3381
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:34,439
which is they were requesting it I said
very beneficial to add clips in like the

3382
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:34,449
very beneficial to add clips in like the
 

3383
01:13:34,449 --> 01:13:36,750
very beneficial to add clips in like the
the coolest points and actually have

3384
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:36,760
the coolest points and actually have
 

3385
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,030
the coolest points and actually have
explicit videos like I'm reapplying a

3386
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:39,040
explicit videos like I'm reapplying a
 

3387
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,160
explicit videos like I'm reapplying a
video like a short clip which is what

3388
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:41,170
video like a short clip which is what
 

3389
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:44,580
video like a short clip which is what
the the podcasts are doing yeah do you

3390
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:44,590
the the podcasts are doing yeah do you
 

3391
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:46,649
the the podcasts are doing yeah do you
see as opposed to like I also add time

3392
01:13:46,649 --> 01:13:46,659
see as opposed to like I also add time
 

3393
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:48,930
see as opposed to like I also add time
stamps for the topics no people want the

3394
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:48,940
stamps for the topics no people want the
 

3395
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:51,990
stamps for the topics no people want the
clip do you see YouTube somehow helping

3396
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:52,000
clip do you see YouTube somehow helping
 

3397
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,060
clip do you see YouTube somehow helping
creators with that process or helping

3398
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:54,070
creators with that process or helping
 

3399
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:55,830
creators with that process or helping
connect clips to the original videos

3400
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:55,840
connect clips to the original videos
 

3401
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,229
connect clips to the original videos
what is that just in a long list of

3402
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:58,239
what is that just in a long list of
 

3403
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,750
what is that just in a long list of
amazing things to work towards yeah I

3404
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:00,760
amazing things to work towards yeah I
 

3405
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,370
amazing things to work towards yeah I
mean it's not something that I think

3406
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:02,380
mean it's not something that I think
 

3407
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:05,910
mean it's not something that I think
we've we've done yet but I can tell you

3408
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:05,920
we've we've done yet but I can tell you
 

3409
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,600
we've we've done yet but I can tell you
that I think clipping is great and I

3410
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:09,610
that I think clipping is great and I
 

3411
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,490
that I think clipping is great and I
think it's actually great for you as a

3412
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:11,500
think it's actually great for you as a
 

3413
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,300
think it's actually great for you as a
creator and here's the reason if you

3414
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:15,310
creator and here's the reason if you
 

3415
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,490
creator and here's the reason if you
think about I mean let's let's say the

3416
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:17,500
think about I mean let's let's say the
 

3417
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:22,610
think about I mean let's let's say the
NBA is uploading videos of of its games

3418
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:22,620
NBA is uploading videos of of its games
 

3419
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:26,250
NBA is uploading videos of of its games
well people might search for warriors

3420
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:26,260
well people might search for warriors
 

3421
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:29,550
well people might search for warriors
vs. rockets or they might search for

3422
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:29,560
vs. rockets or they might search for
 

3423
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,399
vs. rockets or they might search for
Steph Curry and so a highlight from the

3424
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:32,409
Steph Curry and so a highlight from the
 

3425
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:34,620
Steph Curry and so a highlight from the
game in which Steph Curry makes an

3426
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:34,630
game in which Steph Curry makes an
 

3427
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:37,800
game in which Steph Curry makes an
amazing shot is an opportunity for

3428
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:37,810
amazing shot is an opportunity for
 

3429
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,470
amazing shot is an opportunity for
someone to find a portion of that video

3430
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:40,480
someone to find a portion of that video
 

3431
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,310
someone to find a portion of that video
and so I think that you never know how

3432
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:44,320
and so I think that you never know how
 

3433
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,129
and so I think that you never know how
people are gonna search for something

3434
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:47,139
people are gonna search for something
 

3435
01:14:47,139 --> 01:14:49,320
people are gonna search for something
that you've created and so you wanna I

3436
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:49,330
that you've created and so you wanna I
 

3437
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,169
that you've created and so you wanna I
would say you want to make clips and and

3438
01:14:52,169 --> 01:14:52,179
would say you want to make clips and and
 

3439
01:14:52,179 --> 01:14:54,780
would say you want to make clips and and
add titles and things like that so that

3440
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:54,790
add titles and things like that so that
 

3441
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:58,200
add titles and things like that so that
they can find it as easily as possible

3442
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:58,210
they can find it as easily as possible
 

3443
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:00,660
they can find it as easily as possible
do you have a dream of a future perhaps

3444
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:00,670
do you have a dream of a future perhaps
 

3445
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:03,000
do you have a dream of a future perhaps
a distant future when the YouTube

01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,010
a distant future when the YouTube

and sort of clip them out in this

3456
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:15,900
and sort of clip them out in this
 

3457
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,149
and sort of clip them out in this
incredibly rich space if you talk about

01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:18,159
incredibly rich space if you talk about

conversation we probably covered 30 40

3462
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:22,870
conversation we probably covered 30 40
 

3463
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:26,160
conversation we probably covered 30 40
little topics and there's a huge space

3464
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:26,170
little topics and there's a huge space
 

3465
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:29,129
little topics and there's a huge space
of users that would find you know 30

3466
01:15:29,129 --> 01:15:29,139
of users that would find you know 30
 

3467
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:30,689
of users that would find you know 30
percent of those topics interesting and

3468
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:30,699
percent of those topics interesting and
 

3469
01:15:30,699 --> 01:15:31,319
percent of those topics interesting and
that's

01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:31,329
that's

01:15:31,329 --> 01:15:34,140
that's
is very different it's something that's

is very different it's something that's
 

3473
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:37,649
is very different it's something that's
beyond my ability to clip out right but

3474
01:15:37,649 --> 01:15:37,659
beyond my ability to clip out right but
 

3475
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:39,569
beyond my ability to clip out right but
the algorithm might be able to figure

3476
01:15:39,569 --> 01:15:39,579
the algorithm might be able to figure
 

3477
01:15:39,579 --> 01:15:42,689
the algorithm might be able to figure
all that out sort of expand into clips

3478
01:15:42,689 --> 01:15:42,699
all that out sort of expand into clips
 

3479
01:15:42,699 --> 01:15:45,839
all that out sort of expand into clips
do you ever you think about this kind of

3480
01:15:45,839 --> 01:15:45,849
do you ever you think about this kind of
 

3481
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:47,609
do you ever you think about this kind of
thing do you have a hope a dream that

3482
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:47,619
thing do you have a hope a dream that
 

3483
01:15:47,619 --> 01:15:49,080
thing do you have a hope a dream that
one day the album will be able to do

3484
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:49,090
one day the album will be able to do
 

3485
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:51,180
one day the album will be able to do
that kind of deep content analysis well

3486
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:51,190
that kind of deep content analysis well
 

3487
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:53,399
that kind of deep content analysis well
we've actually had projects that attempt

3488
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:53,409
we've actually had projects that attempt
 

3489
01:15:53,409 --> 01:15:56,910
we've actually had projects that attempt
to achieve this but it really does

3490
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:56,920
to achieve this but it really does
 

3491
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,879
to achieve this but it really does
depend on understanding the video well

3492
01:15:59,879 --> 01:15:59,889
depend on understanding the video well
 

3493
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,799
depend on understanding the video well
and our understanding of the video right

3494
01:16:01,799 --> 01:16:01,809
and our understanding of the video right
 

3495
01:16:01,809 --> 01:16:05,580
and our understanding of the video right
now is quite crude and so I think it

3496
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:05,590
now is quite crude and so I think it
 

3497
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:09,120
now is quite crude and so I think it
would be especially hard to do it with a

3498
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:09,130
would be especially hard to do it with a
 

3499
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:11,970
would be especially hard to do it with a
conversation like this one might be able

3500
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:11,980
conversation like this one might be able
 

3501
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:16,709
conversation like this one might be able
to do it with let's say a soccer match

3502
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:16,719
to do it with let's say a soccer match
 

3503
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,390
to do it with let's say a soccer match
more easily right you could probably

3504
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:18,400
more easily right you could probably
 

3505
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,569
more easily right you could probably
find out where the goals were scored and

3506
01:16:20,569 --> 01:16:20,579
find out where the goals were scored and
 

3507
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:23,280
find out where the goals were scored and
then of course you you need to figure

3508
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:23,290
then of course you you need to figure
 

3509
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:25,169
then of course you you need to figure
out who it was that scored the goal and

3510
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:25,179
out who it was that scored the goal and
 

3511
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:27,390
out who it was that scored the goal and
and that might require human to do some

3512
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:27,400
and that might require human to do some
 

3513
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,419
and that might require human to do some
annotation but I think that trying to

3514
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:30,429
annotation but I think that trying to
 

3515
01:16:30,429 --> 01:16:34,020
annotation but I think that trying to
identify coherent topics in a transcript

3516
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:34,030
identify coherent topics in a transcript
 

3517
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:38,089
identify coherent topics in a transcript
like like the one of our conversation is

3518
01:16:38,089 --> 01:16:38,099
like like the one of our conversation is
 

3519
01:16:38,099 --> 01:16:41,100
like like the one of our conversation is
is not something that we're gonna be

3520
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:41,110
is not something that we're gonna be
 

3521
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:42,780
is not something that we're gonna be
very good at right away and I was

3522
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:42,790
very good at right away and I was
 

3523
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,819
very good at right away and I was
speaking more to the general problem

3524
01:16:44,819 --> 01:16:44,829
speaking more to the general problem
 

3525
01:16:44,829 --> 01:16:46,560
speaking more to the general problem
actually of being able to do both a

3526
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:46,570
actually of being able to do both a
 

3527
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:48,359
actually of being able to do both a
soccer match and our conversation

3528
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:48,369
soccer match and our conversation
 

3529
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:51,870
soccer match and our conversation
without explicit sort of almost my hope

3530
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:51,880
without explicit sort of almost my hope
 

3531
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,109
without explicit sort of almost my hope
was that there exists an algorithm

3532
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:55,119
was that there exists an algorithm
 

3533
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:58,879
was that there exists an algorithm
that's able to find exciting things in

3534
01:16:58,879 --> 01:16:58,889
that's able to find exciting things in
 

3535
01:16:58,889 --> 01:17:03,720
that's able to find exciting things in
video so Google now on Google search

3536
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:03,730
video so Google now on Google search
 

3537
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:05,580
video so Google now on Google search
will help you find the segment of the

3538
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:05,590
will help you find the segment of the
 

3539
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,169
will help you find the segment of the
video that you're interested in so if

3540
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:07,179
video that you're interested in so if
 

3541
01:17:07,179 --> 01:17:10,850
video that you're interested in so if
you search for something like how to

3542
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:10,860
you search for something like how to
 

3543
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,500
you search for something like how to
change the filter in my dishwasher then

3544
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:13,510
change the filter in my dishwasher then
 

3545
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:15,000
change the filter in my dishwasher then
if there's a long video about your

3546
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,010
if there's a long video about your
 

3547
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,439
if there's a long video about your
dishwasher and this is the part where

3548
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:16,449
dishwasher and this is the part where
 

3549
01:17:16,449 --> 01:17:18,270
dishwasher and this is the part where
the person shows you how to change the

3550
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:18,280
the person shows you how to change the
 

3551
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,790
the person shows you how to change the
filter then then it will highlight that

3552
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:20,800
filter then then it will highlight that
 

3553
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,729
filter then then it will highlight that
area and provide a link directly to it

3554
01:17:23,729 --> 01:17:23,739
area and provide a link directly to it
 

3555
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,939
area and provide a link directly to it
and you know if from your recollection

3556
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:26,949
and you know if from your recollection
 

3557
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:29,040
and you know if from your recollection
do you know if the thumbnail reflects

3558
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,050
do you know if the thumbnail reflects
 

3559
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,030
do you know if the thumbnail reflects
like what's the difference between

3560
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:30,040
like what's the difference between
 

3561
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,189
like what's the difference between
showing the full video and the shorter

3562
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:32,199
showing the full video and the shorter
 

3563
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:34,049
showing the full video and the shorter
clip do you know what how its presented

3564
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:34,059
clip do you know what how its presented
 

3565
01:17:34,059 --> 01:17:35,729
clip do you know what how its presented
in search results don't remember how its

3566
01:17:35,729 --> 01:17:35,739
in search results don't remember how its
 

3567
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:37,069
in search results don't remember how its
presented and the other thing I would

3568
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:37,079
presented and the other thing I would
 

3569
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:40,410
presented and the other thing I would
say is that right now it's based on

3570
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:40,420
say is that right now it's based on
 

3571
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:43,740
say is that right now it's based on
creator annotations got it so it's not

3572
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:43,750
creator annotations got it so it's not
 

3573
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,010
creator annotations got it so it's not
the thing I'm talking about

3574
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:45,020
the thing I'm talking about
 

3575
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,960
the thing I'm talking about
but there but but folks are working on

3576
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:46,970
but there but but folks are working on

01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:50,000
the more automatic version it's
 

3579
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,030
the more automatic version it's
interesting people might not imagine

3580
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:52,040
interesting people might not imagine
 

3581
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,720
interesting people might not imagine
this but a lot of our systems start by

3582
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:55,730
this but a lot of our systems start by
 

3583
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:58,990
this but a lot of our systems start by
using almost entirely the audience

3584
01:17:58,990 --> 01:17:59,000
using almost entirely the audience
 

3585
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,610
using almost entirely the audience
behavior and then as they get better the

3586
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:03,620
behavior and then as they get better the
 

3587
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,860
behavior and then as they get better the
refinement comes from using the content

3588
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:05,870
refinement comes from using the content
 

3589
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:09,760
refinement comes from using the content
and I wish and I know there's privacy

3590
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:09,770

01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:14,950
and I wish and I know there's privacy
concerns but I wish YouTube explored the

3592
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:14,960
concerns but I wish YouTube explored the
 

3593
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,020
concerns but I wish YouTube explored the
space which is sort of putting a camera

3594
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:17,030
space which is sort of putting a camera
 

3595
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,820
space which is sort of putting a camera
on the user's if they allowed it right

3596
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:18,830
on the user's if they allowed it right
 

3597
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:22,060
on the user's if they allowed it right
to study there like I did a lot of

3598
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:22,070
to study there like I did a lot of
 

3599
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:24,340
to study there like I did a lot of
emotion recognition work and so on to

3600
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:24,350
emotion recognition work and so on to
 

3601
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:27,280
emotion recognition work and so on to
study actual sort of rich or signal one

3602
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:27,290
study actual sort of rich or signal one
 

3603
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:29,290
study actual sort of rich or signal one
of the cool things when you upload 360

3604
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:29,300
of the cool things when you upload 360
 

3605
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:32,320

this a few times so I've uploaded myself
 

3609
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,540
this a few times so I've uploaded myself
it's a horrible idea

3610
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:36,550
it's a horrible idea
 

3611
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:39,580
it's a horrible idea
some people enjoyed it but whatever the

3615
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,200
video of me giving a lecture in 360 over
360 camera it's cool because YouTube

3616
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:44,210
360 camera it's cool because YouTube
 

3617
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:46,450
360 camera it's cool because YouTube
allows you to then watch where did

3618
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:46,460
allows you to then watch where did
 

3619
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,330
allows you to then watch where did
people look at there's a heat map of

3620
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:48,340
people look at there's a heat map of
 

3621
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:51,640
people look at there's a heat map of
where you know avoid the center of the

VR experience was and it's interesting

3624
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:53,720
VR experience was and it's interesting
 

3625
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,350
VR experience was and it's interesting
because that reveals to you like what

3626
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:56,360
because that reveals to you like what
 

3627
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,570
because that reveals to you like what
people looked at and it's it's very not

the case of the lecture is pretty boring

3632
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:02,810
the case of the lecture is pretty boring
 

3633
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:05,200
the case of the lecture is pretty boring
it is what we're expecting but we did a

3634
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:05,210
it is what we're expecting but we did a
 

3635
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,640
it is what we're expecting but we did a
few funny videos where there's a bunch

3636
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:06,650
few funny videos where there's a bunch
 

3637
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,440
few funny videos where there's a bunch
of people doing things and they

3638
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:08,450
of people doing things and they
 

3639
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,330
of people doing things and they
everybody tracks those people you know

3640
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:10,340
everybody tracks those people you know
 

3641
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,530
everybody tracks those people you know
in the beginning they all look at the

3642
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:11,540
in the beginning they all look at the
 

3643
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,570
in the beginning they all look at the
main person and they start spreading

3644
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:13,580
main person and they start spreading
 

3645
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,100
main person and they start spreading
around and looking into other people

3646
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:15,110
around and looking into other people
 

3647
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:16,870
around and looking into other people
it's fascinating so that kind of that's

3648
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
it's fascinating so that kind of that's
 

3649
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,930
it's fascinating so that kind of that's
a really strong signal of what people

3650
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:19,940
a really strong signal of what people
 

3651
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:22,270
a really strong signal of what people
found exciting in the video I don't know

3652
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:22,280
found exciting in the video I don't know
 

3653
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,710
found exciting in the video I don't know
how you get that from people just

3654
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:23,720
how you get that from people just
 

3655
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,260
how you get that from people just
watching except they tuned out at this

3656
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:26,270
watching except they tuned out at this
 

3657
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:26,860
watching except they tuned out at this
point

3658
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:26,870
point
 

3659
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:30,940
point
like it's hard to measure this moment

3660
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:30,950
like it's hard to measure this moment
 

3661
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:32,650
like it's hard to measure this moment
was super exciting for people I don't

3662
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:32,660
was super exciting for people I don't
 

3663
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,210
was super exciting for people I don't
know how you get that signal maybe

3664
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:34,220
know how you get that signal maybe
 

3665
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:35,740
know how you get that signal maybe
comment is there a way to get that

3666
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:35,750
comment is there a way to get that
 

3667
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,110
comment is there a way to get that
signal where this was like this is when

3668
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:38,120
signal where this was like this is when
 

3669
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,810
signal where this was like this is when
their eyes opened up they're like like

3670
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:40,820
their eyes opened up they're like like
 

3671
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,370
their eyes opened up they're like like
for me with the Ray Dalio video right

3672
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:42,380
for me with the Ray Dalio video right
 

3673
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,140
for me with the Ray Dalio video right
like first I was like okay this is

3674
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:44,150
like first I was like okay this is
 

3675
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,210
like first I was like okay this is
another one of these like dumb it down

3676
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:46,220
another one of these like dumb it down
 

3677
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,700
another one of these like dumb it down
for you videos and then you like start

3678
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:48,710
for you videos and then you like start
 

3679
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:50,650
for you videos and then you like start
watching it's like okay there's really

3680
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:50,660
watching it's like okay there's really
 

3681
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,960
watching it's like okay there's really
crisp clean deep explanation of how the

3682
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:52,970
crisp clean deep explanation of how the
 

3683
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:55,120
crisp clean deep explanation of how the
economy works that's where I like set up

3684
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:55,130
economy works that's where I like set up
 

3685
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:56,770
economy works that's where I like set up
and started watch right at that moment

3686
01:19:56,770 --> 01:19:56,780
and started watch right at that moment
 

3687
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:58,800
and started watch right at that moment
is there a way to detect that

3688
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:58,810
is there a way to detect that
 

3689
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:01,390
is there a way to detect that
the only way I can think of is by asking

3690
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:01,400
the only way I can think of is by asking
 

3691
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,200
the only way I can think of is by asking
people to just label it yeah you

3692
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:05,210
people to just label it yeah you
 

3693
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:07,240
people to just label it yeah you
mentioned that we're quite far away in

3694
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:07,250
mentioned that we're quite far away in
 

3695
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,910
mentioned that we're quite far away in
terms of doing video analysis deep video

you know we're quite far away from

3700
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:16,880
you know we're quite far away from
 

3701
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,090
you know we're quite far away from
solving autonomous driving problem - yes

3702
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:19,100
solving autonomous driving problem - yes
 

3703

solving autonomous driving problem - yes
I don't know I think we're closer to

3704
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:21,230
I don't know I think we're closer to
 

3705

I don't know I think we're closer to
that what the you know you never know

3706
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:24,950
that what the you know you never know
 

3707
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:27,220
that what the you know you never know
and the Wright brothers thought they're

and the Wright brothers thought they're
 

3709
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,900

01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:32,690
three years before they flew so what are
 

3713

the biggest challenges would you say is

3714
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:34,610
the biggest challenges would you say is
 

3715
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:37,229
the biggest challenges would you say is
it the broad challenge of understanding

3716
01:20:37,229 --> 01:20:37,239
it the broad challenge of understanding
 

3717
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:39,729
it the broad challenge of understanding

just being able to understand data is
 

3725
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:47,979
just being able to understand data is
there something specific to video that's

3726
01:20:47,979 --> 01:20:47,989
there something specific to video that's
 

3727
01:20:47,989 --> 01:20:49,390
there something specific to video that's
even more challenging than an

3728
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:49,400
even more challenging than an
 

3729
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,490
even more challenging than an

understanding what's your sense of what

3732
01:20:53,709 --> 01:20:53,719
understanding what's your sense of what
 

3733
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:55,300
understanding what's your sense of what
the biggest video is just so much

3734
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:55,310
the biggest video is just so much
 

3735
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:58,780
the biggest video is just so much
information and so precision becomes a

3736
01:20:58,780 --> 01:20:58,790
information and so precision becomes a
 

3737
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:03,010
information and so precision becomes a
real problem it's like a you know you're

3738
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:03,020
real problem it's like a you know you're
 

3739
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,440
real problem it's like a you know you're
trying to classify something and you've

3740
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:05,450
trying to classify something and you've
 

3741
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:10,660
trying to classify something and you've
got a million classes and you the

3742
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:10,670
got a million classes and you the
 

3743
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:13,860
got a million classes and you the
distinctions among them at least from a

01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:16,890
distinctions among them at least from a
from a machine learning perspective are

3746
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:16,900
from a machine learning perspective are
 

3747
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:22,990
from a machine learning perspective are
often pretty small right like you know

3748
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:23,000
often pretty small right like you know
 

3749
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,450
often pretty small right like you know
you need to see this person's number in

3750
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:25,460
you need to see this person's number in
 

3751
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:28,240
you need to see this person's number in
order to know which player it is and and

3752
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:28,250
order to know which player it is and and
 

3753
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:31,510
order to know which player it is and and
there's a lot of players or you need to

3754
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:31,520
there's a lot of players or you need to
 

3755
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,890
there's a lot of players or you need to
see you know the logo on their chest in

3756
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:35,900
see you know the logo on their chest in
 

3757
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,959
see you know the logo on their chest in
order to know like which which team they

3758
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:37,969
order to know like which which team they
 

3759
01:21:37,969 --> 01:21:40,630
order to know like which which team they
play for and so and that's just figuring

3760
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:40,640
play for and so and that's just figuring
 

3761
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,220
play for and so and that's just figuring
out who's who right and then you go

3762
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:42,230
out who's who right and then you go
 

3763
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,350
out who's who right and then you go
further and saying okay well you know

3764
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:44,360
further and saying okay well you know
 

3765
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,300
further and saying okay well you know
was that a goal was it not a goal like

the thing he's focusing on
 

3789
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,020
the thing he's focusing on
is watching video and predicting the

next frame so predicting the future of
 

3793
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:19,720
next frame so predicting the future of

first to a self supervise you know if
you watch enough video essentially if

you watch enough video essentially if
 

3803
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:32,290
you watch enough video essentially if
you watch YouTube you'll be able to

3804
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:32,300
you watch YouTube you'll be able to
 

3805
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,240
you watch YouTube you'll be able to
learn about the nature of reality the

3806
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:34,250
learn about the nature of reality the
 

3807
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:35,590
learn about the nature of reality the

01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:41,050
required by just teaching a system to
predict the next frame so he's confident

this is the way to go so see you from

3814
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:43,760
this is the way to go so see you from
 

3815
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,060
this is the way to go so see you from
the perspective of just working with

the perspective of just working with
 

3817
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:50,260
the perspective of just working with
this video how do you think an algorithm

3818
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:50,270
this video how do you think an algorithm
 

3819
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:53,320
this video how do you think an algorithm
that just watches all of YouTube stays

3820
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:53,330
that just watches all of YouTube stays
 

3821
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:55,420
that just watches all of YouTube stays
up all day and night watching YouTube

3822
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:55,430
up all day and night watching YouTube
 

3823
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:59,020
up all day and night watching YouTube
will be able to understand enough of the

3824
01:22:59,020 --> 01:22:59,030
will be able to understand enough of the
 

3825
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:01,420
will be able to understand enough of the
physics of the world about the way this

3826
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:01,430
physics of the world about the way this
 

3827
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:02,979
physics of the world about the way this
world works failed to do common-sense

3828
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:02,989
world works failed to do common-sense
 

3829
01:23:02,989 --> 01:23:07,510
world works failed to do common-sense
reasoning and so on well I mean we have

3830
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
reasoning and so on well I mean we have
 

3831
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,070
reasoning and so on well I mean we have
systems that already watch all the

3832
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:09,080
systems that already watch all the
 

3833
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,290
systems that already watch all the
videos on YouTube right but they're just

3834
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:11,300
videos on YouTube right but they're just
 

3835
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:13,390
videos on YouTube right but they're just
looking for very specific things right

3836
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:13,400
looking for very specific things right
 

3837
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,970
looking for very specific things right
they're supervised learning systems that

3838
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:15,980
they're supervised learning systems that
 

3839
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:18,790
they're supervised learning systems that
are trying to identify something or

3840
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:18,800
are trying to identify something or
 

3841
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,840
are trying to identify something or
classify something and I don't know if I

3842
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:22,850
classify something and I don't know if I
 

3843
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:24,550
classify something and I don't know if I
don't know if predicting the next frame

3844
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:24,560
don't know if predicting the next frame
 

3845
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,840
don't know if predicting the next frame
is really gonna get there because I

3846
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:27,850
is really gonna get there because I
 

3847
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:30,430
is really gonna get there because I
don't I'm not an expert on compression

3848
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:30,440
don't I'm not an expert on compression
 

3849
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,260
don't I'm not an expert on compression
algorithms but I understand that that's

3850
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:32,270
algorithms but I understand that that's
 

3851
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:33,580
algorithms but I understand that that's
kind of what compression video

3852
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:33,590
kind of what compression video
 

3853
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:34,990
kind of what compression video
compression algorithms do is they

3854
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:35,000
compression algorithms do is they
 

3855
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,300
compression algorithms do is they
basically try to predict the next frame

3856
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:37,310
basically try to predict the next frame
 

3857
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:40,300
basically try to predict the next frame
and and and then fix up the places where

3858
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:40,310
and and and then fix up the places where
 

3859
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:42,670
and and and then fix up the places where
they got it wrong and that leads to

3860
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:42,680
they got it wrong and that leads to
 

3861
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,229
they got it wrong and that leads to
higher compression and if you actually

3862
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:44,239
higher compression and if you actually
 

3863
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,390
higher compression and if you actually
put all the bits for the next frame

3864
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:46,400
put all the bits for the next frame
 

3865
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,660
put all the bits for the next frame
there so so I I don't know if I believe

3866
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:49,670
there so so I I don't know if I believe
 

3867
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:51,430
there so so I I don't know if I believe
that just being able to predict the next

3868
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:51,440
that just being able to predict the next
 

3869
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,910
that just being able to predict the next
frame is gonna be enough because because

3870
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:54,920
frame is gonna be enough because because
 

3871
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,400
frame is gonna be enough because because
there's so many frames and even a tiny

3872
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:57,410
there's so many frames and even a tiny
 

3873
01:23:57,410 --> 01:24:00,250
there's so many frames and even a tiny
bit of error on a per frame basis can

3874
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:00,260
bit of error on a per frame basis can
 

3875
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:03,190
bit of error on a per frame basis can
lead wildly different videos so the

3876
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:03,200
lead wildly different videos so the
 

3877
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,850
lead wildly different videos so the
thing is the idea of compression is one

3878
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:06,860
thing is the idea of compression is one
 

3879
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:08,590
thing is the idea of compression is one
way to do compression is to describe

3880
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:08,600
way to do compression is to describe
 

3881
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,210
way to do compression is to describe
through text with containing the video

3882
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:10,220
through text with containing the video
 

3883
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,620
through text with containing the video
that's the ultimate high level of

3884
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:11,630
that's the ultimate high level of
 

3885
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,680
that's the ultimate high level of
compression so the idea is tradition

3886
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:14,690
compression so the idea is tradition
 

3887
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:15,729
compression so the idea is tradition
when you think of video image

3888
01:24:15,729 --> 01:24:15,739
when you think of video image
 

3889
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:17,260
when you think of video image
compression you're trying to maintain

3890
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:17,270
compression you're trying to maintain
 

3891
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:21,190
compression you're trying to maintain
the same visual quality while reducing

3892
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:21,200
the same visual quality while reducing
 

3893
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,740
the same visual quality while reducing
the size but if you think of deep

3894
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:23,750
the size but if you think of deep
 

3895
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,719
the size but if you think of deep
learning from a bigger perspective

3896
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:25,729
learning from a bigger perspective
 

3897
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:27,729
learning from a bigger perspective
what compression is is you're trying to

3898
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:27,739
what compression is is you're trying to
 

3899
01:24:27,739 --> 01:24:30,310
what compression is is you're trying to
summarize the video and the idea there

3900
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:30,320
summarize the video and the idea there
 

3901
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,439
summarize the video and the idea there
is if you have a big enough neural

3902
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:32,449
is if you have a big enough neural
 

3903
01:24:32,449 --> 01:24:35,290
is if you have a big enough neural
network this by watching the next bit

3904
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:35,300
network this by watching the next bit
 

3905
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,629
network this by watching the next bit
trying to predict the next frame you'll

3906
01:24:37,629 --> 01:24:37,639
trying to predict the next frame you'll
 

3907
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,759
trying to predict the next frame you'll
be able to form a compression of

3908
01:24:39,759 --> 01:24:39,769
be able to form a compression of
 

3909
01:24:39,769 --> 01:24:41,319
be able to form a compression of
actually understanding what's going on

3910
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:41,329
actually understanding what's going on
 

3911
01:24:41,329 --> 01:24:43,509
actually understanding what's going on
in the scene if there's two people

3912
01:24:43,509 --> 01:24:43,519
in the scene if there's two people
 

3913
01:24:43,519 --> 01:24:45,939
in the scene if there's two people
talking you can just reduce that entire

3914
01:24:45,939 --> 01:24:45,949
talking you can just reduce that entire
 

3915
01:24:45,949 --> 01:24:47,979
talking you can just reduce that entire
video and into the fact that two people

3916
01:24:47,979 --> 01:24:47,989
video and into the fact that two people
 

3917
01:24:47,989 --> 01:24:50,049
video and into the fact that two people
are talking and maybe the content of

3918
01:24:50,049 --> 01:24:50,059
are talking and maybe the content of
 

3919
01:24:50,059 --> 01:24:51,279
are talking and maybe the content of
what they're saying and so on that

3920
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:51,289
what they're saying and so on that
 

3921
01:24:51,289 --> 01:24:54,609
what they're saying and so on that
that's kind of the the open-ended dream

3922
01:24:54,609 --> 01:24:54,619
that's kind of the the open-ended dream
 

3923
01:24:54,619 --> 01:24:57,219
that's kind of the the open-ended dream
so I just wanted to sort of express it

3924
01:24:57,219 --> 01:24:57,229
so I just wanted to sort of express it
 

3925
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:58,540
so I just wanted to sort of express it
because it's interesting compelling

3926
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:58,550
because it's interesting compelling
 

3927
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:03,060
because it's interesting compelling
notion but it is nevertheless true that

3928
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:03,070
notion but it is nevertheless true that
 

3929
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:06,069
notion but it is nevertheless true that
video our world is a lot more

3930
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:06,079
video our world is a lot more
 

3931
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:07,930
video our world is a lot more
complicated than we getting credit for I

3932
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:07,940
complicated than we getting credit for I
 

3933
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:09,729
complicated than we getting credit for I
mean in terms of search and discovery we

3934
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:09,739
mean in terms of search and discovery we
 

3935
01:25:09,739 --> 01:25:12,149
mean in terms of search and discovery we
have been working on trying to summarize

3936
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:12,159
have been working on trying to summarize
 

3937
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:16,479
have been working on trying to summarize
videos in text or or with some kind of

3938
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:16,489
videos in text or or with some kind of
 

3939
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:22,350
videos in text or or with some kind of
labels for eight years at least and

3940
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:22,360

 

3941
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,689

we're kind of so so so and so if you

3942
01:25:25,689 --> 01:25:25,699
we're kind of so so so and so if you
 

3943
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:27,580
we're kind of so so so and so if you
would say it's the problem is a hundred

3944
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:27,590
would say it's the problem is a hundred
 

3945
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:31,239
would say it's the problem is a hundred
percent solved and eight years ago was

3946
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:31,249
percent solved and eight years ago was
 

3947
01:25:31,249 --> 01:25:35,529
percent solved and eight years ago was
zero percent solved how where are we on

3948
01:25:35,529 --> 01:25:35,539
zero percent solved how where are we on
 

3949
01:25:35,539 --> 01:25:37,600
zero percent solved how where are we on
that timeline would you say yeah to

3950
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:37,610
that timeline would you say yeah to
 

3951
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:41,319
that timeline would you say yeah to
summarize a video well maybe less than a

3952
01:25:41,319 --> 01:25:41,329
summarize a video well maybe less than a
 

3953
01:25:41,329 --> 01:25:46,000
summarize a video well maybe less than a
quarter of the way so on that topic

3954
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,010
quarter of the way so on that topic
 

3955
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:48,699
quarter of the way so on that topic
what does YouTube look like ten twenty

3956
01:25:48,699 --> 01:25:48,709
what does YouTube look like ten twenty
 

3957
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:52,000
what does YouTube look like ten twenty
thirty years from now I mean I think

3958
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,010
thirty years from now I mean I think
 

3959
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:55,719
thirty years from now I mean I think
that YouTube is evolving to take the

3960
01:25:55,719 --> 01:25:55,729
that YouTube is evolving to take the
 

3961
01:25:55,729 --> 01:25:59,020
that YouTube is evolving to take the
place of TV you know I grew up as a kid

3962
01:25:59,020 --> 01:25:59,030
place of TV you know I grew up as a kid
 

3963
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:02,109
place of TV you know I grew up as a kid
in the 70s and I watched a tremendous

3964
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:02,119
in the 70s and I watched a tremendous
 

3965
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:05,439
in the 70s and I watched a tremendous
amount of television and I feel sorry

3966
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:05,449
amount of television and I feel sorry
 

3967
01:26:05,449 --> 01:26:08,439
amount of television and I feel sorry
for my poor mom because people told her

3968
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:08,449
for my poor mom because people told her
 

3969
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:10,000
for my poor mom because people told her
at the time that it was going to rot my

3970
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,010
at the time that it was going to rot my
 

3971
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,620
at the time that it was going to rot my
brain and that she should kill her

3972
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:11,630
brain and that she should kill her
 

3973
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:15,129
brain and that she should kill her
television but anyway I mean I think

3974
01:26:15,129 --> 01:26:15,139
television but anyway I mean I think
 

3975
01:26:15,139 --> 01:26:18,419
television but anyway I mean I think
that YouTube is at least for my family a

3976
01:26:18,419 --> 01:26:18,429
that YouTube is at least for my family a
 

3977
01:26:18,429 --> 01:26:22,120
that YouTube is at least for my family a
better version of television right it's

3978
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:22,130
better version of television right it's
 

3979
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:25,810
better version of television right it's
one that is on demand it's more tailored

3980
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:25,820
one that is on demand it's more tailored
 

3981
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:28,000
one that is on demand it's more tailored
to the things that my kids want to watch

3982
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:28,010
to the things that my kids want to watch
 

3983
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:32,290
to the things that my kids want to watch
and also they can find things that they

3984
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:32,300
and also they can find things that they
 

3985
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,939
and also they can find things that they
would never have found on television and

3986
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:33,949
would never have found on television and
 

3987
01:26:33,949 --> 01:26:36,969
would never have found on television and
so I think that at least from just

3988
01:26:36,969 --> 01:26:36,979
so I think that at least from just
 

3989
01:26:36,979 --> 01:26:39,029
so I think that at least from just
observing my own family

3990
01:26:39,029 --> 01:26:39,039
observing my own family
 

3991
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:41,790
observing my own family
that's where we're headed is that people

3992
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:41,800
that's where we're headed is that people
 

3993
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,379
that's where we're headed is that people
watch YouTube kind of in the same way

3994
01:26:43,379 --> 01:26:43,389
watch YouTube kind of in the same way
 

3995
01:26:43,389 --> 01:26:45,299
watch YouTube kind of in the same way
that I watch television when I was

3996
01:26:45,299 --> 01:26:45,309
that I watch television when I was
 

3997
01:26:45,309 --> 01:26:47,759
that I watch television when I was
younger so from a search and discovery

3998
01:26:47,759 --> 01:26:47,769
younger so from a search and discovery
 

3999
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:50,339
younger so from a search and discovery
perspective what do you what are you

4000
01:26:50,339 --> 01:26:50,349
perspective what do you what are you
 

4001
01:26:50,349 --> 01:26:53,490
perspective what do you what are you
excited about and then the 5 10 20 30

4002
01:26:53,490 --> 01:26:53,500
excited about and then the 5 10 20 30
 

4003
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,649
excited about and then the 5 10 20 30
years like what kind of things it's

4004
01:26:55,649 --> 01:26:55,659
years like what kind of things it's
 

4005
01:26:55,659 --> 01:26:57,120
years like what kind of things it's
already really good I think it's

4006
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:57,130
already really good I think it's
 

4007
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:00,270
already really good I think it's
achieved a lot of of course we don't

4008
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:00,280
achieved a lot of of course we don't
 

4009
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:03,750
achieved a lot of of course we don't
know what's possible so it's a it's the

4010
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:03,760
know what's possible so it's a it's the
 

4011
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,089
know what's possible so it's a it's the
the task of search of typing in the text

4012
01:27:06,089 --> 01:27:06,099
the task of search of typing in the text
 

4013
01:27:06,099 --> 01:27:08,100
the task of search of typing in the text
or discovering new videos by the next

4014
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:08,110
or discovering new videos by the next
 

4015
01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:10,589
or discovering new videos by the next
recommendation I personally I'm really

4016
01:27:10,589 --> 01:27:10,599
recommendation I personally I'm really
 

4017
01:27:10,599 --> 01:27:12,060
recommendation I personally I'm really
happy with the experience that

4018
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:12,070
happy with the experience that
 

4019
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:14,129
happy with the experience that
continuously I rarely watch a video

4020
01:27:14,129 --> 01:27:14,139
continuously I rarely watch a video
 

4021
01:27:14,139 --> 01:27:16,200
continuously I rarely watch a video
that's not awesome from my own

4022
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:16,210
that's not awesome from my own
 

4023
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:18,779
that's not awesome from my own
perspective but what's what's else is

4024
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:18,789
perspective but what's what's else is
 

4025
01:27:18,789 --> 01:27:21,359
perspective but what's what's else is
possible what are you excited about well

4026
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:21,369
possible what are you excited about well
 

4027
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:24,540
possible what are you excited about well
I think introducing people to more of

4028
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:24,550
I think introducing people to more of
 

4029
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:27,870
I think introducing people to more of
what's available on YouTube is not only

4030
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:27,880
what's available on YouTube is not only
 

4031
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,390
what's available on YouTube is not only
very important to YouTube in to creators

4032
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:30,400
very important to YouTube in to creators
 

4033
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,020
very important to YouTube in to creators
but I think it will help enrich people's

4034
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:34,030
but I think it will help enrich people's
 

4035
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:36,060
but I think it will help enrich people's
lives because there's a lot that I'm

4036
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:36,070
lives because there's a lot that I'm

was broken about about that but it took
 

4057
01:27:59,289 --> 01:28:01,500
was broken about about that but it took
me seven years to learn that this stuff
