a feeling of closeness that is

278
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:29,880
a feeling of closeness that is
 

279
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,610
a feeling of closeness that is
accessible to every human being well

God's Not A Feeling God is known by
 

283
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,570
God's Not A Feeling God is known by
names and attributes

284
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:35,580
names and attributes
 

285
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,029
names and attributes
we call upon God but

286
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:38,039
we call upon God but
 

287
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,070
we call upon God but
there is certainly a feeling of

288
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
there is certainly a feeling of
 

289
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,469
there is certainly a feeling of
closeness when you access him and so I

290
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
closeness when you access him and so I
 

291
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,570
closeness when you access him and so I
think the beauty of Islam is that

292
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:44,580
think the beauty of Islam is that
 

293
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,350
think the beauty of Islam is that
as perfect as God is described

294
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:48,360
as perfect as God is described
 

295
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,170
as perfect as God is described
he's also so accessible to the imperfect

296
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,180
he's also so accessible to the imperfect
 

297
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,930
he's also so accessible to the imperfect
and so the idea of sincere supplication

298
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:53,940
and so the idea of sincere supplication
 

299
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,490
and so the idea of sincere supplication
and connection to him we worship him

300
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:55,500
and connection to him we worship him
 

301
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,290
and connection to him we worship him
alone we call upon him alone there's no

302
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,300
alone we call upon him alone there's no
 

303
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,529
alone we call upon him alone there's no
clergy there's no barrier between God

304
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:00,539
clergy there's no barrier between God
 

305
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,870
clergy there's no barrier between God
and and us

306
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
and and us
 

307
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,930
and and us
and that encourages

308
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:05,940
and that encourages
 

309
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,390
and that encourages
a sincere devotion and commitment to him

310
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
a sincere devotion and commitment to him
 

311
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,749
a sincere devotion and commitment to him
alone and so he is certainly described

312
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
alone and so he is certainly described
 

313
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,150
alone and so he is certainly described

certain way that might not allow us to
 

367
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,529
certain way that might not allow us to
gain a closeness to him because maybe we

00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:15,539
gain a closeness to him because maybe we
 

369
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,969
gain a closeness to him because maybe we
didn't have the best relationship with

God through my difficulties for example
 

427

many times people put a barrier between

432
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,220
many times people put a barrier between
 

433
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,730
many times people put a barrier between
them and God because they can't make

434
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:31,740
them and God because they can't make
 

435
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,050
them and God because they can't make
sense of the things that are happening

436
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,060
sense of the things that are happening
 

437
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,550
sense of the things that are happening
in their own lives

in their own lives
 

439
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,389
in their own lives
and so they project anger towards God

440
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
and so they project anger towards God
 

441
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,730
and so they project anger towards God
and at the same time deny their own

442
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:40,740
and at the same time deny their own
 

443
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,610
and at the same time deny their own
belief in him and do away with this

444
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:43,620
belief in him and do away with this
 

445
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,350
belief in him and do away with this
natural disposition that every one of us

446
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
natural disposition that every one of us
 

447
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,389
natural disposition that every one of us
has to believe in him so they're

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:49,740
intellectual barriers certainly there
 

451
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,370
intellectual barriers certainly there
are experiential barriers

452
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:52,380

his existence there's an explanation for
our existence there's an explanation for

our existence there's an explanation for
the existence of difficulties in trial

466
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:07,320
the existence of difficulties in trial
 

467
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,190
the existence of difficulties in trial
and explanation for the existence of

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:22,920
be our own Gods you know and ultimately
 

479
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,230
be our own Gods you know and ultimately
we create and fashion gods in ways that

481
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,509
we create and fashion gods in ways that
allow us to still be the ultimate

00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
allow us to still be the ultimate
 

483
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,210
allow us to still be the ultimate
determiners of our own fates of Our Own

and that's very unfulfilling when you
 

489
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,410
and that's very unfulfilling when you
fail at your own plan but when you

490
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,420
fail at your own plan but when you
 

491

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:52,860
and
 

1057
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,890
and
in that process

1058
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:54,900
in that process
 

1059
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,750
in that process
invest in something that's greater

1073
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,549
trial
or effort in this life go to waste

1074
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
or effort in this life go to waste
 

1075
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,049
or effort in this life go to waste
without it being repaid in the Hereafter

without it being repaid in the Hereafter
 

1077
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,850
without it being repaid in the Hereafter
and so I work towards that and so life

1078
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:13,860
and so I work towards that and so life
 

1079
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,049
and so I work towards that and so life
and death

1080
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:15,059
and death
 

1081
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,850

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,390
I understood existence to be
Transcendent early on that if I believe

1084
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
Transcendent early on that if I believe
 

1085
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,909
Transcendent early on that if I believe
that there was nothing to life except

1086
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:22,919
that there was nothing to life except
 

1087
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,470
that there was nothing to life except
for life I would be a very bitter person

1088
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
for life I would be a very bitter person
 

1089
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,669
for life I would be a very bitter person
but because

1307
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,610
position to understand that you're
preventing them out of love

1308
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:49,620
preventing them out of love
 

1309
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,789
preventing them out of love
and to isolate these incidents with God

1310
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:52,799
and to isolate these incidents with God
 

1311
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,430
and to isolate these incidents with God
and to say the wisdom what's the wisdom

and to say the wisdom what's the wisdom
 

1313
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,830
and to say the wisdom what's the wisdom
uh you're trying to make sense of a

1314
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
uh you're trying to make sense of a
 

1315
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,450
uh you're trying to make sense of a
pixel when you can't see the bigger

1316
00:24:59,450 --> 00:24:59,460
pixel when you can't see the bigger
 

1317
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,770
pixel when you can't see the bigger
picture

1318
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:00,780
picture
 

1319
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,470
picture
your mind is not at a place where you

1320
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,480
your mind is not at a place where you
 

1321
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,390
your mind is not at a place where you
can make sense of the bigger picture you

1322
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:05,400
can make sense of the bigger picture you
 

1323
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,310
can make sense of the bigger picture you
haven't seen the bigger picture

1324
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,320
haven't seen the bigger picture
 

1325
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,810
haven't seen the bigger picture
and so

1326
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:08,820
and so
 

1327
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,909
and so
for him to even explain to us every

for him to even explain to us every
incidence

1330
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:12,299
incidence
 

1331
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,570
incidence
uh would completely defeat the purpose

1332
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:14,580
uh would completely defeat the purpose
 

1333
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,870
uh would completely defeat the purpose
of putting your trust in him so

know specific by the way that there is

1344
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:27,179
know specific by the way that there is
 

1345
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,049
know specific by the way that there is
what God tells us to do and there's what

1346
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:30,059
what God tells us to do and there's what
 

1347
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,730
what God tells us to do and there's what
God allows to happen

1348
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:31,740
God allows to happen
 

1349
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,710
God allows to happen
so what God tells us to do in terms of

1350
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:33,720
so what God tells us to do in terms of
 

1351
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,269
so what God tells us to do in terms of
the road map towards good and then what

1352
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
the road map towards good and then what
 

1353
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,890
the road map towards good and then what
God allows to happen in his Divine

1354
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:36,900
God allows to happen in his Divine
 

1355
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,649
God allows to happen in his Divine
wisdom that no outcome can escape him

1356
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:39,659
wisdom that no outcome can escape him
 

1357
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,690
wisdom that no outcome can escape him
but at the same time we are accountable

1358
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:41,700
but at the same time we are accountable
 

1359
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,090
but at the same time we are accountable
for our own actions and our own Deeds

1360
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,100
for our own actions and our own Deeds
 

1361
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,250
for our own actions and our own Deeds
so when you come to someone and say you

1362
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:46,260
so when you come to someone and say you
 

1363
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,830
so when you come to someone and say you
know why did God allow this to happen to

1364
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:48,840
know why did God allow this to happen to
 

1365
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,029
know why did God allow this to happen to
this person

1366
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:50,039
this person
 

1367
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,669
this person
I can't rationalize that for you because

1368
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:52,679
I can't rationalize that for you because
 

1369
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,049
I can't rationalize that for you because
my understanding is relegated to the

1370
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:57,059
my understanding is relegated to the
 

1371
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,630
my understanding is relegated to the
immediate experience in front of me

1372
00:25:59,630 --> 00:25:59,640
immediate experience in front of me
 

1373
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,529
immediate experience in front of me
but if I know God and if I learn about

1374
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:03,539
but if I know God and if I learn about
 

1375
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:04,730
but if I know God and if I learn about
God

1376
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:04,740
God
 

1377
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,049
God
then

1378
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:06,059
then
 

1379
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,330
then
I don't have to make sense of the plan

1380
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:08,340
I don't have to make sense of the plan
 

1381
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,250
I don't have to make sense of the plan
but I can tell you that I trust the

1382
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,260
but I can tell you that I trust the
 

1383
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,690
but I can tell you that I trust the
planner

1384
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:11,700
planner
 

1385
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,430
planner
and I think that that's where peace is

1386
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,440
and I think that that's where peace is
 

1387
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,450
and I think that that's where peace is
found

1388
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:14,460
found
 

1389
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,190
found
you know a lot of times you look for the

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,510
you know a lot of times you look for the
light at the end of the tunnel what's

existence of a hereafter
 

1409
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,850
existence of a hereafter
will always fail you so the existence of

will always fail you so the existence of
 

1411
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,070
will always fail you so the existence of
a god that is all-knowing what we don't

a god that is all-knowing what we don't

a god that is all-knowing what we don't
know I know what you don't know that

know I know what you don't know that

00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,630
know I know what you don't know that
understands what we don't understand the

1416
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
understands what we don't understand the
 

1417
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,750
understands what we don't understand the
existence of a God who is not subject to

00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
existence of a God who is not subject to

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,789
existence of a God who is not subject to
our constrictions

1420
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:49,799
our constrictions
 

1421
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,230
our constrictions
and the existence of a Hereafter where

1422
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,240
and the existence of a Hereafter where
 

1423
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,289
and the existence of a Hereafter where
all things find recourse where there is

1424
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:57,299
all things find recourse where there is
 

1425
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,289
all things find recourse where there is
divine recourse

1426
00:26:59,289 --> 00:26:59,299
divine recourse
 

1427
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:02,269
divine recourse
allows for this world to be situated

1428
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:02,279
allows for this world to be situated
 

1429
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,710
allows for this world to be situated
within the existence of something

1430
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:03,720
within the existence of something
 

1431
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,049
within the existence of something
greater and not treated in isolation so

1432
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:06,059
greater and not treated in isolation so
 

1433
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,970
greater and not treated in isolation so
when you're trying to treat an incidence

1434
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:07,980
when you're trying to treat an incidence
 

1435
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,190
when you're trying to treat an incidence
of this world in isolation you're going

1436
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,200
of this world in isolation you're going
 

1437
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,630
of this world in isolation you're going
to fail and when you try to treat

1438
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:11,640
to fail and when you try to treat
 

1439
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,850
to fail and when you try to treat
existence in this world and of this

1440
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:13,860
existence in this world and of this
 

1441
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,529
existence in this world and of this
world in isolation you're also going to

1442
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:15,539
world in isolation you're also going to
 

1443
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,330
world in isolation you're also going to
fail and so the emphasis is the belief

1444
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:17,340
fail and so the emphasis is the belief
 

1445
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,710
fail and so the emphasis is the belief
in God

1446
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:18,720
in God
 

1447
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,190
in God
a god that is not limited like you are

1448
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,200
a god that is not limited like you are
 

1449
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,649
a god that is not limited like you are
and a belief in the Hereafter that is

1450
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:24,659
and a belief in the Hereafter that is
 

1451
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,169
and a belief in the Hereafter that is
not limited like this life

1452
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:27,179
not limited like this life
 

1453
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,409
not limited like this life
and so everything continues onwards and

1454
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:30,419
and so everything continues onwards and
 

1455
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,090
and so everything continues onwards and
there is divine recourse for everything

1456
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:32,100
there is divine recourse for everything
 

1457
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,070
there is divine recourse for everything
each and everything you know the prophet

are you going to create
uh a race or a species that will spill

1578
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:47,100
uh a race or a species that will spill

blood and cause corruption
 

1581
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,769

heart like fertile soil towards truth so
 

2051
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,030
heart like fertile soil towards truth so
you have a sincere Pursuit but then at

some point if you come to know and then

2054
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:01,079
some point if you come to know and then
 

2055
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,349
some point if you come to know and then
you ignore what you come to know then

2056

you ignore what you come to know then
 

2057
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,450
you ignore what you come to know then
the heart rests and it becomes harder to

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:05,460
the heart rests and it becomes harder to
 

2059
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,190
the heart rests and it becomes harder to
recognize it the second time around the

so this is what I talk about when I say
that as human beings we have the

2840
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:17,880
that as human beings we have the

to be angelic
 

2849
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,450
to be angelic
when we choose worship and righteousness

2850
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:28,460
when we choose worship and righteousness
 

2851
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:31,130

a crisis of meaning and emptiness
 

2857
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,170
a crisis of meaning and emptiness
where I think

2858
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:39,180
where I think
 

2859
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,150
where I think

2860
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:41,160
people are willing to inflict great pain
 

2861

00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:42,900
on others when they can't make sense of
 

2863
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,549
on others when they can't make sense of
their pain in their own lives

2864
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:46,559

it's hard to put into words but somehow

3488
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:51,599
it's hard to put into words but somehow
 

3489
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:52,970
it's hard to put into words but somehow
that

3490
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:52,980
that
 

3491
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,370
that
does not capture

3492
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:55,380
does not capture
 

3493
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,029
does not capture
what maybe the founders intended

3494
01:06:59,029 --> 01:06:59,039
what maybe the founders intended
 

3495
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,670
what maybe the founders intended
right what uh what I would see is the

3496
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:01,680
right what uh what I would see is the
 

3497
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,730
right what uh what I would see is the
great idea of the freedom of speech

3498

I don't know what the solution to that
 

3503
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:08,870
I don't know what the solution to that
is

3504
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:08,880
is
 

3505
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,930
is
I think taking it outside of words maybe

3506
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:11,940
I think taking it outside of words maybe
 

3507
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,270
I think taking it outside of words maybe
that requires a community a cultural

3508
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:14,280
that requires a community a cultural
 

3509
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,670
that requires a community a cultural
pressure to be better

3510
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:16,680
pressure to be better
 

3511
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:17,990

3513
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,789
uh
so it's not about the law it's more

3514
01:07:19,789 --> 01:07:19,799
so it's not about the law it's more
 

3515
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:21,349
so it's not about the law it's more
about just the cultural pressure what

3516
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
about just the cultural pressure what
 

3517
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,089
about just the cultural pressure what
isn't isn't okay because there's

01:07:23,089 --> 01:07:23,099
isn't isn't okay because there's
 

3519
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:24,829
isn't isn't okay because there's
something deeply wrong about that kind

3520
01:07:24,829 --> 01:07:24,839
something deeply wrong about that kind
 

3521
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:26,089
something deeply wrong about that kind
of hate

3522
01:07:26,089 --> 01:07:26,099
of hate
 

3523
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:28,970
of hate
uh yeah because it was dehumanizing

temporarily unfortunately some elements

3708
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:09,239
temporarily unfortunately some elements
 

3709
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:10,970
temporarily unfortunately some elements
of that legislation remained and it was

3710
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:10,980
of that legislation remained and it was
 

3711
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,330
of that legislation remained and it was
it was an ongoing struggle but look what

3712
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:14,340
it was an ongoing struggle but look what
 

3713
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,830
it was an ongoing struggle but look what
I'll say is that those are some of the

3714
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:15,840
I'll say is that those are some of the
 

3715
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,130
I'll say is that those are some of the
more obvious manifestations of

3716
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:18,140
more obvious manifestations of
 

3717
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,410
more obvious manifestations of
anti-muslim bigotry

3718
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:20,420
anti-muslim bigotry
 

3719
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:25,189
anti-muslim bigotry
but again there's hypocrisy on all sides

3720
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:25,199
but again there's hypocrisy on all sides
 

3721
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,570
but again there's hypocrisy on all sides
of the political aisle here in the

3722
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:26,580
of the political aisle here in the
 

3723
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:27,770
of the political aisle here in the
United States

3724
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:27,780

there is islamophobia of different
 

3727
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,070
there is islamophobia of different
flavors I think even the term

3728
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:31,080
flavors I think even the term
 

3729
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,110
flavors I think even the term
islamophobia can become contentious

3730
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
islamophobia can become contentious
 

3731
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,510
islamophobia can become contentious
because there are people that attack Us

3732

because there are people that attack Us
 

3733
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,610
because there are people that attack Us
in different ways and that might not be

01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:37,620
in different ways and that might not be
 

3735
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:39,709
in different ways and that might not be
as overtly bigoted but

3736
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:39,719
as overtly bigoted but
 

3737
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:42,229
as overtly bigoted but
nonetheless are infringing on our rights

and producing fruit at all times the
 

6807
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:23,149
and producing fruit at all times the
tree of faith of a Muslim is not

6808
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:23,159
tree of faith of a Muslim is not

things that people can can actually

6814
02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:31,800
things that people can can actually
 

6815
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:34,189
things that people can can actually
experience and I think that Muslims have

6816
02:10:34,189 --> 02:10:34,199
experience and I think that Muslims have
 

6817
02:10:34,199 --> 02:10:35,689
experience and I think that Muslims have
historically contributed to the world

6818
02:10:35,689 --> 02:10:35,699
historically contributed to the world
 

6819

around them
 

6821
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:38,570
around them

contributing to the world around them
 

6825
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:44,750
contributing to the world around them

but I think that we can never do enough
 

6827

possibly could at that time
thankfully uh they all got out in the

7044
02:14:59,030 --> 02:14:59,040
thankfully uh they all got out in the
 

7045
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:00,169
thankfully uh they all got out in the
evening

7046
02:15:00,169 --> 02:15:00,179
evening
 

7047
02:15:00,179 --> 02:15:02,270
evening
and I think that

7048
02:15:02,270 --> 02:15:02,280
and I think that
 

7049
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:04,010
and I think that
you know

7050
02:15:04,010 --> 02:15:04,020
you know
 

7051
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:08,629
you know
looking back on that day

7052
02:15:08,629 --> 02:15:08,639

 

7053
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:10,010

like my wife actually asked me I said

7054
02:15:10,010 --> 02:15:10,020
like my wife actually asked me I said
 

7055
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:11,330
like my wife actually asked me I said
would you have done it differently and I

7056
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:11,340
would you have done it differently and I
 

7057
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:13,010
would you have done it differently and I
said no I really wouldn't because I

7058
02:15:13,010 --> 02:15:13,020
said no I really wouldn't because I
 

7059
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:14,629
said no I really wouldn't because I
think that that

7060
02:15:14,629 --> 02:15:14,639
think that that
 

7061
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:16,490
think that that
things happen sometimes you've got to

7062
02:15:16,490 --> 02:15:16,500
things happen sometimes you've got to
 

7063
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:17,930
things happen sometimes you've got to
act on your good instincts sometimes

7064
02:15:17,930 --> 02:15:17,940
act on your good instincts sometimes
 

7065
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:19,310
act on your good instincts sometimes
right when you talk about like being

7066
02:15:19,310 --> 02:15:19,320
right when you talk about like being
 

7067
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:20,930
right when you talk about like being
calculated

7068
02:15:20,930 --> 02:15:20,940
calculated
 

7069
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:22,910
calculated
I think sometimes

7070
02:15:22,910 --> 02:15:22,920
I think sometimes
 

7071
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:25,189
I think sometimes
were calculated when we shouldn't be and

7072
02:15:25,189 --> 02:15:25,199
were calculated when we shouldn't be and
 

7073
02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:27,470
were calculated when we shouldn't be and
that's when that good Instinct comes in

7074
02:15:27,470 --> 02:15:27,480
that's when that good Instinct comes in
 

7075
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:29,089
that's when that good Instinct comes in
where you're called to do something else

7076
02:15:29,089 --> 02:15:29,099
where you're called to do something else
 

7077
02:15:29,099 --> 02:15:32,390
where you're called to do something else

7319
02:20:12,359 --> 02:20:16,130
about Buddhism so I think that these are
essentially political issues political

things that are far far far from
 

7327
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:28,730

7337
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:38,090
if you have a violent Aim so I think
that that's where you find people

dehumanize entire groups of people
 

7733

7765
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:03,530
of the state of Israel but as we've
mentioned very supportive of Jewish

mentioned very supportive of Jewish
people you have a lot of friends rabbis

7768

people you have a lot of friends rabbis
 

7769
02:29:06,359 --> 02:29:08,410
people you have a lot of friends rabbis
and

7770
02:29:08,410 --> 02:29:08,420
and
 

7771
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:10,790
and
Jews in general here in Dallas and

7772
02:29:10,790 --> 02:29:10,800
Jews in general here in Dallas and
 

7773
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:12,110
Jews in general here in Dallas and
across the world

7774
02:29:12,110 --> 02:29:12,120
across the world
 

7775
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:15,050
across the world
uh what is the difference to you in that

7776
02:29:15,050 --> 02:29:15,060
uh what is the difference to you in that
 

7777
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:17,150
uh what is the difference to you in that
part of the world between politics and

7778
02:29:17,150 --> 02:29:17,160
part of the world between politics and
 

7779
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:20,630
part of the world between politics and
religion so in this case Zionism and

7780
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:20,640
religion so in this case Zionism and
 

7781
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:24,950
religion so in this case Zionism and
Judaism uh both terms broadly defined

7782
02:29:24,950 --> 02:29:24,960
Judaism uh both terms broadly defined
 

7783
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:27,650
Judaism uh both terms broadly defined
both terms broadly defined so I say that

7784
02:29:27,650 --> 02:29:27,660
both terms broadly defined so I say that
 

7785
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:30,290
both terms broadly defined so I say that
because those terms

7786
02:29:30,290 --> 02:29:30,300
because those terms
 

7787
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:32,510
because those terms
there's technical definitions and

7788
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:32,520
there's technical definitions and
 

7789
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:34,790
there's technical definitions and
there's how they're popularly used and

7790
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:34,800
there's how they're popularly used and
 

7791
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:36,230
there's how they're popularly used and
so you have to be kind of sure just like

7792
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:36,240
so you have to be kind of sure just like
 

7793
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,690
so you have to be kind of sure just like
we said with islamophobia these terms

7794
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:38,700
we said with islamophobia these terms
 

7795
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:42,770
we said with islamophobia these terms
are they become politicized so just

7796
02:29:42,770 --> 02:29:42,780
are they become politicized so just
 

7797
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:46,370
are they become politicized so just
generally speaking I think Zionism

7798
02:29:46,370 --> 02:29:46,380
generally speaking I think Zionism
 

7799
02:29:46,380 --> 02:29:49,429
generally speaking I think Zionism
has to do with the with uh with politics

7800
02:29:49,429 --> 02:29:49,439
has to do with the with uh with politics
 

7801
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:51,410
has to do with the with uh with politics
and Judaism has to do with the religion

7802
02:29:51,410 --> 02:29:51,420
and Judaism has to do with the religion

02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:53,389
and Judaism has to do with the religion
it's a great complexity like to a lot of

people like wait a minute right and you
got to take a step back and wonder why

7808
02:29:57,469 --> 02:29:57,479
got to take a step back and wonder why
 

7809
02:29:57,479 --> 02:29:59,630
got to take a step back and wonder why

that sound like how is that how's that

that sound like how is that how's that
 

8419
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:40,550
that sound like how is that how's that
normal right and so I think that if

8420
02:41:40,550 --> 02:41:40,560
normal right and so I think that if
 

8421
02:41:40,560 --> 02:41:43,309
normal right and so I think that if
people take the time to read people take

8422
02:41:43,309 --> 02:41:43,319
people take the time to read people take
 

8423
02:41:43,319 --> 02:41:45,230
people take the time to read people take
the time to investigate

8424
02:41:45,230 --> 02:41:45,240
the time to investigate
 

8425
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:47,690
the time to investigate
then they come to this conclusion

8426
02:41:47,690 --> 02:41:47,700
then they come to this conclusion
 

8427
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:50,510
then they come to this conclusion
themselves that this is unacceptable

8428
02:41:50,510 --> 02:41:50,520
themselves that this is unacceptable
 

8429
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:52,670
themselves that this is unacceptable
and that you can't put and this is one

8430
02:41:52,670 --> 02:41:52,680
and that you can't put and this is one
 

8431
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:54,490
and that you can't put and this is one
of the problems with the framing of

8432
02:41:54,490 --> 02:41:54,500
of the problems with the framing of
 

8433
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:56,929
of the problems with the framing of
israel-palestine is that you're equating

8434
02:41:56,929 --> 02:41:56,939
israel-palestine is that you're equating
 

8435
02:41:56,939 --> 02:41:59,389
israel-palestine is that you're equating
occupier and occupied you're equating

02:41:59,389 --> 02:41:59,399
occupier and occupied you're equating
 

8437
02:41:59,399 --> 02:42:02,270
occupier and occupied you're equating
the two sides of the conflict and it's

8438
02:42:02,270 --> 02:42:02,280
the two sides of the conflict and it's
 

8439
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:04,969
the two sides of the conflict and it's
not a conflict it's an occupation there

8440
02:42:04,969 --> 02:42:04,979
not a conflict it's an occupation there
 

8441
02:42:04,979 --> 02:42:07,610
not a conflict it's an occupation there
is such a disparity of power here

8442
02:42:07,610 --> 02:42:07,620
is such a disparity of power here
 

8443
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:10,730
is such a disparity of power here
that you cannot equate the two sides how

8444
02:42:10,730 --> 02:42:10,740
that you cannot equate the two sides how
 

8445
02:42:10,740 --> 02:42:12,710
that you cannot equate the two sides how
you know you can't you know Malcolm X

would say you clip the bird's wing and
 

8449
02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:15,830
would say you clip the bird's wing and
then fly and then blame it for not

8450
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:15,840
then fly and then blame it for not
 

8451
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:18,290

equate them with their occupier it's an
 

8457
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,090
