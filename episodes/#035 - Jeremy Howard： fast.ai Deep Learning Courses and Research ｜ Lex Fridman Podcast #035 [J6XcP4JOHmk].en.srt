anything like that what is that if you

180
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:02,129
anything like that what is that if you
 

181
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,379
anything like that what is that if you
could pause in there for a second no

so what's the connection between excel

208
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:38,670
so what's the connection between excel
 

209
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,750
so what's the connection between excel
and access so very close

210
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:41,760
and access so very close
 

211
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,340
and access so very close
so access kind of was the relational

212
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,350
so access kind of was the relational
 

213
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,590
so access kind of was the relational
database equivalent if you like so

214
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:48,600
database equivalent if you like so
 

215
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,230
database equivalent if you like so
people still do a lot of that stuff it

216
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,240
people still do a lot of that stuff it
 

217
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
people still do a lot of that stuff it
should be an access in Excel excels they

218
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,250
should be an access in Excel excels they
 

219
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,160
should be an access in Excel excels they
don't know what Excel is great as well

220
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,170
don't know what Excel is great as well
 

221
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,390
don't know what Excel is great as well
so but it's just not as rich a

222
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,400
so but it's just not as rich a
 

223
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,720
so but it's just not as rich a
programming model as VBA combined with a

224
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:02,730
programming model as VBA combined with a
 

225
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,360
programming model as VBA combined with a
relational database and so I've always

226
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,370
relational database and so I've always
 

227
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,620
relational database and so I've always
loved relational databases but today

228
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:08,630
loved relational databases but today
 

229
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,490
loved relational databases but today
programming on top of a relational

230
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:10,500
programming on top of a relational
 

231
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,950
programming on top of a relational
database is just a lot more of a

232
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
database is just a lot more of a
 

233
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,050
database is just a lot more of a
headache you know you generally either

234
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,060

235
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,880
headache you know you generally either
need to kind of you know you need

236
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:16,890
need to kind of you know you need
 

237
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,590
need to kind of you know you need
something that connects that that runs

238
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:18,600
something that connects that that runs
 

239
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,270
something that connects that that runs
some kind of database server unless you

240
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,280
some kind of database server unless you
 

241
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,090
some kind of database server unless you
use circle light which has its own

242
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,100

244
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,000
issues
 

245
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,520
issues
then you can often if you want to get a

246
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:26,530
then you can often if you want to get a
 

247
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,990
then you can often if you want to get a
nice programming model you'll need to

248
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
nice programming model you'll need to
 

249
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,510
nice programming model you'll need to
like create and add an ORM on top and

250
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:30,520
like create and add an ORM on top and
 

251
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,280
like create and add an ORM on top and
then I don't know there's all these

252
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,290
then I don't know there's all these
 

253
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,130
then I don't know there's all these
pieces tie together and it's just a lot

254
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,140
pieces tie together and it's just a lot
 

255
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,260
pieces tie together and it's just a lot
more awkward than it should be there are

256
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,270
more awkward than it should be there are
 

257
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,030
more awkward than it should be there are
people that are trying to make it easier

258
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,040
people that are trying to make it easier
 

259
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,400
people that are trying to make it easier
so in particular I think of if sharp you

260
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,410
so in particular I think of if sharp you
 

261
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,000
so in particular I think of if sharp you
know Don Syme who him and his team have

262
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,010
know Don Syme who him and his team have
 

263
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,290
know Don Syme who him and his team have
done a great job of making something

264
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:49,300
done a great job of making something
 

265
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,970
done a great job of making something
like a database appear in the type

266
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:50,980
like a database appear in the type
 

267
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,740
like a database appear in the type
system so you actually get like tab

268
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:52,750
system so you actually get like tab
 

269
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,080
system so you actually get like tab
completion for fields and tables and

270
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,090
completion for fields and tables and
 

271
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,830
completion for fields and tables and
stuff like that anyway so that was kind

272
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:58,840
stuff like that anyway so that was kind
 

273
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,230
stuff like that anyway so that was kind
of anyway so like that whole VBA office

274
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,240
of anyway so like that whole VBA office
 

275
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,600
of anyway so like that whole VBA office
thing I guess was a starting point which

276
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:03,610
thing I guess was a starting point which
 

277
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,750
thing I guess was a starting point which
I still miss I got into standard Visual

278
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:06,760
I still miss I got into standard Visual
 

279
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,940
I still miss I got into standard Visual
Basic that's interesting just to pause

280
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:08,950
Basic that's interesting just to pause
 

281
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,290
Basic that's interesting just to pause
on them for a second it's interesting

282
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:10,300
on them for a second it's interesting
 

283
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,570
on them for a second it's interesting
that you're connecting programming

284
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:12,580
that you're connecting programming
 

285
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,409
that you're connecting programming
languages to the ease of management of

286
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:16,419
languages to the ease of management of
 

287
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,190
languages to the ease of management of
data yeah so in your use of programming

288
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,200
data yeah so in your use of programming
 

289
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,220
data yeah so in your use of programming
languages you always had a love and a

290
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,230
languages you always had a love and a
 

291
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,290
languages you always had a love and a
connection with data I've always been

292
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:25,300
connection with data I've always been
 

293
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,960
connection with data I've always been
interested in doing useful things for

294
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:27,970
interested in doing useful things for
 

295
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,060
interested in doing useful things for
myself and for others which generally

296
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,070
myself and for others which generally
 

297
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,340
myself and for others which generally
means getting some data and doing

298
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:32,350
means getting some data and doing
 

299
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,390
means getting some data and doing
something with it and putting it out

300
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,400
something with it and putting it out
 

301
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,650
something with it and putting it out
there again so that's been my interest

302
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:37,660
there again so that's been my interest
 

303
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,900
there again so that's been my interest
throughout so I also did a lot of stuff

304
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:39,910
throughout so I also did a lot of stuff
 

305
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,040
throughout so I also did a lot of stuff
with Apple script back in the early days

306
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,050
with Apple script back in the early days
 

307
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,620
with Apple script back in the early days
so it's kind of nice being able to get

308
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:46,630
so it's kind of nice being able to get
 

309
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,350
so it's kind of nice being able to get
the computer and computers to talk to

310
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
the computer and computers to talk to
 

311
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,290
the computer and computers to talk to
each other and to do things for you and

312
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:52,300
each other and to do things for you and
 

313
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,219
each other and to do things for you and
then I could think that one night the

314
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:55,229
then I could think that one night the
 

315
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,080
then I could think that one night the
programming language I most loved then

316
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,090
programming language I most loved then
 

317
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,840
programming language I most loved then
would have been Delphi which was object

318
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:00,850
would have been Delphi which was object
 

319
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,010
would have been Delphi which was object
pascal created by under sales berg who

320
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,020
pascal created by under sales berg who
 

321
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,650
pascal created by under sales berg who
previously did to it by pascal and then

322
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:07,660
previously did to it by pascal and then
 

323
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,180
previously did to it by pascal and then
went on to create dotnet and then went

324
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,190
went on to create dotnet and then went
 

325
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,060
went on to create dotnet and then went
on create typescript delphi was amazing

326
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,070
on create typescript delphi was amazing
 

327
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,560
on create typescript delphi was amazing
because it was like a compiled fast

328
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:15,570
because it was like a compiled fast
 

329
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,540
because it was like a compiled fast
language that was as easy to use as

330
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:18,550
language that was as easy to use as
 

331
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,990
language that was as easy to use as
Visual Basic Delphi what is it similar

332
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
Visual Basic Delphi what is it similar
 

333
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,810
Visual Basic Delphi what is it similar
to in in more modern languages Visual

334
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:27,820

335
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,290

Basic Visual Basic yeah that a compiled

336
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:31,300
Basic Visual Basic yeah that a compiled
 

337
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,589
Basic Visual Basic yeah that a compiled
fast version so I'm not sure there's

338
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:34,599
fast version so I'm not sure there's
 

339
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,930
fast version so I'm not sure there's
anything quite like it anymore

340
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:36,940
anything quite like it anymore
 

341
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,760
anything quite like it anymore
if you took like C

00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:50,229
feel like it's where um Swift could get
 

351
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,360
feel like it's where um Swift could get
to with the new Swift UI and the

actually a math theory paper not a

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,840
actually a math theory paper not a
programming paper it was called notation

422
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:39,850
programming paper it was called notation

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,150
programming paper it was called notation
as a tool for thought and it was the

424
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
as a tool for thought and it was the
 

425
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,949
as a tool for thought and it was the
development of a new way a new type of

426
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:43,959
development of a new way a new type of
 

427
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,079
development of a new way a new type of
math notation and the idea is that this

428
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:46,089
math notation and the idea is that this
 

429
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,240
math notation and the idea is that this
math notation would be was was much more

430
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,250
math notation would be was was much more
 

431
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,210
math notation would be was was much more

00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:56,040
and also well-defined then traditional
math notation which is none of those

math notation which is none of those
 

437
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,699
math notation which is none of those
things math notation is awful and so he

438
00:09:59,699 --> 00:09:59,709
things math notation is awful and so he
 

439
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,650
things math notation is awful and so he
actually turned that into a programming

440
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:01,660
actually turned that into a programming
 

441
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,629
actually turned that into a programming
language and because this was the early

442
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:03,639
language and because this was the early
 

443
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,579

50s although that's very late 50s
although names were available so he

446
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,000
although names were available so he
 

447
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,129
although names were available so he
called his language a programming

448
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:08,139
called his language a programming
 

449
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,439
called his language a programming

so though it's all about computation

554
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:36,899
so though it's all about computation

programming is data processing by
 

561
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,310
programming is data processing by
definition and so there's a lot of

you've done a lot of stuff with Perl and

574
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:01,709
you've done a lot of stuff with Perl and
 

575
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,100
you've done a lot of stuff with Perl and
Python yeah so where does that fit into

576
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,110
Python yeah so where does that fit into
 

577
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,990

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,210
the picture of J and K and APO and well
you know it's much more pragmatic like

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,220
you know it's much more pragmatic like
 

581
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,790
you know it's much more pragmatic like
in the end you kind of have to end up

meet that gap but I guess that maybe if

particularly treatment planning and
triage kind of on device so that if you

1110
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:05,830
triage kind of on device so that if you
 

1111
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,760
triage kind of on device so that if you
do a you know test for malaria or

1112
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:08,770
do a you know test for malaria or
 

1113
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,970
do a you know test for malaria or
tuberculosis or whatever you immediately

1114
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:11,980
tuberculosis or whatever you immediately
 

1115
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,280
tuberculosis or whatever you immediately
get something that even a health care

1116
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,290
get something that even a health care
 

1117
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,950
get something that even a health care
worker that's had a month of training

1118
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:15,960
worker that's had a month of training
 

1119
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,970
worker that's had a month of training
can get a very high quality assessment

1120
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:20,980
can get a very high quality assessment
 

1121
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,150
can get a very high quality assessment
of whether the

1122
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,160
of whether the
 

1123
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,250
of whether the
patient might be at risk until you know

1124
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,260
patient might be at risk until you know
 

1125
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,610
patient might be at risk until you know
okay we'll send them off to a hospital

1126
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:26,620
okay we'll send them off to a hospital
 

1127
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,640
okay we'll send them off to a hospital
so for example in Africa outside of

1128
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:30,650
so for example in Africa outside of
 

1129
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,310
so for example in Africa outside of
South Africa there's only five pediatric

1130
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:33,320
South Africa there's only five pediatric
 

1131
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,440
South Africa there's only five pediatric
radiologists for the entire continent so

1132
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,450
radiologists for the entire continent so
 

1133
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,540
radiologists for the entire continent so
most countries don't have any so if your

1134
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:37,550
most countries don't have any so if your
 

1135
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,010
most countries don't have any so if your
kid is sick and they need something

1136
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,020
kid is sick and they need something
 

1137
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,680
kid is sick and they need something
diagnose your medical imaging the person

1138
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:41,690
diagnose your medical imaging the person
 

1139
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,420
diagnose your medical imaging the person
even if you're able to get medical

1140
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:43,430
even if you're able to get medical
 

1141
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,890
even if you're able to get medical
imaging done the person that looks at it

1142
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:44,900
imaging done the person that looks at it
 

1143
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,490
imaging done the person that looks at it
will be you know a nurse at best yeah

1144
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:48,500
will be you know a nurse at best yeah
 

1145
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,430
will be you know a nurse at best yeah
but actually in India for example and in

1146
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
but actually in India for example and in
 

1147
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,070
but actually in India for example and in
China almost no x-rays are read by

1148
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,080
China almost no x-rays are read by
 

1149
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,920
China almost no x-rays are read by
anybody by any trained professional

1150
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:56,930
anybody by any trained professional
 

1151
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,760
anybody by any trained professional
because they don't have enough so if

1152
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:00,770
because they don't have enough so if
 

1153
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,100
because they don't have enough so if
instead we had a algorithm that could

1154
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,110
instead we had a algorithm that could
 

1155
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:08,320
instead we had a algorithm that could
take the most likely high-risk 5% and

1156
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,330
take the most likely high-risk 5% and
 

1157
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,290
take the most likely high-risk 5% and
say triage basically say okay somebody

1158
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:11,300
say triage basically say okay somebody
 

1159
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,310
say triage basically say okay somebody
needs to look at this it would massively

1160
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
needs to look at this it would massively
 

1161
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,380
needs to look at this it would massively
change the kind of way that what's

1162
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:17,390
change the kind of way that what's
 

1163
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,960
change the kind of way that what's
possible with medicine in the developing

1164
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:19,970
possible with medicine in the developing
 

1165
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,630
possible with medicine in the developing
world and remember they have

1166
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:21,640
world and remember they have
 

1167
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,010
world and remember they have
increasingly they have money there the

1168
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,020
increasingly they have money there the
 

1169
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,690
increasingly they have money there the
developing world they're not imported

1170
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:25,700
developing world they're not imported
 

1171
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,950
developing world they're not imported
Apella people so they have the money so

1172
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
Apella people so they have the money so
 

1173
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,270
Apella people so they have the money so
that they're building the hospitals

1174
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,280
that they're building the hospitals
 

1175
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,150
that they're building the hospitals
they're getting the diagnostic equipment

1176
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,160
they're getting the diagnostic equipment
 

1177
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,330
they're getting the diagnostic equipment
but they just there's no way for a very

1178
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:34,340
but they just there's no way for a very
 

1179
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,330
but they just there's no way for a very
long time will they be able to have the

1180
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:37,340
long time will they be able to have the
 

1181
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,550
long time will they be able to have the
expertise shortage of their sweeties

1182
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:39,560
expertise shortage of their sweeties
 

1183
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,070
expertise shortage of their sweeties
okay and that's where the deep learning

1184
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
okay and that's where the deep learning
 

1185
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,040
okay and that's where the deep learning
systems could step in and magnify the

1186
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,050
systems could step in and magnify the
 

1187
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,910
systems could step in and magnify the
expertise they do exactly yeah so you do

1188
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:48,920
expertise they do exactly yeah so you do
 

1189
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,900
expertise they do exactly yeah so you do
see just a longer it a little bit longer

1190
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:52,910
see just a longer it a little bit longer
 

1191
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,310
see just a longer it a little bit longer
yeah the interaction you still see the

1192
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,320
yeah the interaction you still see the
 

1193
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,440
yeah the interaction you still see the
human expert still at the core of these

1194
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,450
human expert still at the core of these
 

1195
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,850
human expert still at the core of these
systems yeah absolutely there's

1196
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:00,860
systems yeah absolutely there's
 

1197
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,960
systems yeah absolutely there's
something in medicine that can be

1198
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:01,970
something in medicine that can be
 

1199
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,180
something in medicine that can be
automated almost completely I don't see

1200
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,190
automated almost completely I don't see
 

1201
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,100
automated almost completely I don't see
the point of even thinking about that

1202
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,110
the point of even thinking about that
 

1203
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,600
the point of even thinking about that
because we have such a shortage of

1204
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:07,610
because we have such a shortage of
 

1205
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,880
because we have such a shortage of
people why would we not why would we

1206
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:09,890
people why would we not why would we
 

1207
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,310
people why would we not why would we
want to find a way not to use them like

1208
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
want to find a way not to use them like
 

1209
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,790
want to find a way not to use them like
we have people so the idea of like even

1210
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:15,800
we have people so the idea of like even
 

1211
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,410
we have people so the idea of like even
from an economic point of view if you

1212
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:17,420
from an economic point of view if you
 

1213
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,020
from an economic point of view if you
can make them 10x more productive

1214
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,030
can make them 10x more productive
 

1215
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,820
can make them 10x more productive
getting rid of the person doesn't impact

1216
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:21,830
getting rid of the person doesn't impact
 

1217
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,370
getting rid of the person doesn't impact
your unit economics at all and it

1218
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:24,380
your unit economics at all and it
 

1219
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,380
your unit economics at all and it
totally ignores effect that there are

1220
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,390
totally ignores effect that there are
 

1221
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,870
totally ignores effect that there are
things people do better than machines so

1222
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
things people do better than machines so
 

1223
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,010
things people do better than machines so
it's just to me that's not a useful way

1224
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,020
it's just to me that's not a useful way
 

1225
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,200
it's just to me that's not a useful way
of framing the problem I guess

1226
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,210
of framing the problem I guess
 

1227
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,789
of framing the problem I guess
just to clarify I guess I meant there

1228
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
just to clarify I guess I meant there
 

1229
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,180
just to clarify I guess I meant there
may be some problems where you can avoid

1230
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,190
may be some problems where you can avoid
 

1231
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,580
may be some problems where you can avoid
even going to the expert ever sort of

1232
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:42,590
even going to the expert ever sort of
 

1233
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,730
even going to the expert ever sort of
maybe preventive care or some basic

1234
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:45,740
maybe preventive care or some basic
 

1235
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,380
maybe preventive care or some basic
stuff flowing and food allowing the

1236
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,390
stuff flowing and food allowing the
 

1237
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,000
stuff flowing and food allowing the
expert to focus on the things that are

1238
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,010
expert to focus on the things that are
 

1239
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,760
expert to focus on the things that are
that are really that well that's what

1240
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:51,770
that are really that well that's what
 

1241
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,560
that are really that well that's what
the triage would do right so the triage

1242
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:53,570
the triage would do right so the triage
 

1243
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,070
the triage would do right so the triage
would say okay it's ninety ninety nine

1244
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,080
would say okay it's ninety ninety nine
 

1245
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,490
would say okay it's ninety ninety nine
percent sure there's nothing here right

1246
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:00,500
percent sure there's nothing here right
 

1247
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,760
percent sure there's nothing here right
so you know that can be done on device

1248
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:03,770
so you know that can be done on device
 

1249
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,100
so you know that can be done on device
and they can just say okay go home so

1250
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,110
and they can just say okay go home so
 

1251
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,919
and they can just say okay go home so
the experts are being used to look at

1252
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:08,929
the experts are being used to look at
 

1253
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:11,440
the experts are being used to look at
the stuff which has some chance it's

1254
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:11,450
the stuff which has some chance it's
 

1255
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,110
the stuff which has some chance it's
worth looking at which most things is

1256
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,120
worth looking at which most things is
 

1257
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,720
worth looking at which most things is
it's not you know it's fine why do you

1258
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:16,730
it's not you know it's fine why do you
 

1259
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,450
it's not you know it's fine why do you
think we haven't quite made progress on

1260
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:19,460
think we haven't quite made progress on
 

1261
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,419
think we haven't quite made progress on
that yet in terms of the the scale of

1262
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:24,429
that yet in terms of the the scale of
 

1263
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:27,399
that yet in terms of the the scale of
how much AI is applied in the middle

1264
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:27,409
how much AI is applied in the middle
 

1265
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:28,840
how much AI is applied in the middle
there's a lot of reasons I mean one is

1266
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:28,850
there's a lot of reasons I mean one is
 

1267
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,850
there's a lot of reasons I mean one is
it's pretty new I only started and let

1268
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:30,860
it's pretty new I only started and let
 

1269
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,990
it's pretty new I only started and let
it can like 2014 and before that like

1270
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
it can like 2014 and before that like
 

1271
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,820
it can like 2014 and before that like
it's hard to express to what degree the

1272
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:36,830
it's hard to express to what degree the
 

1273
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,360
it's hard to express to what degree the
medical world was not aware of the

1274
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:39,370
medical world was not aware of the
 

1275
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,789
medical world was not aware of the
opportunities here so I went to iris na

1276
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
opportunities here so I went to iris na
 

1277
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,460
opportunities here so I went to iris na
which is the world's largest radiology

out and no one had any idea what I was

1286
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:56,059
out and no one had any idea what I was
 

1287
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:57,399
out and no one had any idea what I was
talking about and no one had any

talking about and no one had any
 

1289
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:01,320

interest in it so like we've come from

1290
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,330
interest in it so like we've come from
 

1291
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:06,250
interest in it so like we've come from
absolute zero which is hard and then the

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
think of doctoring in a very different
 

1299
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,419
think of doctoring in a very different
way so today there is a small number of

way so today there is a small number of
 

1301
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:19,510
way so today there is a small number of
people who are deep learning

of radiology and like it's just starting

1328
00:29:59,549 --> 00:29:59,559
of radiology and like it's just starting
 

1329
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:02,129
of radiology and like it's just starting
out but it's going to be a long process

1330
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:02,139
out but it's going to be a long process
 

1331
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:04,169
out but it's going to be a long process
they regulators have to learn how to

1332
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:04,179
they regulators have to learn how to
 

1333
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,969
they regulators have to learn how to
regulate this they have to build you

1334
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:05,979
regulate this they have to build you
 

1335
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:11,070
regulate this they have to build you
know guidelines and then the lawyers at

1336
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,080
know guidelines and then the lawyers at
 

1337
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,739
know guidelines and then the lawyers at
hospitals have to develop a new way of

1338
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:13,749
hospitals have to develop a new way of
 

1339
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:17,879
hospitals have to develop a new way of
understanding that sometimes it makes

1340
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:17,889
understanding that sometimes it makes
 

1341
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:22,289
understanding that sometimes it makes
sense for data to be you know looked at

1342
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:22,299
sense for data to be you know looked at
 

1343
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:25,319
sense for data to be you know looked at
in raw form in large quantities in order

1344
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:25,329
in raw form in large quantities in order
 

1345
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:27,209
in raw form in large quantities in order
to create world-changing results he has

1346
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:27,219
to create world-changing results he has
 

1347
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:30,119
to create world-changing results he has
a regulation around data all that it

1348
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,129
a regulation around data all that it
 

1349
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,329
a regulation around data all that it
sounds it was probably the hardest

1350
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:32,339
sounds it was probably the hardest
 

1351
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,459
sounds it was probably the hardest
problem but sounds reminiscent of

1352
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:35,469
problem but sounds reminiscent of
 

1353
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:37,259
problem but sounds reminiscent of
autonomous vehicles as well many of the

1354
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:37,269
autonomous vehicles as well many of the
 

1355
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,060
autonomous vehicles as well many of the
same regulatory challenges meaning the

1356
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,070
same regulatory challenges meaning the
 

1357
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,310
same regulatory challenges meaning the
same data challenges yeah I mean funnily

1358
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,320
same data challenges yeah I mean funnily
 

1359
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,869
same data challenges yeah I mean funnily
enough that problem is less their

1360
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:42,879
enough that problem is less their
 

1361
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:44,819
enough that problem is less their
regulation and more the interpretation

1362
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:44,829
regulation and more the interpretation
 

1363
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:47,639
regulation and more the interpretation
of that regulation by by lawyers in

1364
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:47,649
of that regulation by by lawyers in
 

1365
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:51,029
of that regulation by by lawyers in
hospital so hipper is actually was

1366
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,039
hospital so hipper is actually was
 

1367
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,879
hospital so hipper is actually was
designed to its it to P and hipper is

1368
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:53,889
designed to its it to P and hipper is
 

1369
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:56,129
designed to its it to P and hipper is
not standing does not stand for privacy

1370
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:56,139
not standing does not stand for privacy
 

1371
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:58,109
not standing does not stand for privacy
it stands for portability it's actually

1372
00:30:58,109 --> 00:30:58,119
it stands for portability it's actually
 

1373
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:00,229
it stands for portability it's actually
meant to be a way that data can be used

1374
00:31:00,229 --> 00:31:00,239
meant to be a way that data can be used
 

1375
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:03,659
meant to be a way that data can be used
and it was created with lots of gray

1376
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:03,669
and it was created with lots of gray
 

1377
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:05,639
and it was created with lots of gray
areas because the idea is that would be

1378
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:05,649
areas because the idea is that would be
 

1379
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:07,469
areas because the idea is that would be
more practical and would help people to

1380
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:07,479
more practical and would help people to
 

1381
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:10,769
more practical and would help people to
use this this legislation to actually

1382
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:10,779
use this this legislation to actually
 

1383
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:13,369
use this this legislation to actually
share data in a more thoughtful way

1384
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:13,379
share data in a more thoughtful way
 

1385
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,269
share data in a more thoughtful way
unfortunately it's done the opposite

1386
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:15,279
unfortunately it's done the opposite
 

1387
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,940
unfortunately it's done the opposite
because when a lawyer sees a gray area

1388
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:16,950
because when a lawyer sees a gray area
 

1389
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,129
because when a lawyer sees a gray area
they see oh if we don't know we won't

1390
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:20,139
they see oh if we don't know we won't
 

1391
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:21,869
they see oh if we don't know we won't
get sued then we can't do it today

1392
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:21,879
get sued then we can't do it today
 

1393
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:26,430
get sued then we can't do it today
so hipper is not exactly the problem the

1394
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:26,440
so hipper is not exactly the problem the
 

1395
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,669
so hipper is not exactly the problem the
problem is more than there's hospital

1396
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:29,679
problem is more than there's hospital
 

1397
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,659
problem is more than there's hospital
lawyers are not incentive to make bold

1398
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:33,669
lawyers are not incentive to make bold
 

1399
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:36,869
lawyers are not incentive to make bold
decisions about data portability or even

1400
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:36,879
decisions about data portability or even
 

1401
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:39,869
decisions about data portability or even
to embrace technology that saves lives

1402
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:39,879
to embrace technology that saves lives
 

1403
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:42,389
to embrace technology that saves lives
no they more want to not get in trouble

1404
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:42,399
no they more want to not get in trouble
 

1405
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,060
no they more want to not get in trouble
for embracing the right but also it is

1406
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,070
for embracing the right but also it is
 

1407
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,519
for embracing the right but also it is
also so slaves in a very abstract way

1408
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:47,529
also so slaves in a very abstract way
 

1409
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:49,440
also so slaves in a very abstract way
which is like oh we've been able to

1410
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,450
which is like oh we've been able to
 

1411
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,940
which is like oh we've been able to
release these hundred thousand and on

1412
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:50,950
release these hundred thousand and on
 

1413
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,219
release these hundred thousand and on
most records I can't point at the

1414
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:53,229
most records I can't point at the
 

1415
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:55,019
most records I can't point at the
specific person whose life that's saved

1416
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:55,029
specific person whose life that's saved
 

1417
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,089
specific person whose life that's saved
I can say like oh we've ended up with

1418
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:57,099
I can say like oh we've ended up with
 

1419
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:59,419
I can say like oh we've ended up with
this paper which found this result which

1420
00:31:59,419 --> 00:31:59,429
this paper which found this result which
 

1421
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:01,799
this paper which found this result which
you know diagnosed a thousand more

1422
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:01,809
you know diagnosed a thousand more
 

1423
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:02,190
you know diagnosed a thousand more
people

1424
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,200
people
 

1425
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,889
people
otherwise but it's like which ones were

1426
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:04,899
otherwise but it's like which ones were
 

1427
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:08,190
otherwise but it's like which ones were
helped it's it's very abstract and on

1428
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,200
helped it's it's very abstract and on
 

1429
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,989
helped it's it's very abstract and on
the counter side of that you may be able

1430
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:09,999
the counter side of that you may be able
 

1431
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:12,989
the counter side of that you may be able
to point to a life that was taken

1432
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:12,999
to point to a life that was taken
 

1433
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:15,419
to point to a life that was taken
because of something though yeah or or

1434
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:15,429
because of something though yeah or or
 

1435
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:17,519
because of something though yeah or or
or a person whose privacy was violated

1436
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:17,529
or a person whose privacy was violated
 

1437
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:20,070
or a person whose privacy was violated
it was like oh this specific person you

1438
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
it was like oh this specific person you
 

1439
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,749
it was like oh this specific person you
know there was de-identified so we've

1440
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:24,759
know there was de-identified so we've
 

1441
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,940
know there was de-identified so we've
identified just a fascinating topic

1442
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:26,950
identified just a fascinating topic
 

1443
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,649

we're jumping around I'll get back to

1444
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:28,659
we're jumping around I'll get back to
 

1445
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:32,180
we're jumping around I'll get back to
fast AI but on the question of privacy

1446
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,190
fast AI but on the question of privacy
 

1447
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,609
fast AI but on the question of privacy
data is the fuel for so much innovation

00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,070
in deep learning what's your sense and

technologies like in the medical field
 

1457
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:51,570
technologies like in the medical field
that rely on people's data in order to

from data one of my areas of focus is on

1466
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:06,989
from data one of my areas of focus is on
 

1467
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:12,210
from data one of my areas of focus is on
doing more with less data which so most

1468
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:12,220
doing more with less data which so most
 

1469
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,849
doing more with less data which so most
vendors unfortunately are strongly

1470
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:14,859
vendors unfortunately are strongly
 

1471
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,450
vendors unfortunately are strongly
incented to find ways to require more

1472
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:18,460
incented to find ways to require more
 

1473
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,269
incented to find ways to require more
data and more computation so Google and

1474
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:21,279
data and more computation so Google and
 

1475
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,549
data and more computation so Google and
IBM being the most obvious IBM yeah so

1476
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:26,559
IBM being the most obvious IBM yeah so
 

1477
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,220
IBM being the most obvious IBM yeah so
Watson you know so Google and IBM both

1478
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:29,230
Watson you know so Google and IBM both
 

1479
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,399
Watson you know so Google and IBM both
strongly push the idea that you have to

1480
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:32,409
strongly push the idea that you have to
 

1481
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:34,529
strongly push the idea that you have to
be you know that they have more data and

1482
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:34,539
be you know that they have more data and
 

1483
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:36,509
be you know that they have more data and
more computation and more intelligent

1484
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:36,519
more computation and more intelligent
 

1485
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,399
more computation and more intelligent
people than anybody else and so you have

1486
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:38,409
people than anybody else and so you have
 

1487
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:39,989
people than anybody else and so you have
to trust them to do things because

1488
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:39,999
to trust them to do things because
 

1489
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:43,519
to trust them to do things because
nobody else can do it and Google's very

1490
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:43,529
nobody else can do it and Google's very
 

1491
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:46,859
nobody else can do it and Google's very
upfront about this like Geoff Dana's

1492
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:46,869
upfront about this like Geoff Dana's
 

1493
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:48,690
upfront about this like Geoff Dana's
going out there and given talks and said

1494
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:48,700
going out there and given talks and said
 

1495
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,299
going out there and given talks and said
our goal is to require a thousand times

1496
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:51,309
our goal is to require a thousand times
 

1497
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:55,259
our goal is to require a thousand times
more computation but less people our

1498
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:55,269
more computation but less people our
 

1499
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:59,519
more computation but less people our
goal is to use the people that you have

1500
00:33:59,519 --> 00:33:59,529
goal is to use the people that you have
 

1501
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:01,739
goal is to use the people that you have
better and the data you have better in

1502
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:01,749
better and the data you have better in
 

1503
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,960
better and the data you have better in
the computation you have better so one

1504
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:03,970
the computation you have better so one
 

1505
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,220
the computation you have better so one
of the things that we've discovered is

1506
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,230
of the things that we've discovered is
 

1507
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,260
of the things that we've discovered is
or or at least highlighted is that you

1508
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,270
or or at least highlighted is that you
 

1509
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,669
or or at least highlighted is that you
very very very often don't need much

1510
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:11,679
very very very often don't need much
 

1511
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,309
very very very often don't need much
data at all and so the data you already

1512
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:14,319
data at all and so the data you already
 

1513
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,690
data at all and so the data you already
have in your organization

1514
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:15,700
have in your organization
 

1515
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,730
have in your organization
we'll be enough to get state-of-the-art

1516
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:17,740
we'll be enough to get state-of-the-art
 

1517
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,579
we'll be enough to get state-of-the-art
results so like my starting point would

1518
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:20,589
results so like my starting point would
 

1519
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:23,629
results so like my starting point would
be this going to say around privacy is a

00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:23,639
be this going to say around privacy is a
 

1521
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,789
be this going to say around privacy is a
lot of people are looking for ways to

1522
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:25,799
lot of people are looking for ways to
 

1523
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:28,319
lot of people are looking for ways to
share data and aggregate data but I

1524
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:28,329
share data and aggregate data but I
 

1525
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:30,059
share data and aggregate data but I
think often that's unnecessary they

1526
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:30,069
think often that's unnecessary they
 

1527
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,740
think often that's unnecessary they
assume that they need more data than

1528
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:31,750
assume that they need more data than
 

1529
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,909
assume that they need more data than
they do because they're not familiar

1530
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:32,919
they do because they're not familiar
 

1531
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,609
they do because they're not familiar
with the basics of transfer learning

your sense we can build with a small
amount of data general models they will

amount of data general models they will
 

1559
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,170
amount of data general models they will
have a huge impact for most people that

we don't need to have data from punching
on the whole I'd say yes I mean they're

things like you know recommender systems
 

1567
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:28,650
things like you know recommender systems
have this cold-start problem where you

00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,319
have this cold-start problem where you
know Jeremy is a new customer we haven't

know Jeremy is a new customer we haven't
 

1571
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,819
know Jeremy is a new customer we haven't
seen him before so we can't recommend

1572
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:32,829
seen him before so we can't recommend
 

1573
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:34,079

him things based on what else he's
 

1575
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:36,780
him things based on what else he's
bought and liked with us and there's

1576
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:36,790
bought and liked with us and there's
 

1577
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,450
bought and liked with us and there's
various workarounds to that like in a

1578
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:39,460
various workarounds to that like in a
 

1579
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,280
various workarounds to that like in a
lot of music programs we'll start out by

1580
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,290
lot of music programs we'll start out by
 

1581
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,670
lot of music programs we'll start out by
saying which of these artists you like

1582
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:44,680
saying which of these artists you like
 

1583
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,890
saying which of these artists you like
which of these albums do you like which

1584
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:46,900
which of these albums do you like which
 

1585
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,400
which of these albums do you like which
of these songs do you like Netflix used

1586
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,410
of these songs do you like Netflix used
 

1587
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,410
of these songs do you like Netflix used
to do that nowadays they they tend not

1588
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:52,420
to do that nowadays they they tend not
 

1589
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,690
to do that nowadays they they tend not
to people kind of don't like that

1590
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:54,700
to people kind of don't like that
 

1591
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,770
to people kind of don't like that
because they think oh we don't want to

1592
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:55,780
because they think oh we don't want to
 

1593
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,109
because they think oh we don't want to
bother the user so you could work around

1594
00:35:58,109 --> 00:35:58,119
bother the user so you could work around
 

1595
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,809
bother the user so you could work around
that by having some kind of data sharing

1596
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:00,819
that by having some kind of data sharing
 

1597
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:03,510
that by having some kind of data sharing
where you get my marketing record from

1598
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:03,520
where you get my marketing record from
 

1599
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,030
where you get my marketing record from
axiom or whatever and try to guess from

1600
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,040
axiom or whatever and try to guess from
 

1601
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,460
axiom or whatever and try to guess from
that to me the the benefit to me and to

1602
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:11,470
that to me the the benefit to me and to
 

1603
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,390
that to me the the benefit to me and to
society of saving me five minutes on

1604
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,400
society of saving me five minutes on
 

1605
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,069
society of saving me five minutes on
answering some questions versus the

1606
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:17,079
answering some questions versus the
 

1607
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,930
answering some questions versus the
negative externalities of if the privacy

1608
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:21,940
negative externalities of if the privacy
 

1609
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,500
negative externalities of if the privacy
issue doesn't add up so I think like a

1610
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:25,510
issue doesn't add up so I think like a
 

1611
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,970
issue doesn't add up so I think like a
lot of the time the places where people

1612
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:26,980
lot of the time the places where people
 

1613
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,550
lot of the time the places where people
are

1614
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560
are
 

1615
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,450
are
invading our privacy in order to provide

1616
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:31,460
invading our privacy in order to provide
 

1617
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,360
invading our privacy in order to provide
convenience is really about just trying

1618
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,370
convenience is really about just trying
 

1619
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,600
convenience is really about just trying
to make them more money and and they

00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:38,610
to make them more money and and they
 

1621
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,210
to make them more money and and they
move these negative externalities and to

move these negative externalities and to
 

1623
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,010
move these negative externalities and to
places that they don't have to pay for

00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:43,020
places that they don't have to pay for
 

1625
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,990
places that they don't have to pay for
them so when you actually see

1635
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,150
themselves
they say well we can't do it anymore so

1636
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
they say well we can't do it anymore so
 

1637
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,340
they say well we can't do it anymore so
the cost is actually too high right but

1638
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:58,350
the cost is actually too high right but
 

1639
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,710
the cost is actually too high right but
for something like medicine yeah I mean

1640
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
for something like medicine yeah I mean
 

1641
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,790
for something like medicine yeah I mean
the hospital has my you know medical

so you can so I I helped a startup

1648
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:15,360
so you can so I I helped a startup
 

1649
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,690
so you can so I I helped a startup
called doc AI one of the things doc AI

1650
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:17,700
called doc AI one of the things doc AI
 

1651
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,150
called doc AI one of the things doc AI
does is that this has an app you can

1652
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
does is that this has an app you can
 

1653
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,930
does is that this has an app you can
connect to you know Sutter Health's and

1654
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:23,940
connect to you know Sutter Health's and
 

1655
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,800
connect to you know Sutter Health's and
webcore and Walgreens and download your

1656
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:27,810
webcore and Walgreens and download your
 

1657
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,460
webcore and Walgreens and download your
medical data to your phone and then

1658
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:30,470
medical data to your phone and then
 

1659
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,680
medical data to your phone and then
upload it again at your discretion to

1660
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:33,690
upload it again at your discretion to
 

1661
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,590
upload it again at your discretion to
share it as you wish so with that kind

1662
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:36,600
share it as you wish so with that kind
 

1663
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,490
share it as you wish so with that kind
of approach we can share our medical

1664
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:40,500
of approach we can share our medical
 

1665
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,990
of approach we can share our medical
information with the people we want to

1666
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,000
information with the people we want to
 

1667
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,790
information with the people we want to
yes of control I mean it really being

1668
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800
yes of control I mean it really being
 

1669
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,560
yes of control I mean it really being
able to control who you share with us on

1670
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,570
able to control who you share with us on
 

1671
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,680
able to control who you share with us on
yeah so that that has a beautiful

1672
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:51,690
yeah so that that has a beautiful
 

1673
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,640
yeah so that that has a beautiful
interesting tangent but to return back

1674
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:54,650
interesting tangent but to return back
 

1675
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:59,300
interesting tangent but to return back
to uh the origin story of fast they act

1676
00:37:59,300 --> 00:37:59,310
to uh the origin story of fast they act
 

1677
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,420
to uh the origin story of fast they act
right so so before I started fast AI I

1678
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:02,430
right so so before I started fast AI I
 

1679
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,740
right so so before I started fast AI I
spent a year researching where the

1680
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:06,750
spent a year researching where the
 

1681
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,950
spent a year researching where the
biggest opportunities for deep learning

1682
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:09,960
biggest opportunities for deep learning
 

1683
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,370
biggest opportunities for deep learning
because I knew from my time at Cal in

1684
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:13,380
because I knew from my time at Cal in
 

1685
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,590
because I knew from my time at Cal in
particular that deep learning had kind

1686
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:15,600
particular that deep learning had kind
 

1687
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,330
particular that deep learning had kind
of hit this threshold point where it was

1688
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:17,340
of hit this threshold point where it was
 

1689
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,400
of hit this threshold point where it was
rapidly becoming the state of the art

1690
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:19,410
rapidly becoming the state of the art
 

1691
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,900
rapidly becoming the state of the art
approach in every areas that looked at

1692
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:20,910
approach in every areas that looked at
 

1693
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,320
approach in every areas that looked at
it and I've been working with neural

1694
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,330
it and I've been working with neural
 

1695
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,360
it and I've been working with neural
nets for over 20 years I knew that from

1696
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,370
nets for over 20 years I knew that from
 

1697
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,860
nets for over 20 years I knew that from
a theoretical point of view once it hit

1698
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:27,870
a theoretical point of view once it hit
 

1699
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,660
a theoretical point of view once it hit
that point it would do that in kind of

1700
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:29,670
that point it would do that in kind of
 

1701
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,240
that point it would do that in kind of
just about every domain and so I kind of

1702
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,250
just about every domain and so I kind of
 

1703
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,820
just about every domain and so I kind of
spent a year researching what are the

1704
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:34,830
spent a year researching what are the
 

1705
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,500
spent a year researching what are the
domains it's going to have the biggest

1706
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:36,510
domains it's going to have the biggest
 

1707
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,060
domains it's going to have the biggest
low-hanging fruit in the shortest time

1708
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,070
low-hanging fruit in the shortest time
 

1709
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,620
low-hanging fruit in the shortest time
period

1710
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:39,630
period
 

1711
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,230
period
medicine but there were so many I could

1712
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,240
medicine but there were so many I could
 

1713
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,810
medicine but there were so many I could
have picked and so there was a kind of

1714
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:44,820
have picked and so there was a kind of
 

1715
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,820
have picked and so there was a kind of
level of frustration for me of like okay

1716
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:46,830
level of frustration for me of like okay
 

1717
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,940
level of frustration for me of like okay
I'm really glad we've opened up the

1718
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:49,950
I'm really glad we've opened up the
 

1719
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,620
I'm really glad we've opened up the
medical deep learning world and today is

1720
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:51,630
medical deep learning world and today is
 

1721
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,390
medical deep learning world and today is
huge as you know but we can't do you

1722
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
huge as you know but we can't do you
 

1723
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,610
huge as you know but we can't do you
know I can't do everything I don't even

1724
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:58,620
know I can't do everything I don't even
 

1725
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,470
know I can't do everything I don't even
know like it took like in medicine it

1726
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
know like it took like in medicine it
 

1727
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,880
know like it took like in medicine it
took me a really long time to even get a

1728
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:01,890
took me a really long time to even get a
 

1729
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,770
took me a really long time to even get a
sense of like what kind of problems to

1730
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:03,780
sense of like what kind of problems to
 

1731
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,450
sense of like what kind of problems to
medical practitioners solve what kind of

1732
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:05,460
medical practitioners solve what kind of
 

1733
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,080
medical practitioners solve what kind of
data do they have who has that data so I

1734
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,090
data do they have who has that data so I
 

1735
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,780
data do they have who has that data so I
kind of felt like I need to approach

1736
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:11,790
kind of felt like I need to approach
 

1737
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,040
kind of felt like I need to approach
this differently if I want to maximize

1738
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,050
this differently if I want to maximize
 

1739
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,460
this differently if I want to maximize
the positive impact of deep mourning

1740
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:15,470
the positive impact of deep mourning
 

1741
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:19,310
the positive impact of deep mourning
rather than me picking an area and

1742
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:19,320
rather than me picking an area and
 

1743
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,780
rather than me picking an area and
trying to become good at it and building

1744
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:20,790
trying to become good at it and building
 

1745
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,390
trying to become good at it and building
something I should let people who are

1746
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:23,400
something I should let people who are
 

1747
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,100
something I should let people who are
already domain experts in those areas

1748
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,110
already domain experts in those areas
 

1749
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,070
already domain experts in those areas
and who already have the data do it

1750
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,080
and who already have the data do it
 

1751
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,220
and who already have the data do it
themselves mm-hmm so that was the reason

1752
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:31,230
themselves mm-hmm so that was the reason
 

1753
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,630
themselves mm-hmm so that was the reason
for fast AI is to basically try and

1754
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:35,640
for fast AI is to basically try and
 

1755
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,140
for fast AI is to basically try and
figure out how to get deep learning into

1756
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,150
figure out how to get deep learning into
 

1757
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,970
figure out how to get deep learning into
the hands of people who could benefit

1758
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:40,980
the hands of people who could benefit
 

1759
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,520
the hands of people who could benefit
from it and help them to do so in as

1760
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:43,530
from it and help them to do so in as
 

1761
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,650
from it and help them to do so in as
quick and easy and effective way as

1762
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:45,660
quick and easy and effective way as
 

1763
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,620
quick and easy and effective way as
possible god it's all sort of empowered

1764
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:48,630
possible god it's all sort of empowered
 

1765
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,680
possible god it's all sort of empowered
the the domain expert yeah and like

1766
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:51,690
the the domain expert yeah and like
 

1767
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,740
the the domain expert yeah and like
partly it's because like unlike most

1768
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:54,750
partly it's because like unlike most
 

1769
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,970
partly it's because like unlike most
people in this field

1770
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:55,980
people in this field
 

1771
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,240
people in this field
my background is very applied and

1772
00:39:59,240 --> 00:39:59,250
my background is very applied and
 

1773
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,160
my background is very applied and
industrial that my first job at MIT was

1774
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,170
industrial that my first job at MIT was
 

1775
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,200
industrial that my first job at MIT was
at McKinsey and company I spent 10 years

1776
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,210
at McKinsey and company I spent 10 years
 

1777
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,490
at McKinsey and company I spent 10 years
in management consulting I I spend a lot

1778
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:07,500
in management consulting I I spend a lot
 

1779
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,640
in management consulting I I spend a lot
of time with domain experts you know so

1780
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:10,650
of time with domain experts you know so
 

1781
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,140
of time with domain experts you know so
I kind of respect them and appreciate

1782
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,150
I kind of respect them and appreciate
 

1783
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,820
I kind of respect them and appreciate
them and know I know that's where the

1784
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:13,830
them and know I know that's where the
 

1785
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,210
them and know I know that's where the
value generation in society is and so I

1786
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:17,220
value generation in society is and so I
 

1787
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,990
value generation in society is and so I
also know how most of them can't code

1788
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,000
also know how most of them can't code
 

1789
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,560
also know how most of them can't code
and most of them don't have the time to

1790
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:24,570
and most of them don't have the time to
 

1791
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,410
and most of them don't have the time to
invest you know three years and a

1792
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:27,420
invest you know three years and a
 

1793
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,780
invest you know three years and a
graduate degree or whatever so it's like

1794
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:29,790
graduate degree or whatever so it's like
 

1795
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,620
graduate degree or whatever so it's like
how do i skill those two main experts I

1796
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:33,630
how do i skill those two main experts I
 

1797
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,260
how do i skill those two main experts I
think it would be a super powerful thing

1798
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,270
think it would be a super powerful thing
 

1799
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,210
think it would be a super powerful thing
you know biggest societal impact I could

1800
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:38,220
you know biggest societal impact I could
 

1801
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,270
you know biggest societal impact I could
have so that yeah that was the thinking

1802
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,280
have so that yeah that was the thinking
 

1803
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,960
have so that yeah that was the thinking
so so much a fast AI students and

1804
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:44,970
so so much a fast AI students and
 

1805
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,130
so so much a fast AI students and
researchers and the things you teach are

1806
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:48,140
researchers and the things you teach are
 

1807
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,690
researchers and the things you teach are
pragmatically minded right practically

1808
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:50,700
pragmatically minded right practically
 

1809
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,030
pragmatically minded right practically
minded freaking figuring out ways how to

1810
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,040
minded freaking figuring out ways how to
 

1811
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,540
minded freaking figuring out ways how to
solve

1812
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:53,550
solve
 

1813
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,840
solve
real problems and fast right so from

1814
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:56,850
real problems and fast right so from
 

1815
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,130
real problems and fast right so from
your experience what's the difference

1816
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,140
your experience what's the difference
 

1817
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,710
your experience what's the difference
between theory and practice of deep

1818
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:00,720
between theory and practice of deep
 

1819
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,260
between theory and practice of deep
learning well most of the research in

1820
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,270
learning well most of the research in
 

1821
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,540
learning well most of the research in
the deep mining world is a total waste

1822
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:08,550
the deep mining world is a total waste
 

1823
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,460
the deep mining world is a total waste
of time all right that's what I was

1824
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:10,470
of time all right that's what I was
 

1825
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,450
of time all right that's what I was
getting at yeah it's it's a problem in

1826
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:14,460
getting at yeah it's it's a problem in
 

1827
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,380
getting at yeah it's it's a problem in
science in general scientists need to be

1828
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,390
science in general scientists need to be
 

1829
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,870
science in general scientists need to be
published which means they need to work

1830
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880
published which means they need to work
 

1831
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,090
published which means they need to work
on things that their peers are extremely

1832
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:23,100
on things that their peers are extremely
 

1833
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,070
on things that their peers are extremely
familiar with and can recognize in

1834
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,080
familiar with and can recognize in
 

1835
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,990
familiar with and can recognize in
advance in that area so that means that

1836
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,000
advance in that area so that means that
 

1837
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,300
advance in that area so that means that
they all need to work on the same thing

1838
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,310
they all need to work on the same thing
 

1839
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:32,420
they all need to work on the same thing
and so it really Inc and and the thing

1840
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:32,430
and so it really Inc and and the thing
 

1841
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,830
and so it really Inc and and the thing
they work on there's nothing to

1842
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:33,840
they work on there's nothing to
 

1843
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,690
they work on there's nothing to
encourage them to work on things that

1844
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:35,700
encourage them to work on things that
 

1845
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,890
encourage them to work on things that
are practically useful so you get just a

1846
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:39,900
are practically useful so you get just a
 

1847
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,960
are practically useful so you get just a
whole lot of research which is minor

1848
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:41,970
whole lot of research which is minor
 

1849
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,820
whole lot of research which is minor
advances and stuff that's been very

1850
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:43,830
advances and stuff that's been very
 

1851
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,360
advances and stuff that's been very
highly studied and has no significant

1852
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,370
highly studied and has no significant
 

1853
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,880
highly studied and has no significant
practical impact where else the things

1854
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:49,890
practical impact where else the things
 

1855
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,350
practical impact where else the things
that really make a difference like I

1856
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:51,360
that really make a difference like I
 

1857
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,210
that really make a difference like I
mentioned transfer learning like if we

1858
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:53,220
mentioned transfer learning like if we
 

1859
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,840
mentioned transfer learning like if we
can do better at transfer learning then

1860
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:55,850
can do better at transfer learning then
 

1861
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,160
can do better at transfer learning then
it's this like world-changing thing

1862
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,170
it's this like world-changing thing
 

1863
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,070
it's this like world-changing thing
we're suddenly like lots more people can

1864
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:00,080
we're suddenly like lots more people can
 

1865
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,340
we're suddenly like lots more people can
do world-class work with less resources

1866
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:04,350
do world-class work with less resources
 

1867
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,670
do world-class work with less resources
and less data and but almost nobody

1868
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:07,680
and less data and but almost nobody
 

1869
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,370
and less data and but almost nobody
works on that or another example active

1870
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:10,380
works on that or another example active
 

1871
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,080
works on that or another example active
learning which is the study of like how

1872
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,090
learning which is the study of like how
 

1873
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,840
learning which is the study of like how
do we get more out of the human beings

1874
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:14,850
do we get more out of the human beings
 

1875
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,940
do we get more out of the human beings
in the loop where's my favorite topic

1876
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:16,950
in the loop where's my favorite topic
 

1877
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,740
in the loop where's my favorite topic
yeah so active learning is great but

1878
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:18,750
yeah so active learning is great but
 

1879
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,530
yeah so active learning is great but
it's almost nobody working on it because

1880
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:21,540
it's almost nobody working on it because
 

1881
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,750
it's almost nobody working on it because
it's just not a trendy thing right now

1882
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
it's just not a trendy thing right now
 

1883
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,550
it's just not a trendy thing right now

an active learning but there's people

1890
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:32,280
an active learning but there's people
 

1891
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,310
an active learning but there's people
inside companies anybody who actually

inside companies anybody who actually
 

1893
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,940
inside companies anybody who actually
has to solve a problem they're going to

innovate an active learning yeah

1896
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:39,810
innovate an active learning yeah
 

1897
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,720
innovate an active learning yeah
everybody kind of reinvents active

1898
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:41,730
everybody kind of reinvents active
 

1899
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,070
everybody kind of reinvents active
learning when they actually have to work

1900
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,080
learning when they actually have to work
 

1901
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,720
learning when they actually have to work
in practice because they start labeling

1902
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:44,730
in practice because they start labeling
 

1903
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,880
in practice because they start labeling
things and they think gosh this is

1904
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:46,890
things and they think gosh this is
 

1905
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,020
things and they think gosh this is
taking a long time and it's very

1906
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,030
taking a long time and it's very
 

1907
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,350
taking a long time and it's very
expensive and then they start thinking

1908
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:50,360
expensive and then they start thinking
 

1909
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,790
expensive and then they start thinking
well why am i labeling everything I'm

1910
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:52,800
well why am i labeling everything I'm
 

1911
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,740
well why am i labeling everything I'm
only the machines only making mistakes

1912
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:54,750
only the machines only making mistakes
 

1913
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,540
only the machines only making mistakes
on those two classes they're the hard

1914
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:56,550
on those two classes they're the hard
 

1915
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,710
on those two classes they're the hard
ones maybe I ought to start labeling

1916
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:57,720
ones maybe I ought to start labeling
 

1917
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,420
ones maybe I ought to start labeling
those two classes and then you start

1918
00:42:59,420 --> 00:42:59,430
those two classes and then you start
 

1919
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,490
those two classes and then you start
thinking well why did I do that manually

1920
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:01,500
thinking well why did I do that manually
 

1921
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,930
thinking well why did I do that manually
why kind of just get the system to tell

1922
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:02,940
why kind of just get the system to tell
 

1923
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,270
why kind of just get the system to tell
me which things are going to be hardest

1924
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:04,280
me which things are going to be hardest
 

1925
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,170
me which things are going to be hardest
it's an obvious thing to do but

1926
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:07,180
it's an obvious thing to do but
 

1927
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,990
it's an obvious thing to do but
yeah it's it's just like like transplant

1928
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,000
yeah it's it's just like like transplant
 

1929
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,390
yeah it's it's just like like transplant
learning it's it's under studied and the

1930
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:13,400
learning it's it's under studied and the
 

1931
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,339
learning it's it's under studied and the
academic world just has no reason to

1932
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:15,349
academic world just has no reason to
 

1933
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:17,770
academic world just has no reason to
care about practical results the funny

1934
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:17,780
care about practical results the funny
 

1935
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,060
care about practical results the funny
thing is like I've only really ever

1936
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,070
thing is like I've only really ever
 

1937
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,859
thing is like I've only really ever
written one paper I hate writing papers

1938
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:20,869
written one paper I hate writing papers
 

1939
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:23,589
written one paper I hate writing papers
and I didn't even write it it was my

1940
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:23,599
and I didn't even write it it was my
 

1941
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,880
and I didn't even write it it was my
colleague sebastian ruder who actually

1942
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:24,890
colleague sebastian ruder who actually
 

1943
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,130
colleague sebastian ruder who actually
wrote it I just knew did the research

1944
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:27,140
wrote it I just knew did the research
 

1945
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,349
wrote it I just knew did the research
for it but it was basically introducing

1946
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
for it but it was basically introducing
 

1947
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,450
for it but it was basically introducing
transfer learning successful transfer

1948
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:31,460
transfer learning successful transfer
 

1949
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,390
transfer learning successful transfer
learning to NLP for the first time the

1950
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
learning to NLP for the first time the
 

1951
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,760
learning to NLP for the first time the
algorithm is called GLM fit and it

1952
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:39,770
algorithm is called GLM fit and it
 

1953
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,380
algorithm is called GLM fit and it
actually I actually wrote it for the

1954
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:41,390
actually I actually wrote it for the
 

1955
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,690
actually I actually wrote it for the
course for the first day of course I

1956
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:43,700
course for the first day of course I
 

1957
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,490
course for the first day of course I
wanted to teach people in LP and I

1958
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:45,500
wanted to teach people in LP and I
 

1959
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,660
wanted to teach people in LP and I
thought I only want to teach people

1960
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:46,670
thought I only want to teach people
 

1961
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,280
thought I only want to teach people
practical stuff and I think the only

1962
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:48,290
practical stuff and I think the only
 

1963
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,230
practical stuff and I think the only
practical stuff is transfer learning and

1964
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
practical stuff is transfer learning and
 

1965
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,420
practical stuff is transfer learning and
I couldn't find any examples of transfer

1966
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:52,430
I couldn't find any examples of transfer
 

1967
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,790
I couldn't find any examples of transfer
learning and NLP so I just did it and I

1968
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:54,800
learning and NLP so I just did it and I
 

1969
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,010
learning and NLP so I just did it and I
was shocked to find that as soon as I

1970
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,020
was shocked to find that as soon as I
 

1971
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,320
was shocked to find that as soon as I
did it was you know the basic prototype

1972
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,330
did it was you know the basic prototype
 

1973
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,720
did it was you know the basic prototype
took a couple of days smashed the

1974
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:01,730
took a couple of days smashed the
 

1975
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,160
took a couple of days smashed the
state-of-the-art on one of the most

1976
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:03,170
state-of-the-art on one of the most
 

1977
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,900
state-of-the-art on one of the most
important data sets in a field that I

1978
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:04,910
important data sets in a field that I
 

1979
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,270
important data sets in a field that I
knew nothing about and I just thought

1980
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:07,280
knew nothing about and I just thought
 

1981
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,460
knew nothing about and I just thought
well this is ridiculous

1982
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:09,470
well this is ridiculous
 

1983
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:13,990
well this is ridiculous
and so I spoke to the best unit and he

1984
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
and so I spoke to the best unit and he
 

1985
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,109
and so I spoke to the best unit and he
kindly offered to write it up the

1986
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:17,119
kindly offered to write it up the
 

1987
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,150
kindly offered to write it up the
results and so it ended up being

1988
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:19,160
results and so it ended up being
 

1989
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,120
results and so it ended up being
published in a CL which is the top link

1990
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,130
published in a CL which is the top link
 

1991
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,800
published in a CL which is the top link
with a computational linguistics

1992
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:23,810
with a computational linguistics
 

1993
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,530
with a computational linguistics
conference so like people do actually

1994
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:26,540
conference so like people do actually
 

1995
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,560
conference so like people do actually
care once you do it but I guess it's

1996
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:29,570
care once you do it but I guess it's
 

1997
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,720
care once you do it but I guess it's
difficult for maybe like junior

1998
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:31,730
difficult for maybe like junior
 

1999
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,900
difficult for maybe like junior
researchers or like like I don't care

2000
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:34,910
researchers or like like I don't care
 

2001
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,000
researchers or like like I don't care
whether I get citations or papers

2002
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,010
whether I get citations or papers
 

2003
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,290
whether I get citations or papers
whatever I was right there's nothing in

2004
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:38,300
whatever I was right there's nothing in
 

2005
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,730
whatever I was right there's nothing in
my life that makes that important which

2006
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:39,740
my life that makes that important which
 

2007
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,530
my life that makes that important which
is why I've never actually bothered to

2008
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:41,540
is why I've never actually bothered to
 

2009
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,630
is why I've never actually bothered to
write a pic of myself now for people who

2010
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:43,640
write a pic of myself now for people who
 

2011
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,440
write a pic of myself now for people who
do I guess they have to pick the kind of

2012
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:46,450
do I guess they have to pick the kind of
 

2013
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:51,370
do I guess they have to pick the kind of
safe option which is like yeah make a

2014
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:51,380
safe option which is like yeah make a
 

2015
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,810
safe option which is like yeah make a
slight improvement on something that

2016
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:52,820
slight improvement on something that
 

2017
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,380
slight improvement on something that
everybody is already working on yeah

2018
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:55,390
everybody is already working on yeah
 

2019
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,359
everybody is already working on yeah
nobody does anything interesting or

2020
00:44:58,359 --> 00:44:58,369
nobody does anything interesting or
 

2021
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:00,450
nobody does anything interesting or
succeeds in life or the safe option

2022
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:00,460
succeeds in life or the safe option
 

2023
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,589
succeeds in life or the safe option
speed I mean the nice thing is nowadays

2024
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:02,599

everybody is now working on you know a
 

2027
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,770
everybody is now working on you know a
transfer learning because since that

2028

transfer learning because since that
 

2029

time we've had GPT and GPT too and Burt

2030
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:09,500
time we've had GPT and GPT too and Burt
 

2031
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,849
time we've had GPT and GPT too and Burt
and you know it's like it's so yeah once

2032
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:12,859
and you know it's like it's so yeah once
 

2033
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:15,460
and you know it's like it's so yeah once
you show that something is possible if

2034
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:15,470
you show that something is possible if
 

2035
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,890
you show that something is possible if
nobody jumps you and I guess I

2036
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:17,900
nobody jumps you and I guess I
 

2037
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,960
nobody jumps you and I guess I
hope to be a part of and I hope to see

2038
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:19,970
hope to be a part of and I hope to see
 

2039
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,670
hope to be a part of and I hope to see
more innovation and active learning in

2040
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:21,680
more innovation and active learning in
 

2041
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,140
more innovation and active learning in
the same way I think yeah try learning

2042
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:23,150
the same way I think yeah try learning
 

2043
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,620
the same way I think yeah try learning
an active learning are fascinating

2044
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:25,630
an active learning are fascinating
 

2045
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,120
an active learning are fascinating
public open were I actually helped start

2046
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,130
public open were I actually helped start
 

2047
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,220
public open were I actually helped start
a startup called platform AI which is

2048
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:30,230
a startup called platform AI which is
 

2049
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,220
a startup called platform AI which is
really all about active learning and

2050
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:32,230
really all about active learning and
 

2051
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,240
really all about active learning and
yeah it's very interesting trying to

2052
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:34,250
yeah it's very interesting trying to
 

2053
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,820
yeah it's very interesting trying to
kind of see what research is out there

2054
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:36,830
kind of see what research is out there
 

2055
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,470
kind of see what research is out there
and make the most of it and there's

2056
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,480
and make the most of it and there's
 

2057
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,880
and make the most of it and there's
basically none so we've had to do all

2058
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:39,890
basically none so we've had to do all
 

2059
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,100
basically none so we've had to do all
our own research once again and just as

2060
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,110
our own research once again and just as
 

2061
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:45,720
our own research once again and just as
easy described can you tell the story of

2062
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:45,730
easy described can you tell the story of
 

2063
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,570
easy described can you tell the story of
the stanford competition dawn bench and

2064
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:48,580
the stanford competition dawn bench and
 

2065
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:52,200
the stanford competition dawn bench and
fast day eyes achievement on it sure so

2066
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,210
fast day eyes achievement on it sure so
 

2067
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,760
fast day eyes achievement on it sure so
something which I really enjoy is that I

2068
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:54,770
something which I really enjoy is that I
 

2069
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,770
something which I really enjoy is that I
basically teach two courses a year

2070
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:56,780
basically teach two courses a year
 

2071
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,290
basically teach two courses a year
the practical deep money for coders

2072

coders which is the kind of research
 

2079
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,770
coders which is the kind of research
level course and while I teach those

2080

I built the course and so generally it's

2092
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:26,120
I built the course and so generally it's
 

2093
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,360
I built the course and so generally it's
full and so we have twenty or thirty

2094
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:28,370
full and so we have twenty or thirty
 

2095
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:31,360
full and so we have twenty or thirty
people in a big office with nothing to

2096
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:31,370
people in a big office with nothing to
 

2097
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,210
people in a big office with nothing to
do but study deep learning so it was

2098
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:34,220
do but study deep learning so it was
 

2099
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,160
do but study deep learning so it was
during one of these times that somebody

2100
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,170
during one of these times that somebody
 

2101
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,890
during one of these times that somebody
in the group said oh there's a thing

2102
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:38,900
in the group said oh there's a thing
 

2103
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,350
in the group said oh there's a thing
called Don benched it looks interesting

2104
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:41,360
called Don benched it looks interesting
 

2105
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,030
called Don benched it looks interesting
and I was like what the hell is that is

2106
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:43,040
and I was like what the hell is that is
 

2107
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,470
and I was like what the hell is that is
it about some competition to see how

2108
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:44,480
it about some competition to see how
 

2109
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,830
it about some competition to see how
quickly you can train a model seems kind

2110
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:47,840
quickly you can train a model seems kind
 

2111
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,990
quickly you can train a model seems kind
of not exactly relevant to what we're

2112
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
of not exactly relevant to what we're
 

2113
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,160
of not exactly relevant to what we're
doing but it sounds like the kind of

2114
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,170
doing but it sounds like the kind of
 

2115
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,540
doing but it sounds like the kind of
thing which you might be interested in I

2116
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:52,550
thing which you might be interested in I
 

2117
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,860
thing which you might be interested in I
checked it out and I said oh crap

2118
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:53,870
checked it out and I said oh crap
 

2119
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,510
checked it out and I said oh crap
there's only ten days till it's over

2120
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:55,520
there's only ten days till it's over
 

2121
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,630
there's only ten days till it's over
it's pretty too late and we're kind of

2122
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
it's pretty too late and we're kind of
 

2123
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,700
it's pretty too late and we're kind of
busy trying to teach this course yeah

2124
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:00,710
busy trying to teach this course yeah
 

2125
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,620
busy trying to teach this course yeah
maybe like oh it would make an

2126
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:02,630
maybe like oh it would make an
 

2127
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,070
maybe like oh it would make an
interesting case study for the course

2128
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:06,080
interesting case study for the course
 

2129
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,450
interesting case study for the course
like it's all the stuff where you're

2130
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:07,460
like it's all the stuff where you're
 

2131
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,010
like it's all the stuff where you're
already doing why don't you just put

2132
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:09,020
already doing why don't you just put
 

2133
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,170
already doing why don't you just put
together our current best practices and

2134
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:11,180
together our current best practices and
 

2135
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,620
together our current best practices and
ideas so me and I guess about four

2136
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:14,630
ideas so me and I guess about four
 

2137
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,380
ideas so me and I guess about four
students just decided to give it a go

2138
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:17,390
students just decided to give it a go
 

2139
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,630
students just decided to give it a go
and we focused on this more one called

2140
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:19,640
and we focused on this more one called
 

2141
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,510
and we focused on this more one called
Sipho ten which is that all 32 by 32

2142
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:22,520
Sipho ten which is that all 32 by 32
 

2143
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,260
Sipho ten which is that all 32 by 32
pixels can you say word on benches yeah

2144
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:26,270
pixels can you say word on benches yeah
 

2145
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,570
pixels can you say word on benches yeah
so it's a competition to train a model

2146
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:28,580
so it's a competition to train a model
 

2147
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,040
so it's a competition to train a model
as fast as possible I was run by

2148
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,050
as fast as possible I was run by
 

2149
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,120
as fast as possible I was run by
Stanford

2150
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,130
Stanford
 

2151
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,040
Stanford
as cheap as possible - that's also

2152
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,050
as cheap as possible - that's also
 

2153
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,390
as cheap as possible - that's also
another one first cheap as possible and

2154
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,400
another one first cheap as possible and
 

2155
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,880
another one first cheap as possible and
there was a couple of categories

2156
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:35,890
there was a couple of categories
 

2157
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,920
there was a couple of categories
imagenet and so far 10 so image nets is

2158
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:38,930
imagenet and so far 10 so image nets is
 

2159
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,850
imagenet and so far 10 so image nets is
big 1.3 million image thing that took a

2160
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:42,860
big 1.3 million image thing that took a
 

2161
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,670
big 1.3 million image thing that took a
couple of days to train remember a

2162
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
couple of days to train remember a
 

2163
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,580
couple of days to train remember a
friend of mine Pete worden who's now at

2164
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:48,590
friend of mine Pete worden who's now at
 

2165
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,240
friend of mine Pete worden who's now at
Google I remember he told me how he

2166
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,250
Google I remember he told me how he
 

2167
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,130
Google I remember he told me how he
trained imagenet a few years ago and he

2168
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:54,140
trained imagenet a few years ago and he
 

2169
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:59,020
trained imagenet a few years ago and he
basically like had this little granny

2170
00:47:59,020 --> 00:47:59,030
basically like had this little granny
 

2171
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,250
basically like had this little granny
flat out the back that he turned into

2172
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:00,260
flat out the back that he turned into
 

2173
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,050
flat out the back that he turned into
his image net training center and he

2174
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:02,060
his image net training center and he
 

2175
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,430
his image net training center and he
figured you know after like a year of

2176
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:03,440
figured you know after like a year of
 

2177
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,810
figured you know after like a year of
work he figured out how to train it and

2178
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:04,820
work he figured out how to train it and
 

2179
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,240
work he figured out how to train it and
like ten days or something it's like

2180
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:07,250
like ten days or something it's like
 

2181
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,880
like ten days or something it's like
that was a big job well so far ten at

2182
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:09,890
that was a big job well so far ten at
 

2183
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:12,460
that was a big job well so far ten at
that time you could train in a few hours

2184
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:12,470
that time you could train in a few hours
 

2185
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,650
that time you could train in a few hours
you know it's much smaller and easier so

2186
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:14,660
you know it's much smaller and easier so
 

2187
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:19,780
you know it's much smaller and easier so
we thought would try so far 10 and yeah

2188
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:19,790
we thought would try so far 10 and yeah
 

2189
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:23,950
we thought would try so far 10 and yeah
I've really never done that before like

2190
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:23,960
I've really never done that before like
 

2191
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,360
I've really never done that before like
I've never really liked things like

2192
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,370
I've never really liked things like
 

2193
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:28,030
I've never really liked things like
using more than one gpgpu at a time was

2194
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:28,040
using more than one gpgpu at a time was
 

2195
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,190
using more than one gpgpu at a time was
something I tried to avoid cuz to me

2196
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:30,200
something I tried to avoid cuz to me
 

2197
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,170
something I tried to avoid cuz to me
it's like very against the whole idea of

2198
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:32,180
it's like very against the whole idea of
 

2199
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,150
it's like very against the whole idea of
accessibility is she better to do things

2200
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,160
accessibility is she better to do things
 

2201
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,130
accessibility is she better to do things
with 1gb here I mean have you asked in

2202
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:36,140
with 1gb here I mean have you asked in
 

2203
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,590
with 1gb here I mean have you asked in
the past before after having

2204
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:38,600
the past before after having
 

2205
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,360
the past before after having
accomplished something how do I do this

2206
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:40,370
accomplished something how do I do this
 

2207
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,480
accomplished something how do I do this
faster much faster Oh always but it's

2208
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:43,490
faster much faster Oh always but it's
 

2209
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,860
faster much faster Oh always but it's
always for me it's always how do I make

2210
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:44,870
always for me it's always how do I make
 

2211
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:47,530
always for me it's always how do I make
it much faster on a single genus you

2212
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:47,540
it much faster on a single genus you
 

2213
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,360
it much faster on a single genus you
that a normal person could afford in

2214
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:49,370
that a normal person could afford in
 

2215
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,040
that a normal person could afford in
their day-to-day life it's not how could

2216
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,050
their day-to-day life it's not how could
 

2217
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:54,460
their day-to-day life it's not how could
I do it faster I you know having a huge

2218
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:54,470
I do it faster I you know having a huge
 

2219
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,200
I do it faster I you know having a huge
data center because up to me it's all

2220
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:56,210
data center because up to me it's all
 

2221
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,240
data center because up to me it's all
about like as many people should be to

2222
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:58,250
about like as many people should be to
 

2223
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,900
about like as many people should be to
use something as possible without

2224
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:00,910
use something as possible without
 

2225
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,270
use something as possible without
fussing around with infrastructure so

2226
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:04,280
fussing around with infrastructure so
 

2227
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,130
fussing around with infrastructure so
anyway so in this case it's like well we

2228
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:06,140
anyway so in this case it's like well we
 

2229
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,160
anyway so in this case it's like well we
can use eight GPUs just by renting a AWS

2230
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,170
can use eight GPUs just by renting a AWS
 

2231
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,750
can use eight GPUs just by renting a AWS
machine so we thought we'd try that and

2232
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:12,760
machine so we thought we'd try that and
 

2233
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,100
machine so we thought we'd try that and
yeah basically using the stuff we were

2234
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,110
yeah basically using the stuff we were
 

2235
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:18,310
yeah basically using the stuff we were
already doing we were able to get you

2236
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:18,320
already doing we were able to get you
 

2237
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,710
already doing we were able to get you
know the speed you know within a few

2238
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:20,720
know the speed you know within a few
 

2239
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,040
know the speed you know within a few
days we had to speed down to I don't

2240
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,050
days we had to speed down to I don't
 

2241
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,630
days we had to speed down to I don't
know that's a very small number of

2242
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:25,640
know that's a very small number of
 

2243
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,460
know that's a very small number of
minutes I can't remember exactly how

2244
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,470
minutes I can't remember exactly how
 

2245
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:29,140
minutes I can't remember exactly how
many minutes it was but I might have in

2246
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,150
many minutes it was but I might have in
 

2247
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:32,170
many minutes it was but I might have in
like 10 minutes or something and so yeah

2248
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:32,180
like 10 minutes or something and so yeah
 

2249
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,400
like 10 minutes or something and so yeah
we found ourselves at the top of the

2250
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:33,410
we found ourselves at the top of the
 

2251
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,980
we found ourselves at the top of the
leaderboard easily for both time and

2252
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:35,990
leaderboard easily for both time and
 

2253
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:39,130
leaderboard easily for both time and
money which really shocked me because

2254
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:39,140
money which really shocked me because
 

2255
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,210
money which really shocked me because
the other people competing this were

2256
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:40,220
the other people competing this were
 

2257
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,010
the other people competing this were
like Google and Intel and stuff we're

2258
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:42,020
like Google and Intel and stuff we're
 

2259
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,030
like Google and Intel and stuff we're
like know a lot more about this stuff

2260
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:44,040
like know a lot more about this stuff
 

2261
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,190
like know a lot more about this stuff
I think we do so that we were emboldened

2262
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:46,200
I think we do so that we were emboldened
 

2263
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,610
I think we do so that we were emboldened
we thought let's try the imagenet one

2264
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:49,620
we thought let's try the imagenet one
 

2265
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:54,140
we thought let's try the imagenet one
two way out of our league but our goal

2266
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,150
two way out of our league but our goal
 

2267
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,590
two way out of our league but our goal
was to get under 12 hours yeah and we

2268
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:57,600
was to get under 12 hours yeah and we
 

2269
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,780
was to get under 12 hours yeah and we
did which was really exciting and but we

2270
00:49:59,780 --> 00:49:59,790
did which was really exciting and but we
 

2271
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,920
did which was really exciting and but we
didn't put anything up on the

2272
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:00,930
didn't put anything up on the
 

2273
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,540
didn't put anything up on the
leaderboard but we were down to like 10

2274
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:02,550
leaderboard but we were down to like 10
 

2275
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:08,870
leaderboard but we were down to like 10
hours but then Google put in some like 5

2276
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
hours but then Google put in some like 5
 

2277
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,990
hours but then Google put in some like 5
hours or something about us like oh

2278
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:11,000
hours or something about us like oh
 

2279
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,450
hours or something about us like oh
they're so screwed but we kind of

2280
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:14,460
they're so screwed but we kind of
 

2281
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,970
they're so screwed but we kind of
thought we'll keep trying you know if

2282
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:16,980
thought we'll keep trying you know if
 

2283
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,470
thought we'll keep trying you know if
Google can do it info I mean Google did

2284
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:18,480
Google can do it info I mean Google did
 

2285
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,690
Google can do it info I mean Google did
on five hours on someone like a TPU pod

2286
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:20,700
on five hours on someone like a TPU pod
 

2287
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,620
on five hours on someone like a TPU pod
or something like a lot of hardware but

2288
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:23,630
or something like a lot of hardware but
 

2289
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,970
or something like a lot of hardware but
we kind of like had a bunch of ideas to

2290
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:25,980
we kind of like had a bunch of ideas to
 

2291
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,880
we kind of like had a bunch of ideas to
try like a really simple thing was why

2292
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:28,890
try like a really simple thing was why
 

2293
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,620
try like a really simple thing was why
are we using these big images they're

2294
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:30,630
are we using these big images they're
 

2295
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:36,440
are we using these big images they're
like 224 256 by 256 pixels you know why

2296
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:36,450
like 224 256 by 256 pixels you know why
 

2297
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,300
like 224 256 by 256 pixels you know why
don't we try smaller ones and just

2298
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:38,310
don't we try smaller ones and just
 

2299
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:40,640
don't we try smaller ones and just
elaborate there's a constraint on the

2300
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:40,650
elaborate there's a constraint on the
 

2301
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,260
elaborate there's a constraint on the
accuracy that your training model is

2302
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:42,270
accuracy that your training model is
 

2303
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,520
accuracy that your training model is
supposed to achieve yeah you got to

2304
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:43,530
supposed to achieve yeah you got to
 

2305
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,320
supposed to achieve yeah you got to
achieve 93% I think it was for imagenet

2306
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:47,330
achieve 93% I think it was for imagenet
 

2307
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:50,540
achieve 93% I think it was for imagenet
exactly which is very tough so you have

2308
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:50,550
exactly which is very tough so you have
 

2309
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:53,000
exactly which is very tough so you have
to yeah 93% like they think that they

2310
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,010
to yeah 93% like they think that they
 

2311
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,490
to yeah 93% like they think that they
picked a good threshold it was a little

2312
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:55,500
picked a good threshold it was a little
 

2313
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,310
picked a good threshold it was a little
bit higher than what the most commonly

2314
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:58,320
bit higher than what the most commonly
 

2315
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,820
bit higher than what the most commonly
used ResNet 50 model could achieve at

2316
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:01,830
used ResNet 50 model could achieve at
 

2317
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,940
used ResNet 50 model could achieve at
that time so yeah so it's quite a

2318
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:04,950
that time so yeah so it's quite a
 

2319
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,690
that time so yeah so it's quite a
difficult problem to solve but yeah we

2320
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:08,700
difficult problem to solve but yeah we
 

2321
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,820
difficult problem to solve but yeah we
realized if we actually just use 64 by

2322
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:10,830
realized if we actually just use 64 by
 

2323
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:15,710
realized if we actually just use 64 by
64 images it trained a pretty good model

2324
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:15,720
64 images it trained a pretty good model
 

2325
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,570
64 images it trained a pretty good model
and then we could take that same model

2326
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:17,580
and then we could take that same model
 

2327
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,700
and then we could take that same model
and just give it a couple of epochs to

2328
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:19,710
and just give it a couple of epochs to
 

2329
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,370
and just give it a couple of epochs to
learn 224 by 224 images and it was

2330
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:22,380
learn 224 by 224 images and it was
 

2331
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,980
learn 224 by 224 images and it was
basically already trained it makes a lot

2332
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:24,990
basically already trained it makes a lot
 

2333
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,780
basically already trained it makes a lot
of sense like if you teach somebody like

2334
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:26,790
of sense like if you teach somebody like
 

2335
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,280
of sense like if you teach somebody like
here's what a dog looks like and you

2336
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:28,290
here's what a dog looks like and you
 

2337
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,440
here's what a dog looks like and you
show them low res versions and then you

2338
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,450
show them low res versions and then you
 

2339
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,450
show them low res versions and then you
say here's a really clear picture of a

2340
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:32,460
say here's a really clear picture of a
 

2341
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,880
say here's a really clear picture of a
dog they already know what a dog looks

2342
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:34,890
dog they already know what a dog looks
 

2343
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:39,560
dog they already know what a dog looks
like so that like just we jumped to the

2344
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,570
like so that like just we jumped to the
 

2345
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,529
like so that like just we jumped to the
front and we ended up winning

2346
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:44,539

 

2347
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:46,700

parts of that competition we actually

2348
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:46,710
parts of that competition we actually
 

2349
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:49,130
parts of that competition we actually
ended up doing a distributed version

2350
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:49,140
ended up doing a distributed version
 

2351
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,470
ended up doing a distributed version
over multiple machines a couple of

2352
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:51,480
over multiple machines a couple of
 

2353
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,910
over multiple machines a couple of
months later and ended up at the top of

2354
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:52,920
months later and ended up at the top of
 

2355
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,970
months later and ended up at the top of
the leaderboard we had 18 minutes in it

2356
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:55,980
the leaderboard we had 18 minutes in it
 

2357
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,640
the leaderboard we had 18 minutes in it
yeah and it was and people have just

2358
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:58,650
yeah and it was and people have just
 

2359
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,890
yeah and it was and people have just
kept on blasting through again and again

2360
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:00,900
kept on blasting through again and again
 

2361
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,789
kept on blasting through again and again
since then so so what's your view on

2362
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:03,799
since then so so what's your view on
 

2363
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:07,220
since then so so what's your view on
multi-gpu or multiple machine training

2364
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,230
multi-gpu or multiple machine training
 

2365
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:11,299
multi-gpu or multiple machine training
in general as as a way to speed code up

2366
00:52:11,299 --> 00:52:11,309
in general as as a way to speed code up
 

2367
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:13,579
in general as as a way to speed code up
I think it's largely a waste of time

2368
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:13,589
I think it's largely a waste of time
 

2369
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,739
I think it's largely a waste of time
both multi-gpu on a single machine and

2370
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:15,749
both multi-gpu on a single machine and
 

2371
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:17,839
both multi-gpu on a single machine and
yeah particularly multi machines because

2372
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:17,849
yeah particularly multi machines because
 

2373
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:24,170
yeah particularly multi machines because
it's just clunky motogp use is less

2374
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:24,180
it's just clunky motogp use is less
 

2375
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,700
it's just clunky motogp use is less
clunky than it used to be but to me

2376
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:25,710
clunky than it used to be but to me
 

2377
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,069
clunky than it used to be but to me
anything that slows down your iteration

2378
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
anything that slows down your iteration
 

2379
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,150
anything that slows down your iteration
speed is a waste of time so you could

2380
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,160
speed is a waste of time so you could
 

2381
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,289
speed is a waste of time so you could
maybe do your very last you know

2382
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:35,299
maybe do your very last you know
 

2383
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:38,089
maybe do your very last you know
perfecting of the model on Motty GPUs if

2384
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:38,099
perfecting of the model on Motty GPUs if
 

2385
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:42,620
perfecting of the model on Motty GPUs if
you need to that so for example I think

2386
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:42,630
you need to that so for example I think
 

2387
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:45,140
you need to that so for example I think
doing stuff on imagenet is generally a

2388
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:45,150
doing stuff on imagenet is generally a
 

2389
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,420
doing stuff on imagenet is generally a
waste of time why test things on 1.3

2390
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:47,430
waste of time why test things on 1.3
 

2391
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,729
waste of time why test things on 1.3
million images most of us don't use 1.3

2392
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:49,739
million images most of us don't use 1.3
 

2393
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:51,890
million images most of us don't use 1.3
million images and we've also done

2394
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:51,900
million images and we've also done
 

2395
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,440
million images and we've also done
research that shows that doing things on

2396
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,450
research that shows that doing things on
 

2397
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,930
research that shows that doing things on
a smaller subset of images gives you the

2398
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:56,940
a smaller subset of images gives you the
 

2399
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,599
a smaller subset of images gives you the
same relative answers anyway so from a

2400
00:52:59,599 --> 00:52:59,609
same relative answers anyway so from a
 

2401
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,700
same relative answers anyway so from a
research point of view why waste that

2402
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:01,710
research point of view why waste that
 

2403
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,559
research point of view why waste that
time so actually I released a couple of

2404
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:03,569
time so actually I released a couple of
 

2405
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:04,670
time so actually I released a couple of
new data sets

2406
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:04,680
new data sets
 

2407
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,960
new data sets
recently one is called imaginet the

2408
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:08,970
recently one is called imaginet the
 

2409
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,049
recently one is called imaginet the
French image net which is a small subset

2410
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:12,059
French image net which is a small subset
 

2411
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,670
French image net which is a small subset
of image net which is designed to be

2412
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
of image net which is designed to be
 

2413
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,519
of image net which is designed to be
easy to classify I would highly spell

2414
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:16,529
easy to classify I would highly spell
 

2415
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:18,650
easy to classify I would highly spell
imaginer it's got an extra T and e at

2416
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:18,660
imaginer it's got an extra T and e at
 

2417
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,779
imaginer it's got an extra T and e at
the end because it's very French am i

2418
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:20,789
the end because it's very French am i
 

2419
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:22,819
the end because it's very French am i
okay yeah I'm okay and then another one

2420
00:53:22,819 --> 00:53:22,829
okay yeah I'm okay and then another one
 

2421
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:26,109
okay yeah I'm okay and then another one
called image Wharf which is a subset of

2422
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:26,119
called image Wharf which is a subset of
 

2423
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,609
called image Wharf which is a subset of
the image net that only contains dog

2424
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:28,619
the image net that only contains dog
 

2425
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:30,150
the image net that only contains dog
breeds

2426
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,160
breeds
 

2427
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,499
breeds
that's a hard one right that's a hard

2428
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:31,509
that's a hard one right that's a hard
 

2429
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,359
that's a hard one right that's a hard
one yeah and I've discovered that if you

2430
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:33,369
one yeah and I've discovered that if you
 

2431
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:35,160
one yeah and I've discovered that if you
just look at these two subsets you can

2432
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:35,170
just look at these two subsets you can
 

2433
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,160
just look at these two subsets you can
train things on a single GPU in ten

2434
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,170
train things on a single GPU in ten
 

2435
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:41,190
train things on a single GPU in ten
minutes and the results you get directly

2436
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:41,200
minutes and the results you get directly
 

2437
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,799
minutes and the results you get directly
transferable to imagenet nearly all the

2438
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:43,809
transferable to imagenet nearly all the
 

2439
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:45,569
transferable to imagenet nearly all the
time and so now I'm starting to see some

2440
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:45,579
time and so now I'm starting to see some
 

2441
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:48,630
time and so now I'm starting to see some
researchers start to use these holidays

2442
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,640
researchers start to use these holidays
 

2443
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,970
researchers start to use these holidays
that's so deeply love the way you think

2444
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:50,980
that's so deeply love the way you think
 

2445
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,150
that's so deeply love the way you think
because I think you might have written a

2446
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,160
because I think you might have written a
 

2447
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,259
because I think you might have written a
blog post saying that sort of going

2448
00:53:58,259 --> 00:53:58,269
blog post saying that sort of going
 

2449
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:01,769
blog post saying that sort of going
these big data sets is encouraging

2450
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:01,779
these big data sets is encouraging
 

2451
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:03,539
these big data sets is encouraging
people to not think creatively

2452
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:03,549
people to not think creatively
 

2453
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:07,069
people to not think creatively
absolutely so you're - it's sort of

2454
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:07,079
absolutely so you're - it's sort of
 

2455
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,120
absolutely so you're - it's sort of
constrained you to Train on large

2456
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,130
constrained you to Train on large
 

2457
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:10,529
constrained you to Train on large
resources and because you have these

2458
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:10,539
resources and because you have these
 

2459
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,720
resources and because you have these
resources you think more research will

2460
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:12,730
resources you think more research will
 

2461
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:15,210
resources you think more research will
be bit better and then you start like

2462
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:15,220
be bit better and then you start like
 

2463
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,460
be bit better and then you start like
for some somehow you kill the creativity

2464
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:17,470
for some somehow you kill the creativity
 

2465
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,890
for some somehow you kill the creativity
yeah and even worse than that Lex I keep

2466
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:19,900
yeah and even worse than that Lex I keep
 

2467
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,720
yeah and even worse than that Lex I keep
hearing from people who say I decided

2468
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:21,730
hearing from people who say I decided
 

2469
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,789
hearing from people who say I decided
not to get into deep learning because I

2470
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:23,799
not to get into deep learning because I
 

2471
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:25,829
not to get into deep learning because I
don't believe it's accessible to people

2472
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:25,839
don't believe it's accessible to people
 

2473
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,650
don't believe it's accessible to people
outside of Google to do useful work so

2474
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:28,660
outside of Google to do useful work so
 

2475
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,720
outside of Google to do useful work so
like I see a lot of people make an

2476
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:30,730
like I see a lot of people make an
 

2477
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:33,650
like I see a lot of people make an
explicit decision to not learn this

2478
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:33,660
explicit decision to not learn this
 

2479
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,480
explicit decision to not learn this
incredibly valuable tool because they've

2480
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:36,490
incredibly valuable tool because they've
 

2481
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,150
incredibly valuable tool because they've
they've drunk the Google kool-aid which

2482
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:39,160
they've drunk the Google kool-aid which
 

2483
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,799
they've drunk the Google kool-aid which
is that only Google's big enough and

2484
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:40,809
is that only Google's big enough and
 

2485
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:42,960
is that only Google's big enough and
smart enough to do it and I just find

2486
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:42,970
smart enough to do it and I just find
 

2487
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,789
smart enough to do it and I just find
that so disappointing and it's so wrong

2488
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:44,799
that so disappointing and it's so wrong
 

2489
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,819
that so disappointing and it's so wrong
and I think all the major breakthroughs

2490
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:47,829
and I think all the major breakthroughs
 

2491
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:51,420
and I think all the major breakthroughs
in AI in the next twenty years will be

2492
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:51,430
in AI in the next twenty years will be
 

2493
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,279
in AI in the next twenty years will be
doable on a single GPU

2494
00:54:53,279 --> 00:54:53,289
doable on a single GPU
 

2495
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,589
doable on a single GPU
like I would say my sense is all the big

2496
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
like I would say my sense is all the big
 

2497
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,319
like I would say my sense is all the big
sort of well let's put it this way none

2498
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:58,329
sort of well let's put it this way none
 

2499
00:54:58,329 --> 00:54:59,849
sort of well let's put it this way none
of the big breakthroughs of the last 20

2500
00:54:59,849 --> 00:54:59,859
of the big breakthroughs of the last 20
 

2501
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:01,410
of the big breakthroughs of the last 20
years or acquired multiple GPUs

2502
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:01,420
years or acquired multiple GPUs
 

2503
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:05,609
years or acquired multiple GPUs
so like fetch norm well you drop out

2504
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:05,619
so like fetch norm well you drop out
 

2505
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:08,999
so like fetch norm well you drop out
did you demonstrate to everyone of them

2506
00:55:08,999 --> 00:55:09,009
did you demonstrate to everyone of them
 

2507
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:12,180
did you demonstrate to everyone of them
yeah this is five multiple GPUs against

2508
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:12,190
yeah this is five multiple GPUs against
 

2509
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,999
yeah this is five multiple GPUs against
the original Gans didn't require

2510
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:15,009
the original Gans didn't require
 

2511
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:16,799
the original Gans didn't require
multiple ups well and and we've actually

2512
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:16,809
multiple ups well and and we've actually
 

2513
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:18,720
multiple ups well and and we've actually
recently shown that you don't even need

2514
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:18,730
recently shown that you don't even need
 

2515
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:22,289
recently shown that you don't even need
gains so we've developed gained level

2516
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:22,299
gains so we've developed gained level
 

2517
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:24,900
gains so we've developed gained level
outcomes without knitting Gans and we

2518
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:24,910
outcomes without knitting Gans and we
 

2519
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:27,029
outcomes without knitting Gans and we
can now do it with again by using

2520
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:27,039
can now do it with again by using
 

2521
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:28,740
can now do it with again by using
transfer learning we can do it in a

2522
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:28,750
transfer learning we can do it in a
 

2523
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,960
transfer learning we can do it in a
couple of hours on a single generator

2524
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:30,970
couple of hours on a single generator
 

2525
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,789
couple of hours on a single generator
might like without the other serial port

2526
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:32,799
might like without the other serial port
 

2527
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:33,390
might like without the other serial port
yeah

2528
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:33,400
yeah
 

2529
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,059
yeah
so we've found loss functions that work

2530
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:36,069
so we've found loss functions that work
 

2531
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:38,130
so we've found loss functions that work
super well without the adversarial part

2532
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:38,140
super well without the adversarial part
 

2533
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,710
super well without the adversarial part
and then one of our students guy called

2534
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:40,720
and then one of our students guy called
 

2535
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,940
and then one of our students guy called

to colorize old black-and-white movies

2540
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:48,290
to colorize old black-and-white movies
 

2541
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:50,859
to colorize old black-and-white movies
you can do it on a single GPU color as a

2542
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:50,869
you can do it on a single GPU color as a
 

2543
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:53,050
you can do it on a single GPU color as a
whole movie in a couple of hours and one

2544
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:53,060
whole movie in a couple of hours and one
 

2545
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,540

of the things that Jason and I did

2546
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:55,550
of the things that Jason and I did
 

2547
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,930
of the things that Jason and I did
together was we figured out how to add a

2548
00:55:58,930 --> 00:55:58,940
together was we figured out how to add a
 

2549
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,690
together was we figured out how to add a
little bit of n at the very end which it

2550
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:01,700
little bit of n at the very end which it
 

2551
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,490
little bit of n at the very end which it
turns out for colorization makes it just

2552
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:03,500
turns out for colorization makes it just
 

2553
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,640
turns out for colorization makes it just
a bit brighter and nicer and then Jason

2554
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:06,650
a bit brighter and nicer and then Jason
 

2555
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,380
a bit brighter and nicer and then Jason
did masses of experiments to figure out

2556
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:08,390
did masses of experiments to figure out
 

2557
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:10,359
did masses of experiments to figure out
exactly how much to do but it's still

2558
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:10,369
exactly how much to do but it's still
 

2559
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:13,329
exactly how much to do but it's still
all done on his home machine on a single

GPU in his lounge room and like if you

2562
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:15,710
GPU in his lounge room and like if you
 

2563
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:18,670
GPU in his lounge room and like if you
think about like colorizing Hollywood

2564
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:18,680
think about like colorizing Hollywood
 

2565
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,620
think about like colorizing Hollywood
movies that sounds like something a huge

2566
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:20,630

the world's best results on this there's

2570
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:25,609
the world's best results on this there's
 

2571
00:56:25,609 --> 00:56:27,310
the world's best results on this there's
this problem of microphones we're just

2572
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:27,320
this problem of microphones we're just
 

2573
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,230
this problem of microphones we're just
talking two microphones now yeah it's

2574
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:29,240
talking two microphones now yeah it's
 

2575
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,030
talking two microphones now yeah it's
such a pain in the ass to have these

2576
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:31,040
such a pain in the ass to have these
 

2577
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,730
such a pain in the ass to have these
microphones to get good quality audio

2578
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:33,740
microphones to get good quality audio
 

2579
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,099
microphones to get good quality audio
and I tried to see if it's possible to

2580
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:36,109
and I tried to see if it's possible to
 

2581
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:38,130
and I tried to see if it's possible to
plop down a bunch of cheap sensors and

2582
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:38,140
plop down a bunch of cheap sensors and
 

2583
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,510
plop down a bunch of cheap sensors and
reconstruct higher quality audio from

2584
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:40,520
reconstruct higher quality audio from
 

2585
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,579
reconstruct higher quality audio from
multiple sources because right now I

2586
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:42,589
multiple sources because right now I
 

2587
00:56:42,589 --> 00:56:45,880
multiple sources because right now I
haven't seen work from okay we can say

2588
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:45,890
haven't seen work from okay we can say
 

2589
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,730
haven't seen work from okay we can say
inexpensive mics automatically combining

the combined audio right people haven't

2594
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:52,880
the combined audio right people haven't
 

2595
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,190
the combined audio right people haven't
done that and that feels like a learning

2596
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:54,200
done that and that feels like a learning
 

2597
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,349
done that and that feels like a learning
problem alright so hopefully somebody

2598
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:56,359
problem alright so hopefully somebody
 

2599
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:57,910
problem alright so hopefully somebody
can well I mean it's it's eminently

2600
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:57,920
can well I mean it's it's eminently
 

2601
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,099
can well I mean it's it's eminently
doable and it should have been done by

2602
00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:00,109
doable and it should have been done by
 

2603
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:00,640
doable and it should have been done by
now

2604
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:00,650
now
 

2605
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,109
now
I feel I felt the same way about

2606
00:57:02,109 --> 00:57:02,119
I feel I felt the same way about
 

2607
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,300
I feel I felt the same way about
computational photography four years ago

2608
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:04,310
computational photography four years ago
 

2609
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:04,960
computational photography four years ago
that's right

2610
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:04,970
that's right
 

2611
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:07,680
that's right
why are we investing in big lenses when

2612
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:07,690
why are we investing in big lenses when
 

2613
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,599
why are we investing in big lenses when
three cheap lenses plus actually a

2614
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:10,609
three cheap lenses plus actually a
 

2615
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:13,960
three cheap lenses plus actually a
little bit of intentional movement so

2616
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:13,970
little bit of intentional movement so
 

2617
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,640
little bit of intentional movement so
like Holden you don't like take a few

2618
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:15,650
like Holden you don't like take a few
 

2619
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:18,400
like Holden you don't like take a few
frames gives you enough information to

00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:18,410
frames gives you enough information to
 

2621
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:20,710
frames gives you enough information to
get excellent sub pixel resolution which

2622
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:20,720
get excellent sub pixel resolution which
 

2623

00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:24,079
you would know exactly what you meant to
 

2627
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,220
you would know exactly what you meant to
be looking at we can totally do the same

2628
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:27,230
be looking at we can totally do the same
 

2629
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:28,630
be looking at we can totally do the same
thing with audio I think there's a

2630
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:28,640
thing with audio I think there's a
 

2631
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,280
thing with audio I think there's a
madness that it hasn't been done yet I

2632
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:30,290
madness that it hasn't been done yet I
 

2633

madness that it hasn't been done yet I
live in progress on the photographer tog

Rafik um yeah the dog photography is

2636
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:34,430
Rafik um yeah the dog photography is
 

2637
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:39,430
Rafik um yeah the dog photography is
basically standard now so the the Google

2638
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:39,440
basically standard now so the the Google
 

2639
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,380
basically standard now so the the Google
picks all night light I don't know if

2640
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:41,390
picks all night light I don't know if
 

2641
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:42,640
picks all night light I don't know if
you've ever tried it but it's it's

2642
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:42,650
you've ever tried it but it's it's
 

2643
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,740
you've ever tried it but it's it's
astonishing you take a picture in almost

2644
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:44,750
astonishing you take a picture in almost
 

2645
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,380
astonishing you take a picture in almost
pitch black and you get back a very high

2646
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,390
pitch black and you get back a very high
 

2647
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,900
pitch black and you get back a very high
quality image and it's not because of

2648
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:49,910
quality image and it's not because of
 

2649
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,690
quality image and it's not because of
the lens same stuff is like adding the

2650
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:52,700
the lens same stuff is like adding the
 

2651
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,830
the lens same stuff is like adding the
bouquet to the you know the

2652
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:54,840
bouquet to the you know the
 

2653
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,150
bouquet to the you know the
background wearing have done

2654
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:56,160
background wearing have done
 

2655
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,040
background wearing have done
computationally this depicts over here

yeah basically the everybody now is

2658
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,010
yeah basically the everybody now is
 

2659
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:05,120
yeah basically the everybody now is
doing most of the fanciest stuff on

2660
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:05,130
doing most of the fanciest stuff on
 

2661
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,410
doing most of the fanciest stuff on
their phones with computational

photography and also increasingly people

2664
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:08,340
photography and also increasingly people
 

2665
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,790
photography and also increasingly people
are putting more than one lens on the

2666
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:10,800
are putting more than one lens on the
 

2667
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,130
are putting more than one lens on the
back of the camera so the same will

2668
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:13,140
back of the camera so the same will
 

2669
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,780
back of the camera so the same will
happen for audio for sure and there's

2670
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:14,790
happen for audio for sure and there's
 

2671
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,670
happen for audio for sure and there's
applications in the audio side if you

2672
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:16,680
applications in the audio side if you
 

2673
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,000
applications in the audio side if you
look at an Alexa type device most people

2674
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,010
look at an Alexa type device most people
 

2675
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,590
look at an Alexa type device most people
have seen especially I worked at Google

2676
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:21,600
have seen especially I worked at Google
 

2677
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,440
have seen especially I worked at Google
before when you look at noise background

2678
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:24,450
before when you look at noise background
 

2679
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:27,170
before when you look at noise background
removal you don't think of multiple

2680
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:27,180

sources of audio you don't play with

2682
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:30,450

2683
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,880

that as much as I would hope people I

2684
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:31,890
that as much as I would hope people I
 

2685
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,410
that as much as I would hope people I
mean you can still do it even with one

2686
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:33,420
mean you can still do it even with one
 

2687
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,240
mean you can still do it even with one
like again it's not not much works being

2688
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:35,250
like again it's not not much works being
 

2689
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,410
like again it's not not much works being
done in this area so we're actually

2690
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:36,420
done in this area so we're actually
 

2691
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,940
done in this area so we're actually
going to be releasing an audio library

2692
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:37,950
going to be releasing an audio library
 

2693
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,160
going to be releasing an audio library
soon which hopefully will encourage

2694
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:40,170
soon which hopefully will encourage
 

2695
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:41,720
soon which hopefully will encourage
development of this because it's so

2696
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:41,730
development of this because it's so
 

2697
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:44,720
development of this because it's so
underused the basic approach we used for

2705
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:54,590

work for audio no-one's done it yet but

2706
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:54,600
work for audio no-one's done it yet but
 

2707
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,320
work for audio no-one's done it yet but
it would be a couple of months work okay

2708
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:57,330
it would be a couple of months work okay
 

2709
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,570
it would be a couple of months work okay

could publish that
 

2763
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,910
could publish that
without an explanation and then in the

without an explanation and then in the
 

2765
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,920
without an explanation and then in the
next 60 years people can try to work out

we don't allow this in the deep learning

2770

we don't allow this in the deep learning
 

2771
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,380
we don't allow this in the deep learning
world so it's it's literally impossible

01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:18,390
world so it's it's literally impossible
 

2773

it should have I don't know why
 

2781
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:28,880
it should have I don't know why
and so the reviewers were like we can't

2782
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:28,890
and so the reviewers were like we can't
 

2783
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:29,870
and so the reviewers were like we can't
publish that because you don't know why

2784
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:29,880
publish that because you don't know why
 

2785
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,059
publish that because you don't know why
so anyway that's important to pause on

2786
01:00:32,059 --> 01:00:32,069
so anyway that's important to pause on
 

2787
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:34,430
so anyway that's important to pause on
because there's so many discoveries that

2788
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:34,440
because there's so many discoveries that
 

2789
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,440
because there's so many discoveries that
would need to start like that every

01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:36,450
would need to start like that every
 

2791
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:38,270
would need to start like that every
every other scientific field I know of

01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,089
every other scientific field I know of
works is that way I don't know why ours

01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:47,880
unexplained experimental results but
 

2799
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,440
unexplained experimental results but
there it is so it wasn't published

2800
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:50,450
there it is so it wasn't published
 

2801
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:55,039
there it is so it wasn't published
having said that I read a lot more

2802
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:55,049
having said that I read a lot more
 

2803
01:00:55,049 --> 01:00:56,690
having said that I read a lot more
unpublished papers and published papers

2804
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:56,700
unpublished papers and published papers
 

2805
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,890
unpublished papers and published papers
because that's where you find the

2806
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:57,900
because that's where you find the
 

2807
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,980
because that's where you find the
interesting insights so I absolutely

01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:00,990
interesting insights so I absolutely
 

2809
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,640
interesting insights so I absolutely
read this paper and I was just like this

2810
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:04,650
read this paper and I was just like this
 

2811
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:08,720
read this paper and I was just like this
is astonishingly mind-blowing and weird

2812
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:08,730
is astonishingly mind-blowing and weird
 

2813
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:11,089
is astonishingly mind-blowing and weird
and awesome and like why isn't everybody

2814
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:11,099
and awesome and like why isn't everybody
 

2815
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:12,950
and awesome and like why isn't everybody
only talking about this because like if

2816
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:12,960
only talking about this because like if
 

2817
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,240
only talking about this because like if
you can train these things ten times

2818
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:14,250
you can train these things ten times
 

2819
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,549
you can train these things ten times
faster they also generalized better

2820
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:16,559
faster they also generalized better
 

2821
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,530
faster they also generalized better
because you're you're doing less epochs

2822
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:18,540
because you're you're doing less epochs
 

2823
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,940
because you're you're doing less epochs
which means you look at the data less

2824
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:19,950
which means you look at the data less
 

2825
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,760
which means you look at the data less
you get better accuracy so I've been

2826
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:22,770
you get better accuracy so I've been
 

2827
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:25,299
you get better accuracy so I've been
kind of studying that ever since and

2828
01:01:25,299 --> 01:01:25,309
kind of studying that ever since and
 

2829
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:28,220
kind of studying that ever since and
eventually Leslie kind of figured out a

2830
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:28,230
eventually Leslie kind of figured out a
 

2831
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,190
eventually Leslie kind of figured out a
lot of how to get it's done and we added

2832
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
lot of how to get it's done and we added
 

2833
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,530
lot of how to get it's done and we added
minor tweaks and a big part of the trick

2834
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:33,540
minor tweaks and a big part of the trick
 

2835
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,720
minor tweaks and a big part of the trick
is starting at a very low learning rate

2836
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:35,730
is starting at a very low learning rate
 

2837
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,630
is starting at a very low learning rate
very gradually increasing it so as

2838
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:38,640
very gradually increasing it so as
 

2839
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,950
very gradually increasing it so as
you're training your model you would

2840
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:39,960
you're training your model you would
 

2841
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,839
you're training your model you would
take very small steps at the start and

2842
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:41,849
take very small steps at the start and
 

2843
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:43,250
take very small steps at the start and
it gradually makes them bigger and

2844
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:43,260
it gradually makes them bigger and
 

2845
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,260
it gradually makes them bigger and
bigger and tall eventually you're taking

2846
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:45,270
bigger and tall eventually you're taking
 

2847
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,059
bigger and tall eventually you're taking
much bigger steps than anybody thought

2848
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:47,069
much bigger steps than anybody thought
 

2849
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:49,560
much bigger steps than anybody thought
as possible

2850
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:49,570
as possible
 

2851
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:50,790
as possible
a few other little tricks to make it

2852
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:50,800
a few other little tricks to make it
 

2853
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,550
a few other little tricks to make it
work but ever ever basically we can

2854
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:53,560
work but ever ever basically we can
 

2855
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,470
work but ever ever basically we can
reliably get super convergence and so

2856
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:55,480
reliably get super convergence and so
 

2857
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,060
reliably get super convergence and so
for the dawn bench thing we were using

2858
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,070
for the dawn bench thing we were using
 

2859
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:59,430
for the dawn bench thing we were using
just much higher learning rates than

2860
01:01:59,430 --> 01:01:59,440
just much higher learning rates than
 

2861
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,490
just much higher learning rates than
people expected to work what do you

2862
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:02,500
people expected to work what do you
 

2863
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,560
people expected to work what do you
think the future of I mean makes so much

2864
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:04,570
think the future of I mean makes so much
 

2865
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,270
think the future of I mean makes so much
sense for that to be a critical hyper

2866
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:06,280
sense for that to be a critical hyper
 

2867
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,100
sense for that to be a critical hyper
parameter learning rate that you very

2868
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:08,110
parameter learning rate that you very
 

2869
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,080
parameter learning rate that you very
what do you think the future of learning

2870
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:10,090
what do you think the future of learning
 

2871
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:14,070
what do you think the future of learning
rate magic looks like well there's been

2872
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:14,080
rate magic looks like well there's been
 

2873
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,540
rate magic looks like well there's been
a lot of great work in the last 12

2874
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:15,550
a lot of great work in the last 12
 

2875
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:17,880
a lot of great work in the last 12
months in this area it's and people are

2876
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:17,890
months in this area it's and people are
 

2877
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:20,040
months in this area it's and people are
increasingly realizing that up to might

2878
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,050
increasingly realizing that up to might
 

2879
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,600
increasingly realizing that up to might
like we just have no idea really how

2880
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:21,610
like we just have no idea really how
 

2881
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:24,810
like we just have no idea really how
optimizers work and the combination of

2882
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:24,820
optimizers work and the combination of
 

2883
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,550
optimizers work and the combination of
weight decay which is how we regularize

2884
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:26,560
weight decay which is how we regularize
 

2885
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,770
weight decay which is how we regularize
optimizers and the learning rate and

2886
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:28,780
optimizers and the learning rate and
 

2887
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,200
optimizers and the learning rate and
then other things like the epsilon we

2888
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:31,210
then other things like the epsilon we
 

2889
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,170
then other things like the epsilon we
use in in the atom optimizer they all

2890
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:33,180
use in in the atom optimizer they all
 

2891
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,320
use in in the atom optimizer they all
work together in weird ways and

2892
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:36,330
work together in weird ways and
 

2893
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,820
work together in weird ways and
different parts of the model this is

2894
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:38,830
different parts of the model this is
 

2895
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:39,990
different parts of the model this is
another thing we've done a lot of work

2896
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:40,000
another thing we've done a lot of work
 

2897
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,420
another thing we've done a lot of work
on is research into how different parts

2898
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:42,430
on is research into how different parts
 

2899
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,280
on is research into how different parts
of the model should be trained at

2900
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:44,290
of the model should be trained at
 

2901
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:46,890
of the model should be trained at
different rates in different ways so we

2902
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:46,900
different rates in different ways so we
 

2903
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,240
different rates in different ways so we
do something we call discriminative

2904
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:48,250
do something we call discriminative
 

2905
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,010
do something we call discriminative
learning rates which is really important

2906
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:50,020
learning rates which is really important
 

2907
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,340
learning rates which is really important
particularly for transfer learning so

2908
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:53,350
particularly for transfer learning so
 

2909
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:54,930
particularly for transfer learning so
really I think in the last 12 months a

2910
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:54,940
really I think in the last 12 months a
 

2911
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,070
really I think in the last 12 months a
lot of people have realized that this

2912
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:56,080
lot of people have realized that this
 

2913
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,690
lot of people have realized that this
all this stuff is important there's been

2914
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:57,700
all this stuff is important there's been
 

2915
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,360
all this stuff is important there's been
a lot of great work coming out and we're

2916
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:00,370
a lot of great work coming out and we're
 

2917
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:04,010
a lot of great work coming out and we're
starting to see algorithms here which

2918
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:04,020
starting to see algorithms here which
 

2919
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:07,080
starting to see algorithms here which
have very very few dials if any that you

2920
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,090
have very very few dials if any that you
 

2921
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,850
have very very few dials if any that you
have to touch selector I think what's

2922
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:08,860
have to touch selector I think what's
 

2923
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:09,900
have to touch selector I think what's
going to happen is the idea of a

2924
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:09,910
going to happen is the idea of a
 

2925
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,790
going to happen is the idea of a
learning rate well it almost already has

2926
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:11,800
learning rate well it almost already has
 

2927
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,070
learning rate well it almost already has
disappeared in the latest research and

2928
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:14,080
disappeared in the latest research and
 

2929
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,640
disappeared in the latest research and
instead it's just like you know we we

2930
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:17,650
instead it's just like you know we we
 

2931
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:21,870
instead it's just like you know we we
know enough about how to interpret the

2932
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:21,880
know enough about how to interpret the
 

2933
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,520
know enough about how to interpret the
gradients and the change of gradients we

2934
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:23,530
gradients and the change of gradients we
 

2935
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,140
gradients and the change of gradients we
see to know how to set every parameter

2936
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,150
see to know how to set every parameter
 

2937
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,240
see to know how to set every parameter
you can await it so you see the future

2938
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:27,250
you can await it so you see the future
 

2939
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:32,130
you can await it so you see the future
of of deep learning where really where's

2940
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:32,140
of of deep learning where really where's
 

2941
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,740
of of deep learning where really where's
the input of a human expert needed well

2942
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:34,750
the input of a human expert needed well
 

2943
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,390
the input of a human expert needed well
hopefully the input of the human expert

2944
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:36,400
hopefully the input of the human expert
 

2945
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,970
hopefully the input of the human expert
will be almost entirely unneeded from

2946
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:38,980
will be almost entirely unneeded from
 

2947
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,730
will be almost entirely unneeded from
the deep learning point of view so again

2948
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:41,740
the deep learning point of view so again
 

2949
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:43,980
the deep learning point of view so again
like Google's approach to this is to try

2950
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:43,990
like Google's approach to this is to try
 

2951
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:45,900
like Google's approach to this is to try
and use thousands of times more compute

2952
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:45,910
and use thousands of times more compute
 

2953
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:48,690
and use thousands of times more compute
to run lots and lots of models at the

2954
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:48,700
to run lots and lots of models at the
 

2955
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,190
to run lots and lots of models at the
same time and hopefully one of them is

2956
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:50,200
same time and hopefully one of them is
 

2957
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,350
same time and hopefully one of them is
good at or male CONUS yeah I don't know

2958
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:52,360
good at or male CONUS yeah I don't know
 

2959
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,940
good at or male CONUS yeah I don't know
kind of stuff which i think is insane

2960
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:55,950
kind of stuff which i think is insane
 

2961
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,980
kind of stuff which i think is insane
when you better understand the mechanics

2962
01:03:58,980 --> 01:03:58,990
when you better understand the mechanics
 

2963
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:02,400
when you better understand the mechanics
of how models learn you don't have to

2964
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:02,410
of how models learn you don't have to
 

2965
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:02,790
of how models learn you don't have to
try

2966
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:02,800
try
 

2967
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,230
try
thousand different models to find which

2968
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:04,240
thousand different models to find which
 

2969
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,880
thousand different models to find which
one happens to work the best you can

2970
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:05,890
one happens to work the best you can
 

2971
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,160
one happens to work the best you can
just jump straight to the best one which

2972
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:08,170
just jump straight to the best one which
 

2973
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:09,930
just jump straight to the best one which
means that it's more accessible in terms

2974
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:09,940
means that it's more accessible in terms
 

2975
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,620
means that it's more accessible in terms
of compute cheaper and also with less

2976
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:13,630
of compute cheaper and also with less
 

2977
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,300
of compute cheaper and also with less
hyper parameters to set it means you

2978
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:15,310
hyper parameters to set it means you
 

2979
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,860
hyper parameters to set it means you
don't need deep learning experts to

2980
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:16,870
don't need deep learning experts to
 

2981
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,660
don't need deep learning experts to
train your deep learning model for you

2982
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:18,670
train your deep learning model for you
 

2983
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:21,210
train your deep learning model for you
which means that domain experts can do

2984
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:21,220
which means that domain experts can do
 

2985
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,040
which means that domain experts can do
more of the work which means that now

2986
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,050
more of the work which means that now
 

2987
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:25,650
more of the work which means that now
you can focus the human time on the kind

2988
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:25,660
you can focus the human time on the kind
 

2989
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,860
you can focus the human time on the kind
of interpretation data gathering

2990
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:27,870
of interpretation data gathering
 

2991
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:30,150
of interpretation data gathering
identifying what all errors and stuff

2992
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:30,160
identifying what all errors and stuff
 

2993
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,240
identifying what all errors and stuff
like that yeah the data side how often

2994
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:33,250
like that yeah the data side how often
 

2995
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,800
like that yeah the data side how often
do you work with data these days in

2996
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:34,810
do you work with data these days in
 

2997
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:37,920
do you work with data these days in
terms of the cleaning looking at like

2998
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:37,930
terms of the cleaning looking at like
 

2999
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:41,190
terms of the cleaning looking at like
Darwin looked at different species while

3000
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:41,200
Darwin looked at different species while
 

3001
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,970
Darwin looked at different species while
traveling about do you look at data I

3002
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:44,980
traveling about do you look at data I
 

3003
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,360
traveling about do you look at data I
have you in your roots and cargo always

3004
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:48,370
have you in your roots and cargo always
 

3005
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:50,580
have you in your roots and cargo always
yeah good data I mean it's a key part of

3006
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:50,590
yeah good data I mean it's a key part of
 

3007
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:52,530
yeah good data I mean it's a key part of
our course it's like before we train a

3008
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:52,540
our course it's like before we train a
 

3009
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,150
our course it's like before we train a
model in the course we see how to look

3010
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:54,160
model in the course we see how to look
 

3011
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,010
model in the course we see how to look
at the data and then after the first

3012
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:56,020
at the data and then after the first
 

3013
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,420
at the data and then after the first
thing we do after we train our first

3014
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:57,430
thing we do after we train our first
 

3015
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:59,370
thing we do after we train our first
model which we fine-tune an image net

3016
01:04:59,370 --> 01:04:59,380
model which we fine-tune an image net
 

3017
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,810
model which we fine-tune an image net
model for five minutes and then the

3018
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:00,820
model for five minutes and then the
 

3019
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,430
model for five minutes and then the
thing we immediately do after that is we

3020
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:02,440
thing we immediately do after that is we
 

3021
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,010
thing we immediately do after that is we
learn how to analyze the results of the

3022
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:05,020
learn how to analyze the results of the
 

3023
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,410
learn how to analyze the results of the
model by looking at examples of

3024
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:07,420
model by looking at examples of
 

3025
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,360
model by looking at examples of
misclassified images and looking at a

3026
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:09,370
misclassified images and looking at a
 

3027
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:12,570
misclassified images and looking at a
classification matrix and then doing

3028
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:12,580
classification matrix and then doing
 

3029
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,600
classification matrix and then doing
like research on Google to learn about

3030
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:15,610
like research on Google to learn about
 

3031
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,800
like research on Google to learn about
the kinds of things that it's

3032
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:16,810
the kinds of things that it's
 

3033
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,870
the kinds of things that it's
misclassifying so to me one of the three

3034
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:18,880
misclassifying so to me one of the three
 

3035
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,400
misclassifying so to me one of the three
cool things about machine learning

3036
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:20,410
cool things about machine learning
 

3037
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:22,410
cool things about machine learning
models in general is that you can

3038
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:22,420
models in general is that you can
 

3039
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,390
models in general is that you can
interpret when you interpret them they

3040
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
interpret when you interpret them they
 

3041
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,680
interpret when you interpret them they
tell you about things like what are the

3042
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:25,690
tell you about things like what are the
 

3043
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:28,020
tell you about things like what are the
most important features which groups you

3044
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:28,030
most important features which groups you
 

3045
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,210
most important features which groups you
misclassifying and they help you become

3046
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:30,220
misclassifying and they help you become
 

3047
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,820
misclassifying and they help you become
a domain expert more quickly because you

3048
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:32,830
a domain expert more quickly because you
 

3049
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:35,130
a domain expert more quickly because you
can focus your time on the bits that the

3050
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:35,140
can focus your time on the bits that the
 

3051
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,790
can focus your time on the bits that the
model is telling you it is important so

3052
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:38,800
model is telling you it is important so
 

3053
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,140
model is telling you it is important so
it lets you deal with things like data

3054
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:40,150
it lets you deal with things like data
 

3055
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,940
it lets you deal with things like data
leakage for example if it says all the

3056
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:41,950
leakage for example if it says all the
 

3057
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,670
leakage for example if it says all the
main feature I'm looking at is customer

3058
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:44,680
main feature I'm looking at is customer
 

3059
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,560
main feature I'm looking at is customer
ID you know and you're like oh customer

3060
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:46,570
ID you know and you're like oh customer
 

3061
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,480
ID you know and you're like oh customer
ID should be predictive and then you can

3062
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:48,490
ID should be predictive and then you can
 

3063
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,990
ID should be predictive and then you can
talk to the people that manage customer

3064
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:52,000
talk to the people that manage customer
 

3065
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,880
talk to the people that manage customer
IDs and they'll tell you like oh yes as

3066
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:53,890
IDs and they'll tell you like oh yes as
 

3067
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,880
IDs and they'll tell you like oh yes as
soon as a customer's application is

3068
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:56,890
soon as a customer's application is
 

3069
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,590
soon as a customer's application is
accepted we add a one on the end of

3070
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:58,600
accepted we add a one on the end of
 

3071
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,090
accepted we add a one on the end of
their customer arm or something you know

3072
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:00,100
their customer arm or something you know
 

3073
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,450
their customer arm or something you know
yeah so yeah model looking at data

3074
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:03,460
yeah so yeah model looking at data
 

3075
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,250
yeah so yeah model looking at data
particularly from the lens of which

3076
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:05,260
particularly from the lens of which
 

3077
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,630
particularly from the lens of which
parts of the date of the model says is

3078
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
parts of the date of the model says is
 

3079
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,720
parts of the date of the model says is
important is super important yeah and

3080
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:09,730
important is super important yeah and
 

3081
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,880
important is super important yeah and
using kind of using the model to almost

3082
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:11,890
using kind of using the model to almost
 

3083
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,010
using kind of using the model to almost
debug the data yeah you have learn more

3084
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:14,020
debug the data yeah you have learn more
 

3085
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:16,099
debug the data yeah you have learn more
about exactly

3086
01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:16,109
about exactly
 

3087
01:06:16,109 --> 01:06:18,749
about exactly
what are the different cloud options for

3088
01:06:18,749 --> 01:06:18,759
what are the different cloud options for
 

3089
01:06:18,759 --> 01:06:20,460
what are the different cloud options for
training y'all networks it's the last

question related to dawn bench well it's

3092
01:06:22,589 --> 01:06:22,599
question related to dawn bench well it's
 

3093
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:25,529
question related to dawn bench well it's
part of a lot of the work we do but from

3094
01:06:25,529 --> 01:06:25,539
part of a lot of the work we do but from
 

3095
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:27,329
part of a lot of the work we do but from
a perspective of performance I think

3096
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:27,339
a perspective of performance I think
 

3097
01:06:27,339 --> 01:06:29,069
a perspective of performance I think
you've written this in a blog post

there's AWS there's TPU from Google

3100
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:32,079
there's AWS there's TPU from Google
 

3101
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,200
there's AWS there's TPU from Google
what's your sense what the future holds

3102
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:34,210
what's your sense what the future holds
 

3103
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,329
what's your sense what the future holds
what would you recommend now right there

3104
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:36,339
what would you recommend now right there
 

3105
01:06:36,339 --> 01:06:39,829
what would you recommend now right there
was a so from a halfway point of view

3106
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:39,839
was a so from a halfway point of view
 

3107
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,900

Google's TP use and the best nvidia gpus

3108
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:42,910
Google's TP use and the best nvidia gpus
 

3109
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:46,680
Google's TP use and the best nvidia gpus
are similar I mean maybe the TP is like

3110
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:46,690
are similar I mean maybe the TP is like
 

3111
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:48,749
are similar I mean maybe the TP is like
30% faster but they're also much harder

3112
01:06:48,749 --> 01:06:48,759
30% faster but they're also much harder
 

3113
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:52,069
30% faster but they're also much harder
to program with there isn't a clear

01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:52,079
to program with there isn't a clear
 

3115
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,390

leader in terms of hardware right now

3116
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:54,400
leader in terms of hardware right now
 

3117
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,849

01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,290
was certainly the the strongest entrant
to come along and say let's not do it

3274
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:28,300
to come along and say let's not do it
 

3275
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,360
to come along and say let's not do it
that way let's just use normal Python

3276
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:31,370
that way let's just use normal Python
 

3277
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:32,860
that way let's just use normal Python
and everything you know about in Python

3278
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:32,870
and everything you know about in Python
 

3279
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:34,930
and everything you know about in Python
is just going to work and we'll figure

3280
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:34,940
is just going to work and we'll figure
 

3281
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,810
is just going to work and we'll figure
out how to make that run on the GPU as

3282
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:37,820
out how to make that run on the GPU as
 

3283
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:41,680
out how to make that run on the GPU as
in when and necessary that turned out to

3284
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:41,690
in when and necessary that turned out to
 

3285
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:45,370
in when and necessary that turned out to
be a huge a huge leap in terms of what

3286
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:45,380
be a huge a huge leap in terms of what
 

3287
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,080
be a huge a huge leap in terms of what
we could do with our research and what

3288
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:47,090
we could do with our research and what
 

3289
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:48,870
we could do with our research and what
we could weigh with our teaching and

3290
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:48,880
we could weigh with our teaching and
 

3291
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,700
we could weigh with our teaching and
because it was a limiting yeah I mean it

3292
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:51,710
because it was a limiting yeah I mean it
 

3293
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,230
because it was a limiting yeah I mean it
was critical for us for something like

3294
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:53,240
was critical for us for something like
 

3295
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,030
was critical for us for something like
dawn Bench to be able to rapidly try

3296
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:55,040
dawn Bench to be able to rapidly try
 

3297
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,160
dawn Bench to be able to rapidly try
things it's just so much harder to be a

things it's just so much harder to be a
 

3299
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,750
things it's just so much harder to be a
researcher and practitioner when you

3300
01:10:58,750 --> 01:10:58,760
researcher and practitioner when you
 

3301
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,700
researcher and practitioner when you
have to do everything up front and you

3302
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:00,710
have to do everything up front and you
 

3303
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:05,490
have to do everything up front and you
can inspect it problem with pay torch is

it's not at all accessible to newcomers
 

3307
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,720
it's not at all accessible to newcomers

not great for researchers because you're
 

3315
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,080
not great for researchers because you're

boilerplate and overhead rather than
 

3319
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:24,340

01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:24,350
thinking about your algorithm so we
 

3321
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:26,950

what they did was they tried to

3390
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:51,800
what they did was they tried to
 

3391
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,060
what they did was they tried to
replicate the bits that people were

01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,470
saying they like about a torch the is
kind of interactive computation but they

3396
01:12:59,470 --> 01:12:59,480
kind of interactive computation but they
 

3397
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,290
kind of interactive computation but they
didn't actually change their

3398
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:01,300
didn't actually change their
 

3399
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:04,300
didn't actually change their
foundational runtime components so they

3400
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:04,310
foundational runtime components so they
 

3401
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,070
foundational runtime components so they
kind of added this like syntax sugar

3402
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,080
kind of added this like syntax sugar
 

3403
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,290
kind of added this like syntax sugar
they call TF eager tend to flow again

3404
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:08,300
they call TF eager tend to flow again

01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,630
they call TF eager tend to flow again
which makes it look a lot like pay torch

3406
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:10,640
which makes it look a lot like pay torch
 

3407
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,640
which makes it look a lot like pay torch
but it's 10 times slower than pi torch

01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:12,650
but it's 10 times slower than pi torch
 

3409

but it's 10 times slower than pi torch
to actually hmm do a step so because

3410
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:17,810
to actually hmm do a step so because
 

3411
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,390
to actually hmm do a step so because
they didn't invest the time and like

3412
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:19,400
they didn't invest the time and like
 

3413
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,730
they didn't invest the time and like
retooling the foundations cuz their code

3414
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:21,740
retooling the foundations cuz their code
 

3415
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,950
retooling the foundations cuz their code
base is so horribly copy yeah I think

3416
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:23,960
base is so horribly copy yeah I think
 

3417
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,540
base is so horribly copy yeah I think
it's probably very difficult to do that

3418
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:25,550
it's probably very difficult to do that
 

3419
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:27,220
it's probably very difficult to do that
kind of rejoin yeah well particularly

3420
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:27,230
kind of rejoin yeah well particularly
 

3421
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,780
kind of rejoin yeah well particularly
the way tensorflow was written it was

01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:31,180

3425
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:33,880
written by a lot of people very quickly
in a very disorganized way so like when

3426
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:33,890
in a very disorganized way so like when
 

3427
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:35,500
in a very disorganized way so like when
you actually look in the code as I do it

3428
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:35,510
you actually look in the code as I do it
 

3429
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,780
you actually look in the code as I do it
often I'm always just like oh god what

3430
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:37,790
often I'm always just like oh god what
 

3431
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:39,880
often I'm always just like oh god what

01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:45,110
awful so I'm really extremely negative
 

3435
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:48,850
awful so I'm really extremely negative

3439
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,830

can be a different beast altogether it
 

3441
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,900

you know all the great compiler stuff
 

3447
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:06,400
you know all the great compiler stuff
that Swift builds on with LLVM and yeah

01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:21,980
fine by me but yeah but it does the job
 

3459
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,850
fine by me but yeah but it does the job
if you're using like predefined things

you actually compare like okay I want to
 

3471
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:37,900
you actually compare like okay I want to
write something from scratch yeah like I

01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:37,910
write something from scratch yeah like I

this is taking so long

this is taking so long
 

3497
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,190
this is taking so long
yeah and also there's a lot of things

3498
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:04,200
yeah and also there's a lot of things
 

3499
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,860
yeah and also there's a lot of things
which are just less programmable like TF

3500
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:06,870
which are just less programmable like TF

works intensive flow is just this big

3504
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:10,800

mess it's incredibly inefficient and
 

3507
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,480
mess it's incredibly inefficient and
they kind of had to write it that way

3508
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:14,490
they kind of had to write it that way
 

3509
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:17,540
they kind of had to write it that way
because of the TPU problems I described

3510
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:17,550
because of the TPU problems I described
 

3511
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:22,670
because of the TPU problems I described
earlier so I just you know I just feel

3512
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:22,680
earlier so I just you know I just feel
 

3513
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,080
earlier so I just you know I just feel
like they've got this huge technical

3514
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:24,090
like they've got this huge technical
 

3515
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:25,760
like they've got this huge technical
debt which they're not gonna solve

3516
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:25,770
debt which they're not gonna solve
 

3517
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:28,190
debt which they're not gonna solve
without starting from scratch so here's

3518
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:28,200
without starting from scratch so here's
 

3519
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,110
without starting from scratch so here's
an interesting question then if there's

3520
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:30,120
an interesting question then if there's
 

3521
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:35,570
an interesting question then if there's
a new student starting today what would

3522
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:35,580
a new student starting today what would
 

3523
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:38,060
a new student starting today what would
you recommend they use well I mean we

3524
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:38,070
you recommend they use well I mean we
 

3525
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,310
you recommend they use well I mean we
obviously recommend fast AI and pi torch

3526
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,320
obviously recommend fast AI and pi torch
 

3527
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,980
obviously recommend fast AI and pi torch
because we teach new students and that's

3528
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:42,990
because we teach new students and that's
 

3529
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:44,930
because we teach new students and that's
what we teach with so we would very

3530
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:44,940
what we teach with so we would very
 

3531
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,870
what we teach with so we would very
strongly recommend that because it will

3532
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:47,880
strongly recommend that because it will
 

3533
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,180
strongly recommend that because it will
let you get on top of the concepts much

3534
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:50,190
let you get on top of the concepts much
 

3535
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:52,850
let you get on top of the concepts much
more quickly so then you'll become an

3536
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:52,860
more quickly so then you'll become an
 

3537
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,320
more quickly so then you'll become an
extra and you'll also learn the actual

01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:54,330
extra and you'll also learn the actual
 

3539
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:56,540
extra and you'll also learn the actual
state-of-the-art techniques you know so

3540
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:56,550
state-of-the-art techniques you know so
 

3541
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,630
state-of-the-art techniques you know so
you actually get world-class results

3542
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:58,640
you actually get world-class results
 

3543
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,240
you actually get world-class results
honestly it doesn't much matter what

3544
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:02,250
honestly it doesn't much matter what

3583
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:00,920
of Swift Chris Latner is working at
Google on the Swift Potenza flows so

3584
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:00,930
Google on the Swift Potenza flows so
 

3585
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:04,400
Google on the Swift Potenza flows so
like that's that's a priority it'll be

3586
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:04,410
like that's that's a priority it'll be
 

3587
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:05,420
like that's that's a priority it'll be
interesting to see what happens with

3588
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:05,430
interesting to see what happens with
 

3589
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:08,210
interesting to see what happens with
Apple because like Apple hasn't shown

3590
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:08,220
Apple because like Apple hasn't shown
 

3591
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:11,149
Apple because like Apple hasn't shown
any sign of caring about

3592
01:17:11,149 --> 01:17:11,159
any sign of caring about
 

3593
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:14,360
any sign of caring about
numeric programming in Swift so I mean

3594
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:14,370
numeric programming in Swift so I mean
 

3595
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:17,479
numeric programming in Swift so I mean
hopefully they'll get off their ass and

3596
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:17,489
hopefully they'll get off their ass and
 

3597
01:17:17,489 --> 01:17:18,919
hopefully they'll get off their ass and
start appreciating this because

3598
01:17:18,919 --> 01:17:18,929
start appreciating this because
 

3599
01:17:18,929 --> 01:17:21,620
start appreciating this because
currently all of their low-level

3600
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:21,630
currently all of their low-level
 

3601
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:24,919
currently all of their low-level
libraries are not written in Swift

3602
01:17:24,919 --> 01:17:24,929
libraries are not written in Swift
 

3603
01:17:24,929 --> 01:17:27,290
libraries are not written in Swift
they're not particularly swifty at all

3604
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:27,300
they're not particularly swifty at all
 

3605
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,910
they're not particularly swifty at all
stuff like [\h__\h] ml they're really

3606
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:28,920
stuff like [\h__\h] ml they're really
 

3607
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,600
stuff like [\h__\h] ml they're really
pretty rubbish so yeah so there's a long

3608
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:32,610
pretty rubbish so yeah so there's a long
 

3609
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:34,820
pretty rubbish so yeah so there's a long
way to go but at least one nice thing is

3610
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:34,830
way to go but at least one nice thing is
 

3611
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:35,990
way to go but at least one nice thing is
that Swift for tensorflow

3612
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,000
that Swift for tensorflow
 

3613
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,959
that Swift for tensorflow
can actually directly use Python code

3614
01:17:38,959 --> 01:17:38,969
can actually directly use Python code
 

3615
01:17:38,969 --> 01:17:41,810
can actually directly use Python code
and Python libraries you know literally

3616
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:41,820
and Python libraries you know literally
 

3617
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,689
and Python libraries you know literally
the entire lesson one notebook a fast AI

3618
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:44,699
the entire lesson one notebook a fast AI
 

3619
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:48,110
the entire lesson one notebook a fast AI
runs in Swift right now in Python mode

3620
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:48,120
runs in Swift right now in Python mode
 

3621
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,990
runs in Swift right now in Python mode
so that's that's a nice intermediate

3622
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:51,000
so that's that's a nice intermediate
 

3623
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,340
so that's that's a nice intermediate
thing how long does it take the look at

3624
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:55,350
thing how long does it take the look at
 

3625
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:57,919
thing how long does it take the look at
the two two facile courses how long does

3626
01:17:57,919 --> 01:17:57,929
the two two facile courses how long does
 

3627
01:17:57,929 --> 01:18:00,560
the two two facile courses how long does
it take to get from point zero to

3628
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:00,570
it take to get from point zero to
 

3629
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:05,290
it take to get from point zero to
completing both courses it varies a lot

3630
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:05,300
completing both courses it varies a lot
 

3631
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:10,070
completing both courses it varies a lot
somewhere between two months and two

3632
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
somewhere between two months and two
 

3633
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,710
somewhere between two months and two
years generally

3634
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:12,720
years generally
 

3635
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,810
years generally
so for two months how many hours a day

3636
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:14,820
so for two months how many hours a day
 

3637
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:18,890
so for two months how many hours a day
so I sound like a somebody who is a very

3638
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:18,900
so I sound like a somebody who is a very
 

3639
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:25,160
so I sound like a somebody who is a very
competent coder can can do 70 hours per

3640
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:25,170
competent coder can can do 70 hours per
 

3641
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:29,330
competent coder can can do 70 hours per
course and seventy seven zero yeah

3642
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:29,340
course and seventy seven zero yeah
 

3643
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,960
course and seventy seven zero yeah
that's it okay but a lot of people I

3644
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:32,970
that's it okay but a lot of people I
 

3645
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:36,740
that's it okay but a lot of people I
know take a year off to study first day

3646
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:36,750
know take a year off to study first day
 

3647
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:39,320
know take a year off to study first day
I full-time and say at the end of the

3648
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:39,330
I full-time and say at the end of the
 

3649
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:43,610
I full-time and say at the end of the
year they feel pretty competent because

3650
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:43,620
year they feel pretty competent because
 

3651
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,290
year they feel pretty competent because
generally there's a lot of other things

3652
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:45,300
generally there's a lot of other things
 

3653
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,400
generally there's a lot of other things
you do like they're generally they'll be

3654
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:46,410
you do like they're generally they'll be
 

3655
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:48,980
you do like they're generally they'll be
entering cowgirl competitions they you

3656
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:48,990
entering cowgirl competitions they you
 

3657
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,080
entering cowgirl competitions they you
might be reading in Goodfellows books

3658
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:51,090
might be reading in Goodfellows books
 

3659
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:52,700
might be reading in Goodfellows books
they might you know they'll be doing a

3660
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:52,710
they might you know they'll be doing a
 

3661
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:55,190
they might you know they'll be doing a
bunch of stuff and often you know

3662
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:55,200
bunch of stuff and often you know
 

3663
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,650
bunch of stuff and often you know
particularly if they are domain expert

3664
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:57,660
particularly if they are domain expert
 

3665
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:00,560
particularly if they are domain expert
they're coding skills might be a little

3666
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:00,570
they're coding skills might be a little
 

3667
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,330
they're coding skills might be a little
on the pedestrian side so part of it's

3668
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:02,340
on the pedestrian side so part of it's
 

3669
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:04,910
on the pedestrian side so part of it's
just like doing a lot more writing what

3670
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:04,920
just like doing a lot more writing what
 

3671
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,680
just like doing a lot more writing what
do you find is the bottleneck for people

3672
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:06,690
do you find is the bottleneck for people
 

3673
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:09,980
do you find is the bottleneck for people
usually except getting started and

3674
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:09,990
usually except getting started and
 

3675
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:13,280
usually except getting started and
setting stuff up I would say coding just

3676
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:13,290
setting stuff up I would say coding just
 

3677
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,810
setting stuff up I would say coding just
yeah I would say the best the people who

3678
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:14,820
yeah I would say the best the people who
 

3679
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,860
yeah I would say the best the people who
are strong coders pick it up the best

3680
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:17,870
are strong coders pick it up the best
 

3681
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:20,960
are strong coders pick it up the best
although another bottleneck is people

3682
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:20,970
although another bottleneck is people
 

3683
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:25,250
although another bottleneck is people
who have a lot of experience of classic

3684
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:25,260
who have a lot of experience of classic
 

3685
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,770
who have a lot of experience of classic
statistics can really struggle because

3686
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:27,780
statistics can really struggle because
 

3687
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:30,080
statistics can really struggle because
it the intuition is so the opposite of

3688
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:30,090
it the intuition is so the opposite of
 

3689
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,640
it the intuition is so the opposite of
what they used to they're very used to

3690
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:31,650
what they used to they're very used to
 

3691
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:33,080
what they used to they're very used to
like trying to reduce the number of

3692
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:33,090
like trying to reduce the number of
 

3693
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:36,980
like trying to reduce the number of
parameters in their model and looking at

3694
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:36,990
parameters in their model and looking at
 

3695
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:39,110
parameters in their model and looking at
individual coefficients and stuff like

3696
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:39,120
individual coefficients and stuff like
 

3697
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,930
individual coefficients and stuff like
that so I find people who have a lot of

3698
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:41,940
that so I find people who have a lot of
 

3699
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,640
that so I find people who have a lot of
coding background and know nothing about

3700
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:43,650
coding background and know nothing about
 

3701
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:46,100
coding background and know nothing about
statistics are generally going to be the

3702
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:46,110
statistics are generally going to be the
 

3703
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:50,780
statistics are generally going to be the
best off so you taught several course on

3704
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:50,790
best off so you taught several course on
 

3705
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:52,970
best off so you taught several course on
deep learning and as Fineman says the

3706
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:52,980
deep learning and as Fineman says the
 

3707
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,380
deep learning and as Fineman says the
best way to understand something is to

3708
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:54,390
best way to understand something is to
 

3709
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:56,690
best way to understand something is to
teach it what have you learned about

3710
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:56,700
teach it what have you learned about
 

3711
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,710
teach it what have you learned about
deep learning from teaching it a lot

3712
01:19:59,710 --> 01:19:59,720
deep learning from teaching it a lot
 

3713
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,050
deep learning from teaching it a lot
it's a key reason for me to to teach the

3714
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:03,060
it's a key reason for me to to teach the
 

3715
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:04,250
it's a key reason for me to to teach the
courses I mean obviously it's going to

3716
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:04,260
courses I mean obviously it's going to
 

3717
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,830
courses I mean obviously it's going to
be necessary to achieve our goal of

3718
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:05,840
be necessary to achieve our goal of
 

3719
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,270
be necessary to achieve our goal of
getting two main experts to be familiar

3720
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:08,280
getting two main experts to be familiar
 

3721
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,070
getting two main experts to be familiar
with deep learning but it was also

3722
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:10,080
with deep learning but it was also
 

3723
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,110
with deep learning but it was also
necessary for me to achieve my goal of

3724
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:12,120
necessary for me to achieve my goal of
 

3725
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,930
necessary for me to achieve my goal of
being really familiar with deep learning

3726
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:14,940
being really familiar with deep learning
 

3727
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:23,900
being really familiar with deep learning
I I mean to see so many domain experts

3728
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:23,910
I I mean to see so many domain experts
 

3729
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,760
I I mean to see so many domain experts
from so many different backgrounds it's

3730
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:25,770
from so many different backgrounds it's
 

3731
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:29,080
from so many different backgrounds it's
definitely I wouldn't say taught me but

3732
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:29,090
definitely I wouldn't say taught me but
 

3733
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:31,220
definitely I wouldn't say taught me but
convinced me something that I like to

3734
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:31,230
convinced me something that I like to
 

3735
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:33,650
convinced me something that I like to
believe was true which was anyone can do

3736
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:33,660
believe was true which was anyone can do
 

3737
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,020
believe was true which was anyone can do
it so there's a lot of kind of

3738
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:36,030
it so there's a lot of kind of
 

3739
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:38,510
it so there's a lot of kind of
snobbishness out there about only

3740
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:38,520
snobbishness out there about only
 

3741
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,340
snobbishness out there about only
certain people can learn to code only

3742
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:40,350
certain people can learn to code only
 

3743
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:41,660
certain people can learn to code only
certain people are going to be smart

3744
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:41,670
certain people are going to be smart
 

3745
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,850
certain people are going to be smart
enough to like do AI that's definitely

3746
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:43,860
enough to like do AI that's definitely
 

3747
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,850

[\h__\h] you know I've seen so many

3748
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:46,860
[\h__\h] you know I've seen so many
 

3749
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:47,780
[\h__\h] you know I've seen so many
people from so many different

3750
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:47,790
people from so many different
 

3751
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:50,720
people from so many different
backgrounds get state-of-the-art results

3752
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:50,730
backgrounds get state-of-the-art results
 

3753
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:53,990
backgrounds get state-of-the-art results
in their domain areas now the it's

3754
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,000
in their domain areas now the it's
 

3755
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,670
in their domain areas now the it's
definitely taught me that the key

3756
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:55,680
definitely taught me that the key
 

3757
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,100
definitely taught me that the key
differentiator between people that

3758
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:58,110
differentiator between people that
 

3759
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:00,230
differentiator between people that
succeed and people that fail is tenacity

3760
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:00,240
succeed and people that fail is tenacity
 

3761
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,090
succeed and people that fail is tenacity
that seems to be basically the only

3762
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:02,100
that seems to be basically the only
 

3763
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,960
that seems to be basically the only
thing that matters the people a lot of

3764
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:05,970
thing that matters the people a lot of
 

3765
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:10,340
thing that matters the people a lot of
people give up and but if the ones who

3766
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:10,350
people give up and but if the ones who
 

3767
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:13,160
people give up and but if the ones who
don't give up pretty much everybody

3768
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:13,170
don't give up pretty much everybody
 

3769
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:16,580
don't give up pretty much everybody
succeeds you know even if at first I'm

3770
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:16,590
succeeds you know even if at first I'm
 

3771
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:17,930
succeeds you know even if at first I'm
just kind of like thinking like wow

3772
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:17,940
just kind of like thinking like wow
 

3773
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,030
just kind of like thinking like wow
they're really not quite getting it yet

3774
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:20,040
they're really not quite getting it yet
 

3775
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,400
they're really not quite getting it yet
are they but eventually people get it

3776
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:22,410
are they but eventually people get it
 

3777
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:25,640
are they but eventually people get it
and they succeed so I think that's been

3778
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:25,650
and they succeed so I think that's been
 

3779
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:27,590
and they succeed so I think that's been
any they're both things I'd like to

3780
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:27,600
any they're both things I'd like to
 

3781
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,540
any they're both things I'd like to
believe was true but I don't feel like I

3782
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:29,550
believe was true but I don't feel like I
 

3783
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,280
believe was true but I don't feel like I
really had strong evidence with them to

3784
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:31,290
really had strong evidence with them to
 

3785
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,990
really had strong evidence with them to
be true but now I can say I've seen it

3786
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:33,000
be true but now I can say I've seen it
 

3787
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,400
be true but now I can say I've seen it
again and again so what advice do you

3788
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:37,410
again and again so what advice do you
 

3789
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:40,310
again and again so what advice do you
have for someone who wants to get

3790
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:40,320
have for someone who wants to get

our course is very good but also lots of
 

3801
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,130
our course is very good but also lots of
people independently I said it's very

hopping on in my lessons is train models

3812
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:06,920
hopping on in my lessons is train models
 

3813
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,320
hopping on in my lessons is train models
print out the inputs to the models print

3814
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:09,330
print out the inputs to the models print
 

3815
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:11,180
print out the inputs to the models print
out to the outputs to the models like

3816
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:11,190
out to the outputs to the models like
 

3817
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:14,420
out to the outputs to the models like
study you know change change the inputs

3818
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:14,430
study you know change change the inputs
 

3819
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,510
study you know change change the inputs
of it look at how the outputs very just

3820
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,520
of it look at how the outputs very just
 

3821
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,180
of it look at how the outputs very just
run lots of experiments to get a you

3822
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:20,190
run lots of experiments to get a you
 

3823
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:22,300
run lots of experiments to get a you
know an intuitive understanding of

3824
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:22,310
know an intuitive understanding of
 

3825
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:26,750
know an intuitive understanding of
what's going on to get hooked do

3826
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:26,760
what's going on to get hooked do
 

3827
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,210
what's going on to get hooked do
think you mentioned training do you

3828
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:29,220
think you mentioned training do you
 

3829
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,880
think you mentioned training do you
think just running the models inference

3830
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:31,890
think just running the models inference
 

3831
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:35,540
think just running the models inference
like if we talk about getting started no

3832
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:35,550
like if we talk about getting started no
 

3833
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,040
like if we talk about getting started no
you've got to find cheering the models

3834
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:37,050
you've got to find cheering the models
 

3835
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:39,200
you've got to find cheering the models
so that's that's that's the critical

3836
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:39,210
so that's that's that's the critical
 

3837
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:40,820
so that's that's that's the critical
thing because at that point you now have

3838
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:40,830
thing because at that point you now have
 

3839
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,460
thing because at that point you now have
model that's in your domain area so

3840
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:43,470
model that's in your domain area so
 

3841
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:45,320
model that's in your domain area so
there's there's there's no point running

3842
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:45,330
there's there's there's no point running
 

3843
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:47,240
there's there's there's no point running
somebody else's model because it's not

3844
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:47,250
somebody else's model because it's not
 

3845
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,130
somebody else's model because it's not
your model like so it only takes five

3846
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:49,140
your model like so it only takes five
 

3847
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,660
your model like so it only takes five
minutes to fine-tune a model for the

3848
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:50,670
minutes to fine-tune a model for the
 

3849
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:52,910
minutes to fine-tune a model for the
data you care about and in lesson two of

3850
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:52,920
data you care about and in lesson two of
 

3851
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,590
data you care about and in lesson two of
the course we teach you how to create

3852
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:54,600
the course we teach you how to create
 

3853
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,510
the course we teach you how to create
your own data set from scratch by

3854
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:56,520
your own data set from scratch by
 

3855
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,700
your own data set from scratch by
scripting Google Image Search yeah so

3856
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:58,710
scripting Google Image Search yeah so
 

3857
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:01,100
scripting Google Image Search yeah so
and we show you how to actually create a

3858
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:01,110
and we show you how to actually create a
 

3859
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,020
and we show you how to actually create a
web application running online so I

3860
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:03,030
web application running online so I
 

3861
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:04,240
web application running online so I
create one in the course that

3862
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:04,250
create one in the course that
 

3863
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,320
create one in the course that
differentiates between a teddy bear or

3864
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:06,330
differentiates between a teddy bear or
 

3865
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,540
differentiates between a teddy bear or
grizzly bear and a brown bear and it

3866
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:08,550
grizzly bear and a brown bear and it
 

3867
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,680
grizzly bear and a brown bear and it
does it with basically a hundred percent

3868
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:09,690
does it with basically a hundred percent
 

3869
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:12,440
does it with basically a hundred percent
accuracy took me about four minutes to

3870
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:12,450
accuracy took me about four minutes to
 

3871
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:13,880
accuracy took me about four minutes to
scrape the images from Google search in

3872
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:13,890
scrape the images from Google search in
 

3873
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:17,060
scrape the images from Google search in
the script there's a little graphical

3874
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:17,070
the script there's a little graphical
 

3875
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:18,860
the script there's a little graphical
widgets we have in the notebook that

01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:21,540
help you clean up the data set there's
 

3879
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,570

you actually really care for right if
 

3987
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:43,290
you actually really care for right if
you're not working on a real problem

3988
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:43,300
you're not working on a real problem
 

3989
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,110
you're not working on a real problem
that you understand how do you know if

3990
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:46,120
that you understand how do you know if
 

3991
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,180
that you understand how do you know if
you're doing it any good you know how do

you know if your results so good how do
 

3995
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:50,730
you know if your results so good how do
you know if you're getting bad results

3996
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:50,740
you know if you're getting bad results
 

3997
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,290
you know if you're getting bad results
why you're getting bad results is it a

3998
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:52,300
why you're getting bad results is it a
 

3999
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,990
why you're getting bad results is it a
problem with the data or is like how do

4000
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:55,000
problem with the data or is like how do
 

4001
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,540
problem with the data or is like how do
you know you're doing anything useful

4002
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:56,550
you know you're doing anything useful
 

4003
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:59,040
you know you're doing anything useful
yeah the only to me the only really

4004
01:25:59,040 --> 01:25:59,050
yeah the only to me the only really
 

4005
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,590
yeah the only to me the only really
interesting research is not the only but

4006
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:01,600
interesting research is not the only but
 

4007
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,730
interesting research is not the only but
the vast majority of interesting

4008
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:02,740
the vast majority of interesting
 

4009
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:05,460
the vast majority of interesting
research is like try and solve an actual

4010
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:05,470
research is like try and solve an actual
 

4011
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:07,320
research is like try and solve an actual
problem and solve it really well so both

4012
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:07,330
problem and solve it really well so both
 

4013
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:09,630
problem and solve it really well so both
understanding sufficient tools and the

4014
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:09,640
understanding sufficient tools and the
 

4015
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:13,290
understanding sufficient tools and the
deep learning side and becoming a domain

4016
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:13,300
deep learning side and becoming a domain
 

4017
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,030
deep learning side and becoming a domain
expert in a particular domain I really

4018
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:15,040
expert in a particular domain I really
 

4019
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,390
expert in a particular domain I really
thinks will then reach for anybody yeah

4020
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:18,400
thinks will then reach for anybody yeah
 

4021
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,900
thinks will then reach for anybody yeah
I mean to me I would compare it to like

4022
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:20,910
I mean to me I would compare it to like
 

4023
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:24,300
I mean to me I would compare it to like
studying self-driving cars having never

looked at a car or being in a car or

4026
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:26,620
looked at a car or being in a car or
 

4027
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,470
looked at a car or being in a car or
turn the car on right you know which is

4028
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:28,480
turn the car on right you know which is
 

4029
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,090
turn the car on right you know which is
like the way it is for a lot of people

4030
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:30,100
like the way it is for a lot of people
 

4031
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,110
like the way it is for a lot of people
they'll study some academic data set

4032
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:33,120
they'll study some academic data set
 

4033
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,760
they'll study some academic data set
where they literally have no idea about

4034
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:35,770
where they literally have no idea about
 

4035
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:37,320
where they literally have no idea about
the other way I'm not sure how familiar

4036
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:37,330
the other way I'm not sure how familiar
 

4037
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,630
the other way I'm not sure how familiar
with the thomas vehicles but that is

4038
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:39,640
with the thomas vehicles but that is
 

4039
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,640
with the thomas vehicles but that is
literally you describe a large

4040
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:41,650
literally you describe a large
 

4041
01:26:41,650 --> 01:26:43,770
literally you describe a large
percentage of robotics folks working in

01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:43,780
percentage of robotics folks working in
 

4043
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:45,750
percentage of robotics folks working in

you know like these are the things that
 

4057
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,360
you know like these are the things that
happened to me and I was driving it so

01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:57,370
happened to me and I was driving it so
 

4059
01:26:57,370 --> 01:26:58,380

there's nothing that beats the

there's nothing that beats the
 

4061
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:59,760
there's nothing that beats the
real-world examples are just

4062
01:26:59,760 --> 01:26:59,770
real-world examples are just
 

4063
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:03,180
real-world examples are just

but if you keep costs super low and try
 

4081
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,640
but if you keep costs super low and try
and save up some money beforehand so you

4082
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:30,650
and save up some money beforehand so you
 

4083
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:35,899
and save up some money beforehand so you
can afford to have some time then just

4084
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:35,909
can afford to have some time then just
 

4085
01:27:35,909 --> 01:27:37,160
can afford to have some time then just
sticking with it it's one important

sticking with it it's one important
 

4087
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:40,699
sticking with it it's one important
thing doing something you understand and

4088
01:27:40,699 --> 01:27:40,709
thing doing something you understand and
 

4089
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:42,770
thing doing something you understand and
care about is important that by

4090
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:42,780
care about is important that by
 

4091
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,199
care about is important that by
something I don't mean the biggest

4092
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:45,209
something I don't mean the biggest
 

4093
01:27:45,209 --> 01:27:46,549
something I don't mean the biggest
problem I see with deep whining people

4094
01:27:46,549 --> 01:27:46,559
problem I see with deep whining people
 

4095
01:27:46,559 --> 01:27:50,239
problem I see with deep whining people
is they do a PhD in deep learning and

4096
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:50,249
is they do a PhD in deep learning and
 

4097
01:27:50,249 --> 01:27:51,439
is they do a PhD in deep learning and
then they try and commercialize their

4098
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:51,449
then they try and commercialize their
 

4099
01:27:51,449 --> 01:27:53,540
then they try and commercialize their
PhD it is a waste of time because that

4100
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:53,550
PhD it is a waste of time because that
 

4101
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:56,089
PhD it is a waste of time because that
doesn't solve an actual problem you

4102
01:27:56,089 --> 01:27:56,099
doesn't solve an actual problem you
 

4103
01:27:56,099 --> 01:27:58,160
doesn't solve an actual problem you
picked your PhD topic because it was an

4104
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:58,170
picked your PhD topic because it was an
 

4105
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:00,469
picked your PhD topic because it was an
interesting kind of engineering or math

4106
01:28:00,469 --> 01:28:00,479
interesting kind of engineering or math
 

4107
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:03,620
interesting kind of engineering or math
or research exercise but yeah if you've

4108
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:03,630
or research exercise but yeah if you've
 

4109
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:06,350
or research exercise but yeah if you've
actually spent time as a recruiter and

4110
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:06,360
actually spent time as a recruiter and
 

4111
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,359
actually spent time as a recruiter and
you know that most of your time was

4112
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:08,369
you know that most of your time was
 

4113
01:28:08,369 --> 01:28:10,969
you know that most of your time was
spent sifting through resumes and you

4114
01:28:10,969 --> 01:28:10,979
spent sifting through resumes and you
 

4115
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:12,979
spent sifting through resumes and you
know that most of the time you're just

4116
01:28:12,979 --> 01:28:12,989
know that most of the time you're just
 

4117
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:14,839
know that most of the time you're just
looking for certain kinds of things and

4118
01:28:14,839 --> 01:28:14,849
looking for certain kinds of things and
 

4119
01:28:14,849 --> 01:28:19,069
looking for certain kinds of things and
you can try doing that with a model for

4120
01:28:19,069 --> 01:28:19,079
you can try doing that with a model for
 

4121
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:20,239
you can try doing that with a model for
a few minutes and see whether that

4122
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:20,249
a few minutes and see whether that
 

4123
01:28:20,249 --> 01:28:21,500
a few minutes and see whether that
something which your models be able to

4124
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:21,510
something which your models be able to
 

4125
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:24,259
something which your models be able to
do as well as you could then you're on

4126
01:28:24,259 --> 01:28:24,269
do as well as you could then you're on
 

4127
01:28:24,269 --> 01:28:26,679
do as well as you could then you're on
the right track to creating a startup

4128
01:28:26,679 --> 01:28:26,689
the right track to creating a startup
 

4129
01:28:26,689 --> 01:28:30,790
the right track to creating a startup
and then I think just yeah being just be

4130
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:30,800
and then I think just yeah being just be
 

4131
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,240
and then I think just yeah being just be
pragmatic and

4132
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:34,250

 

4133
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:36,030

train state

4134
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:36,040
train state
 

4135
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,320
train state
to capital money as long as possible

4136
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:37,330
to capital money as long as possible
 

4137
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:40,560
to capital money as long as possible
preferably forever so yeah on that point

4138
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:40,570
preferably forever so yeah on that point
 

4139
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:44,940
preferably forever so yeah on that point
do you venture capital so did you were

4140
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:44,950
do you venture capital so did you were
 

4141
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:47,040
do you venture capital so did you were
able to successfully run startups with

4142
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:47,050
able to successfully run startups with
 

4143
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:49,470
able to successfully run startups with
was self-funded yeah my first two was

4144
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:49,480
was self-funded yeah my first two was
 

4145
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,570
was self-funded yeah my first two was
self-funded and that was the right way

4146
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:51,580
self-funded and that was the right way
 

4147
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,230
self-funded and that was the right way
to do it

4148
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:52,240
to do it
 

4149
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:56,850
to do it
that's scary no species startups are

4150
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:56,860
that's scary no species startups are
 

4151
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:58,940
that's scary no species startups are
much more scary because you have these

4152
01:28:58,940 --> 01:28:58,950
much more scary because you have these
 

4153
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:01,440
much more scary because you have these
people on your back who do this all the

4154
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:01,450
people on your back who do this all the
 

4155
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:03,120
people on your back who do this all the
time and who have done it for years

4156
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:03,130
time and who have done it for years
 

4157
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:05,700
time and who have done it for years
telling you grow grow grow grow and I

4158
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:05,710
telling you grow grow grow grow and I
 

4159
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:07,290
telling you grow grow grow grow and I
don't they don't care if you fail they

4160
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:07,300
don't they don't care if you fail they
 

4161
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,670
don't they don't care if you fail they
only care if you don't grow fast enough

4162
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:08,680
only care if you don't grow fast enough
 

4163
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,500
only care if you don't grow fast enough
so that's scary

4164
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:10,510
so that's scary
 

4165
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:13,320
so that's scary
where else doing the ones myself well

4166
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:13,330
where else doing the ones myself well
 

4167
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:17,850
where else doing the ones myself well
with with partners who were friends is

4168
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:17,860
with with partners who were friends is
 

4169
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:20,670
with with partners who were friends is
nice because like we just went along at

4170
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:20,680
nice because like we just went along at
 

4171
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,740
nice because like we just went along at
a pace that made sense and we were able

4172
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:22,750
a pace that made sense and we were able
 

4173
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:25,560
a pace that made sense and we were able
to build it to something which was big

4174
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:25,570
to build it to something which was big
 

4175
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:26,880
to build it to something which was big
enough that we never had to work again

4176
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:26,890
enough that we never had to work again
 

4177
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:29,510
enough that we never had to work again
but was not big enough that any VC would

4178
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,520
but was not big enough that any VC would
 

4179
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,880
but was not big enough that any VC would
think it was impressive and that was

4180
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:32,890
think it was impressive and that was
 

4181
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:36,120
think it was impressive and that was
enough for us to be excited you know so

4182
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:36,130
enough for us to be excited you know so
 

4183
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:38,850
enough for us to be excited you know so
I I thought that's a much better way to

4184
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:38,860
I I thought that's a much better way to
 

4185
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:40,860
I I thought that's a much better way to
do things and most people in generally

4186
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:40,870
do things and most people in generally
 

4187
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:42,420
do things and most people in generally
speaking that for yourself but how do

4188
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:42,430
speaking that for yourself but how do
 

4189
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:44,640
speaking that for yourself but how do
you make money during that process do

4190
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:44,650
you make money during that process do
 

4191
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:47,940
you make money during that process do
you cut into savings if I guess so yeah

4192
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:47,950
you cut into savings if I guess so yeah
 

4193
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:48,720
you cut into savings if I guess so yeah
so fir

4194
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:48,730
so fir
 

4195
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:50,190
so fir
so I started fast mail and optimal

4196
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:50,200
so I started fast mail and optimal
 

4197
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,920
so I started fast mail and optimal
decisions at the same time in 1999 with

4198
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:52,930
decisions at the same time in 1999 with
 

4199
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:59,280
decisions at the same time in 1999 with
two different friends and for fast mail

4200
01:29:59,280 --> 01:29:59,290

I guess I spent $70 a month on the
 

4203
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:05,310
I guess I spent $70 a month on the
server and when the server ran out of

4204

space I put a payments button on the

4206
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:08,470
space I put a payments button on the
 

4207
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,350
space I put a payments button on the
front page and said if you want more

4208
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:10,360
front page and said if you want more
 

4209

front page and said if you want more
than 10 makerspace you have to pay $10 a

yeah and so run low like keep your cost
 

4213

down yes I came across town and once you
 

4215
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:22,620
down yes I came across town and once you
know once once I needed to spend more

4216
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:22,630
know once once I needed to spend more
 

4217
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:25,050
know once once I needed to spend more
money I asked people to spend the money

4218
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:25,060
money I asked people to spend the money
 

4219
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:28,830
money I asked people to spend the money
for me and that that was that basically

4220
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:28,840
for me and that that was that basically
 

4221
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,930
for me and that that was that basically
from then on oh we were making money and

4222
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:30,940
from then on oh we were making money and
 

4223
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:36,000
from then on oh we were making money and
I was profitable from then for optimal

4224
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:36,010
I was profitable from then for optimal
 

4225
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:38,270
I was profitable from then for optimal
decisions it was a bit harder because we

4226
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:38,280
decisions it was a bit harder because we
 

4227
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,290
decisions it was a bit harder because we
were trying to sell something that was

4228
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:40,300
were trying to sell something that was
 

4229
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,330
were trying to sell something that was
more like a 1 million dollar sale but

4230
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:42,340
more like a 1 million dollar sale but
 

4231
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:45,810
more like a 1 million dollar sale but
what we did was we would sell scoping

4232
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:45,820
what we did was we would sell scoping
 

4233
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:49,800
what we did was we would sell scoping
projects so kind of like prototype he

4234
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:49,810
projects so kind of like prototype he
 

4235
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:51,810
projects so kind of like prototype he
projects but rather than to be free we

4236
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:51,820
projects but rather than to be free we
 

4237
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:54,930
projects but rather than to be free we
would sell them 50 to $100,000 so again

4238
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:54,940
would sell them 50 to $100,000 so again
 

4239
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:57,270
would sell them 50 to $100,000 so again
we were covering our costs and also

4240
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:57,280
we were covering our costs and also
 

4241
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,680
we were covering our costs and also
making the client feel like we were

4242
01:30:58,680 --> 01:30:58,690
making the client feel like we were
 

4243
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:00,510
making the client feel like we were
doing something valuable so in both

4244
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:00,520
doing something valuable so in both
 

4245
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:04,110
doing something valuable so in both
cases we were profitable from six months

4246
01:31:04,110 --> 01:31:04,120
cases we were profitable from six months
 

4247
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:08,600
cases we were profitable from six months
in yeah nevertheless is scary I mean

4248
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:08,610
in yeah nevertheless is scary I mean
 

4249
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:12,960
in yeah nevertheless is scary I mean
yeah sure it's it's Gary before you jump

4250
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:12,970
yeah sure it's it's Gary before you jump
 

4251
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:15,540
yeah sure it's it's Gary before you jump
in and I just I guess I was comparing it

4252
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:15,550
in and I just I guess I was comparing it
 

4253
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:18,780
in and I just I guess I was comparing it
to this scariness of VC I felt like with

4254
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:18,790
to this scariness of VC I felt like with
 

4255
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:21,050
to this scariness of VC I felt like with
VC stuff it was more scary you kind of

4256
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:21,060
VC stuff it was more scary you kind of
 

4257
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,910
VC stuff it was more scary you kind of
much more in somebody else's hands you

4258
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:23,920
much more in somebody else's hands you
 

4259
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,730
much more in somebody else's hands you
know will they fund you or not and what

4260
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:26,740
know will they fund you or not and what
 

4261
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:27,990
know will they fund you or not and what
do they think of what you're doing I

4262
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,000
do they think of what you're doing I
 

4263
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,640
do they think of what you're doing I
also found it very difficult with VC's

4264
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:29,650
also found it very difficult with VC's
 

4265
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,610
also found it very difficult with VC's
bet startups to actually do the thing

4266
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:32,620
bet startups to actually do the thing
 

4267
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,470
bet startups to actually do the thing
which I thought was important for the

4268
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:34,480
which I thought was important for the
 

4269
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,880
which I thought was important for the
company rather than doing the thing

4270
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:35,890
company rather than doing the thing
 

4271
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:38,190
company rather than doing the thing
which I thought would make the VC happy

4272
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:38,200
which I thought would make the VC happy
 

4273
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,680
which I thought would make the VC happy
now VCS always tell you not to do the

4274
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:40,690
now VCS always tell you not to do the
 

4275
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,780
now VCS always tell you not to do the
thing that makes them happy but then if

4276
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:42,790
thing that makes them happy but then if
 

4277
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:43,740
thing that makes them happy but then if
you don't do the thing that makes them

4278
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:43,750
you don't do the thing that makes them
 

4279
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:46,890
you don't do the thing that makes them
happy they get set so and do you think

4280
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:46,900
happy they get set so and do you think
 

4281
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,810
happy they get set so and do you think
optimizing for the whatever they call it

4282
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:48,820
optimizing for the whatever they call it
 

4283
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,670
optimizing for the whatever they call it
they exit is uh

4284
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:50,680
they exit is uh
 

4285
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,160
they exit is uh
as a good thing to optimize for I think

4286
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:53,170
as a good thing to optimize for I think
 

4287
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:55,050
as a good thing to optimize for I think
I can be but not at the VC level because

4288
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:55,060
I can be but not at the VC level because
 

4289
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:57,590
I can be but not at the VC level because
the VC exit needs to be you know a

4290
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:57,600
the VC exit needs to be you know a
 

4291
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,430
the VC exit needs to be you know a
thousand x so where else the lifestyle

4292
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:02,440
thousand x so where else the lifestyle
 

4293
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,410
thousand x so where else the lifestyle
exit if you can sell something for ten

4294
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:04,420
exit if you can sell something for ten
 

4295
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,000
exit if you can sell something for ten
million dollars I think you've made it

4296
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:06,010
million dollars I think you've made it
 

4297
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:09,360
million dollars I think you've made it
right so I don't it depends if you want

4298
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:09,370
right so I don't it depends if you want
 

4299
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:11,520
right so I don't it depends if you want
to build something that's gonna you kind

4300
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:11,530
to build something that's gonna you kind
 

4301
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:12,930
to build something that's gonna you kind
of happy to do forever

4302
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:12,940
of happy to do forever
 

4303
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:14,310
of happy to do forever
then fine if you want to build something

4304
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:14,320
then fine if you want to build something
 

4305
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,520
then fine if you want to build something
you want to sell then three is time

4306
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:17,530
you want to sell then three is time
 

4307
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:18,900
you want to sell then three is time
that's fine too I mean they're both

4308
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:18,910
that's fine too I mean they're both
 

4309
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:22,050
that's fine too I mean they're both
perfectly good outcomes so you're

4310
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:22,060
perfectly good outcomes so you're
 

4311
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:25,230
perfectly good outcomes so you're
learning Swift now in a way I mean you

4312
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:25,240
learning Swift now in a way I mean you
 

4313
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:30,240
learning Swift now in a way I mean you
were a writer and I read that you use at

4314
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:30,250
were a writer and I read that you use at
 

4315
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,580
were a writer and I read that you use at
least in some cases spaced repetition as

4316
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:32,590
least in some cases spaced repetition as
 

4317
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,200
least in some cases spaced repetition as
a mechanism for learning new things yeah

4318
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:34,210
a mechanism for learning new things yeah
 

4319
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:38,270
a mechanism for learning new things yeah
I used Anki quite a lot yourself sure I

4320
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:38,280
I used Anki quite a lot yourself sure I
 

4321
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,350
I used Anki quite a lot yourself sure I
actually don't never talk to anybody

4322
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:40,360
actually don't never talk to anybody
 

4323
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,930
actually don't never talk to anybody
about it don't don't know how many

4324
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:42,940
about it don't don't know how many
 

4325
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:45,150
about it don't don't know how many
people do it but it works incredibly

4326
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:45,160
people do it but it works incredibly
 

4327
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,460
people do it but it works incredibly
well for me can you talk to your

4328
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:47,470
well for me can you talk to your
 

4329
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:49,770
well for me can you talk to your
experience like how did you what what do

4330
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:49,780
experience like how did you what what do
 

4331
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:52,590
experience like how did you what what do
you like first of all okay let's back it

4332
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:52,600
you like first of all okay let's back it
 

4333
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,620
you like first of all okay let's back it
up what is space repetition so spaced

4334
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:55,630
up what is space repetition so spaced
 

4335
01:32:55,630 --> 01:33:00,510
up what is space repetition so spaced

hundred and fifty years ago he did

4342
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:08,350
hundred and fifty years ago he did
 

4343
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:10,110
hundred and fifty years ago he did
something which sounds pretty damn

4344
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:10,120
something which sounds pretty damn
 

4345
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:13,110
something which sounds pretty damn
tedious he wrote down random sequences

4346
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:13,120
tedious he wrote down random sequences
 

4347
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:17,520
tedious he wrote down random sequences
of letters on cards and tested how well

4348
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:17,530
of letters on cards and tested how well
 

4349
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:20,310
of letters on cards and tested how well
he would remember those random sequences

4350
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:20,320
he would remember those random sequences
 

4351
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:23,130
he would remember those random sequences
a day later or a week later whatever he

4352
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:23,140
a day later or a week later whatever he
 

4353
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,840
a day later or a week later whatever he
discovered that there was this kind of a

4354
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:24,850
discovered that there was this kind of a
 

4355
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:27,660
discovered that there was this kind of a
curve where his probability of

4356
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:27,670
curve where his probability of
 

4357
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:29,100
curve where his probability of
remembering one of them would be

4358
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:29,110
remembering one of them would be
 

4359
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:30,780
remembering one of them would be
dramatically smaller the next day and

4360
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:30,790
dramatically smaller the next day and
 

4361
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:31,920
dramatically smaller the next day and
then a little bit smaller the next day a

4362
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:31,930
then a little bit smaller the next day a
 

4363
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:33,750
then a little bit smaller the next day a
little bit smaller next day what he

4364
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:33,760
little bit smaller next day what he
 

4365
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,240
little bit smaller next day what he
discovered is that if he revised those

4366
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:36,250
discovered is that if he revised those
 

4367
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,890
discovered is that if he revised those
cards after a day the probabilities

4368
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:39,900
cards after a day the probabilities
 

4369
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:42,570
cards after a day the probabilities
would decrease at a smaller rate and

4370
01:33:42,570 --> 01:33:42,580
would decrease at a smaller rate and
 

4371
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:44,190
would decrease at a smaller rate and
then if he revised them again a week

4372
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:44,200
then if he revised them again a week
 

4373
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,020
then if he revised them again a week
later they would decrease it a smaller

4374
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:46,030
later they would decrease it a smaller
 

4375
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:48,240
later they would decrease it a smaller
rate again and so he basically figured

4376
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:48,250
rate again and so he basically figured
 

4377
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:52,290
rate again and so he basically figured
out a roughly optimal equation for when

4378
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:52,300
out a roughly optimal equation for when
 

4379
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,000
out a roughly optimal equation for when
you should revise something you want to

4380
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:54,010
you should revise something you want to
 

4381
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:57,900
you should revise something you want to
remember so spaced repetition learning

4382
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:57,910
remember so spaced repetition learning
 

4383
01:33:57,910 --> 01:34:00,600
remember so spaced repetition learning
is using this simple algorithm just

4384
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:00,610
is using this simple algorithm just
 

4385
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:03,150
is using this simple algorithm just
something like revise something after a

4386
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:03,160
something like revise something after a
 

4387
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,950
something like revise something after a
day and then three days and then a week

4388
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:04,960
day and then three days and then a week
 

4389
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,500
day and then three days and then a week
and then three weeks and so forth

4390
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:07,510
and then three weeks and so forth
 

4391
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:09,450
and then three weeks and so forth
and so if you use a program like Anki as

4392
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:09,460
and so if you use a program like Anki as
 

4393
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:11,550
and so if you use a program like Anki as
you know it will just do that for you

4394
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:11,560
you know it will just do that for you
 

4395
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,650
you know it will just do that for you
and if you and it will say did you

4396
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:13,660
and if you and it will say did you
 

4397
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:16,410
and if you and it will say did you
remember this and if you say no it will

4398
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:16,420
remember this and if you say no it will
 

4399
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,750
remember this and if you say no it will
reschedule it back to be up here again

4400
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:18,760
reschedule it back to be up here again
 

4401
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:21,120
reschedule it back to be up here again
like ten times faster than it otherwise

4402
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:21,130
like ten times faster than it otherwise
 

4403
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:25,200
like ten times faster than it otherwise
would have it's a kind of a way of being

4404
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:25,210
would have it's a kind of a way of being
 

4405
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:27,239
would have it's a kind of a way of being
guaranteed to learn something

4406
01:34:27,239 --> 01:34:27,249
guaranteed to learn something
 

4407
01:34:27,249 --> 01:34:29,339
guaranteed to learn something
because by definition if you're not

4408
01:34:29,339 --> 01:34:29,349
because by definition if you're not
 

4409
01:34:29,349 --> 01:34:31,379
because by definition if you're not
learning it it will be rescheduled to be

4410
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:31,389
learning it it will be rescheduled to be
 

4411
01:34:31,389 --> 01:34:34,049
learning it it will be rescheduled to be
revised more quickly unfortunately

4412
01:34:34,049 --> 01:34:34,059
revised more quickly unfortunately
 

4413
01:34:34,059 --> 01:34:36,629
revised more quickly unfortunately
though it's also like it doesn't let you

4414
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:36,639
though it's also like it doesn't let you
 

4415
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:38,700
though it's also like it doesn't let you
for yourself if you not learning

4416
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:38,710
for yourself if you not learning
 

4417
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:41,879
for yourself if you not learning
something you you know like it your

4418
01:34:41,879 --> 01:34:41,889
something you you know like it your
 

4419
01:34:41,889 --> 01:34:44,250
something you you know like it your
revisions will just get more and more so

4420
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:44,260
revisions will just get more and more so
 

4421
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:47,029
revisions will just get more and more so
you have to find ways to learn things

4422
01:34:47,029 --> 01:34:47,039
you have to find ways to learn things
 

4423
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:49,500
you have to find ways to learn things
productively and effectively like treat

4424
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:49,510
productively and effectively like treat
 

4425
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:51,959
productively and effectively like treat
your brain well so using like mnemonics

4426
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:51,969
your brain well so using like mnemonics
 

4427
01:34:51,969 --> 01:34:55,770
your brain well so using like mnemonics
and stories and context and stuff like

4428
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:55,780
and stories and context and stuff like
 

4429
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:59,189
and stories and context and stuff like
that so yeah it's it's a super great

4430
01:34:59,189 --> 01:34:59,199
that so yeah it's it's a super great
 

4431
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:00,719
that so yeah it's it's a super great
technique is like learning how to loan

4432
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:00,729
technique is like learning how to loan
 

4433
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:03,330
technique is like learning how to loan
is something which everybody should

4434
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:03,340
is something which everybody should
 

4435
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:04,620
is something which everybody should
learn before they actually learn

4436
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:04,630
learn before they actually learn
 

4437
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:08,189
learn before they actually learn
anything but almost nobody does what

4438
01:35:08,189 --> 01:35:08,199
anything but almost nobody does what
 

4439
01:35:08,199 --> 01:35:10,109
anything but almost nobody does what
have you so certainly works well for

4440
01:35:10,109 --> 01:35:10,119
have you so certainly works well for
 

4441
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:13,890
have you so certainly works well for
learning new languages for I mean for

4442
01:35:13,890 --> 01:35:13,900
learning new languages for I mean for
 

4443
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:16,649
learning new languages for I mean for
learned like small projects almost but

4444
01:35:16,649 --> 01:35:16,659
learned like small projects almost but
 

4445
01:35:16,659 --> 01:35:19,169
learned like small projects almost but
do you you know I started using it for

4446
01:35:19,169 --> 01:35:19,179
do you you know I started using it for
 

4447
01:35:19,179 --> 01:35:21,060
do you you know I started using it for
if you had who wrote a blog post about

4448
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:21,070
if you had who wrote a blog post about
 

4449
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:21,989
if you had who wrote a blog post about
this inspired me

4450
01:35:21,989 --> 01:35:21,999
this inspired me
 

4451
01:35:21,999 --> 01:35:27,270
this inspired me
I went Ben you I'm not sure is I started

4452
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:27,280
I went Ben you I'm not sure is I started
 

4453
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:30,509
I went Ben you I'm not sure is I started
when I read papers all all concepts and

4454
01:35:30,509 --> 01:35:30,519
when I read papers all all concepts and
 

4455
01:35:30,519 --> 01:35:32,459
when I read papers all all concepts and
ideas I'll put them was it Michael

4456
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:32,469
ideas I'll put them was it Michael
 

4457
01:35:32,469 --> 01:35:34,469
ideas I'll put them was it Michael
Nelson in my Illinois muscle strains

4458
01:35:34,469 --> 01:35:34,479
Nelson in my Illinois muscle strains
 

4459
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,330
Nelson in my Illinois muscle strains
that Michael started doing this recently

4460
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:36,340
that Michael started doing this recently
 

4461
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:41,399
that Michael started doing this recently
and he's been writing about it I so the

4462
01:35:41,399 --> 01:35:41,409
and he's been writing about it I so the
 

4463
01:35:41,409 --> 01:35:43,529
and he's been writing about it I so the
kind of today's evening house is a guy

4464
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:43,539
kind of today's evening house is a guy
 

4465
01:35:43,539 --> 01:35:45,959
kind of today's evening house is a guy
called Peter was niak who developed a

4466
01:35:45,959 --> 01:35:45,969
called Peter was niak who developed a
 

4467
01:35:45,969 --> 01:35:48,509
called Peter was niak who developed a
system called super memo and he's been

4468
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:48,519
system called super memo and he's been
 

4469
01:35:48,519 --> 01:35:51,870
system called super memo and he's been
basically trying to become like the

4470
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:51,880
basically trying to become like the
 

4471
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:54,299
basically trying to become like the
world's greatest Renaissance man over

4472
01:35:54,299 --> 01:35:54,309
world's greatest Renaissance man over
 

4473
01:35:54,309 --> 01:35:56,489
world's greatest Renaissance man over
the last few decades he's basically

4474
01:35:56,489 --> 01:35:56,499
the last few decades he's basically
 

4475
01:35:56,499 --> 01:35:59,489
the last few decades he's basically
lived his life with spaced repeated

4476
01:35:59,489 --> 01:35:59,499
lived his life with spaced repeated
 

4477
01:35:59,499 --> 01:36:04,770
lived his life with spaced repeated
repetition learning for everything I and

4478
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:04,780
repetition learning for everything I and
 

4479
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:06,660
repetition learning for everything I and
sort of like Michaels only very recently

4480
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:06,670
sort of like Michaels only very recently
 

4481
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:08,279
sort of like Michaels only very recently
got into this but he started really

4482
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:08,289
got into this but he started really
 

4483
01:36:08,289 --> 01:36:09,810
got into this but he started really
getting excited about doing it for a lot

4484
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:09,820
getting excited about doing it for a lot
 

4485
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:12,270
getting excited about doing it for a lot
of different things for me personally I

4486
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:12,280
of different things for me personally I
 

4487
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,910
of different things for me personally I
actually don't use it for anything

4488
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:14,920
actually don't use it for anything
 

4489
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:18,330
actually don't use it for anything
except Chinese and the reason for that

4490
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:18,340
except Chinese and the reason for that
 

4491
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:21,719
except Chinese and the reason for that
is that Chinese is specifically a thing

4492
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:21,729
is that Chinese is specifically a thing
 

4493
01:36:21,729 --> 01:36:23,549
is that Chinese is specifically a thing
I made a conscious decision that I want

4494
01:36:23,549 --> 01:36:23,559
I made a conscious decision that I want
 

4495
01:36:23,559 --> 01:36:28,620
I made a conscious decision that I want
to continue to remember even if I don't

4496
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:28,630
to continue to remember even if I don't
 

4497
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:30,000
to continue to remember even if I don't
get much of a chance to exercise it

4498
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,010
get much of a chance to exercise it
 

4499
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:32,160
get much of a chance to exercise it
because like I'm not often in China so I

4500
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:32,170
because like I'm not often in China so I
 

4501
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:35,189
because like I'm not often in China so I
I don't or else something like

4502
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:35,199
I don't or else something like
 

4503
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:38,549
I don't or else something like
programming languages or papers I have a

4504
01:36:38,549 --> 01:36:38,559
programming languages or papers I have a
 

4505
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:40,439
programming languages or papers I have a
very different approach which is I try

4506
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:40,449
very different approach which is I try
 

4507
01:36:40,449 --> 01:36:41,250
very different approach which is I try
not to

4508
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:41,260
not to
 

4509
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:43,530
not to
learn anything from them but instead I

4510
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:43,540
learn anything from them but instead I
 

4511
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:46,680
learn anything from them but instead I
try to identify the important concepts

4512
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:46,690
try to identify the important concepts
 

4513
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:49,490
try to identify the important concepts
and like actually ingest them so like

4514
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:49,500
and like actually ingest them so like
 

4515
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:53,520
and like actually ingest them so like
really understand that concept deeply

4516
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:53,530
really understand that concept deeply
 

4517
01:36:53,530 --> 01:36:55,560
really understand that concept deeply
and study it carefully I will decide if

4518
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:55,570
and study it carefully I will decide if
 

4519
01:36:55,570 --> 01:36:57,470
and study it carefully I will decide if
it really is important if it is like

4520
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:57,480
it really is important if it is like
 

4521
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:01,200
it really is important if it is like

much faster to relearn than it was to

4662
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:48,980
much faster to relearn than it was to
 

4663
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:52,270
much faster to relearn than it was to
learn the first time yeah absolutely

4664
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:52,280
learn the first time yeah absolutely
 

4665
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,100
learn the first time yeah absolutely
it's it's in there the same with with

4666
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:54,110
it's it's in there the same with with
 

4667
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:57,010
it's it's in there the same with with
guitar with music and so on it's sad

4668
01:39:57,010 --> 01:39:57,020
guitar with music and so on it's sad
 

4669
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:59,050
guitar with music and so on it's sad
because the work sometimes takes away

4670
01:39:59,050 --> 01:39:59,060
because the work sometimes takes away
 

4671
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:01,360
because the work sometimes takes away
and then you won't play for a year but

4672
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:01,370
and then you won't play for a year but
 

4673
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:03,100
and then you won't play for a year but
really if you then just get back to it

4674
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:03,110
really if you then just get back to it
 

4675
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:04,510
really if you then just get back to it
every day you're right through right

4676
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:04,520
every day you're right through right
 

4677
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,970
every day you're right through right
there again what do you think is the

4678
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:06,980
there again what do you think is the
 

4679
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,860
there again what do you think is the
next big breakthrough in artificial

4680
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:08,870
next big breakthrough in artificial
 

4681
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:11,140
next big breakthrough in artificial
intelligence what are your hopes in deep

4682
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:11,150
intelligence what are your hopes in deep
 

4683
01:40:11,150 --> 01:40:13,540
intelligence what are your hopes in deep
learning or beyond that people should be

4684
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:13,550
learning or beyond that people should be
 

4685
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:14,890
learning or beyond that people should be
working on or you hope there'll be

4686
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:14,900
working on or you hope there'll be
 

4687
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,870
working on or you hope there'll be
breakthroughs I don't think it's

4688
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:16,880
breakthroughs I don't think it's
 

4689
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,390
breakthroughs I don't think it's
possible to predict I think yeah I think

4690
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:19,400
possible to predict I think yeah I think
 

4691
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,370
possible to predict I think yeah I think
what we already have is an incredibly

4692
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:21,380
what we already have is an incredibly
 

4693
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:24,750
what we already have is an incredibly
powerful platform to solve lots of

4694
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:24,760
powerful platform to solve lots of
 

4695
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,740
powerful platform to solve lots of
societally important problems that are

4696
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:26,750
societally important problems that are
 

4697
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,870
societally important problems that are
currently unsolved so I just hope that

4698
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:28,880
currently unsolved so I just hope that
 

4699
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,000
currently unsolved so I just hope that
people will lots of people will learn

4700
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:31,010
people will lots of people will learn
 

4701
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:33,670
people will lots of people will learn
this toolkit and try to use it I don't

4702
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:33,680
this toolkit and try to use it I don't
 

4703
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,920
this toolkit and try to use it I don't
think we need a lot of new technological

4704
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:35,930
think we need a lot of new technological
 

4705
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:37,660
think we need a lot of new technological
breakthroughs to do a lot of great work

4706
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:37,670
breakthroughs to do a lot of great work
 

4707
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:41,590
breakthroughs to do a lot of great work
right now and when do you think we're

4708
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:41,600
right now and when do you think we're
 

4709
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,510
right now and when do you think we're
going to create a human level

4710
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:43,520
going to create a human level
 

4711
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,880
going to create a human level
intelligence system do you think know

4712
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:45,890
intelligence system do you think know
 

4713
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:48,880
intelligence system do you think know
how hard is it how far away are we don't

4714
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:48,890
how hard is it how far away are we don't
 

4715
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:50,980
how hard is it how far away are we don't
know don't have no way to know I don't

4716
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:50,990
know don't have no way to know I don't
 

4717
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:52,750
know don't have no way to know I don't
know like I don't know why people make

4718
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:52,760
know like I don't know why people make
 

4719
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,520
know like I don't know why people make
predictions about this because there's

4720
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:54,530
predictions about this because there's
 

4721
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:57,880
predictions about this because there's
no data and nothing to go on and the

4722
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:57,890
no data and nothing to go on and the
 

4723
01:40:57,890 --> 01:40:59,430
no data and nothing to go on and the
Senate that's right it's just like

4724
01:40:59,430 --> 01:40:59,440
Senate that's right it's just like
 

4725
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,960
Senate that's right it's just like
there's so many

4726
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:01,970
there's so many
 

4727
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:03,820
there's so many
societally important problems to solve

4728
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:03,830
societally important problems to solve
 

4729
01:41:03,830 --> 01:41:06,730
societally important problems to solve
right now I just don't find it a really

4730
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:06,740
right now I just don't find it a really
 

4731
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:10,480
right now I just don't find it a really
interesting question to even answer so

4732
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:10,490
interesting question to even answer so
 

4733
01:41:10,490 --> 01:41:12,370
interesting question to even answer so
in terms of societally important

4734
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:12,380
in terms of societally important
 

4735
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:14,920
in terms of societally important
problems what's the problem well is

4736
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:14,930
problems what's the problem well is
 

4737
01:41:14,930 --> 01:41:16,360
problems what's the problem well is
within reached for it

4738
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:16,370
within reached for it
 

4739
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:17,680
within reached for it
well I mean for example there are

4740
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:17,690
well I mean for example there are
 

4741
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:20,080
well I mean for example there are
problems that AI creates right so most

4742
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:20,090
problems that AI creates right so most
 

4743
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:22,580
problems that AI creates right so most
specifically

4744
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:22,590
specifically
 

4745
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:26,209
specifically
labor force displacement is going to be

4746
01:41:26,209 --> 01:41:26,219
labor force displacement is going to be
 

4747
01:41:26,219 --> 01:41:28,419
labor force displacement is going to be
huge and people keep making this

4748
01:41:28,419 --> 01:41:28,429
huge and people keep making this
 

4749
01:41:28,429 --> 01:41:31,219
huge and people keep making this
frivolous econometrics argument of being

4750
01:41:31,219 --> 01:41:31,229
frivolous econometrics argument of being
 

4751
01:41:31,229 --> 01:41:33,290
frivolous econometrics argument of being
like oh there's been other things that

4752
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:33,300
like oh there's been other things that
 

4753
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,669
like oh there's been other things that
aren't AI that have come along before

4754
01:41:34,669 --> 01:41:34,679
aren't AI that have come along before
 

4755
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:37,129
aren't AI that have come along before
and haven't created massive labor force

4756
01:41:37,129 --> 01:41:37,139
and haven't created massive labor force
 

4757
01:41:37,139 --> 01:41:39,500
and haven't created massive labor force
displacement therefore AI want it slow

4758
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:39,510
displacement therefore AI want it slow
 

4759
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,450
displacement therefore AI want it slow
so there's a serious concern for you oh

4760
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:41,460
so there's a serious concern for you oh
 

4761
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:43,850
so there's a serious concern for you oh
yeah Andrew yang is running on it yeah

4762
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:43,860
yeah Andrew yang is running on it yeah
 

4763
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:46,399
yeah Andrew yang is running on it yeah
it's it's it's I'm desperately concerned

4764
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:46,409
it's it's it's I'm desperately concerned
 

4765
01:41:46,409 --> 01:41:50,989
it's it's it's I'm desperately concerned
and you see already that the changing

4766
01:41:50,989 --> 01:41:50,999
and you see already that the changing
 

4767
01:41:50,999 --> 01:41:54,500
and you see already that the changing
workplace has lived to a hollowing out

4768
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:54,510
workplace has lived to a hollowing out
 

4769
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:56,479
workplace has lived to a hollowing out
of the middle class you're seeing that

4770
01:41:56,479 --> 01:41:56,489
of the middle class you're seeing that
 

4771
01:41:56,489 --> 01:41:59,209
of the middle class you're seeing that
students coming out of school today have

4772
01:41:59,209 --> 01:41:59,219
students coming out of school today have
 

4773
01:41:59,219 --> 01:42:02,899
students coming out of school today have
a less rosy financial future ahead of

4774
01:42:02,899 --> 01:42:02,909
a less rosy financial future ahead of
 

4775
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:04,729
a less rosy financial future ahead of
them and the parents did which has never

4776
01:42:04,729 --> 01:42:04,739
them and the parents did which has never
 

4777
01:42:04,739 --> 01:42:07,459
them and the parents did which has never
happened in recent in the last few

4778
01:42:07,459 --> 01:42:07,469
happened in recent in the last few
 

4779
01:42:07,469 --> 01:42:09,709
happened in recent in the last few
hundred years you know we've always had

4780
01:42:09,709 --> 01:42:09,719
hundred years you know we've always had
 

4781
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:12,709
hundred years you know we've always had
progress before and you see this turning

4782
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:12,719
progress before and you see this turning
 

4783
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:18,439
progress before and you see this turning
into anxiety and despair and and even

4784
01:42:18,439 --> 01:42:18,449
into anxiety and despair and and even
 

4785
01:42:18,449 --> 01:42:23,800
into anxiety and despair and and even
violence so I very much worry about that

4786
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:23,810

 

4787
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:26,320

quite a bit about ethics too I do think

4788
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:26,330
quite a bit about ethics too I do think
 

4789
01:42:26,330 --> 01:42:31,020
quite a bit about ethics too I do think
that every data scientist working with

4790
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:31,030
that every data scientist working with
 

4791
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:34,030
that every data scientist working with
deep learning needs to recognize they

4792
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:34,040
deep learning needs to recognize they
 

4793
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:35,500
deep learning needs to recognize they
have an incredibly high leverage tool

4794
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:35,510
have an incredibly high leverage tool
 

4795
01:42:35,510 --> 01:42:37,330
have an incredibly high leverage tool
that they're using that can influence

4796
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:37,340
that they're using that can influence
 

4797
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:39,370
that they're using that can influence
society in lots of ways and if they're

4798
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:39,380
society in lots of ways and if they're
 

4799
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:41,200
society in lots of ways and if they're
doing research that that research is

4800
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:41,210
doing research that that research is
 

4801
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:43,090
doing research that that research is
going to be used by people doing this

4802
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:43,100
going to be used by people doing this
 

4803
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:45,130
going to be used by people doing this
kind of work and they have a

4804
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:45,140
kind of work and they have a
 

4805
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:47,590
kind of work and they have a
responsibility to consider the

4806
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:47,600
responsibility to consider the
 

4807
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,330
responsibility to consider the
consequences and to think about things

4808
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:49,340
consequences and to think about things
 

4809
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:53,740
consequences and to think about things
like how will humans be in the loop here

4810
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:53,750
like how will humans be in the loop here
 

4811
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:55,810
like how will humans be in the loop here
how do we avoid runaway feedback loops

4812
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:55,820
how do we avoid runaway feedback loops
 

4813
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:58,480
how do we avoid runaway feedback loops
how do we ensure an appeals process for

4814
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:58,490
how do we ensure an appeals process for
 

4815
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:01,120
how do we ensure an appeals process for
humans that are impacted by my algorithm

4816
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,130
humans that are impacted by my algorithm
 

4817
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:04,150
humans that are impacted by my algorithm
how do I ensure that the constraints of
