fundamental level right so understanding
 

179
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,520
fundamental level right so understanding
the universe at all levels is part of

there's this step from the fundamentals

you're thinking of the universe it's a

you're thinking of the universe it's a

you're thinking of the universe it's a
closed system I am so what makes a

computing machine is that there's a

272
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,080
computing machine is that there's a

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,770
computing machine is that there's a
human that everyone comes up to it and

human that everyone comes up to it and

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,540
human that everyone comes up to it and
moves the mouse around yeah so input

276
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:19,550
moves the mouse around yeah so input
 

277
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,000
moves the mouse around yeah so input
gives it input gives it input and your

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,010
gives it input gives it input and your
 

279
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,300
gives it input gives it input and your
and that's why you're saying is just a

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,310
and that's why you're saying is just a
 

281
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,550
and that's why you're saying is just a
computation a deterministic thing that's

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:27,560
computation a deterministic thing that's
 

283
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,250
computation a deterministic thing that's
just unrolling but the immense

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:30,260
just unrolling but the immense

processing there's a state and then it

288
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:36,590
processing there's a state and then it
 

289
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,969
processing there's a state and then it
changes with good rule with rules and

290
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:39,979
changes with good rule with rules and
 

291
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,860
changes with good rule with rules and
there's a sense for a lot of people that

292
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:41,870
there's a sense for a lot of people that
 

293
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,950
there's a sense for a lot of people that
if the brain operates the human brain

294
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
if the brain operates the human brain
 

295
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,750
if the brain operates the human brain
operates within that world then it's

296
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:46,760
operates within that world then it's
 

297
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,420
operates within that world then it's
simply just a small subset of that and

298
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,430
simply just a small subset of that and
 

299
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,110
simply just a small subset of that and
so there's no reason we can't build

300
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,120
so there's no reason we can't build
 

301
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,350
so there's no reason we can't build
arbitrarily great intelligences yeah do

302
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,360
arbitrarily great intelligences yeah do
 

303
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,390
arbitrarily great intelligences yeah do
you think of intelligence in this way

304
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
you think of intelligence in this way
 

305
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,980
you think of intelligence in this way
intelligence is tricky I don't have a

00:05:59,980 --> 00:05:59,990
intelligence is tricky I don't have a
 

307
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,560
intelligence is tricky I don't have a
definition of it offhand so I remember

308
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,570
definition of it offhand so I remember
 

309
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,200
definition of it offhand so I remember
this panel discussion that I saw on

this panel discussion that I saw on
 

311
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,730
this panel discussion that I saw on
YouTube I wasn't there but Seth Lloyd

313
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,440
YouTube I wasn't there but Seth Lloyd
was on the panel and so was Martin Rees

314
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,450
was on the panel and so was Martin Rees
 

315
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,290
was on the panel and so was Martin Rees
the famous astrophysicist and Seth gave

316
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:11,300
the famous astrophysicist and Seth gave
 

317
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,060
the famous astrophysicist and Seth gave
his shtick for why the universe is a

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,070
his shtick for why the universe is a
 

319
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,460
his shtick for why the universe is a
computer and explained this and and and

320
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,470
computer and explained this and and and
 

321
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,280
computer and explained this and and and
Martin we said so what is not a computer

322
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,290
Martin we said so what is not a computer
 

323
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,240
Martin we said so what is not a computer
that's a good question I'm not sure

324
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,250
that's a good question I'm not sure

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,719
basically right yeah so in cube it's

382
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:26,599
fields and the particles in that region
 

383
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:29,920
fields and the particles in that region
can arrange themselves that that number

384
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:29,930
can arrange themselves that that number
 

385
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,629
can arrange themselves that that number
of degrees of freedom in a region of

00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:31,639
of degrees of freedom in a region of
 

387
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,150
of degrees of freedom in a region of
space is arguably finite we actually

388
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
space is arguably finite we actually
 

389
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,670
space is arguably finite we actually
don't know how many there are but

390
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:36,680
don't know how many there are but
 

391
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,930
don't know how many there are but
there's a very good argument it says

392
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:37,940
there's a very good argument it says
 

393
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,810
there's a very good argument it says
it's a finite number so as the universe

394
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:40,820
it's a finite number so as the universe
 

395
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,920
it's a finite number so as the universe
expands and space gets bigger

396
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:43,930
expands and space gets bigger
 

397
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,839
expands and space gets bigger
are there more degrees of freedom if

398
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:46,849
are there more degrees of freedom if
 

399
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:47,920
are there more degrees of freedom if
it's an infinite number it doesn't

400
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:47,930
it's an infinite number it doesn't
 

401
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,390
it's an infinite number it doesn't
really matter infinity times two is

402
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,400
really matter infinity times two is
 

403
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,770
really matter infinity times two is
still infinity but if it's a finite

404
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:50,780
still infinity but if it's a finite
 

405
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,500
still infinity but if it's a finite
number then there's more space so

406
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:53,510
number then there's more space so
 

407
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,730
number then there's more space so
there's more degrees of freedom so where

408
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:54,740
there's more degrees of freedom so where
 

409
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,469
there's more degrees of freedom so where
did they come from that would mean the

410
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
did they come from that would mean the
 

411
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,149
did they come from that would mean the
universe is not a closed system there's

412
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:58,159
universe is not a closed system there's
 

413
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,040
universe is not a closed system there's
more degrees of freedom popping into

414
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,050
more degrees of freedom popping into
 

415
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,550
more degrees of freedom popping into
existence so what we suggested was that

416
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:03,560
existence so what we suggested was that
 

417
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,409
existence so what we suggested was that
there are more degrees of freedom and

418
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:05,419
there are more degrees of freedom and
 

419
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,300
there are more degrees of freedom and
it's not that they're not there to start

420
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,310
it's not that they're not there to start
 

421
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,990
it's not that they're not there to start
but they're not entangled to start so

422
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,000
but they're not entangled to start so
 

423
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,909
but they're not entangled to start so
the universe that you and I know of zien

424
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:12,919
the universe that you and I know of zien
 

425
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,260
the universe that you and I know of zien
over the three dimensions around us that

426
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,270
over the three dimensions around us that
 

427
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,140
over the three dimensions around us that
we see we said those are the entangled

428
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,150
we see we said those are the entangled
 

429
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,089
we see we said those are the entangled
degrees of freedom making up space-time

430
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:19,099
degrees of freedom making up space-time
 

431
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,129
degrees of freedom making up space-time
and as the universe expands there's a

432
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:21,139
and as the universe expands there's a
 

433
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,560
and as the universe expands there's a
whole bunch of qubits in their in their

434
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:23,570
whole bunch of qubits in their in their
 

435
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,010
whole bunch of qubits in their in their
zero State that become entangled with

436
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,020
zero State that become entangled with
 

437
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,360
zero State that become entangled with
the rest of space-time through the

438
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,370
the rest of space-time through the
 

439
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,839
the rest of space-time through the
action of these quantum circuits so what

440
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:31,849
action of these quantum circuits so what
 

441
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:34,800
action of these quantum circuits so what
does it mean that there's now more

442
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:34,810
does it mean that there's now more
 

443
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,769
does it mean that there's now more
degrees of freedom as they become more

444
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:38,779
degrees of freedom as they become more
 

445
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,199
degrees of freedom as they become more
integral yeah so this is the universe

446
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:41,209
integral yeah so this is the universe
 

447
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,459
integral yeah so this is the universe
expands that's right so there's more and

448
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:42,469
expands that's right so there's more and
 

449
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:43,420
expands that's right so there's more and
more degrees of freedom they're

450
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:43,430
more degrees of freedom they're
 

451
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,860
more degrees of freedom they're
entangled that are

452
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:44,870
entangled that are
 

453
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,410
entangled that are
playing part playing the role a part of

454
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,420
playing part playing the role a part of
 

455
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,690
playing part playing the role a part of
the entangled space-time structure so

456
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:49,700
the entangled space-time structure so
 

457
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,820
the entangled space-time structure so
the basic the underlying philosophy is

458
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:51,830
the basic the underlying philosophy is
 

459
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,010
the basic the underlying philosophy is
that space-time itself arises from the

460
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,020
that space-time itself arises from the
 

461
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,570
that space-time itself arises from the
entanglement of some fundamental quantum

462
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:55,580
entanglement of some fundamental quantum
 

463
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,130
entanglement of some fundamental quantum
degrees of freedom Wow okay so at which

464
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,140
degrees of freedom Wow okay so at which
 

465
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,269
degrees of freedom Wow okay so at which
point is most of the the the

466
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:04,279
point is most of the the the
 

467
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,710
point is most of the the the
entanglement happening are we talking

468
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:05,720
entanglement happening are we talking
 

469
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,630
entanglement happening are we talking
about close to the bing bang are we

470
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:07,640
about close to the bing bang are we
 

471
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,990
about close to the bing bang are we
talking about throughout the the time

472
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,000
talking about throughout the the time
 

473
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,900
talking about throughout the the time
right yeah so the idea is that at the

474
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:13,910
right yeah so the idea is that at the
 

475
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,490
right yeah so the idea is that at the
Big Bang

476
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:14,500
Big Bang
 

477
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,720
Big Bang
almost all the degrees of freedom that

478
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,730
almost all the degrees of freedom that
 

479
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,780
almost all the degrees of freedom that
the universe could have were there but

480
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:19,790
the universe could have were there but
 

481
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,700
the universe could have were there but
they were unentangled with anything else

482
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:21,710
they were unentangled with anything else
 

483
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,890
they were unentangled with anything else

and that's a reflection of the fact that
the Big Bang had a low entropy it was

the Big Bang had a low entropy it was

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,390
the Big Bang had a low entropy it was

Carroll what do you think of the thought

496
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,310

experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're

498
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:39,500
experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're
 

499
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,000
experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're
living in a simulation so I think let me

500
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,010
living in a simulation so I think let me
 

501
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,740
living in a simulation so I think let me
contextualize that a little bit more I

502
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:44,750
contextualize that a little bit more I
 

503
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,510
contextualize that a little bit more I
think people don't actually take this

504
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:46,520
think people don't actually take this
 

505
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,970
think people don't actually take this
thought experiments I think it's quite

506
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:48,980
thought experiments I think it's quite
 

507
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,490
thought experiments I think it's quite
interesting it's not very useful but

508
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:51,500
interesting it's not very useful but
 

509
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,140
interesting it's not very useful but
it's quite interesting from the

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,150
it's quite interesting from the
 

511
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,240
it's quite interesting from the
perspective of AI a lot of the learning

00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,250
perspective of AI a lot of the learning

that can be done usually happens in

00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,040
that can be done usually happens in

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,030
that can be done usually happens in
simulation from artificial examples and

516
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
simulation from artificial examples and
 

517
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,110
simulation from artificial examples and
so it's a constructive question to ask

518
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,120
so it's a constructive question to ask
 

519
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,480
so it's a constructive question to ask
how difficult is our real world to

520
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:07,490
how difficult is our real world to
 

521
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,390
how difficult is our real world to
simulate right which is kind of a dual

522
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:10,400
simulate right which is kind of a dual

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,780
simulate right which is kind of a dual
part of for living in a simulation and

524
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:13,790
part of for living in a simulation and
 

525
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,030
part of for living in a simulation and
somebody built that simulation now how

526
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,040
somebody built that simulation now how
 

527
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,949
somebody built that simulation now how
if you were to try to do it yourself how

528
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:17,959
if you were to try to do it yourself how
 

529
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,170
if you were to try to do it yourself how
hard would it be so obviously we could

530
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,180
hard would it be so obviously we could
 

531
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,550
hard would it be so obviously we could
be living a simulation if you just want

532
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:21,560
be living a simulation if you just want
 

533
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,500
be living a simulation if you just want
the physical possibility then I

534
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,510
the physical possibility then I
 

535
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,940
the physical possibility then I
completely agree that it's physically

536
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:24,950
completely agree that it's physically
 

537
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,170
completely agree that it's physically
possible I don't think that we actually

538
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:26,180
possible I don't think that we actually
 

539
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,710
possible I don't think that we actually
are so take this one piece of data into

540
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:29,720
are so take this one piece of data into
 

541
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,290
are so take this one piece of data into
consideration you know we we live in a

542
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:32,300
consideration you know we we live in a
 

543
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,579
consideration you know we we live in a
big universe okay there's two trillion

544
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:36,589
big universe okay there's two trillion
 

545
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:38,620
big universe okay there's two trillion
galaxies in our observable universe with

546
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:38,630
galaxies in our observable universe with
 

547
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,710
galaxies in our observable universe with
200 billion stars in each galaxy etc it

548
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:41,720
200 billion stars in each galaxy etc it
 

549
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,010
200 billion stars in each galaxy etc it
would seem to be a waste of resources to

550
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,020
would seem to be a waste of resources to
 

551
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,690
would seem to be a waste of resources to
have a universe that big going on just

552
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:46,700
have a universe that big going on just
 

553
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,280
have a universe that big going on just
to do a simulation so in other words I

554
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,290
to do a simulation so in other words I
 

555
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,620
to do a simulation so in other words I
want to be a good Bayesian I want to ask

556
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,630
want to be a good Bayesian I want to ask
 

557
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,460
want to be a good Bayesian I want to ask
under this hypothesis what do I expect

558
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:53,470
under this hypothesis what do I expect
 

559
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,930
under this hypothesis what do I expect
to see so the first thing I would say is

560
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:55,940
to see so the first thing I would say is
 

561
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,670
to see so the first thing I would say is
I wouldn't expect to see a universe that

562
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
I wouldn't expect to see a universe that
 

563
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,240
I wouldn't expect to see a universe that
was that big

564
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,250
was that big
 

565
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,570
was that big
okay the second thing is I wouldn't

566
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:01,580
okay the second thing is I wouldn't
 

567
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,430
okay the second thing is I wouldn't
expect the resolution of the universe to

568
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
expect the resolution of the universe to
 

569
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,560
expect the resolution of the universe to
be as good as it is so it's always

570
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:05,570
be as good as it is so it's always
 

571
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,540
be as good as it is so it's always
possible that if they're superhuman

572
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:07,550
possible that if they're superhuman
 

573
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,340
possible that if they're superhuman
simulators only have finite resources

574
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:09,350
simulators only have finite resources
 

575
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,200
simulators only have finite resources
that they don't render the entire

576
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,210
that they don't render the entire
 

577
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,240
that they don't render the entire
universe right that that the part that

578
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,250
universe right that that the part that
 

579
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,700
universe right that that the part that
is out there that two trillion galaxies

580
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:15,710
is out there that two trillion galaxies
 

581
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,610
is out there that two trillion galaxies
isn't actually being simulated fully

582
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:18,620
isn't actually being simulated fully
 

583
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,180
isn't actually being simulated fully
okay but then the obvious extrapolation

584
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,190
okay but then the obvious extrapolation
 

585
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,340
okay but then the obvious extrapolation
of that is that only I am being

586
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,350
of that is that only I am being
 

587
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,440
of that is that only I am being
simulated fully like the rest of you are

588
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,450
simulated fully like the rest of you are
 

589
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,450
simulated fully like the rest of you are
just part not non-player characters

590
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:28,460
just part not non-player characters
 

591
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,370
just part not non-player characters
right I'm the only thing that is real

592
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:30,380
right I'm the only thing that is real
 

593
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,040
right I'm the only thing that is real
the rest of you are just chatbots

594
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,050
the rest of you are just chatbots

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,420
the rest of you are just chatbots
beyond this wall I see the wall but

596
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,430
beyond this wall I see the wall but
 

597
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,370
beyond this wall I see the wall but
there is literally nothing on the other

598
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:36,380
there is literally nothing on the other
 

599
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,320
there is literally nothing on the other
side of the wall that is sort of the

600
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,330
side of the wall that is sort of the

Bayesian prediction that's what it would

602
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:39,830
Bayesian prediction that's what it would
 

603
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,530
Bayesian prediction that's what it would
be like to do an efficient simulation of

604
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:41,540
be like to do an efficient simulation of
 

605
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,890
be like to do an efficient simulation of
me

606
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:41,900
me
 

607
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,220
me
so like none of that seems quite

608
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,230
so like none of that seems quite
 

609
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,790
so like none of that seems quite
realistic there's that I don't see I

610
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:47,800
realistic there's that I don't see I
 

611
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,140
realistic there's that I don't see I
hear the argument that it's just

612
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,150
hear the argument that it's just
 

613
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,450
hear the argument that it's just
possible and easy to simulate lots of

614
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:52,460
possible and easy to simulate lots of
 

615
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,060
possible and easy to simulate lots of
things I don't see any evidence from

616
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,070
things I don't see any evidence from
 

617
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,550
things I don't see any evidence from
what we know about our universe that we

618
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:57,560
what we know about our universe that we
 

619
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,740
what we know about our universe that we
look like a simulated universe now maybe

620
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,750
look like a simulated universe now maybe
 

621
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,000
look like a simulated universe now maybe
you could say well we don't know what it

622
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,010
you could say well we don't know what it
 

623
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,320
you could say well we don't know what it
would look like but that's just

624
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,330
would look like but that's just
 

625
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,610
would look like but that's just
abandoning your Bayesian

626
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:03,620
abandoning your Bayesian
 

627
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,740
abandoning your Bayesian
responsibilities like your your job is

628
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:05,750
responsibilities like your your job is
 

629
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,200
responsibilities like your your job is
to say under this theory here's what you

630
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,210
to say under this theory here's what you
 

631
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,690
to say under this theory here's what you
would expect to see yes certainly if you

632
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:10,700
would expect to see yes certainly if you
 

633
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,000
would expect to see yes certainly if you
think about simulation is a thing that's

634
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,010
think about simulation is a thing that's
 

635
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,300
think about simulation is a thing that's
like a video game where only a small

636
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,310
like a video game where only a small
 

637
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,840
like a video game where only a small
subset is being rendered but say the

638
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:19,850
subset is being rendered but say the
 

639
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,050
subset is being rendered but say the
entire all of the laws of physics it the

640
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,060
entire all of the laws of physics it the
 

641
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,760
entire all of the laws of physics it the
entire closed system of the

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:24,770
entire closed system of the
 

643
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,860
entire closed system of the
quote-unquote universe mm-hmm it had a

644
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:26,870
quote-unquote universe mm-hmm it had a
 

645
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,380
quote-unquote universe mm-hmm it had a
creator yeah it's always possible all

646
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:29,390
creator yeah it's always possible all
 

647
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,900
creator yeah it's always possible all
right so that's not useful to think

648
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:31,910
right so that's not useful to think
 

649
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,370
right so that's not useful to think
about when you're thinking about physics

650
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:33,380
about when you're thinking about physics
 

651
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,150
about when you're thinking about physics
the way Nick Bostrom phrases it if is if

652
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,160
the way Nick Bostrom phrases it if is if
 

653
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,980
the way Nick Bostrom phrases it if is if
it's possible to simulate a universe

654
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:38,990
it's possible to simulate a universe
 

655
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,030
it's possible to simulate a universe
eventually we'll do it right you could

656
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
eventually we'll do it right you could
 

657
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,740
eventually we'll do it right you could
use that by the way for a lot of things

658
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:44,750
use that by the way for a lot of things
 

659
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,980
use that by the way for a lot of things
well yeah but I guess the question is

660
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:47,990
well yeah but I guess the question is
 

661
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,910
well yeah but I guess the question is
how hard is it to create a universe I

662
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
how hard is it to create a universe I
 

663
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
how hard is it to create a universe I
wrote a little blog post about this and

664
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:53,930
wrote a little blog post about this and
 

665
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,600
wrote a little blog post about this and
maybe maybe I'm missing something but

666
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:55,610
maybe maybe I'm missing something but
 

667
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,370
maybe maybe I'm missing something but
there's an argument that says not only

668
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,380
there's an argument that says not only
 

669
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,380
there's an argument that says not only
that it might be possible to simulate a

670
00:12:59,380 --> 00:12:59,390
that it might be possible to simulate a
 

671
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,120
that it might be possible to simulate a
universe but probably if you imagine

672
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,130
universe but probably if you imagine
 

673
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,860
universe but probably if you imagine
that you actually attribute

674
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:05,870
that you actually attribute
 

675
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,410
that you actually attribute
consciousness and agency to the little

676
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:08,420
consciousness and agency to the little
 

677
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,090
consciousness and agency to the little
things that we're simulating to our

678
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,100
things that we're simulating to our
 

679
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,800
things that we're simulating to our
little artificial beings

680
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:11,810
little artificial beings
 

681
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,449
little artificial beings
there's probably a lot more of them than

682
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:13,459
there's probably a lot more of them than
 

683
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,160
there's probably a lot more of them than
there are ordinary organic beings in the

684
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,170
there are ordinary organic beings in the
 

685
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,449
there are ordinary organic beings in the
universe or there will be in the future

686
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:16,459
universe or there will be in the future
 

687
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:18,249
universe or there will be in the future
right so there's an argument that not

688
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:18,259
right so there's an argument that not
 

689
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:20,860
right so there's an argument that not
only is being a simulation possible it's

690
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:20,870
only is being a simulation possible it's
 

691
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,800
only is being a simulation possible it's
probable because in the space of all

692
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:23,810
probable because in the space of all
 

693
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,600
probable because in the space of all
living consciousness is most of them are

694
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,610
living consciousness is most of them are
 

695
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,100
living consciousness is most of them are
being simulated right most of them are

696
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,110
being simulated right most of them are
 

697
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,259
being simulated right most of them are
not at the top level I think that

698
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:29,269
not at the top level I think that
 

699
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:30,999
not at the top level I think that
argument must be wrong because it

700
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:31,009
argument must be wrong because it
 

701
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,949
argument must be wrong because it
follows from that argument that you know

702
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
follows from that argument that you know
 

703
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,569
follows from that argument that you know
if we're simulated but we can also

704
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:34,579
if we're simulated but we can also
 

705
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:37,749
if we're simulated but we can also
simulate other things well but if we can

706
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:37,759
simulate other things well but if we can
 

707
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,460
simulate other things well but if we can
simulate other things they can simulate

708
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:39,470
simulate other things they can simulate
 

709
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,650
simulate other things they can simulate
other things right

710
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:41,660
other things right
 

711
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,999
other things right
if we give them enough power and

712
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:43,009
if we give them enough power and
 

713
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:45,610
if we give them enough power and
resolution and ultimately we'll reach a

714
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:45,620
resolution and ultimately we'll reach a
 

715
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,960
resolution and ultimately we'll reach a
bottom because the laws of physics in

716
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:46,970
bottom because the laws of physics in
 

717
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,660
bottom because the laws of physics in
our universe have a bottom or made of

718
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,670
our universe have a bottom or made of
 

719
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,679
our universe have a bottom or made of
atoms and so forth

720
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:50,689
atoms and so forth
 

721
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:52,949
atoms and so forth
so there will be the cheapest possible

722
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
so there will be the cheapest possible
 

723
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,079
so there will be the cheapest possible
simulations and if you believe the

724
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:56,089
simulations and if you believe the
 

725
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:58,150
simulations and if you believe the
original argument you should conclude

726
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
original argument you should conclude
 

727
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,860
original argument you should conclude
that we should be in the cheapest

728
00:13:59,860 --> 00:13:59,870
that we should be in the cheapest
 

729
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,269
that we should be in the cheapest
possible simulation because that's where

730
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
possible simulation because that's where
 

731
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,369
possible simulation because that's where
most people are but we don't look like

732
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:03,379
most people are but we don't look like
 

733
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:04,869
most people are but we don't look like
that doesn't look at all like we're at

734
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:04,879
that doesn't look at all like we're at
 

735
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,999
that doesn't look at all like we're at
the edge of resolution you know there

736
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:07,009
the edge of resolution you know there
 

737
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,030
the edge of resolution you know there
were 16-bit you know things but it's it

738
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,040
were 16-bit you know things but it's it
 

739
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,160
were 16-bit you know things but it's it
seems much easier to make much lower

740
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,170
seems much easier to make much lower
 

741
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,829
seems much easier to make much lower
level things that then we are so and

742
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839
level things that then we are so and
 

743
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,069
level things that then we are so and
also I questioned the whole approach to

744
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
also I questioned the whole approach to
 

745
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,019
also I questioned the whole approach to
the anthropic principle that says we are

746
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:20,029
the anthropic principle that says we are
 

747
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:22,360
the anthropic principle that says we are
typical observers in the universe I

748
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,370
typical observers in the universe I
 

749
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,889
typical observers in the universe I
think that that's not actually I think

750
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:23,899
think that that's not actually I think
 

751
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:26,710
think that that's not actually I think
that there's a lot of selection that we

752
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
that there's a lot of selection that we
 

753
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,410
that there's a lot of selection that we
can do that we're typically in things we

754
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:29,420
can do that we're typically in things we
 

755
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,179
can do that we're typically in things we
already know but not typical within all

756
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:31,189
already know but not typical within all
 

757
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:33,699
already know but not typical within all
the universe so do you think there's

758
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:33,709
the universe so do you think there's
 

759
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,549
the universe so do you think there's
intelligent life however you would like

760
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:36,559
intelligent life however you would like
 

761
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,590
intelligent life however you would like
to define intelligent life out there in

762
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:38,600
to define intelligent life out there in
 

763
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,210
to define intelligent life out there in
the universe my guess is that there is

764
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,220
the universe my guess is that there is
 

765
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,369
the universe my guess is that there is
not intelligent life in the observable

766
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:45,379
not intelligent life in the observable
 

767
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:48,970
not intelligent life in the observable
universe other than us simply on the

768
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:48,980
universe other than us simply on the
 

769
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,910
universe other than us simply on the
basis of the the fact that the likely

770
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
basis of the the fact that the likely
 

771
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,009
basis of the the fact that the likely
number of other intelligent species in

772
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:54,019
number of other intelligent species in
 

773
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,679
number of other intelligent species in
the observable universe there's two

774
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:56,689
the observable universe there's two
 

775
00:14:56,689 --> 00:15:01,720
the observable universe there's two
likely numbers zero or billions and if

776
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:01,730
likely numbers zero or billions and if
 

777
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,829
likely numbers zero or billions and if
there had been billions we would have

778
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:02,839
there had been billions we would have
 

779
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,860
there had been billions we would have
noticed already - for there to be

780
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:05,870
noticed already - for there to be
 

781
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,629
noticed already - for there to be
literally like a small number like you

782
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:07,639
literally like a small number like you
 

783
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,239
literally like a small number like you
know Star Trek there's you know a dozen

784
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:10,249
know Star Trek there's you know a dozen
 

785
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:12,610
know Star Trek there's you know a dozen
intelligent civilizations in our galaxy

786
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:12,620
intelligent civilizations in our galaxy
 

787
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,780
intelligent civilizations in our galaxy
but not a billion that that's weird that

788
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:16,790
but not a billion that that's weird that
 

789
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,879
but not a billion that that's weird that
that's sort of bizarre to me it's easy

790
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:18,889
that's sort of bizarre to me it's easy
 

791
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:20,079
that's sort of bizarre to me it's easy
for me to imagine that there are zero

792
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,089
for me to imagine that there are zero
 

793
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:21,819
for me to imagine that there are zero
others because there's just a big

794
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:21,829
others because there's just a big
 

795
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:24,579
others because there's just a big
bottleneck to making multicellular life

796
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:24,589
bottleneck to making multicellular life
 

797
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:25,540
bottleneck to making multicellular life
or

798
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:25,550
or
 

799
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,820
or
logical life or whatever it's very hard

800
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:27,830
logical life or whatever it's very hard
 

801
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,990
logical life or whatever it's very hard
for me to imagine that there's a whole

802
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,000
for me to imagine that there's a whole
 

803
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,910
for me to imagine that there's a whole
bunch out there that have somehow

804
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:30,920
bunch out there that have somehow
 

805
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,060
bunch out there that have somehow
remained hidden from us the question I'd

806
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,070
remained hidden from us the question I'd
 

807
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,530
remained hidden from us the question I'd
like to ask is what would intelligent

808
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:35,540
like to ask is what would intelligent
 

809
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,040
like to ask is what would intelligent
life look like the what I mean by that

810
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,050
life look like the what I mean by that
 

811
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,350
life look like the what I mean by that
question in a war that's going is what

812
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
question in a war that's going is what
 

813
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,560
question in a war that's going is what
if intelligent life is just fundamental

814
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:44,570
if intelligent life is just fundamental
 

815
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,500
if intelligent life is just fundamental
it's in some very big ways different

816
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,510
it's in some very big ways different
 

817
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,579
it's in some very big ways different
than our the one that has on earth that

818
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:51,589
than our the one that has on earth that
 

819
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,319
than our the one that has on earth that
there's all kinds of intelligent life

820
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:53,329
there's all kinds of intelligent life
 

821
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,480
there's all kinds of intelligent life
that operates in different scales of

822
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,490
that operates in different scales of
 

823
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,850
that operates in different scales of
both size and temporal right that's a

824
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:57,860
both size and temporal right that's a
 

825
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,740
both size and temporal right that's a
great possibility because I think we

826
00:15:59,740 --> 00:15:59,750
great possibility because I think we
 

827
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,720
great possibility because I think we
should be humble about what intelligence

828
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:01,730
should be humble about what intelligence
 

829
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,280
should be humble about what intelligence
is what life is we don't even agree on

830
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,290
is what life is we don't even agree on
 

831
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,050
is what life is we don't even agree on
what life is much less what intelligent

832
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:05,060
what life is much less what intelligent
 

833
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,199
what life is much less what intelligent
life is right so that that's an argument

834
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:08,209
life is right so that that's an argument
 

835
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,579
life is right so that that's an argument
for humility saying there could be

836
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:09,589
for humility saying there could be
 

837
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:11,980
for humility saying there could be
intelligent life of a very different

838
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:11,990
intelligent life of a very different
 

839
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,230
intelligent life of a very different
character right like you could imagine

840
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
character right like you could imagine
 

841
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,600
character right like you could imagine
that dolphins are intelligent but never

842
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:18,610
that dolphins are intelligent but never
 

843
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,949
that dolphins are intelligent but never
invent space travel because they live in

844
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
invent space travel because they live in
 

845
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,480
invent space travel because they live in
the ocean and they don't have thumbs

846
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,490
the ocean and they don't have thumbs
 

847
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,300
the ocean and they don't have thumbs
right so they never invent technology

848
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,310
right so they never invent technology
 

849
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,470
right so they never invent technology
you never events melting maybe the

850
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:29,480
you never events melting maybe the
 

851
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,420
you never events melting maybe the
universe is full of intelligent species

852
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:31,430
universe is full of intelligent species
 

853
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,790
universe is full of intelligent species
that just don't make technology right

854
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:33,800
that just don't make technology right
 

855
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,650
that just don't make technology right
that that's compatible with the data I

856
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:35,660
that that's compatible with the data I
 

857
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,949
that that's compatible with the data I
think and and I think maybe maybe what

858
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
think and and I think maybe maybe what
 

859
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,069
think and and I think maybe maybe what
you're pointing at is even more out

860
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
you're pointing at is even more out
 

861
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,900
you're pointing at is even more out
there versions of intelligence you know

100 million years on the one hand yes we
 

873
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,350
100 million years on the one hand yes we
should be very open-minded about those

lifetime it's not impossible to me that
 

897
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,820
lifetime it's not impossible to me that
there's a sweet spot for intelligent

898
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:30,830
there's a sweet spot for intelligent
 

899
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,710
there's a sweet spot for intelligent
life that we find ourselves in so I'm

900
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
life that we find ourselves in so I'm
 

901
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,909
life that we find ourselves in so I'm
hoping mine didn't either way I won't

902
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
hoping mine didn't either way I won't
 

903
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,560
hoping mine didn't either way I won't
mind either being humble and there's all

904
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:35,570
mind either being humble and there's all
 

905
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,810
mind either being humble and there's all
sorts of different kinds of life or no

906
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:37,820
sorts of different kinds of life or no
 

907
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,070
sorts of different kinds of life or no
there's a reason we just don't know it

908
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,080
there's a reason we just don't know it
 

909
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,960
there's a reason we just don't know it
yet why life like ours is the kind of

910
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:40,970
yet why life like ours is the kind of
 

911
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,549
yet why life like ours is the kind of
life that's out there yeah I'm of two

912
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
life that's out there yeah I'm of two
 

913
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,580
life that's out there yeah I'm of two
minds too but I often wonder if our

914
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:45,590
minds too but I often wonder if our
 

915
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,120
minds too but I often wonder if our
brains is just designed to quite

916
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,130
brains is just designed to quite
 

917
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,389
brains is just designed to quite
obviously to operate and see the world

918
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:52,399
obviously to operate and see the world
 

919
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:54,880
obviously to operate and see the world
in the unnies timescales and we're

920
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:54,890
in the unnies timescales and we're
 

921
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,460
in the unnies timescales and we're
almost blind and and the tools we've

922
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:57,470
almost blind and and the tools we've
 

923
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,430
almost blind and and the tools we've
created for detecting things are blind

924
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:00,440
created for detecting things are blind
 

925
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,710
created for detecting things are blind
yeah to the kind of observation needed

926
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
yeah to the kind of observation needed
 

927
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,330
yeah to the kind of observation needed
to see intelligent life or other skills

928
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:04,340
to see intelligent life or other skills
 

929
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,840
to see intelligent life or other skills
well I'm totally open to that but so

930
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:07,850
well I'm totally open to that but so
 

931
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,100
well I'm totally open to that but so
here's another argument I would make you

932
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,110
here's another argument I would make you
 

933
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,169
here's another argument I would make you
know we have looked for intelligent life

934
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:11,179
know we have looked for intelligent life
 

935
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:12,850
know we have looked for intelligent life
but we've looked at for it in the

936
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:12,860
but we've looked at for it in the
 

937
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,769
but we've looked at for it in the
dumbest way we can rise by turning radio

938
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:14,779
dumbest way we can rise by turning radio
 

939
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:18,100
dumbest way we can rise by turning radio
telescopes to the sky and why in the

940
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,110
telescopes to the sky and why in the
 

941
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,810
telescopes to the sky and why in the
world would a super advanced

942
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:19,820
world would a super advanced
 

943
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,840
world would a super advanced
civilization randomly beam out radio

944
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:22,850
civilization randomly beam out radio
 

945
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,340
civilization randomly beam out radio

especially because in order to think
 

953
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,730
especially because in order to think
that you would actually contact another

00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:36,310
forever you have to keep doing it for
millions of years that sounds like a

960
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,320
millions of years that sounds like a
 

961
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,600
millions of years that sounds like a
waste of resources if you thought that

962
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:39,610
waste of resources if you thought that
 

963
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,269
waste of resources if you thought that
there were other solar systems with

964
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:43,279
there were other solar systems with
 

965
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,279
there were other solar systems with
planets around them where maybe

966
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:45,289
planets around them where maybe
 

967
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:47,080
planets around them where maybe
intelligent life didn't yet exist but

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,090
intelligent life didn't yet exist but

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,230
intelligent life didn't yet exist but
might someday you wouldn't try to talk

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:51,860
to it with radio waves she would send a
 

973
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,279
to it with radio waves she would send a
spacecraft out there and you would park

974
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:54,289
spacecraft out there and you would park
 

975
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:56,110
spacecraft out there and you would park
it around there and it would be like

976
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,120
it around there and it would be like
 

977
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,509
it around there and it would be like
from our point of view be like 2001 or

from our point of view be like 2001 or

there's an you know an monolith monolith
 

981
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,500
there's an you know an monolith monolith
so there could be an artifact in fact

982
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:02,510
so there could be an artifact in fact
 

983
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,600
so there could be an artifact in fact
the other way works also right there

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,610
the other way works also right there
 

985
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,169
the other way works also right there
could be artifacts in our solar system

986
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:07,179
could be artifacts in our solar system
 

987
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,720
could be artifacts in our solar system
that are have been put there by other

technologically advanced civilizations
and that's how we will eventually

992
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:13,309
and that's how we will eventually
 

993
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,279
and that's how we will eventually
contact them and we have just haven't

994
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:15,289
contact them and we have just haven't
 

995
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:16,450
contact them and we have just haven't
explored the solar system well enough

explored the solar system well enough
 

997
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,330

yet to find them the reason why we don't

998
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:19,340
yet to find them the reason why we don't
 

999
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,500
yet to find them the reason why we don't
think about that is because we're young

think about that is because we're young
 

1001
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,360
think about that is because we're young
and impatient right like it would take

1002
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:22,370
and impatient right like it would take
 

1003
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,789
and impatient right like it would take
more than my lifetime to actually send

1004
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
more than my lifetime to actually send
 

1005
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,169
more than my lifetime to actually send
something to another star system and

1006
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:26,179
something to another star system and
 

1007
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,480
something to another star system and
wait for it and then come back so but if

1008
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,490
wait for it and then come back so but if
 

1009
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,399
wait for it and then come back so but if
if we start thinking on hundreds of

00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:30,409
if we start thinking on hundreds of
 

1011
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:31,779
if we start thinking on hundreds of
thousands of years or million year

1012

thousands of years or million year
 

1013
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,580
thousands of years or million year
timescales that's clearly the right

1014
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:33,590
timescales that's clearly the right
 

1015
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,180
timescales that's clearly the right
thing to do

1016
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,190
thing to do
 

1017
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,240
thing to do
are you excited by the thing that Elon

1018
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,250
are you excited by the thing that Elon

Musk says don't pay sex in general space

1020
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:39,590
Musk says don't pay sex in general space
 

1021
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,470
Musk says don't pay sex in general space
but the idea of space exploration even

1022
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:41,480
but the idea of space exploration even
 

1023
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,769
but the idea of space exploration even
though your or your species is young and

1024
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:44,779
though your or your species is young and
 

1025
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:47,560
though your or your species is young and
impatient ya know I do think that space

1026
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:47,570
impatient ya know I do think that space
 

1027
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,420
impatient ya know I do think that space
travel is crucially important long term

1028
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:50,430
travel is crucially important long term
 

1029
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,510
travel is crucially important long term
even to other star systems and I think

1030
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
even to other star systems and I think
 

1031
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,990
even to other star systems and I think
that many people overestimate the

1032
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,000
that many people overestimate the
 

1033
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,180
that many people overestimate the
difficulty because they say look if you

1034
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,190
difficulty because they say look if you
 

1035
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,160
difficulty because they say look if you
travel 1% the speed of light to another

1037
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,840
travel 1% the speed of light to another
star system will be dead before we get

1038
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:02,850
star system will be dead before we get
 

1039
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,390
star system will be dead before we get
there right and I think that it's much

1040
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:05,400
there right and I think that it's much
 

1041
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,070
there right and I think that it's much
easier and therefore when they write

1042
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,080
easier and therefore when they write
 

1043
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,150
easier and therefore when they write
their science fiction stories they

1044
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,160
their science fiction stories they
 

1045
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,320
their science fiction stories they
imagine we feel fast from the speed of

1046
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,330
imagine we feel fast from the speed of
 

1047
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,280
imagine we feel fast from the speed of
light because otherwise they are too

1048
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,290
light because otherwise they are too
 

1049
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,350
light because otherwise they are too
impatient right we're not gonna go

1050
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:12,360
impatient right we're not gonna go
 

1051
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,850
impatient right we're not gonna go
faster than the speed of light but we

1052
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:13,860
faster than the speed of light but we
 

1053
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,560
faster than the speed of light but we
could easily imagine that the human

1054
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:15,570
could easily imagine that the human
 

1055
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,120
could easily imagine that the human
lifespan gets extended to thousands of

1056
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,130
lifespan gets extended to thousands of
 

1057
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,280
lifespan gets extended to thousands of
years and once you do that then the

1058
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,290
years and once you do that then the
 

1059
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,049
years and once you do that then the
stars are much closer effectively right

1060
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:21,059
stars are much closer effectively right
 

1061
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,390
stars are much closer effectively right
and what's a hundred year trip right so

1062
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,400
and what's a hundred year trip right so
 

1063
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,490
and what's a hundred year trip right so
I think that that's gonna be the future

1064
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:25,500
I think that that's gonna be the future
 

1065
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,160
I think that that's gonna be the future
the far future not not my lifetime once

1066
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,170
the far future not not my lifetime once
 

1067
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,799
the far future not not my lifetime once
again but baby steps and unless your

1068
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:30,809
again but baby steps and unless your
 

1069
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:33,020
again but baby steps and unless your
lifetime gets extended well it's in a

1070
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,030
lifetime gets extended well it's in a
 

1071
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,240
lifetime gets extended well it's in a
race against time right a friend of mine

1072
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,250
race against time right a friend of mine

said you know you and I are gonna die

1076
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:39,870
said you know you and I are gonna die
 

1077
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,130
said you know you and I are gonna die
but I don't know about our grandchildren

1078
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:42,140
but I don't know about our grandchildren
 

1079
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,750
but I don't know about our grandchildren
that's right that's it I don't know for

1080
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:44,760
that's right that's it I don't know for
 

1081
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,190
that's right that's it I don't know for
predicting the future is hard but that's

1082
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:46,200
predicting the future is hard but that's
 

1083
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,100
predicting the future is hard but that's
at least a plausible scenario and so ya

1084
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,110
at least a plausible scenario and so ya
 

1085
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,110
at least a plausible scenario and so ya
know I think that as we discussed

1086
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
know I think that as we discussed
 

1087
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,380
know I think that as we discussed
earlier there are threats to the earth

1088
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:53,390

currently answer but might soon when you

1098
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:12,059
currently answer but might soon when you
 

1099
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,370
currently answer but might soon when you
think about the problems and the

1100
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:13,380
think about the problems and the
 

1101
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,680
think about the problems and the
mysteries before us hmm that may be

1102
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:15,690
mysteries before us hmm that may be
 

1103
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,140
mysteries before us hmm that may be
within reach of science I think an

1104
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,150
within reach of science I think an
 

1105
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,360
within reach of science I think an
obvious one is the origin of life we

1106
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,370
obvious one is the origin of life we
 

1107
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,940
obvious one is the origin of life we
don't know how that happened there's a

1108
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:22,950
don't know how that happened there's a
 

1109
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,560
don't know how that happened there's a
difficulty in knowing how it happened

1110
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:24,570
difficulty in knowing how it happened
 

1111
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,090
difficulty in knowing how it happened
historically actually you know literally

historically actually you know literally

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,490
on earth but starting life from non-life
is something I kind of think we're close

1116
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:31,500
is something I kind of think we're close
 

1117
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,190
is something I kind of think we're close
to right we really think so how like how

1118
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:34,200
to right we really think so how like how
 

1119
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,860
to right we really think so how like how
difficult is it to start lie - well I

1120
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:36,870
difficult is it to start lie - well I
 

1121
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,650
difficult is it to start lie - well I
I've talked to people including on the

1122
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:39,660
I've talked to people including on the
 

1123
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,080
I've talked to people including on the
podcast about this you know life

1124
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,090
podcast about this you know life
 

1125
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,060
podcast about this you know life
requires three things life as we know it

1126
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,070
requires three things life as we know it
 

1127
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,590
requires three things life as we know it
so there's a difference with life which

1128
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
so there's a difference with life which
 

1129
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,610
so there's a difference with life which
who knows what it is

1130
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:46,620
who knows what it is
 

1131
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,620
who knows what it is
and life as we know it which we can talk

1132
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:48,630
and life as we know it which we can talk
 

1133
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,200
and life as we know it which we can talk
about with some intelligence so life as

1134
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,210
about with some intelligence so life as
 

1135
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,000
about with some intelligence so life as
we know it requires compartmentalization

1136
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,010
we know it requires compartmentalization
 

1137
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,010
we know it requires compartmentalization
you need like a little membrane around

1138
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,020
you need like a little membrane around
 

1139
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,280
you need like a little membrane around
your cell metabolism you take in food

1140
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,290
your cell metabolism you take in food
 

1141
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,260
your cell metabolism you take in food
and eat it and let that make you do

1142
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,270
and eat it and let that make you do
 

1143
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,750
and eat it and let that make you do
things and then replication okay so you

1144
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:02,760
things and then replication okay so you
 

1145
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,100
things and then replication okay so you
need to have some information about

1146
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,110
need to have some information about
 

1147
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,960
need to have some information about
you are that you passed down through to

1148
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:05,970
you are that you passed down through to
 

1149
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,680
you are that you passed down through to
future generations in the lab

1150
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:08,690
future generations in the lab
 

1151
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,900
future generations in the lab
compartmentalization seems pretty easy

1152
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:10,910
compartmentalization seems pretty easy
 

1153
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,880
compartmentalization seems pretty easy
not hard to make lipid bilayers that

1154
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:13,890
not hard to make lipid bilayers that
 

1155
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,470
not hard to make lipid bilayers that
come into a little cellular walls pretty

1156
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:15,480
come into a little cellular walls pretty
 

1157
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,440
come into a little cellular walls pretty
easily metabolism and replication are

1158
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:18,450
easily metabolism and replication are
 

1159
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,680
easily metabolism and replication are
hard but replication we're close to

1160
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:21,690
hard but replication we're close to
 

1161
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,350
hard but replication we're close to
people have made RNA like molecules in

1162
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:24,360
people have made RNA like molecules in
 

1163
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,830
people have made RNA like molecules in
the lab that I think the state of the

1164
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
the lab that I think the state of the
 

1165
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,110
the lab that I think the state of the
art is they're not able to make one

1166
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,120
art is they're not able to make one
 

1167
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
art is they're not able to make one
molecule that reproduces itself but

1168
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,130
molecule that reproduces itself but
 

1169
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,650
molecule that reproduces itself but
they're able to make two molecules that

1170
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:33,660
they're able to make two molecules that
 

1171
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,900
they're able to make two molecules that
reproduce each other yeah so that's okay

1172
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:35,910
reproduce each other yeah so that's okay
 

1173
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,370
reproduce each other yeah so that's okay
that's pretty close metabolism is hard

1174
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:40,380
that's pretty close metabolism is hard
 

1175
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,360
that's pretty close metabolism is hard
to believe it or not even though it's

1176
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,370
to believe it or not even though it's
 

1177
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,010
to believe it or not even though it's
sort of the most obvious thing but you

1178
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:43,020
sort of the most obvious thing but you
 

1179
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,840
sort of the most obvious thing but you
want some sort of controlled metabolism

1180
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:44,850
want some sort of controlled metabolism
 

1181
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,090
want some sort of controlled metabolism
and the actual cellular machinery in our

1182
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,100
and the actual cellular machinery in our
 

1183
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,070
and the actual cellular machinery in our
bodies is quite complicated it's hard to

1184
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,080
bodies is quite complicated it's hard to
 

1185
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,020
bodies is quite complicated it's hard to
see it just popping into existence all

1186
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,030
see it just popping into existence all
 

1187
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,080
see it just popping into existence all
by itself probably took a while but it's

1188
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,090
by itself probably took a while but it's
 

1189
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,570
by itself probably took a while but it's
we're making progress and in fact I

1190
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:56,580
we're making progress and in fact I
 

1191
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,740
we're making progress and in fact I
don't think we're spending nearly enough

1192
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:57,750
don't think we're spending nearly enough
 

1193
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,140
don't think we're spending nearly enough
money on it if I were the NSF I would

1194
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,150
money on it if I were the NSF I would
 

1195
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,060
money on it if I were the NSF I would
flood this area with money because it

1196
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,070
flood this area with money because it
 

1197
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,360
flood this area with money because it
would change our view of the world if we

1198
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,370
would change our view of the world if we
 

1199
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,830
would change our view of the world if we
could actually make life in the lab and

1200
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:06,840
could actually make life in the lab and
 

1201
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,780
could actually make life in the lab and
understand how it was made originally

1202
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:08,790
understand how it was made originally
 

1203
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,310
understand how it was made originally
here on earth and I'm sure have some

1204
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
here on earth and I'm sure have some
 

1205
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
here on earth and I'm sure have some
ripple effects that help cure disease

1206
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,330
ripple effects that help cure disease
 

1207
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,360
ripple effects that help cure disease
and so on I mean that just that ending

1208
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,370
and so on I mean that just that ending
 

1209
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,159
and so on I mean that just that ending
so synthetic biology is a wonderful big

1210
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:16,169
so synthetic biology is a wonderful big
 

1211
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:18,590
so synthetic biology is a wonderful big
frontier where we're making cells the

1212
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:18,600
frontier where we're making cells the
 

1213
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,320
frontier where we're making cells the
right now the best way to do that is to

1214
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,330
right now the best way to do that is to
 

1215
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,060
right now the best way to do that is to
borrow heavily from existing biology

1216
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,070
borrow heavily from existing biology
 

1217
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,799
borrow heavily from existing biology
right where craig Venter several years

1218
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:24,809
right where craig Venter several years
 

1219
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,840
right where craig Venter several years
ago created an artificial cell but all

1220
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:26,850
ago created an artificial cell but all
 

1221
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,970
ago created an artificial cell but all
he did was not all he did it was a

1222
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:28,980
he did was not all he did it was a
 

1223
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,260
he did was not all he did it was a
tremendous accomplishment but all he did

1224
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,270
tremendous accomplishment but all he did
 

1225
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,380
tremendous accomplishment but all he did
was take out the DNA from a cell and put

1226
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:33,390
was take out the DNA from a cell and put
 

1227
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,970
was take out the DNA from a cell and put
in an entirely new DNA and let it boot

1228
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:34,980
in an entirely new DNA and let it boot
 

1229
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,850
in an entirely new DNA and let it boot
up and go hmm what about the leap to

1230
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:39,860
up and go hmm what about the leap to
 

1231
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,520
up and go hmm what about the leap to
creating intelligent life on Earth yeah

1232
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:43,530
creating intelligent life on Earth yeah
 

1233
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,500
creating intelligent life on Earth yeah
however again we define intelligence of

1234
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:45,510
however again we define intelligence of
 

1235
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,590
however again we define intelligence of
course but let's just even say Homo

1236
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:48,600
course but let's just even say Homo
 

1237
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,640
course but let's just even say Homo
sapiens the the modern the modern

1238
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:52,650
sapiens the the modern the modern
 

1239
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,490
sapiens the the modern the modern
intelligence in our human brain you have

1240
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:55,500
intelligence in our human brain you have
 

1241
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,039
intelligence in our human brain you have
a sense of what's involved in that leap

1242
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:58,049
a sense of what's involved in that leap
 

1243
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:00,799
a sense of what's involved in that leap
and how big of a leap that is so AI

1244
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:00,809
and how big of a leap that is so AI
 

1245
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,840
and how big of a leap that is so AI
would count in this or you really want

1246
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:02,850
would count in this or you really want
 

1247
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,060
would count in this or you really want
life you want a really organism in some

1248
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,070
life you want a really organism in some
 

1249
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,380
life you want a really organism in some
sense AI would count okay I yeah of

1250
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,390
sense AI would count okay I yeah of
 

1251
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,090
sense AI would count okay I yeah of
course of course AI would come but well

1252
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,100
course of course AI would come but well
 

1253
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,010
course of course AI would come but well
let's say artificial consciousness right

1254
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,020
let's say artificial consciousness right
 

1255
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,049
let's say artificial consciousness right
so I do not think we are on the

1256
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:15,059
so I do not think we are on the
 

1257
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,100
so I do not think we are on the
threshold of creating artificial

1258
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,110
threshold of creating artificial
 

1259
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,870
threshold of creating artificial
consciousness I think it's possible

1260
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:17,880
consciousness I think it's possible
 

1261
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,669
consciousness I think it's possible
I'm not again very educated about how

1262
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
I'm not again very educated about how
 

1263
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,230
I'm not again very educated about how
close we are but my impression is not

1264
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:21,240
close we are but my impression is not
 

1265
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,220
close we are but my impression is not
that we're really close because we

1266
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,230
that we're really close because we
 

1267
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,409
that we're really close because we
understand how little how little we

1268
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:24,419
understand how little how little we
 

1269
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,060
understand how little how little we
understand of consciousness and what it

1270
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,070
understand of consciousness and what it
 

1271
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,190
understand of consciousness and what it
is so if we don't have any idea what it

1272
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,200
is so if we don't have any idea what it
 

1273
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,390
is so if we don't have any idea what it
is it's hard to imagine we're on the

1274
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:29,400
is it's hard to imagine we're on the
 

1275
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,659
is it's hard to imagine we're on the
threshold of making it ourselves

1276
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:31,669
threshold of making it ourselves
 

1277
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:34,549
threshold of making it ourselves
but it's doable it's possible I don't

1278
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
but it's doable it's possible I don't
 

1279
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,710
but it's doable it's possible I don't
see any obstacles in principle so yeah I

1280
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
see any obstacles in principle so yeah I
 

1281
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,299
see any obstacles in principle so yeah I
would hold out some interest in that

1282
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:38,309
would hold out some interest in that
 

1283
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:41,299
would hold out some interest in that
happening eventually I think in general

1284
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:41,309
happening eventually I think in general
 

1285
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:43,310
happening eventually I think in general
consciousness I think we'll be just

1286
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,320
consciousness I think we'll be just
 

1287
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,150
consciousness I think we'll be just
surprised how easy consciousness is once

1288
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,160
surprised how easy consciousness is once
 

1289
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,190
surprised how easy consciousness is once
we create intelligence you know I think

1290
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
we create intelligence you know I think
 

1291
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,159
we create intelligence you know I think
consciousness is the thing that that's

1292
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:52,169
consciousness is the thing that that's
 

1293
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:54,640
consciousness is the thing that that's
just something we all fake

1294
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:54,650
just something we all fake
 

1295
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,899
just something we all fake
well good no actually I like this idea

1296
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:56,909
well good no actually I like this idea
 

1297
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,640
well good no actually I like this idea
that in fact consciousness is way less

1298
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:58,650
that in fact consciousness is way less
 

1299
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,620
that in fact consciousness is way less
mysterious than we think yeah because

1300
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:00,630
mysterious than we think yeah because
 

1301
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,419
mysterious than we think yeah because
we're all at every time at every moment

1302
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:02,429
we're all at every time at every moment
 

1303
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:03,890
we're all at every time at every moment
less conscious than we think we are

1304
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:03,900
less conscious than we think we are
 

1305
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,080
less conscious than we think we are
right we can fool things and I think

1306
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,090
right we can fool things and I think
 

1307
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,899
right we can fool things and I think
that plus the idea that you not only

1308
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:08,909
that plus the idea that you not only
 

1309
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:11,299
that plus the idea that you not only
have artificial intelligent systems but

1310
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:11,309
have artificial intelligent systems but
 

1311
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,340
have artificial intelligent systems but
you put them in a body right give them a

1312
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:13,350
you put them in a body right give them a
 

1313
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,659
you put them in a body right give them a
robot body that will help the faking a

1314
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:17,669
robot body that will help the faking a
 

1315
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,240
robot body that will help the faking a
lot yeah I think I think creating

1316
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,250
lot yeah I think I think creating
 

1317
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,890
lot yeah I think I think creating
consciousness in our artificial

1318
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:21,900
consciousness in our artificial
 

1319
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,090
consciousness in our artificial
consciousness is as simple as asking a

1320
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,100
consciousness is as simple as asking a
 

1321
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,919
consciousness is as simple as asking a
Roomba to say I'm conscious and refusing

1322
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:30,929
Roomba to say I'm conscious and refusing
 

1323
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,380
Roomba to say I'm conscious and refusing
to be talked out of it could be it could

1324
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:33,390
to be talked out of it could be it could
 

1325
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,919
to be talked out of it could be it could
be and I mean I'm almost being silly but

1326
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:36,929
be and I mean I'm almost being silly but
 

1327
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:40,190
be and I mean I'm almost being silly but
that's what we do yeah that's what we do

1328
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,200
that's what we do yeah that's what we do
 

1329
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,169
that's what we do yeah that's what we do
with each other this is the kind of that

1330
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:42,179
with each other this is the kind of that
 

1331
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,299
with each other this is the kind of that
consciousness is also a social construct

1332
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:44,309
consciousness is also a social construct
 

1333
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,370
consciousness is also a social construct
and a lot of our ideas of intelligence

1334
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:46,380
and a lot of our ideas of intelligence
 

1335
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,070
and a lot of our ideas of intelligence
is a social construct and so reaching

1336
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,080
is a social construct and so reaching
 

1337
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,770
is a social construct and so reaching
that bar involves something that's

1338
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:51,780
that bar involves something that's
 

1339
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,710
that bar involves something that's
beyond that's not necessarily involve

1340
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
beyond that's not necessarily involve
 

1341
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,289
beyond that's not necessarily involve
the fundamental understanding of how you

1342
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:57,299
the fundamental understanding of how you
 

1343
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:01,039
the fundamental understanding of how you
go from electrons to neurons to

1344
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,049
go from electrons to neurons to
 

1345
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:03,409
go from electrons to neurons to
cognition no I actually I think that is

1346
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:03,419
cognition no I actually I think that is
 

1347
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,590
cognition no I actually I think that is
a really good point and in fact what it

1348
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:06,600
a really good point and in fact what it
 

1349
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,289
a really good point and in fact what it
suggests is you know so yeah you

1350
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:09,299
suggests is you know so yeah you
 

1351
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:10,789
suggests is you know so yeah you
referred to Kate Kate darling who I had

1352
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
referred to Kate Kate darling who I had
 

1353
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,710
referred to Kate Kate darling who I had
on the podcast and who does these

1354
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
on the podcast and who does these
 

1355
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,580
on the podcast and who does these
experiments with very simple robots but

1356
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:16,590
experiments with very simple robots but
 

1357
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,190
experiments with very simple robots but
they look like animals and they can look

1358
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
they look like animals and they can look
 

1359
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,080
they look like animals and they can look
like they're experiencing pain and we

1360
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,090
like they're experiencing pain and we
 

1361
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,480
like they're experiencing pain and we
human beings react very negatively to

1362
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:23,490
human beings react very negatively to
 

1363
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,980
human beings react very negatively to
these little robots looking like they're

1364
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:24,990
these little robots looking like they're
 

1365
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,070
these little robots looking like they're
experiencing pain and what you want to

1366
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
experiencing pain and what you want to
 

1367
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
experiencing pain and what you want to
say is yeah but they're just robots it's

1368
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,090
say is yeah but they're just robots it's
 

1369
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,570
say is yeah but they're just robots it's
not really pain

1370
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:31,580
not really pain
 

1371
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,919
not really pain
he's just some electrons going around

1372
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:32,929
he's just some electrons going around
 

1373
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:34,690
he's just some electrons going around
but then you realize you know you and I

1374
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:34,700
but then you realize you know you and I
 

1375
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,060
but then you realize you know you and I
are just electrons going around and

1376
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,070
are just electrons going around and
 

1377
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,950
are just electrons going around and
that's what pain is also and so what I

1378
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960
that's what pain is also and so what I
 

1379
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,279
that's what pain is also and so what I
what I would have an easy time imagining

1380
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:42,289
what I would have an easy time imagining
 

1381
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:44,830
what I would have an easy time imagining
is that there is a spectrum between

1382
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:44,840
is that there is a spectrum between
 

1383
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,049
is that there is a spectrum between
these simple robots that Kate works with

1384
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:47,059
these simple robots that Kate works with
 

1385
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:50,289
these simple robots that Kate works with
and a human being where there are things

1386
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:50,299
and a human being where there are things
 

1387
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,570
and a human being where there are things
that sort of by some strict definition

1388
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:52,580
that sort of by some strict definition
 

1389
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,310
that sort of by some strict definition
touring test level thing are not

1390
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
touring test level thing are not
 

1391
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,919
touring test level thing are not
conscious but nevertheless walk and talk

1392
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:56,929
conscious but nevertheless walk and talk
 

1393
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,139
conscious but nevertheless walk and talk
like they're conscious and it could be

1394
00:26:59,139 --> 00:26:59,149
like they're conscious and it could be
 

1395
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:00,580
like they're conscious and it could be
that the future is I mean

1396
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:00,590
that the future is I mean
 

1397
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,029
that the future is I mean
Siri is close right and so it might be

1398
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:04,039
Siri is close right and so it might be
 

1399
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,399
Siri is close right and so it might be
the future has a lot more agents like

1400
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:06,409
the future has a lot more agents like
 

1401
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:08,499
the future has a lot more agents like
that and in fact rather than some day

1402
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:08,509
that and in fact rather than some day
 

1403
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:10,840
that and in fact rather than some day
going aha we have consciousness will

1404
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:10,850
going aha we have consciousness will
 

1405
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,639
going aha we have consciousness will
just creep up on it with more and more

1406
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:12,649
just creep up on it with more and more
 

1407
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:14,799
just creep up on it with more and more
accurate reflections of what we expect

1408
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:14,809
accurate reflections of what we expect
 

1409
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:18,460
accurate reflections of what we expect
and in the future maybe the present for

1410
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:18,470
and in the future maybe the present for
 

1411
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,220
and in the future maybe the present for
example we haven't met before and you're

1412
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:21,230
example we haven't met before and you're
 

1413
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,169
example we haven't met before and you're
made basically assuming that I'm human

1414
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:23,179
made basically assuming that I'm human
 

1415
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:27,220
made basically assuming that I'm human
as it's a high probability at this time

1416
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,230
as it's a high probability at this time
 

1417
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,220
as it's a high probability at this time
because the yeah but in the future there

1418
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,230
because the yeah but in the future there
 

1419
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,810
because the yeah but in the future there
might be question marks on that right

1420
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:31,820
might be question marks on that right
 

1421
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,950
might be question marks on that right
yeah no absolutely

1422
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
yeah no absolutely
 

1423
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,739
yeah no absolutely
certainly videos are almost to the point

1424
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:35,749
certainly videos are almost to the point
 

1425
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:36,580
certainly videos are almost to the point
where you shouldn't trust them already

1426
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:36,590
where you shouldn't trust them already
 

1427
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,479
where you shouldn't trust them already
photos you can't trust right videos is

1428
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:40,489
photos you can't trust right videos is
 

1429
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:42,430
photos you can't trust right videos is
easier to trust but we're getting worse

1430
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:42,440
easier to trust but we're getting worse
 

1431
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,799
easier to trust but we're getting worse
that yeah we're getting better at faking

1432
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:44,809
that yeah we're getting better at faking
 

1433
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:46,299
that yeah we're getting better at faking
them Yeah right getting better

1434
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:46,309
them Yeah right getting better
 

1435
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:48,970
them Yeah right getting better
yeah so physical embodied people what's

1436
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:48,980
yeah so physical embodied people what's
 

1437
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,279
yeah so physical embodied people what's
what's so hard about faking that so this

1438
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:51,289
what's so hard about faking that so this
 

1439
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:52,690
what's so hard about faking that so this
is very depressing this conversation

1440
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:52,700
is very depressing this conversation
 

1441
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,930
is very depressing this conversation
right so to me is excited you're doing

1442
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:55,940
right so to me is excited you're doing
 

1443
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,330
right so to me is excited you're doing
it so exciting to you but it's a

1444
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:58,340
it so exciting to you but it's a
 

1445
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,070
it so exciting to you but it's a
sobering thought we're very bad right

1446
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
sobering thought we're very bad right
 

1447
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,229
sobering thought we're very bad right
yet imagining what the next 50 years are

1448
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:02,239
yet imagining what the next 50 years are
 

1449
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,369
yet imagining what the next 50 years are
gonna be like when we're in the middle

1450
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:03,379
gonna be like when we're in the middle
 

1451
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:04,539
gonna be like when we're in the middle
of a phase transition as who you are

1452
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:04,549
of a phase transition as who you are
 

1453
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,820
of a phase transition as who you are
right now yeah and I in general I'm not

1454
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:06,830
right now yeah and I in general I'm not
 

1455
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,720
right now yeah and I in general I'm not
blind to all the threats yeah I am

1456
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:09,730
blind to all the threats yeah I am
 

1457
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,970
blind to all the threats yeah I am
excited by the power of technology to

1458
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:12,980
excited by the power of technology to
 

1459
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,119
excited by the power of technology to
solve to protect us against the threats

1460
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:16,129
solve to protect us against the threats
 

1461
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:19,810
solve to protect us against the threats
as they evolve I'm not as much as Steven

1462
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:19,820
as they evolve I'm not as much as Steven
 

1463
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,539
as they evolve I'm not as much as Steven
Pinker optimistic about the world but in

1464
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:22,549
Pinker optimistic about the world but in
 

1465
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:24,669
Pinker optimistic about the world but in
everything I've seen all the brilliant

1466
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:24,679
everything I've seen all the brilliant
 

1467
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:26,950
everything I've seen all the brilliant
people in the world that I've met are

1468
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
people in the world that I've met are
 

1469
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,639
people in the world that I've met are
good people so the army of the good in

1470
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:30,649
good people so the army of the good in
 

1471
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:32,409
good people so the army of the good in
terms of the development of technology

1472
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:32,419
terms of the development of technology
 

1473
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,159
terms of the development of technology
is large okay you're way more optimistic

1474
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:36,169
is large okay you're way more optimistic
 

1475
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:38,590
is large okay you're way more optimistic
than I am I think that goodness and

1476
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:38,600
than I am I think that goodness and
 

1477
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,239
than I am I think that goodness and
badness are equally distributed among

1478
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:40,249
badness are equally distributed among
 

1479
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:41,909
badness are equally distributed among
intelligent and unintelligent people I

1480
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:41,919
intelligent and unintelligent people I
 

1481
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,099
intelligent and unintelligent people I
don't see much of a correlation there

1482
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:44,109
don't see much of a correlation there
 

1483
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:45,360
don't see much of a correlation there
interesting

1484
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,370
interesting
 

1485
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,950
interesting
neither of us have proof yeah exactly is

1486
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:47,960
neither of us have proof yeah exactly is
 

1487
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,310
neither of us have proof yeah exactly is
yeah

1488
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
yeah
 

1489
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,860
yeah
again that pinions are freeze right nor

1490
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:50,870
again that pinions are freeze right nor
 

1491
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,049
again that pinions are freeze right nor
definitions of good and evil we come

1492
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:53,059
definitions of good and evil we come
 

1493
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:56,009
definitions of good and evil we come
without definitions or with without data

1494
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:56,019
without definitions or with without data
 

1495
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:59,080
without definitions or with without data
opinions so what kind of questions

1496
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,090
opinions so what kind of questions
 

1497
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,350
opinions so what kind of questions
concerns not currently answer may never

1498
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,360
concerns not currently answer may never
 

1499
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,570
concerns not currently answer may never
be able to answer in your view well the

1500
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:04,580
be able to answer in your view well the
 

1501
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,399
be able to answer in your view well the
obvious one is what is good and bad you

1502
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:06,409
obvious one is what is good and bad you
 

1503
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:07,930
obvious one is what is good and bad you
know I know what is right and wrong I

1504
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:07,940
know I know what is right and wrong I
 

1505
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,399
know I know what is right and wrong I
think that there are questions that you

1506
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:09,409
think that there are questions that you
 

1507
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:11,440
think that there are questions that you
know science tells us what happens what

1508
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,450
know science tells us what happens what
 

1509
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,570
know science tells us what happens what
the world is and what it does it doesn't

1510
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:13,580
the world is and what it does it doesn't
 

1511
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,159
the world is and what it does it doesn't
say what the world should do or what we

1512
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:15,169
say what the world should do or what we
 

1513
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:16,060
say what the world should do or what we
should do because we're part of the

1514
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,070
should do because we're part of the
 

1515
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,269
should do because we're part of the
world but we are part of the world and

1516
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:19,279
world but we are part of the world and
 

1517
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,860
world but we are part of the world and
we have the ability to feel like

1518
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:20,870
we have the ability to feel like
 

1519
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,830
we have the ability to feel like
something's right something's wrong and

1520
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:22,840
something's right something's wrong and
 

1521
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,690
something's right something's wrong and
to make a very long story very short I

1522
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:25,700
to make a very long story very short I
 

1523
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,850
to make a very long story very short I
think that the idea of moral philosophy

1524
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:27,860
think that the idea of moral philosophy
 

1525
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,310
think that the idea of moral philosophy
is systematizing our intuitions of what

1526
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,320
is systematizing our intuitions of what
 

1527
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,039
is systematizing our intuitions of what
is right what is wrong and science might

1528
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,049
is right what is wrong and science might
 

1529
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:34,930
is right what is wrong and science might
be able to predict ahead of time what we

1530
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:34,940
be able to predict ahead of time what we
 

1531
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,419
be able to predict ahead of time what we
will do but it won't ever be able to

1532
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:37,429
will do but it won't ever be able to
 

1533
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:38,980
will do but it won't ever be able to
judge whether we should have done it or

1534
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:38,990
judge whether we should have done it or
 

1535
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,860
judge whether we should have done it or
not so you know you're kind of unique in

1536
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:41,870
not so you know you're kind of unique in
 

1537
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,440
not so you know you're kind of unique in
terms of scientists listen it doesn't

1538
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:44,450
terms of scientists listen it doesn't
 

1539
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,870
terms of scientists listen it doesn't
have to do with podcast but even just

1540
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
have to do with podcast but even just
 

1541
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,490
have to do with podcast but even just
reaching out I think you referred to as

1542
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:48,500
reaching out I think you referred to as
 

1543
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,350
reaching out I think you referred to as
sort of an doing interdisciplinary

1544
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:50,360
sort of an doing interdisciplinary
 

1545
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,659
sort of an doing interdisciplinary
science so you reach out and talk to

1546
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:52,669
science so you reach out and talk to
 

1547
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:55,210
science so you reach out and talk to
people that are outside of your

1548
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:55,220
people that are outside of your
 

1549
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,840
people that are outside of your
discipline which I always hope that's

1550
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:58,850
discipline which I always hope that's
 

1551
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,669
discipline which I always hope that's
what science was for in fact I was a

1552
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:00,679
what science was for in fact I was a
 

1553
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,830
what science was for in fact I was a
little disillusioned when I realized

1554
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:02,840
little disillusioned when I realized
 

1555
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,379
little disillusioned when I realized
that academia is very siloed yeah and so

1556
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:08,389
that academia is very siloed yeah and so
 

1557
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,490
that academia is very siloed yeah and so
the question is how well at your own

1558
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:12,500
the question is how well at your own
 

1559
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,960
the question is how well at your own
level how do you prepare for these

1560
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:13,970
level how do you prepare for these
 

1561
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,970
level how do you prepare for these
conversations how do you think about

1562
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:15,980
conversations how do you think about
 

1563
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,529
conversations how do you think about
these conversations how do you open your

1564
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:17,539
these conversations how do you open your
 

1565
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:19,240
these conversations how do you open your
mind enough to have these conversations

1566
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,250
mind enough to have these conversations
 

1567
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,610
mind enough to have these conversations
and it may be a little bit broader

1568
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:21,620
and it may be a little bit broader
 

1569
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,310
and it may be a little bit broader
how can you advise other scientists to

1570
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
how can you advise other scientists to
 

1571
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,590
how can you advise other scientists to
have these kinds of conversations not at

1572
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:26,600
have these kinds of conversations not at
 

1573
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,690
have these kinds of conversations not at
the podcast so the fact that you're

1574
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:28,700
the podcast so the fact that you're
 

1575
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,250
the podcast so the fact that you're
doing a podcast is awesome other people

1576
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,260
doing a podcast is awesome other people
 

1577
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,769
doing a podcast is awesome other people
don't hear them yeah but it's also good

were recorded in fact a lot of the
 

1615
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,460
were recorded in fact a lot of the
motivation for starting recording it was

1616
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:12,470
motivation for starting recording it was
 

1617
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,230
motivation for starting recording it was
making sure I would read all these books

1618
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:14,240
making sure I would read all these books
 

1619
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,880
making sure I would read all these books
that I had purchased right like all

these books I wanted to read not enough
 

1623
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,960
these books I wanted to read not enough
time to read them and now if I have

00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,290
people who do it successfully generally
 

1641
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,560
people who do it successfully generally
first became very successful within

1642
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:41,570
first became very successful within
 

1643
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,970

their little silo you have discipline

1644
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:42,980
their little silo you have discipline
 

1645
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,120
their little silo you have discipline
and only then did they start expanding

1646
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,130
and only then did they start expanding
 

1647
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,650
and only then did they start expanding
out if you're a young person you know I

1648
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:47,660
out if you're a young person you know I
 

1649
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,540
out if you're a young person you know I
I have graduate students I try to be

1650
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:49,550
I have graduate students I try to be
 

1651
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,750
I have graduate students I try to be
very very candid with them about this

1652
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:52,760
very very candid with them about this
 

1653
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,270
very very candid with them about this
that it's you know most graduate

broad you are and the less time you
 

1667
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,420
broad you are and the less time you
spend hyper specializing in your field

1668
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:13,430
spend hyper specializing in your field
 

1669
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,910

the lower your job chances are that's

the lower your job chances are that's
 

1671
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,620
the lower your job chances are that's
just an academic reality it's terrible I

1672
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:17,630
just an academic reality it's terrible I
 

1673
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,720
just an academic reality it's terrible I
don't like it yeah but it's a reality

there's plenty of people who are
 

1679
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,870
there's plenty of people who are
wonderful scientists who have zero

1680
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:25,880
wonderful scientists who have zero
 

1681
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,450

interest in branching out and talking to
 

1683
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,870
interest in branching out and talking to
things to anyone outside their field but

1684
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:31,880
things to anyone outside their field but
 

1685
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,140
things to anyone outside their field but
it is disillusioning to me some of the

1686
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,150
it is disillusioning to me some of the
 

1687
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,300
it is disillusioning to me some of the
you know romantic notion I had the

1688
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,310
you know romantic notion I had the
 

1689
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,790
you know romantic notion I had the
intellectual academic life is belied by

1690
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:39,800
intellectual academic life is belied by
 

1691
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,560
intellectual academic life is belied by
the reality of it the idea that we

1692
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:41,570
the reality of it the idea that we
 

1693
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,260
the reality of it the idea that we
should reach out beyond our discipline

1694
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,270
should reach out beyond our discipline
 

1695
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,190
should reach out beyond our discipline
and that is a positive good is just so

1696
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,200
and that is a positive good is just so
 

1697
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,510
and that is a positive good is just so
rare in universities that it may as well

1698
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:52,520
rare in universities that it may as well
 

1699
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,750
rare in universities that it may as well
not exist at all but that said even

1700
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:55,760
not exist at all but that said even
 

1701
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,370
not exist at all but that said even
though you're saying you're doing it

1702
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:57,380
though you're saying you're doing it
 

1703
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,050
though you're saying you're doing it
like the personal trainer because you

1704
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,060
like the personal trainer because you
 

1705
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,880
like the personal trainer because you
just can't help it you're also an

1706
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:00,890
just can't help it you're also an
 

1707
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,910
just can't help it you're also an
inspiration to others like I could speak

1708
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:03,920
inspiration to others like I could speak
 

1709
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,960
inspiration to others like I could speak
for myself you know I also have a career

1710
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:07,970
for myself you know I also have a career
 

1711
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,300
for myself you know I also have a career
I'm thinking about right now and without

1712
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,310
I'm thinking about right now and without
 

1713
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,430
I'm thinking about right now and without
your podcast I may

1714
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:12,440
your podcast I may
 

1715
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,600
your podcast I may
not have been doing this at all right so

1716
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:15,610
not have been doing this at all right so
 

1717
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,790
not have been doing this at all right so
it makes me realize that these kinds of

1718
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:18,800
it makes me realize that these kinds of
 

1719
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,440
it makes me realize that these kinds of
conversations is kind of what science is

1720
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,450
conversations is kind of what science is
 

1721
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,830
conversations is kind of what science is
about in many ways what the reason we

1722
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:23,840
about in many ways what the reason we
 

1723
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,310
about in many ways what the reason we
write papers this exchange of ideas is

1724
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:27,320
write papers this exchange of ideas is
 

1725
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,250
write papers this exchange of ideas is
it's much harder to do interdisciplinary

1726
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,260
it's much harder to do interdisciplinary
 

1727
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,090
it's much harder to do interdisciplinary
papers I would say yeah that's right and

1728
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:33,100
papers I would say yeah that's right and
 

1729
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,290
papers I would say yeah that's right and
conversations are easier so

1730
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:35,300
conversations are easier so
 

1731
