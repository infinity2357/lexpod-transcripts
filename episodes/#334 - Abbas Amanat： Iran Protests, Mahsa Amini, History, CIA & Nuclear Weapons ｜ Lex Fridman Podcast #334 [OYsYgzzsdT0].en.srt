not necessarily when she was arrested
 

143
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,270
not necessarily when she was arrested
but in the course of the detention when

144
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
but in the course of the detention when

147
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,890
they take them to a center presumably to
re-educate them yeah and she apparently

148
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:30,900
re-educate them yeah and she apparently
 

149
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,670
re-educate them yeah and she apparently
collapsed and maybe my sense is that she

150
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:34,680
collapsed and maybe my sense is that she
 

151
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,190
collapsed and maybe my sense is that she
must have had some kind of a problem

152
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
must have had some kind of a problem
 

153

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,509
this is a variety of reasons perhaps you
can get to that later on if you like but

911
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,990

one major factor which seems to add to
 

913
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,610
one major factor which seems to add to
the anxiety

914
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:40,620
the anxiety
 

915
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,210
the anxiety
of well the regime is extremely anxious

916
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:44,220
of well the regime is extremely anxious
 

917
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,450
of well the regime is extremely anxious
now because they are in a position and

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,010
now because they are in a position and
it shows that they don't have the lack

920
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,020
it shows that they don't have the lack
 

921
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,110

see them reacting in a very forceful way
 

925
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,350
see them reacting in a very forceful way
because basically they don't seem to

926
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
because basically they don't seem to
 

927
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,990
because basically they don't seem to
have that kind of a confidence to allow

high otherwise you wouldn't have double

1306
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,200
high otherwise you wouldn't have double
 

1307

high otherwise you wouldn't have double
your population in matter of four

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,430
2.8 or 3 percent birth rate in around
1980s I would say 1970s 1980s now

1328
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:28,440
1980s I would say 1970s 1980s now
 

1329
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,950
1980s I would say 1970s 1980s now
it is 1.1

1330
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:30,960
it is 1.1
 

1331
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,710
it is 1.1
and it's what probably the most

1332
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:33,720
and it's what probably the most
 

1333
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,289
and it's what probably the most
successful country in the Middle East in

the government
a consistent uh attempt to try to

00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,140
a consistent uh attempt to try to

middle class refuses to do that and this

1344
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,200
middle class refuses to do that and this
 

1345
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,350
middle class refuses to do that and this
is the middle class not only anymore in

1346
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:54,360
is the middle class not only anymore in
 

1347
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,610
is the middle class not only anymore in

the capital
 

1349
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,430
the capital
but this is very smaller towns and

00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:58,440
but this is very smaller towns and
 

1351
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,070
but this is very smaller towns and
cities places that used to be villages

1352
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,080
cities places that used to be villages
 

1353
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,649
cities places that used to be villages
now you look at them they have a decent

1354
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:03,659
now you look at them they have a decent
 

1355
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:06,409
now you look at them they have a decent

000 and they live in urban life and they

1358
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
000 and they live in urban life and they
 

1359
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,210
000 and they live in urban life and they
don't want to be

1360

don't want to be
 

1361
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,789
don't want to be
subjected to that old pattern of

00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:13,799
subjected to that old pattern of
 

1363
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,010
subjected to that old pattern of
agrarian society when you had 10

1364
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:16,020
agrarian society when you had 10
 

1365
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,590
agrarian society when you had 10
children or eight children and of course

1366
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:18,600
children or eight children and of course
 

1367
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,710
children or eight children and of course
it's a much more advanced in terms of uh

1368
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:23,720
it's a much more advanced in terms of uh
 

1369
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,889
it's a much more advanced in terms of uh
in terms of health and medicine so you

1370
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:27,899
in terms of health and medicine so you
 

1371
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,630
in terms of health and medicine so you
don't at least lose children as they

1372
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:29,640
don't at least lose children as they
 

1373
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,730
don't at least lose children as they

of
 

1377
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:35,810
of
kids to survive and therefore if you

1378
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:35,820
kids to survive and therefore if you
 

1379
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,850

1381
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,490
have 10 kids you're sick with 10 kids
you don't end up with four as it used to

1382
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:40,500
you don't end up with four as it used to
 

1383
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,549
you don't end up with four as it used to
be in the past

1384
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
be in the past

six of them would have died in the in

1386
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:45,299
six of them would have died in the in
 

1387
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,529
six of them would have died in the in
the after the age of five actually but

1388
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:48,539
the after the age of five actually but
 

1389
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,950
the after the age of five actually but
now because of that you see that this

1390
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:51,960
now because of that you see that this
 

1391
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,310
now because of that you see that this
Urban population in the cities have

most important different accents yeah or
 

1713
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,150
most important different accents yeah or
different languages since they have

1714
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,160
different languages since they have
 

1715
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,030
different languages since they have
dialects is a different language

1716
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,040
dialects is a different language
 

1717
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,349
dialects is a different language
altogether

1718
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:42,359
altogether
 

1719
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,670
altogether
but

1720
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
but
 

1721
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,210
but
or so for that matter Kurdish which is

1722
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,220
or so for that matter Kurdish which is
 

1723
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,829
or so for that matter Kurdish which is
closer to Persian because they are

1724
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:48,839
closer to Persian because they are
 

1725
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,950

Azerbaijan in the North
they're the same basically actually if

1736
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:05,160
they're the same basically actually if
 

1737
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,550
they're the same basically actually if
you would have looked as a fascinating

1738
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:07,560
you would have looked as a fascinating
 

1739
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,730
you would have looked as a fascinating
picture if you have looked at the let's

1740
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:10,740
picture if you have looked at the let's
 

1741
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,450
picture if you have looked at the let's
say even 19th century early 20th century

1742
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:13,460
say even 19th century early 20th century
 

1743
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,950
say even 19th century early 20th century
linguistic map of Iran would have been

1744
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:15,960
linguistic map of Iran would have been
 

1745
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,390
linguistic map of Iran would have been
amazed

1746
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:17,400
amazed
 

1747
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,970
amazed
in the number of dialects in the number

1748
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:19,980
in the number of dialects in the number
 

1749
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,490
in the number of dialects in the number
of languages that has survived and this

1750
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:22,500
of languages that has survived and this
 

1751
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,230
of languages that has survived and this
is an ancient country it's an ancient

1752
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,240
is an ancient country it's an ancient
 

1753

00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:25,140
land
 

1755
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,530
land
and it's a lot of mountains all around

1756
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:27,540
and it's a lot of mountains all around
 

1757
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,530
and it's a lot of mountains all around
it or big deserts so there's a sense of

1758
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:30,540
it or big deserts so there's a sense of
 

1759
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,690
it or big deserts so there's a sense of
isolation so you would say here and

1760
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:32,700
isolation so you would say here and
 

1761
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,210
isolation so you would say here and
there you see a different community that

1762
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:35,220
there you see a different community that
 

1763
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,530
there you see a different community that
speaks differently all ancient

1764
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:38,540
speaks differently all ancient
 

1765
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,730
speaks differently all ancient
traditions and languages yeah and

traditions and languages yeah and
 

1767
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,770
traditions and languages yeah and

it there's a huge amount of tension but

1904
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
it there's a huge amount of tension but
 

1905
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,870
it there's a huge amount of tension but
there is also a sense of belonging to

that's why the concept of a state

1912
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:10,740
that's why the concept of a state
 

1913
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,910
that's why the concept of a state

there is going to be a huge kind of a
 

2143
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:21,890
there is going to be a huge kind of a
change and in this particular case

that it's not going to be a revolution
 

2149
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,109
that it's not going to be a revolution
like 1979 Islamic revolution

2150
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:30,119
like 1979 Islamic revolution
 

2151
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,650
like 1979 Islamic revolution
and I have my hopes in that for one

2152
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:33,660
and I have my hopes in that for one
 

2153
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,750
and I have my hopes in that for one
thing this is a revolution that doesn't

2154
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:35,760
thing this is a revolution that doesn't
 

2155
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,010
thing this is a revolution that doesn't
have a leader

2156
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:37,020
have a leader
 

2157
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,210

00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:38,220
okay
 

2159
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,010
okay
and it seems that they're comfortable

2160
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:40,020
and it seems that they're comfortable
 

2161
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,210
and it seems that they're comfortable
with that

2162
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:41,220
with that
 

2163
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,970
with that
at least so far because we were the

2164
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:43,980
at least so far because we were the
 

2165
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,370
at least so far because we were the
sixth week of this movement and I hope

2166
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:46,380
sixth week of this movement and I hope
 

2167
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,750
sixth week of this movement and I hope
it's not going to be actually a

2168
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:47,760
it's not going to be actually a
 

2169
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,150
it's not going to be actually a
revolution as I pointed out before I

2170
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:50,160
revolution as I pointed out before I
 

2171
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,970
revolution as I pointed out before I
hope it's going to be more of a

2172
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:52,980
hope it's going to be more of a
 

2173
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,790
hope it's going to be more of a
sense of trying to come

2174
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:55,800
sense of trying to come
 

2175
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,250
sense of trying to come
to some compromise

2176
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:58,260
to some compromise
 

2177
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,030
to some compromise
and gradually move toward change rather

2178
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:02,040
and gradually move toward change rather
 

2179
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,490
and gradually move toward change rather
than a collapse of this

2180
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:04,500
than a collapse of this
 

2181
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,150
than a collapse of this
regime and replacement with what so the

2182
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:08,160
regime and replacement with what so the
 

2183
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,970
regime and replacement with what so the
anxiety of the regime you hope will turn

2184
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:10,980
anxiety of the regime you hope will turn
 

2185
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,690
anxiety of the regime you hope will turn
into a kind of uh realization that you

2186
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:14,700
into a kind of uh realization that you
 

2187
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,210
into a kind of uh realization that you
have to you have to modernize you have

girls that we thought we are bringing up

2582
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480
girls that we thought we are bringing up
 

2583
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,990
girls that we thought we are bringing up
in this Society the source of you losing

2584
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:45,000
in this Society the source of you losing
 

2585
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,970
in this Society the source of you losing
your power will be these these women

2586
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:46,980
your power will be these these women
 

2587
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,510
your power will be these these women
that's the fear yeah and you see of

2588
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:50,520
that's the fear yeah and you see of
 

2589
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:54,530
that's the fear yeah and you see of
course this government do have a support

2590
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:54,540
course this government do have a support
 

2591
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,010
course this government do have a support
base I mean it would be uh totally wrong

2592
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:58,020
base I mean it would be uh totally wrong
 

2593
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,049
base I mean it would be uh totally wrong
to think that the Islamic Republic has

2594
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:00,059
to think that the Islamic Republic has
 

2595
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:03,829
to think that the Islamic Republic has
not created its own power base it does

2596
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:03,839
not created its own power base it does
 

2597
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,309
not created its own power base it does
uh but it's probably if there's no way

2598
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:07,319
uh but it's probably if there's no way
 

2599
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:09,890
uh but it's probably if there's no way
there are no statistics that we can or

2600
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:09,900
there are no statistics that we can or
 

2601
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,589
there are no statistics that we can or
I'm not aware of any statistics that I

2602
01:01:12,589 --> 01:01:12,599
I'm not aware of any statistics that I
 

2603
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,329
I'm not aware of any statistics that I
can give you in numbers what's the

2604
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:14,339
can give you in numbers what's the
 

2605
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:16,730
can give you in numbers what's the
percentage of support for the regime in

2606
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:16,740
percentage of support for the regime in
 

2607
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,789
percentage of support for the regime in
Iran but quite frankly I don't think

2608
01:01:19,789 --> 01:01:19,799
Iran but quite frankly I don't think
 

2609
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:22,190
Iran but quite frankly I don't think
it's more than probably 10 of the

2610
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:22,200
it's more than probably 10 of the
 

2611
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,010
it's more than probably 10 of the
population very generous I I would be

2612
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:25,020
population very generous I I would be
 

2613
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,230
population very generous I I would be
surprised if it's that low I would say

2614
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:27,240
surprised if it's that low I would say
 

2615
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,170
surprised if it's that low I would say
so if my understanding because I've been

2616
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:30,180
so if my understanding because I've been
 

2617
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,750
so if my understanding because I've been
very deeply paying attention to the war

2618
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:32,760
very deeply paying attention to the war
 

2619
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,789
very deeply paying attention to the war
in Ukraine in to uh Ukraine to Russia

2620
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:36,799
in Ukraine in to uh Ukraine to Russia
 

2621
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:40,970
in Ukraine in to uh Ukraine to Russia
and uh to support in Russia for Putin

2622
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:40,980
and uh to support in Russia for Putin
 

2623
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,990
and uh to support in Russia for Putin
yes I think without knowing the details

2624
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:45,000
yes I think without knowing the details
 

2625
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,569
yes I think without knowing the details
without even considering the effects of

2626
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:47,579
without even considering the effects of
 

2627
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,670
without even considering the effects of
propaganda and stuff like that is

2628
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:49,680
propaganda and stuff like that is
 

2629
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,049
propaganda and stuff like that is
there's probably a large number of

2630
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:51,059
there's probably a large number of
 

2631
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:53,510
there's probably a large number of
people in Iran that

2632
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:53,520
people in Iran that
 

2633
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,970
people in Iran that
don't see this as a battle of Human

2634
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:55,980
don't see this as a battle of Human
 

2635
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,549
don't see this as a battle of Human
Rights but see it as a battle of

2636
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559
Rights but see it as a battle of
 

2637
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,030
Rights but see it as a battle of
uh conservatism like tradition versus

2638
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:02,040
uh conservatism like tradition versus
 

2639
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,030
uh conservatism like tradition versus
modernization and they value tradition

2640
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:05,040
modernization and they value tradition
 

2641
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,250
modernization and they value tradition
that that what they fear from the

2642
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:07,260
that that what they fear from the
 

2643
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,049
that that what they fear from the
throwing away of the hijab

2644
01:02:09,049 --> 01:02:09,059
throwing away of the hijab
 

2645
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,710
throwing away of the hijab
is not the loss of power and like the

2646
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:12,720
is not the loss of power and like the
 

2647
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,569
is not the loss of power and like the
women getting human rights what they

women getting human rights what they
 

2649
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:17,030
women getting human rights what they
fear is is the same stuff you fear when

2657
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:26,210
basically that they there's a large
number of Iranians that probably value

yeah but I wonder where that because

3316
01:18:09,169 --> 01:18:09,179
yeah but I wonder where that because
 

3317
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:11,570
yeah but I wonder where that because
that's been that way for for a very very

3318
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:11,580
that's been that way for for a very very
 

3319
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:14,990
that's been that way for for a very very
long time and so I wonder

3320
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,000
long time and so I wonder
 

3321
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,910
long time and so I wonder
you know it's funny a certain ideas just

3322
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:19,920
you know it's funny a certain ideas just
 

3323
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,910
you know it's funny a certain ideas just
their time comes exactly it's like 1848

3324
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:22,920
their time comes exactly it's like 1848
 

3325
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,890
their time comes exactly it's like 1848
when you would see that there's a whole

3326
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:24,900
when you would see that there's a whole
 

3327
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,649
when you would see that there's a whole
range of revolutions

3328
01:18:26,649 --> 01:18:26,659
range of revolutions
 

3329
01:18:26,659 --> 01:18:30,229
range of revolutions
across Europe yeah or you would see for

3330
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:30,239
across Europe yeah or you would see for
 

3331
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,709
across Europe yeah or you would see for
instance the Arab Spring you see all

3332
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:33,719
instance the Arab Spring you see all
 

3333
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:35,149
instance the Arab Spring you see all
these Revolutions in the Arab world

3334
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:35,159
these Revolutions in the Arab world
 

3335
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:37,610
these Revolutions in the Arab world
which unfortunately nearly all of them

3336
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:37,620
which unfortunately nearly all of them
 

3337
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,630
which unfortunately nearly all of them
failed

3338
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:38,640
failed
 

3339
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,810
failed
so yes these are very contagious ideas

3340
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:41,820
so yes these are very contagious ideas
 

3341
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:45,229
so yes these are very contagious ideas
that moves across Frontiers from one

3342
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:45,239
that moves across Frontiers from one
 

3343
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:48,350
that moves across Frontiers from one

add to that there are two elements which
 

3347
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,510
add to that there are two elements which
one can say there is a greater

both of them from the perspective of the

Constitution and this considered as
 

3437
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,669
Constitution and this considered as
repressive and therefore there has to be

3438
01:21:10,669 --> 01:21:10,679
repressive and therefore there has to be
 

3439
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:13,430
repressive and therefore there has to be
a new space open between these two

3440
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:13,440
a new space open between these two
 

3441
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,169
a new space open between these two
and that was the idea of a

01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:15,179
and that was the idea of a
 

3443
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:17,990
and that was the idea of a
constitutional Revolution but but it's

01:34:50,689 --> 01:34:50,699
and it's what I did the size was the
 

4013
01:34:50,699 --> 01:34:53,390
and it's what I did the size was the
Persian goldfish at the time was the

outside world and therefore the
 

4019
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:04,490
outside world and therefore the
Americans uh had a particular interest

4020
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:04,500
Americans uh had a particular interest
 

4021

Americans uh had a particular interest
in Iraq and in the earlier stages their

4025
01:35:09,179 --> 01:35:10,930

Iranian government because they wanted

the name of the company changed and they
got into a huge dispute with the wasada

4052
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:46,860
got into a huge dispute with the wasada
 

4053

got into a huge dispute with the wasada
government that eventually led to the

government that eventually led to the
 

4055
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:54,050

coup of 1953 which eventually created it
 

4057
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:55,610
coup of 1953 which eventually created it
very

4058
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:55,620
very
 

4059
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:59,689
very
uh very distressful memory

4060
01:35:59,689 --> 01:35:59,699
uh very distressful memory
 

4061
01:35:59,699 --> 01:36:01,850
uh very distressful memory
in the minds of many of the Iranian

4062
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:01,860
in the minds of many of the Iranian
 

4063
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:04,790
in the minds of many of the Iranian
nationalists that this was the betrayer

4064
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:04,800
nationalists that this was the betrayer
 

4065
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,250
nationalists that this was the betrayer
of the great Powers the British and

4066
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:07,260
of the great Powers the British and
 

4067
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:10,610
of the great Powers the British and
Americans yes CIA played a part because

4068
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:10,620
Americans yes CIA played a part because
 

4069
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,530
Americans yes CIA played a part because
see I feared

4070
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:12,540
see I feared
 

4071
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,629
see I feared
contrary to the British that they were

4072
01:36:14,629 --> 01:36:14,639
contrary to the British that they were
 

4073
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:18,169
contrary to the British that they were
afraid of their own oil in Iran the CIA

4074
01:36:18,169 --> 01:36:18,179
afraid of their own oil in Iran the CIA
 

4075
01:36:18,179 --> 01:36:22,910
afraid of their own oil in Iran the CIA
was afraid of the Soviet penetration in

4076
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:22,920
was afraid of the Soviet penetration in
 

4077
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,250
was afraid of the Soviet penetration in
in the South and particularly because

4078
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:25,260
in the South and particularly because
 

4079
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,870
in the South and particularly because
there was a very powerful

4080
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:26,880
there was a very powerful
 

4081
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,689
there was a very powerful
a very powerful Communist party you know

4082
01:36:29,689 --> 01:36:29,699
a very powerful Communist party you know
 

4083
01:36:29,699 --> 01:36:31,550
a very powerful Communist party you know
the two-day party of Iran

4084
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:31,560
the two-day party of Iran
 

4085
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,910
the two-day party of Iran
so they

4086
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:33,920
so they
 

4087
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,410
so they
gradually shifted between the Truman

4088
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:36,420
gradually shifted between the Truman
 

4089
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,450
gradually shifted between the Truman
Administration and our Eisenhower

4090
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:38,460
Administration and our Eisenhower
 

4091
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,310
Administration and our Eisenhower
Administration these are early days of

4092
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:40,320
Administration these are early days of
 

4093
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:44,169
Administration these are early days of
the CIA and then they actually did

4094
01:36:44,169 --> 01:36:44,179
the CIA and then they actually did
 

4095
01:36:44,179 --> 01:36:47,930
the CIA and then they actually did
participate uh to set their agents

4096
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:47,940
participate uh to set their agents
 

4097
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:52,070
participate uh to set their agents
there's a long story to that and it

4098
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:52,080
there's a long story to that and it
 

4099
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,649
there's a long story to that and it
eventually resulted in a successful coup

4100
01:36:54,649 --> 01:36:54,659
eventually resulted in a successful coup
 

4101
01:36:54,659 --> 01:36:58,129
eventually resulted in a successful coup
that removed from Power what's the

4102
01:36:58,129 --> 01:36:58,139
that removed from Power what's the
 

4103
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:00,110
that removed from Power what's the
United States interest here why are they

4104
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:00,120
United States interest here why are they
 

4105
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:03,169
United States interest here why are they
using CIA are they trying to make sure

4106
01:37:03,169 --> 01:37:03,179
using CIA are they trying to make sure
 

4107
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:05,209
using CIA are they trying to make sure
there's not too much centralization of

4108
01:37:05,209 --> 01:37:05,219
there's not too much centralization of
 

4109
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:07,430
there's not too much centralization of
power in this region they were afraid of

4110
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:07,440
power in this region they were afraid of
 

4111
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,830
power in this region they were afraid of
the fact that the

4112
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:08,840
the fact that the
 

4113
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:12,410
the fact that the
that of the Soviet Union and during the

4114
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:12,420
that of the Soviet Union and during the
 

4115
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:14,530
that of the Soviet Union and during the
Cold War that was the cancer

4116
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:14,540
Cold War that was the cancer
 

4117
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:17,030
Cold War that was the cancer
they actually almost want to protect

4118
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:17,040
they actually almost want to protect
 

4119
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,390
they actually almost want to protect
Iran and its own Sovereign processes

4120
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:20,400
Iran and its own Sovereign processes
 

4121
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,189
Iran and its own Sovereign processes
from the influence of the Soviets yes

4122
01:37:22,189 --> 01:37:22,199
from the influence of the Soviets yes
 

4123
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:24,770
from the influence of the Soviets yes
because they were afraid of the fact

4124
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:24,780
because they were afraid of the fact
 

4125
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:28,250
because they were afraid of the fact
if Iran or at least this is part of the

4126
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:28,260
if Iran or at least this is part of the
 

4127
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:30,890
if Iran or at least this is part of the
I'm simplifying a very complex picture

4128
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:30,900
I'm simplifying a very complex picture
 

4129
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:34,189
I'm simplifying a very complex picture
but the but but the Americans basically

4130
01:37:34,189 --> 01:37:34,199
but the but but the Americans basically
 

4131
01:37:34,199 --> 01:37:36,590
but the but but the Americans basically
were thinking that if Iran is going to

4132
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:36,600
were thinking that if Iran is going to
 

4133
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:37,990
were thinking that if Iran is going to
be lost

4134
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,000
be lost
 

4135
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,030
be lost
choose Soviet influence

4136
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:41,040
choose Soviet influence
 

4137
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,790
choose Soviet influence
then eventually basically the all the

4138
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:43,800
then eventually basically the all the
 

4139
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,649
then eventually basically the all the
oil resources in the Persian Gulf are

4140
01:37:45,649 --> 01:37:45,659
oil resources in the Persian Gulf are
 

4141
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:47,870
oil resources in the Persian Gulf are
going to be threatened

4142
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:47,880
going to be threatened
 

4143
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:50,450
going to be threatened
and therefore and this would basically

4144
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,460
and therefore and this would basically
 

4145
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:53,689
and therefore and this would basically
is the National Security of the United

4146
01:37:53,689 --> 01:37:53,699
is the National Security of the United
 

4147
01:37:53,699 --> 01:37:56,350
is the National Security of the United
States and all of the western allies

4148
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:56,360
States and all of the western allies
 

4149
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,310
States and all of the western allies
European allies

4150
01:37:58,310 --> 01:37:58,320
European allies
 

4151
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,729
European allies
so in a sense this was the long arm of

4152
01:38:01,729 --> 01:38:01,739
so in a sense this was the long arm of
 

4153
01:38:01,739 --> 01:38:04,910
so in a sense this was the long arm of
the CIA to try to

4154
01:38:04,910 --> 01:38:04,920
the CIA to try to
 

4155
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,189
the CIA to try to
try to make sure that that's not going

4156
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:07,199
try to make sure that that's not going
 

4157
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,110
try to make sure that that's not going
to happen and then of course they'll be

4158
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:09,120
to happen and then of course they'll be
 

4159
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,930
to happen and then of course they'll be
persuaded by the British because British

4160
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:11,940
persuaded by the British because British
 

4161
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:14,149
persuaded by the British because British
were the old hand which were in Iran

4162
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:14,159
were the old hand which were in Iran
 

4163
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,550
were the old hand which were in Iran
since the beginning of the 19th century

4164
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:16,560
since the beginning of the 19th century
 

4165
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,709
since the beginning of the 19th century
they always had relations with Iran and

4166
01:38:18,709 --> 01:38:18,719
they always had relations with Iran and
 

4167
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:23,450
they always had relations with Iran and
so forth so they gradually replaced and

4168
01:38:23,450 --> 01:38:23,460
so forth so they gradually replaced and
 

4169
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:25,610
so forth so they gradually replaced and
and of course they don't want to give

4170
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:25,620
and of course they don't want to give
 

4171
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:28,250
and of course they don't want to give

Empire somewhat rather naive and very
 

4433
01:44:23,239 --> 01:44:26,270
Empire somewhat rather naive and very
nationalistic and crude fashion and what

nationalistic and crude fashion and what
 

4435
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,910
nationalistic and crude fashion and what
happened is that as a result there was

happened is that as a result there was
 

4437
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:31,850

the intellectuals from the left
 

4441
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:37,970
the intellectuals from the left
eventually resulting in a kind of a

4442
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:37,980
eventually resulting in a kind of a
 

4443
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:42,350
eventually resulting in a kind of a
protest movement as I said by 1977 1978.

4444
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:42,360
protest movement as I said by 1977 1978.

01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:44,460
then of course the question that comes
 

4447
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:48,109
then of course the question that comes
to mind and the probably it you have you

4448
01:44:48,109 --> 01:44:48,119
to mind and the probably it you have you
 

4449
01:44:48,119 --> 01:44:50,209
to mind and the probably it you have you
you would like to know about is the fact

4450
01:44:50,209 --> 01:44:50,219
you would like to know about is the fact
 

4451

back to the Constitution
 

4463
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:15,350
back to the Constitution
of 1906 1907 why it's all of a sudden it

4464
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:15,360
of 1906 1907 why it's all of a sudden it

the reason for that at least in a

4468
01:45:21,229 --> 01:45:21,239
the reason for that at least in a
 

4469
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:25,790
the reason for that at least in a
concise fashion is the fact that on one

4470
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:25,800
concise fashion is the fact that on one

century
 

5345
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:20,629
century
uh a thousand times

02:06:20,629 --> 02:06:20,639
uh a thousand times
 

5347
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:23,470
uh a thousand times
we would get the uh 79 Revolution

you know one percent of the time it

5354
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:31,440
you know one percent of the time it
 

5355
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:33,169
you know one percent of the time it
feels like or no what which percentage

5356

would you put well I think has something

5358
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:35,820
would you put well I think has something
 

5359
02:06:35,820 --> 02:06:37,609
would you put well I think has something
to do

5360
02:06:37,609 --> 02:06:37,619
to do
 

5361
02:06:37,619 --> 02:06:41,209
to do
with the very complex nature

5362
02:06:41,209 --> 02:06:41,219
with the very complex nature
 

5363
02:06:41,219 --> 02:06:44,450
with the very complex nature
of how Iran evolved

5364
02:06:44,450 --> 02:06:44,460
of how Iran evolved
 

5365
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:47,209
of how Iran evolved
over a long period of time since the

5366
02:06:47,209 --> 02:06:47,219
over a long period of time since the
 

5367
02:06:47,219 --> 02:06:51,410
over a long period of time since the
16th century that's why if I would for a

5368
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:51,420
16th century that's why if I would for a
 

5369
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:53,209
16th century that's why if I would for a
moment talk about what I have written

5370
02:06:53,209 --> 02:06:53,219
moment talk about what I have written
 

5371
02:06:53,219 --> 02:06:56,629
moment talk about what I have written
I've written a book that's called Iran

5372
02:06:56,629 --> 02:06:56,639
I've written a book that's called Iran
 

5373
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:59,089
I've written a book that's called Iran
and modern history and it does not start

5374
02:06:59,089 --> 02:06:59,099
and modern history and it does not start
 

5375
02:06:59,099 --> 02:07:01,490
and modern history and it does not start
in the 20th century it starts in the

5376
02:07:01,490 --> 02:07:01,500
in the 20th century it starts in the
 

5377
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:04,430
in the 20th century it starts in the
16th century yeah because that's what I

5378
02:07:04,430 --> 02:07:04,440
16th century yeah because that's what I
 

5379
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:07,129
16th century yeah because that's what I
have argued that this complex process

5380
02:07:07,129 --> 02:07:07,139
have argued that this complex process
 

5381
02:07:07,139 --> 02:07:09,830
have argued that this complex process
that at the end of the day resulted in

5382
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:09,840
that at the end of the day resulted in
 

5383
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,189
that at the end of the day resulted in
what we see around us today is something

5384
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:13,199
what we see around us today is something
 

5385
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:15,649
what we see around us today is something
that was in making for a very long time

5386
02:07:15,649 --> 02:07:15,659
that was in making for a very long time
 

5387
02:07:15,659 --> 02:07:18,229
that was in making for a very long time
and religion was a big part of it she

it's disillusionment with that image
 

5407
02:07:46,199 --> 02:07:48,410
it's disillusionment with that image
yeah or at least a process of this

02:07:48,410 --> 02:07:48,420
yeah or at least a process of this
 

5409
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:50,689
yeah or at least a process of this
illusionment the outcome of it is what

illusionment the outcome of it is what
 

5411
02:07:50,699 --> 02:07:54,410
illusionment the outcome of it is what
we see today basically that process of

02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:54,420
we see today basically that process of
 

5413
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:57,770
we see today basically that process of
40 years is a process of readjusting to

great disappointment in a sense
 

5431
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:21,709
great disappointment in a sense
like most Messianic movements by the way

5432
02:08:21,709 --> 02:08:21,719
like most Messianic movements by the way
 

5433
02:08:21,719 --> 02:08:24,229
like most Messianic movements by the way
Mosaic move as a general are always

leading into great disappointments but
 

5437
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,709
leading into great disappointments but
what I have here that perhaps should be

5438
02:08:30,709 --> 02:08:30,719
what I have here that perhaps should be
 

5439
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:34,270
what I have here that perhaps should be
added to it that yes it was the

5440
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:34,280
added to it that yes it was the
 

5441
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:39,770
added to it that yes it was the
peculiarity of Iran as a society that

5442
02:08:39,770 --> 02:08:39,780
peculiarity of Iran as a society that
 

5443
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:42,050
peculiarity of Iran as a society that
had to experience

5444
02:08:42,050 --> 02:08:42,060
had to experience
 

5445
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:44,770
had to experience
this eventual

5446
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:44,780
this eventual
 

5447
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:47,950
this eventual
encounter between religion and state

5448
02:08:47,950 --> 02:08:47,960
encounter between religion and state
 

5449
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:50,450
encounter between religion and state
that's something to do with the nature

5450
02:08:50,450 --> 02:08:50,460
that's something to do with the nature
 

5451
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:52,490
that's something to do with the nature
of Jesus that's just one point that

5452
02:08:52,490 --> 02:08:52,500
of Jesus that's just one point that
 

5453
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:54,109
of Jesus that's just one point that

5615
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:45,189
you know in the way that Stalin took
power and held power in the early days

5616
02:12:45,189 --> 02:12:45,199
power and held power in the early days
 

5617
02:12:45,199 --> 02:12:48,290
power and held power in the early days
is there something like this in terms of

5618
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:48,300
is there something like this in terms of
 

5619
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:50,270
is there something like this in terms of
the establishment of the Revolutionary

5620
02:12:50,270 --> 02:12:50,280
the establishment of the Revolutionary
 

5621
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:52,010
the establishment of the Revolutionary
guard and all those kinds of stuff yes

5622
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:52,020
guard and all those kinds of stuff yes
 

5623
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:54,649
guard and all those kinds of stuff yes
so it's the the Messianic figure that

5624
02:12:54,649 --> 02:12:54,659
so it's the the Messianic figure that
 

5625
02:12:54,659 --> 02:12:57,890
so it's the the Messianic figure that
has some support from the people but uh

5626
02:12:57,890 --> 02:12:57,900
has some support from the people but uh
 

5627
02:12:57,900 --> 02:12:59,569
has some support from the people but uh
does he have to crush his enemies in

5628
02:12:59,569 --> 02:12:59,579
does he have to crush his enemies in
 

5629
02:12:59,579 --> 02:13:01,550
does he have to crush his enemies in
competition

5630
02:13:01,550 --> 02:13:01,560
competition
 

5631
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:03,589
competition
certainly did

5632
02:13:03,589 --> 02:13:03,599
certainly did
 

5633
02:13:03,599 --> 02:13:08,209
certainly did
probably not certainly not as brutal in

5634
02:13:08,209 --> 02:13:08,219
probably not certainly not as brutal in
 

5635
02:13:08,219 --> 02:13:11,390
probably not certainly not as brutal in
terms of the victims as you would see in

5636
02:13:11,390 --> 02:13:11,400
terms of the victims as you would see in
 

5637
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:13,510
terms of the victims as you would see in
Soviet Union understand

5638
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:13,520
Soviet Union understand
 

5639
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:18,290
Soviet Union understand
who the Bloodshed or the

02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:18,300
who the Bloodshed or the
 

5641
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:21,290
who the Bloodshed or the
destruction of the population was far

5642
02:13:21,290 --> 02:13:21,300
destruction of the population was far
 

5643
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:22,430
destruction of the population was far
greater

5644
02:13:22,430 --> 02:13:22,440
greater
 

5645
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:24,830
greater
than what you would find in

02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:24,840
than what you would find in
 

5647
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:27,109
than what you would find in
Iran of the Islamic Republic it's

uncomfortable
 

5651
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:31,609
uncomfortable
perhaps I would find a greater parallel

5652
02:13:31,609 --> 02:13:31,619
perhaps I would find a greater parallel
 

5653
02:13:31,619 --> 02:13:33,470
perhaps I would find a greater parallel
with matzodun

5654
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:33,480
with matzodun
 

5655
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:35,229

particularly because China has a very
 

5659
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,490
particularly because China has a very
strong Messianic tradition

arch enemy
 

6415
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:08,389
arch enemy
and some of it might be due to the

and some of it might be due to the

02:32:08,399 --> 02:32:11,530
and some of it might be due to the
israeli's own exaggeration

israeli's own exaggeration
 

6419

israeli's own exaggeration
of Iran's threat and some of it is

of Iran's threat and some of it is
 

6421
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:19,010
of Iran's threat and some of it is
because Iran has developed a fairly

the United States is

the United States is
willing to do so

willing to do so
 

6513
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:46,070
willing to do so
and it seems that now what is happening

02:34:46,070 --> 02:34:46,080
and it seems that now what is happening
 

6515
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:48,290
and it seems that now what is happening
in terms of the protests in the Iranian

in terms of the protests in the Iranian
streets makes it even harder

02:34:52,450 --> 02:34:52,460
streets makes it even harder
 

6519
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:57,290
streets makes it even harder
in a public eye to try to negotiate a

in a public eye to try to negotiate a
 

6521
02:34:57,300 --> 02:35:01,550
in a public eye to try to negotiate a
deal with Iran because that means in the

02:35:01,550 --> 02:35:01,560
deal with Iran because that means in the
 

6523
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:03,290
deal with Iran because that means in the
minds of many

and with some justification
 

6527
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:09,309
and with some justification
that uh

02:35:09,309 --> 02:35:09,319
that uh
 

6529
02:35:09,319 --> 02:35:13,730
that uh
if the nuclear agreement would result in

02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:13,740
if the nuclear agreement would result in
 

6531
02:35:13,740 --> 02:35:16,570
if the nuclear agreement would result in
the removal of many of these sanctions

6532
02:35:16,570 --> 02:35:16,580
the removal of many of these sanctions
 

6533
02:35:16,580 --> 02:35:19,730
the removal of many of these sanctions
millions billions

6534
02:35:19,730 --> 02:35:19,740
millions billions
 

6535
02:35:19,740 --> 02:35:23,150
millions billions
uh as the result of the removal of the

6536
02:35:23,150 --> 02:35:23,160
uh as the result of the removal of the
 

6537
02:35:23,160 --> 02:35:26,090
uh as the result of the removal of the
sanctions and Iran's ability to sell it

6538
02:35:26,090 --> 02:35:26,100
sanctions and Iran's ability to sell it
 

6539
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:28,370
sanctions and Iran's ability to sell it
it's all in the international market

6540
02:35:28,370 --> 02:35:28,380
it's all in the international market
 

6541
02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:31,750
it's all in the international market
without any restrictions

6542
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:31,760
without any restrictions
 

6543
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:35,090
without any restrictions
means that the Iranian government is

6544
02:35:35,090 --> 02:35:35,100
means that the Iranian government is
 

6545
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:38,510
means that the Iranian government is
going to become even more powerful

6546
02:35:38,510 --> 02:35:38,520
going to become even more powerful
 

6547
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:41,510
going to become even more powerful
more financially secure in order to

6548
02:35:41,510 --> 02:35:41,520
more financially secure in order to
 

6549
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:43,370
more financially secure in order to
suppress its own people

6550
02:35:43,370 --> 02:35:43,380
suppress its own people
 

6551
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:45,410
suppress its own people
so that's the agreement that goes

6552
02:35:45,410 --> 02:35:45,420
so that's the agreement that goes
 

6553
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:47,510
so that's the agreement that goes
against

6554
02:35:47,510 --> 02:35:47,520
against
 

6555
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:52,610
against
coming to terms with with uh Iran but

6556
02:35:52,610 --> 02:35:52,620
coming to terms with with uh Iran but
 

6557
02:35:52,620 --> 02:35:56,750
coming to terms with with uh Iran but
the problem is that there is no clear

6558
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:56,760
the problem is that there is no clear
 

6559
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:58,730
the problem is that there is no clear
alternative even I'm not particularly

6560
02:35:58,730 --> 02:35:58,740
alternative even I'm not particularly
 

6561
02:35:58,740 --> 02:36:00,530
alternative even I'm not particularly
personally favorable

6562
02:36:00,530 --> 02:36:00,540
personally favorable
 

6563
02:36:00,540 --> 02:36:04,250
personally favorable
for this agreement to be uh to to be

02:36:04,250 --> 02:36:04,260
for this agreement to be uh to to be

ratified
 

6567
02:36:05,220 --> 02:36:07,670
ratified
but the alternative is very difficult

6568
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:07,680
but the alternative is very difficult
 

6569
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:10,730
but the alternative is very difficult
there is no way to try to see what can

6570
02:36:10,730 --> 02:36:10,740
there is no way to try to see what can
 

6571
02:36:10,740 --> 02:36:14,290
there is no way to try to see what can
be done

6572
02:36:14,290 --> 02:36:14,300

can be accepted second in real terms
what do you want to you want to commit

6916
02:44:46,070 --> 02:44:46,080
what do you want to you want to commit
 

6917
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:47,690
what do you want to you want to commit
to genocide

6918
02:44:47,690 --> 02:44:47,700
to genocide
 

6919
02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:50,270
to genocide
do you have a population there

6920
02:44:50,270 --> 02:44:50,280
do you have a population there
 

6921
02:44:50,280 --> 02:44:52,490
do you have a population there
that you have to come to terms with it

6922
02:44:52,490 --> 02:44:52,500
that you have to come to terms with it
 

6923
02:44:52,500 --> 02:44:56,290
that you have to come to terms with it
and you cannot just postpone as they did

6924
02:44:56,290 --> 02:44:56,300
and you cannot just postpone as they did
 

6925
02:44:56,300 --> 02:44:59,510
and you cannot just postpone as they did
since 67 they are postponing and hoping

6926
02:44:59,510 --> 02:44:59,520
since 67 they are postponing and hoping
 

6927
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:03,410
since 67 they are postponing and hoping
that it goes away somehow

6928
02:45:03,410 --> 02:45:03,420
that it goes away somehow
 

6929
02:45:03,420 --> 02:45:07,010
that it goes away somehow
I don't think it's going to go away

6930
02:45:07,010 --> 02:45:07,020
I don't think it's going to go away
 

6931
02:45:07,020 --> 02:45:10,190
I don't think it's going to go away
and and it's going to get worse right

6932
02:45:10,190 --> 02:45:10,200
and and it's going to get worse right
 

6933
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:11,330
and and it's going to get worse right
and better

6934
02:45:11,330 --> 02:45:11,340
and better
 

6935
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:13,730
and better
it's a long nuanced discussion and I

6936
02:45:13,730 --> 02:45:13,740
it's a long nuanced discussion and I
 

6937
02:45:13,740 --> 02:45:17,270
it's a long nuanced discussion and I
look forward to having it so just leave

6938
02:45:17,270 --> 02:45:17,280
look forward to having it so just leave
 

6939
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:19,070
look forward to having it so just leave
it

6940
02:45:19,070 --> 02:45:19,080
it
 

6941
02:45:19,080 --> 02:45:22,130
it
um there for the moment

6942
02:45:22,130 --> 02:45:22,140
um there for the moment
 

6943
02:45:22,140 --> 02:45:26,090
um there for the moment
uh but it is

6944
02:45:26,090 --> 02:45:26,100

 

6945
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:29,630

a stressful place in the world uh where

6946
02:45:29,630 --> 02:45:29,640
a stressful place in the world uh where
 

6947
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:34,969
a stressful place in the world uh where
the rhetoric is existential or Iran yeah

6948
02:45:34,969 --> 02:45:34,979
the rhetoric is existential or Iran yeah
 

6949
02:45:34,979 --> 02:45:38,210
the rhetoric is existential or Iran yeah
it makes claims that he wants to wipe

6950
02:45:38,210 --> 02:45:38,220
it makes claims that he wants to wipe
 

6951
02:45:38,220 --> 02:45:40,610
it makes claims that he wants to wipe
a country off the face of the Earth it's

6952
02:45:40,610 --> 02:45:40,620
a country off the face of the Earth it's
 

6953
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:44,330
a country off the face of the Earth it's
just the level of of intensity of

6954
02:45:44,330 --> 02:45:44,340
just the level of of intensity of
 

6955
02:45:44,340 --> 02:45:46,490
just the level of of intensity of
rhetoric is unlike anywhere else in the

6956
02:45:46,490 --> 02:45:46,500
rhetoric is unlike anywhere else in the
 

6957
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:49,429
rhetoric is unlike anywhere else in the
world and extremely dangerous and in in

6958
02:45:49,429 --> 02:45:49,439
world and extremely dangerous and in in
 

6959
02:45:49,439 --> 02:45:52,550
world and extremely dangerous and in in
both directions so one the real danger

6960
02:45:52,550 --> 02:45:52,560
both directions so one the real danger
 

6961
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:55,730
both directions so one the real danger
of the rhetoric actually being acted

6962
02:45:55,730 --> 02:45:55,740
of the rhetoric actually being acted
 

6963
02:45:55,740 --> 02:45:56,750
of the rhetoric actually being acted
upon

6964
02:45:56,750 --> 02:45:56,760
upon
 

6965
02:45:56,760 --> 02:45:59,110
upon
and then the extreme

6966
02:45:59,110 --> 02:45:59,120
and then the extreme
 

6967
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:03,530
and then the extreme
political parties using the rhetoric to

6968
02:46:03,530 --> 02:46:03,540
political parties using the rhetoric to
 

6969
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:04,969
political parties using the rhetoric to
justify

6970
02:46:04,969 --> 02:46:04,979
justify
 

6971
02:46:04,979 --> 02:46:07,849
justify
even a greater escalation

6972
02:46:07,849 --> 02:46:07,859
even a greater escalation
 

6973
02:46:07,859 --> 02:46:12,469
even a greater escalation
so uh yeah if Iran is saying that this

6974
02:46:12,469 --> 02:46:12,479
so uh yeah if Iran is saying that this
 

6975
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:15,710
so uh yeah if Iran is saying that this
is it's saying that they're wanting to

6976
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:15,720
is it's saying that they're wanting to
 

6977
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:17,770
is it's saying that they're wanting to
wipe Israel off the face of the Earth

6978
02:46:17,770 --> 02:46:17,780
wipe Israel off the face of the Earth
 

6979
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:21,349
wipe Israel off the face of the Earth
that justifies any response

6980
02:46:21,349 --> 02:46:21,359
that justifies any response
 

6981
02:46:21,359 --> 02:46:23,630
that justifies any response
uh on the other side on the other side

6982
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:23,640
uh on the other side on the other side
 

6983
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:25,849
uh on the other side on the other side
of course I tend to agree with you fully

6984
02:46:25,849 --> 02:46:25,859
of course I tend to agree with you fully
 

6985
02:46:25,859 --> 02:46:28,309
of course I tend to agree with you fully
and unfortunately this is a very

6986
02:46:28,309 --> 02:46:28,319
and unfortunately this is a very
 

6987
02:46:28,319 --> 02:46:30,429
and unfortunately this is a very
critical situation that

6988
02:46:30,429 --> 02:46:30,439
critical situation that
 

6989
02:46:30,439 --> 02:46:33,710
critical situation that
uh this region is facing Iran in

6990
02:46:33,710 --> 02:46:33,720
uh this region is facing Iran in
 

6991
02:46:33,720 --> 02:46:34,969
uh this region is facing Iran in
particular

6992
02:46:34,969 --> 02:46:34,979
particular
 

6993
02:46:34,979 --> 02:46:37,490
particular
I would say that

6994
02:46:37,490 --> 02:46:37,500
I would say that
 

6995
02:46:37,500 --> 02:46:38,330
I would say that
um

6996
02:46:38,330 --> 02:46:38,340
um
 

6997
02:46:38,340 --> 02:46:42,290
um
I hope that in the minds of the people

6998
02:46:42,290 --> 02:46:42,300
I hope that in the minds of the people
 

6999
02:46:42,300 --> 02:46:44,270
I hope that in the minds of the people
of Israel

7000
02:46:44,270 --> 02:46:44,280
of Israel
 

7001
02:46:44,280 --> 02:46:50,030
of Israel
there is a enough or common sense to

7002
02:46:50,030 --> 02:46:50,040
there is a enough or common sense to
 

7003
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:51,710
there is a enough or common sense to
realize that

7004
02:46:51,710 --> 02:46:51,720
realize that
 

7005
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:54,230
realize that
probably escalation on the Israeli side

7006
02:46:54,230 --> 02:46:54,240
probably escalation on the Israeli side
 

7007
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:56,990
probably escalation on the Israeli side
is not in the favor of anybody

7008
02:46:56,990 --> 02:46:57,000
is not in the favor of anybody
 

7009
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:00,349
is not in the favor of anybody
and try to let the Iranians to go on

7010
02:47:00,349 --> 02:47:00,359
and try to let the Iranians to go on
 

7011
02:47:00,359 --> 02:47:01,690
and try to let the Iranians to go on
with their

7012
02:47:01,690 --> 02:47:01,700
with their
 

7013
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:04,010
with their
empty rhetoric

7014
02:47:04,010 --> 02:47:04,020
empty rhetoric
 

7015
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:07,309
empty rhetoric
as they do so far but

7016
02:47:07,309 --> 02:47:07,319
as they do so far but
 

7017
02:47:07,319 --> 02:47:11,150
as they do so far but
at the same time I cannot deny the fact

7018
02:47:11,150 --> 02:47:11,160
at the same time I cannot deny the fact
 

7019
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:11,990
at the same time I cannot deny the fact
that

7020
02:47:11,990 --> 02:47:12,000
that
 

7021
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,929
that
you know there is a danger on the side

7022
02:47:14,929 --> 02:47:14,939
you know there is a danger on the side
 

7023
02:47:14,939 --> 02:47:18,469
you know there is a danger on the side
of this regime and what it says it

7024
02:47:18,469 --> 02:47:18,479
of this regime and what it says it
 

7025
02:47:18,479 --> 02:47:21,650
of this regime and what it says it
cannot be denied nobody can justify that

7026
02:47:21,650 --> 02:47:21,660
cannot be denied nobody can justify that
 

7027
02:47:21,660 --> 02:47:24,469
cannot be denied nobody can justify that
uh particularly because the Iranian

7028
02:47:24,469 --> 02:47:24,479
uh particularly because the Iranian
 

7029
02:47:24,479 --> 02:47:28,010
uh particularly because the Iranian
population is not behind this regime

7030
02:47:28,010 --> 02:47:28,020
population is not behind this regime
 

7031
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:29,630
population is not behind this regime
certainly in the case of the

02:48:22,620 --> 02:48:25,370
the Iranian regime it seems to me by
going to the extreme try to create for

going to the extreme try to create for

some remarkable issue in the course of
the past few weeks

02:53:15,290 --> 02:53:15,300
the past few weeks
 

7263
02:53:15,300 --> 02:53:18,650
the past few weeks
where the Saudis giving assurances to

terms of the oil production I think it's

7270
02:53:27,469 --> 02:53:27,479
terms of the oil production I think it's
 

7271
02:53:27,479 --> 02:53:29,450
terms of the oil production I think it's
more than that event and it's not only

7272
02:53:29,450 --> 02:53:29,460
more than that event and it's not only
 

7273
02:53:29,460 --> 02:53:32,030
more than that event and it's not only
them but also the Emirates are doing the

02:53:32,030 --> 02:53:32,040
them but also the Emirates are doing the
 

7275
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:34,309
them but also the Emirates are doing the
same thing so what does that just tell

02:53:34,309 --> 02:53:34,319
same thing so what does that just tell
 

7277
02:53:34,319 --> 02:53:35,690

Behavior in Ukraine
 

7305
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:21,110
Behavior in Ukraine
but actually it's a rogue nation that it

7306
02:54:21,110 --> 02:54:21,120
but actually it's a rogue nation that it
 

7307
02:54:21,120 --> 02:54:24,349
but actually it's a rogue nation that it
attracts another Rogue Nation so Iran

7308
02:54:24,349 --> 02:54:24,359
attracts another Rogue Nation so Iran
 

7309
02:54:24,359 --> 02:54:28,969
attracts another Rogue Nation so Iran
finds itself now in a greater place of

in the hope that this would give Iran a

China relation makes more sense

7326
02:54:53,030 --> 02:54:53,040
China relation makes more sense
 

7327
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:56,809
China relation makes more sense
uh although if you ask ordinary Iranians

7328
02:54:56,809 --> 02:54:56,819
uh although if you ask ordinary Iranians
 

7329
02:54:56,819 --> 02:54:58,730
uh although if you ask ordinary Iranians
they don't like it

7330
02:54:58,730 --> 02:54:58,740
they don't like it
 

7331
02:54:58,740 --> 02:55:03,309
they don't like it
they will tell why should we be tied up

7332
02:55:03,309 --> 02:55:03,319
they will tell why should we be tied up
 

7333
02:55:03,319 --> 02:55:09,889
they will tell why should we be tied up
with uh with China as the only uh trade

7334
02:55:09,889 --> 02:55:09,899
with uh with China as the only uh trade
 

7335
02:55:09,899 --> 02:55:12,530
with uh with China as the only uh trade
party with with America because of the I

7336
02:55:12,530 --> 02:55:12,540
party with with America because of the I
 

7337
02:55:12,540 --> 02:55:14,870
party with with America because of the I
foolish isolations that you have created

7338
02:55:14,870 --> 02:55:14,880
foolish isolations that you have created
 

7339
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:17,450
foolish isolations that you have created
for us because of all the sanctions that

7340
02:55:17,450 --> 02:55:17,460
for us because of all the sanctions that
 

7341
02:55:17,460 --> 02:55:19,490
for us because of all the sanctions that
you have created for us the Islamic

Republic
 

7345
02:55:20,880 --> 02:55:23,510
Republic
so in a sense it's a very difficult

7346
02:55:23,510 --> 02:55:23,520
so in a sense it's a very difficult
 

7347
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:25,910
so in a sense it's a very difficult
question to answer probably Iranians

7348
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:25,920
question to answer probably Iranians
 

7349
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:28,429
question to answer probably Iranians
also like to be more on the other camp

7350
02:55:28,429 --> 02:55:28,439
also like to be more on the other camp
 

7351
02:55:28,439 --> 02:55:32,389
also like to be more on the other camp
but what happens is that in real term

7352
02:55:32,389 --> 02:55:32,399
but what happens is that in real term
 

7353
02:55:32,399 --> 02:55:35,210
but what happens is that in real term
so what surprises me most

7354
02:55:35,210 --> 02:55:35,220
so what surprises me most
 

7355
02:55:35,220 --> 02:55:39,230
so what surprises me most
is not this alliance with China but it's

7356
02:55:39,230 --> 02:55:39,240
is not this alliance with China but it's
 

7357
02:55:39,240 --> 02:55:41,570
is not this alliance with China but it's
kind of becoming

7358
02:55:41,570 --> 02:55:41,580
kind of becoming
 

7359
02:55:41,580 --> 02:55:45,490
kind of becoming
a lucky or subservient

7360
02:55:45,490 --> 02:55:45,500
a lucky or subservient
 

7361
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:50,929
a lucky or subservient
to Putin's regime in in Russia

7362
02:55:50,929 --> 02:55:50,939
to Putin's regime in in Russia
 

7363
02:55:50,939 --> 02:55:53,150
to Putin's regime in in Russia
since if you look at it

7364
02:55:53,150 --> 02:55:53,160
since if you look at it
 

7365
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:55,070
since if you look at it
Iran

the beginning of the 19th century always
viewed Russia as the greatest threat

7374

viewed Russia as the greatest threat
 

7375
02:56:06,380 --> 02:56:09,050
viewed Russia as the greatest threat
strategically because it was sitting

03:00:41,330 --> 03:00:41,340
a life
 

7561
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:43,130
a life
in which they don't

7562
03:00:43,130 --> 03:00:43,140
in which they don't
 

7563
03:00:43,140 --> 03:00:45,830
in which they don't
They Don't Really create trouble for

7564
03:00:45,830 --> 03:00:45,840
They Don't Really create trouble for
 

7565
03:00:45,840 --> 03:00:48,830
They Don't Really create trouble for
their neighbors or for the world

7566
03:00:48,830 --> 03:00:48,840
their neighbors or for the world
 

7567
03:00:48,840 --> 03:00:52,070
their neighbors or for the world
and therefore I would see a better

7568
03:00:52,070 --> 03:00:52,080
and therefore I would see a better
 

7569
03:00:52,080 --> 03:00:55,790
and therefore I would see a better
future for Iran that's for one reason

7570
03:00:55,790 --> 03:00:55,800
future for Iran that's for one reason
 

7571
03:00:55,800 --> 03:00:58,070
future for Iran that's for one reason
it's strategically

7572
03:00:58,070 --> 03:00:58,080
it's strategically
 

7573
03:00:58,080 --> 03:01:01,990
it's strategically
or geopolitically maybe in Iran's

7574
03:01:01,990 --> 03:01:02,000
or geopolitically maybe in Iran's
 

7575
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:05,630
or geopolitically maybe in Iran's
advantage in a peaceful fashion to

7576
03:01:05,630 --> 03:01:05,640
advantage in a peaceful fashion to
 

7577
03:01:05,640 --> 03:01:06,830
advantage in a peaceful fashion to
negotiate

7578
03:01:06,830 --> 03:01:06,840
negotiate
 

7579
03:01:06,840 --> 03:01:09,370
negotiate
as it's the fate of all the nations

7580
03:01:09,370 --> 03:01:09,380
as it's the fate of all the nations
 

7581
03:01:09,380 --> 03:01:13,370
as it's the fate of all the nations
rather than commit itself or

7582
03:01:13,370 --> 03:01:13,380
rather than commit itself or
 

7583
03:01:13,380 --> 03:01:16,389
rather than commit itself or
sworn to a particular

7584
03:01:16,389 --> 03:01:16,399
sworn to a particular
 

7585
03:01:16,399 --> 03:01:19,969
sworn to a particular
course of a policy

7586
03:01:19,969 --> 03:01:19,979
course of a policy
 

7587
03:01:19,979 --> 03:01:22,849
course of a policy
so there's a give and take as the nature

7588
03:01:22,849 --> 03:01:22,859
so there's a give and take as the nature
 

7589
03:01:22,859 --> 03:01:25,250
so there's a give and take as the nature
of politics is the art of possible as

7590
03:01:25,250 --> 03:01:25,260
of politics is the art of possible as
 

7591
03:01:25,260 --> 03:01:26,690
of politics is the art of possible as
it's been said

7592
03:01:26,690 --> 03:01:26,700
it's been said
 

7593
03:01:26,700 --> 03:01:29,450
it's been said
so probably Iran is going to be

7594
03:01:29,450 --> 03:01:29,460
so probably Iran is going to be
 

7595
03:01:29,460 --> 03:01:32,750
so probably Iran is going to be
hopefully moving that direction I think

7596
03:01:32,750 --> 03:01:32,760
hopefully moving that direction I think
 

7597
03:01:32,760 --> 03:01:35,210
hopefully moving that direction I think
there is a generational thing that's the

7598
03:01:35,210 --> 03:01:35,220
there is a generational thing that's the
 

7599
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:36,889
there is a generational thing that's the
third reason

7600
03:01:36,889 --> 03:01:36,899
third reason
 

7601
03:01:36,899 --> 03:01:39,950
third reason
no matter how much

7602
03:01:39,950 --> 03:01:39,960
no matter how much
 

7603
03:01:39,960 --> 03:01:43,309
no matter how much

the Islamic Republic tried
to islamicize the Iranian Society in its

03:01:47,090 --> 03:01:47,100
to islamicize the Iranian Society in its
 

7607
03:01:47,100 --> 03:01:48,670
to islamicize the Iranian Society in its
own image

7608
03:01:48,670 --> 03:01:48,680
own image
 

7609
03:01:48,680 --> 03:01:52,269
own image
of kind of radical

7610
03:01:52,269 --> 03:01:52,279
of kind of radical
 

7611
03:01:52,279 --> 03:01:57,290
of kind of radical
ideological indoctrination it has failed

7612
03:01:57,290 --> 03:01:57,300
ideological indoctrination it has failed
 

7613
03:01:57,300 --> 03:02:00,230

what we see today in the Iranian streets
 

7617
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:07,630
what we see today in the Iranian streets
and the Iranian population said no to it

7618
03:02:07,630 --> 03:02:07,640
and the Iranian population said no to it

if there would have been and they very
 

7623
